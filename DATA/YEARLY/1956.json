Coffin, [1956] S.C.R. 191\nDate: 1956-01-24\nIn the Matter of a Reference Re Regina v. Coffin\n1955: December 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; 1956: January 24.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nCriminal law\u2014Murder\u2014Circumstantial evidence\u2014Recent possession of stolen goods\u2014Hearsay evidence\u2014Witness attended cinema as guard for jury\u2014Mixed jury\u2014Refreshing memory of witness\u2014Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 59, s. 9\u2014Criminal Code, ss. 923, 944, 1011, 1014(2).\nThe accused was found guilty of murder by a mixed jury. His conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal. His appeal from the dismissal by a judge of this Court of his application for leave to appeal was dismissed on the ground that this Court was without jurisdiction. Pursuant to s. 55; of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, the Governor General in Council then referred the following question to this Court: \"If the application made by Wilbert Coffin for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said application, what disposition of the appeal would now be made by the Court?\"\nHeld: Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ. would have dismissed the appeal. Locke and Cartwright JJ. would have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J.: The evidence was such that a legally instructed jury could reasonably find the accused guilty.\nIf the possession of recently stolen goods is not explained satisfactorily, they are presumed to have. been acquired illegally. That possession may, also indicate not only robbery, but a more serious crime related to robbery. There is no doubt that the jury did not accept the accused's explanations and that they could justly conclude that he was the thief. Thus they could see therein a motive for the murder -and it was \u00e0; which they could legally take into account.\nThe judge was not obliged to tell the jury that they were not entitled to convict of murder\" simply because they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of theft. The recent possession not only created the presumption, failing explanation, that he had stolen, but the jury had the right to conclude that it was a link in the chain of circumstances which indicated that he had committed the murder.\nAny possible inaccuracies in the early part of the judge's direction in regard to the nature of the evidence, was subsequently remedied. The rule in the Hodge's case was entirely respected.\nThe evidence of the police officer that as the result of \"precise information\" toe searched for a rifle at the accused's camp, was. not hearsay evidence. The witness was not trying to prove the truth of his information but merely to establish the reason for his visit.\nAll necessary precautions to prevent irregularities were taken to the judge's satisfaction when he allowed the jury to go to the cinema. All the constables were under oath and it is not suggested that any indiscretions were committed. Moreover, the judge was exercising his discretion when he gave the permission after both parties had consented.\nIt is within the judge's discretion to grant a jury composed exclusively of persons who speak the accused's language, but if he refuses, he must grant a mixed jury. He must consider what will best serve the ends of justice. The interests of society must not be disregarded. The judge decided that the ends of justice would not be effectively served by granting the accused's request, for that would have eliminated eighty-five per cent of the population from taking part in the administration' of justice.\nEven if there had been any irregularities concerning the list of jurors, they would be covered by s. 1011 Cr. C.\nThere was nothing more logical, since a mixed jury was concerned, than, to have the judge, counsel for the Crown and for the accused address the jury in French and in English. Nothing in what counsel for the Crown said was such as to suggest that the jury bring in a verdict based on sentiments and prejudices and not exclusively on the evidence.\nS. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act does not forbid refreshing the memory of a witness by means of a previous testimony which he has given. There was no attempt to discredit or contradict the witness Petrie. She admitted that her memory was better at the time of the preliminary inquiry. Moreover, this is a question for the judge's discretion.\nEven if there had been some irregularities, s. 1014(c) Cr. C. would apply, as no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred. The evidence left the jury no alternative. It was entirely consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\nPer Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.: The court has a discretion, not open to review, to permit leading questions whenever it is considered necessary in the interests of justice. Moreover, a witness may refresh his memory by reference to his earlier depositions and s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act applies only when it is attempted to discredit or contradict a party's own witness.\nThe contention that, because of the differences between the addresses of counsel in one language and the other, and between the two charges delivered by the trial judge, the accused was tried by two groups of jurymen, and further that s. 944 Cr. C. requires that the jury be addressed by one counsel only on each side, cannot succeed. The practice followed has been the invariable one in Quebec since 1892. Neither the differences in the addresses nor in the charges were of a nature to call for the interference of this Court.\nThe judge, in exercising his discretion under s. 923 Cr. C, was right in his view that the ends of justice would be better served with a mixed jury.\nIt cannot be said that the accused gave any reasonable explanation of how he came to be in possession of the things as to which he even attempted to make an explanation. There was, therefore, abundant evidence from which the jury could conclude, as they have done, that the possessor of the money and other items was the robber and murderer as well.\nPer Locke J.: The evidence of the police officer that he acted on \"precise information\" in searching for a rifle in the vicinity of the accused's camp, was, clearly hearsay evidence and, therefore, improperly admitted. That evidence, to which so much importance was attached by counsel for the Crown and by the trial judge when the matter was presented to the jury, was on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused. It cannot, therefore, properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and consequently, s. 592 Cr. C, has no application. (Makin v. A.G. for New South Wales [1894] A.C. 57 and Allen v. The King 44 S.C.R. 331 followed).\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ.: The evidence that the police officer had information that a rifle was concealed in a precisely indicated spot near the accused's camp, was inadmissible as being hearsay evidence. Proof that an accused has suppressed or endeavoured to suppress evidence is admissible, but, here, the foundation of the whole incident on which the jury were invited to find that he had suppressed evidence was this inadmissible hearsay evidence. It related to a vital matter and in view of the way it was stressed at the trial, counsel for the Crown cannot now be heard to belittle its importance.\nThe transcript of the evidence given at the preliminary inquiry by the witness Petrie was used not for the purpose of refreshing her memory but for the purpose of endeavouring to have her admit that she was mistaken or untruthful in giving her evidence at the trial. The cross-examination of this witness was unlawful and was attended by further error in that no warning was given to the jury that any evidence of what she had said at the preliminary inquiry was not evidence of the truth of the facts then stated but could be considered by them only for the purpose of testing the credibility of the testimony which she had given at the trial.\nAlthough there is no evidence to suggest that any improper communication took place on the occasion of the visit to the cinema, this unfortunate incident falls within the principle stated in Rex v. Masuda 106 C.C.C. at 123 and 124. There is no escape from holding that the incident was fatal to the validity of the conviction.\nThe judge did not direct his mind to the question whether the ends of justice would be better served by empanelling a mixed jury. The reasons given for the exercise of his discretion under s. 923 Cr. C. were irrelevant. Whether the empanelling of a jury of the sort requested by the accused would be attended with difficulty or whether the language of the accused was or was not that spoken by the majority of the population of the district were irrelevant considerations. The record has. failed to disclose any ground sufficient in law to warrant the accused being denied his right to a jury composed entirely of persons speaking his language. The error is not cured by s. 1011 Cr. C.\nS. 1014(2) does not avail to support the conviction as it is impossible to affirm with certainty that if none of the above errors had occurred the jury would necessarily have convicted; furthermore, even if this could be affirmed, the error in law in admitting the hearsay evidence as to the rifle was so substantial a wrong that the sub-section can have no application, as the accused was deprived of his right to a trial by jury according to Jaw. The errors pertaining to the episode of the cinema and to the empanelling of the mixed jury are also such as cannot be cured by the sub-section.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council (P.C. 1552, dated October 14, 1955) to the Supreme Court of Canada in the exercise of the powers conferred by s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1952, c. 259) of the question stated (supra).\nA. E. M. Moloney, Q.C. and F. de B. Gravel for the accused.\nN. Dorion, Q.C. and P. Miquelon, Q.C. for the Attorney General of Quebec.\nG. Favreau, Q.C. and A. J. MacLeod, Q.C. for the Attorney General of Canada. The Chief Justice:\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Taschereau, my answer to the question referred to the ] Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014L'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit devant le tribunal de Perc\u00e9, district judiciaire de la Gasp\u00e9sie, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'accusation d'avoir, au d\u00e9but de juin , assassin\u00e9 Richard de Holidaysburg, Pennsylvanie, U.S.A.\nLe proc\u00e8s, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par l'honorable Juge G\u00e9rard Lacroix, s'est instruit devant un jury de langue fran\u00e7aise et de langue anglaise, et l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable dans le cours du mois d'ao\u00fbt . Ce verdict a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 unanimement par la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de Qu\u00e9bec 1, et, s'autorisant alors des dispositions du Code Criminel, l'appelant s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 l'un des juges en chambre de cette Cour pour obtenir une permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appeler.Cette permission a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par l'honorable Juge Abbott, mais les procureurs de l'appelant ont tout de m\u00eame demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour de r\u00e9viser ce jugement de M. le Juge Abbott et d'entendre son appel au m\u00e9rite. La Cour en est venue unanimement \u00e0 la conclusion qu'elle n'avait pas dans l'esp\u00e8ce, et a en cons\u00e9quence refus\u00e9 la demande.\nL'appelant a ensuite fait parvenir une requ\u00eate au Ministre de la Justice, demandant qu'un nouveau proc\u00e8s lui soit accord\u00e9. Le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Conseil, en vertu des dispositions de l'article de la Loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, a demand\u00e9 l'opinion de cette Cour afin de savoir quel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le jugment rendu, si celle-ci avait entendu l'appel \u00e0 son m\u00e9rite.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Hunter Lindsay, accompagn\u00e9 de son fils Richard, et d'un ami de ce dernier, Frederick Claar, tous trois de Holidaysburg, Pennsylvanie, quitt\u00e8rent leur r\u00e9sidence le juin , pour se rendre faire la chasse \u00e0 l'ours en Gasp\u00e9sie. Le voyage qui s'effectuait en camionnette devait durer environ une dizaine de jours, et les chasseurs projetaient de revenir chez-eux vers le juin.\nLe 8 juin, \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9, ils obtinrent tous trois leur permis de chasse et de circulation dans la for\u00eat. A la m\u00eame date, ils ach\u00e8tent diverses \u00e9piceries chez les marchands locaux, et le soir, ils s'engagent dans la for\u00eat de Gasp\u00e9. Un garde-feu du nom de Patterson raconte qu'au sud-ouest de Gasp\u00e9, sur une petite route qui longe le nord de la Rivi\u00e8re St-Jean, leur camionnette s'est enlis\u00e9e dans la vase d'un ruisseau qu'ils avaient tent\u00e9 de traverser, et qu'\u00e0 cause de l'humidit\u00e9 le moteur avait cess\u00e9 de fonctionner. Comme ne r\u00e9ussit pas \u00e0 les remettre sur la route pour leur permettre de continuer leur voyage, il retourna seul \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 quelque dix milles seulement, et leur envoya de l'aide, soit Thomas et Oscar et Wellie , qui arriv\u00e8rent \u00e0 bord de leur camion le matin du juin et les tir\u00e8rent du ruisseau. On remit le moteur en marche, et le midi du , on revit les trois chasseurs \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9 m\u00eame. Evidemment, ils sont revenus sur leur chemin, et d\u00e9clarent \u00e0 un marchand local d'essence qu'ils d\u00e9sirent retourner aux camps , 25 et , situ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ouest de Gasp\u00e9, mais cette fois non pas en longeant le c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de la Rivi\u00e8re St-Jean, mais par une route diff\u00e9rente.\nLe lendemain, soit le 10, un garagiste revoit \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9 le plus jeune des trois chasseurs en compagnie de lui-m\u00eame, dans un camion d'une demi-tonne et de marque Chevrolet, et portant une licence canadienne. Le jeune , qui \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9 de ffin, informa le garagiste qu'ils sont venus tous trois en Gasp\u00e9sie faire la chasse \u00e0 l'ours, mais que contrairement \u00e0 leurs habitudes ils n'ont pas eu cette fois recours aux services d'un guide. Quant \u00e0 , alors qu'il est seul avec le t\u00e9moin, il explique qu'il est revenu avec un individu au village pour faire r\u00e9parer une pompe \u00e0 gazoline d\u00e9fectueuse. Dans un bar o\u00f9 il ach\u00e8te une demi-douzaine de bouteilles de bi\u00e8re, il reconte qu'en se rendant prospecter dans la for\u00eat, il a rencontr\u00e9 les trois chasseurs dont la camionnette \u00e9tait en panne. dit qu'il a d\u00e9cel\u00e9 une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 dans la pompe et qu'il a remen\u00e9 les am\u00e9ricains \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9 \u00e0 bord d'un , que Billy Baker lui aurait pr\u00eat\u00e9. Le m\u00eame jour, se rend chez un nomm\u00e9 Napol\u00e9on G\u00e9rard, un garagiste, accompagn\u00e9 du jeune , et ach\u00e8te une pompe \u00e0 gazoline au prix de $8.80. Coffin n'a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 personne de r\u00e9parer la pompe d\u00e9fectueuse.\nEvidemment, Coffin et les trois sont retourn\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement dans l\u00e0 for\u00eat, dans le camion conduit par , et le , Coffin est revu \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame camion, et un t\u00e9moin affirme avoir vu d\u00e9passer le canon d'une carabine. Quant aux voyageurs, on n'en a plus eu de nouvelles. La p\u00e9riode de vacances qu'ils s'\u00e9taient fix\u00e9e s'\u00e9coula, et les familles et Claar n'en entendent plus parler.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que tard dans la soir\u00e9e du juin, T a quitt\u00e9 Gasp\u00e9 dans le camion ant\u00e9rieurement emprunt\u00e9 de Baker, mais sans la permission de ce dernier pour ce nouveau voyage. Avant de partir cependant, il se procura un permis de conducteur, paya quelques dettes contract\u00e9es depuis quelque temps, acheta \u00e0 divers endroits plusieurs bouteilles de bi\u00e8re, paya l'un des vendeurs avec un billet am\u00e9ricain de $20 et exhiba un canif \u00e0 usage multiple, plus; tard identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du jeune . Il se rendit chez sa soeur madame Stanley \u00e0 qui il montra le m\u00eame canif. Il se changea de v\u00eatements et quitta sa soeur sans mentionner sa destination. Dans la nuit du au juin, vers :30 heure du matin, il arr\u00eata chez un nomm\u00e9 Earle Turzo de York Centre, \u00e0 qui il remit une somme de $10, emprunt\u00e9e cinq semaines auparavant, et se fit remettre un revolver qu'il avait donn\u00e9 en garantie. Il paya la, traite au whisky \u00e0 Turzo ainsi qu'\u00e0 la m\u00e8re de celui-ci. A :30 heures .M., pr\u00e8s de Perc\u00e9, son camion tomba dans le foss\u00e9. Un nomm\u00e9 El\u00e9ment lui aida \u00e0 en sortir et se fit payer en billets am\u00e9ricains.\nA six heures du matin, le 13, Coffin est rendu \u00e0 Perc\u00e9. Il fait son plein d'essence et fait r\u00e9parer ses freins. Le co\u00fbt de la r\u00e9paration s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 $8. Coffin remet au garagiste un billet am\u00e9ricain de $20 et se fait remettre $10, laissant la diff\u00e9rence comme pourboire. Il expliqua au garagiste qu'il lui fallait se rendre \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, ayant re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en rapport avec une pr\u00e9tendue compagnie am\u00e9ricaine, et qu'il ne pouvait transmettre ses informations ni par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ni par lettre.\nCoffin se rend ensuite vers la Vall\u00e9e de la Matap\u00e9dia. Il s'arr\u00eate pr\u00e8s de o\u00f9 il fait monter \u00e0 bord de sa camionnette un nomm\u00e9 Diotte. L\u00e0, il s'arr\u00eate chez le coiffeur o\u00f9 il \"paye la traite\". Il donne $10 \u00e0 Diotte pour acheter un paquet de cigarettes. Pendant ce temps, il se fait tailler la barbe, couper les cheveux, laver la t\u00eate, et verse la somme de $3 en paiement quand il ne devait que $1.50. Au cireur de chaussures qui lui demande $0.15, il lui fait cadeau de $1. Vers midi, le juin, il arrive \u00e0 St-Charles Caplan, verse dans un foss\u00e9. Un camionneur vient lui aider et tire d'un porte-feuilles bien garni, de couleur brune, un billet am\u00e9ricain de $20 et ne demande que $10 de change. A Black Cape, il fait de nouveau son plein d'essence chez un nomm\u00e9 Campbell, et lui laisse un pourboire de $1. Il arr\u00eate ensuite, vers trois heures de l'apr\u00e8s-midi, \u00e0 Maria dans le comt\u00e9 de Bonaventure, o\u00f9 il s'endort au volant de son camion. Un nomm\u00e9 Audet vient le r\u00e9veiller, invite \u00e0 entrer chez-lui o\u00f9 in prend un repas. lui donne $2 et $1 \u00e0 l'un des enfants. Entre cinq et six heures, il part en direction de Qu\u00e9bec. Le dimanche matin, il est rendu \u00e0 St-Andr\u00e9 de Kamouraska chez un nomm\u00e9 Tardif o\u00f9 il d\u00e9je\u00fbne, et paye avec un billet de $20 de d\u00e9nomination am\u00e9ricaine. Comme on ne peut faire la monnaie, il laisse $5 refusant de recevoir la balance. Apparemment, il a aussi laiss\u00e9 $10 sous une chaise. Madame Tardif a constat\u00e9 qu'en payant, il avait tir\u00e9 de sa poche un gros paquet de billets. A Montmagny, il tombe de nouveau dans un foss\u00e9. Un nomm\u00e9 Chouinard de Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup le tire de ce foss\u00e9, et lui laisse $5 sur un billet de $10. A St-Michel de Bellechasse o\u00f9 il couche, il repart le lendemain matin vers sept heures, et malgr\u00e9 qu'on lui demandait la somme de $2.50, il laisse \u00e0 l'h\u00f4telier $5. L'h\u00f4telier remarque que le porte-feuilles est bien garni de papier-monnaie. Le dimanche , il arrive \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al chez sa \"common law wife\" Marion Petrie . Dans la camionnette de Baker qu'il conduisait toujours, Petrie remarque des \u0153ufs contenus dans une bo\u00eete de biscuits soda et une bouteille de sirop \"Old Type\", pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment une bo\u00eete semblable \u00e0 celle acquise par les chasseurs chez un \u00e9picier de Gasp\u00e9, et une bouteille portant la m\u00eame marque que celle achet\u00e9e au m\u00eame endroit. Petrie voit \u00e9galement une pompe \u00e0 gazoline qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e, et qui est \u00e9videmment celle achet\u00e9e \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9 pour les am\u00e9ricains. Dans une valise plac\u00e9e \u00e9galement dans le camion et que les d\u00e9tectives retrouvent plus tard chez madame Stanley, s\u0153ur de , et qui est identifi\u00e9e comme appartenant au jeune Claar, on y trouve des serviettes, deux paires de salopettes que la m\u00e8re du jeune Claar reconna\u00eet comme \u00e9tant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de son fils. Evidemment, ces objets avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s par le jeune Claar pour aller faire la chasse au camp , et sont demeur\u00e9s dans le camion de Coffin qui est all\u00e9 le reconduire. apporta \u00e9galement \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al une paire de jumelles appartenant aussi \u00e0 Claar.\nCoffin s\u00e9journa \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al durant environ dix jours o\u00f9 il ach\u00e8te des \u00e9piceries, huit \u00e0 dix bouteilles de bi\u00e8re quotidiennement, et d\u00e9pense sans travailler. En quittant Montr\u00e9al, il se rend \u00e0 Val d'Or, rencontrer un nomm\u00e9 Hastie, courtier en valeurs mini\u00e8res, et celui-ci consent \u00e0 se rendre en Gasp\u00e9sie avec pour y examiner certains d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de cuivre. Le juillet, le lendemain de son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9, informe Hastie qu'il lui est impossible de l'accompagner, car il lui faut aider les policiers dans leurs recherches commenc\u00e9es depuis quelque temps d\u00e9j\u00e0.\nAvant l'arriv\u00e9e de , on avait retrouv\u00e9 vers le juillet la camionnette des chasseurs \u00e0 un demi-mille du camp , et dans laquelle se trouvent une carabine et une paire de pantalons.\nLe lendemain de la d\u00e9couverte de la camionnette, les recherches se poursuivent. Les camps sont visit\u00e9s et, le juillet, d'importantes d\u00e9couvertes sont faites. Entre les camps et s\u00e9par\u00e9s d'une distance d'environ trois milles, on voit des traces de roues de camions, et du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche de la route on d\u00e9couvre divers objets, et le lendemain on en d\u00e9couvre d'autres dissimul\u00e9s dans les feuillages et d'autres reposant dans le lit de la rivi\u00e8re qui coule \u00e0 environ cinquante pieds du chemin. Entre autres, on y trouve un po\u00e8le, un r\u00e9servoir \u00e0 essence, un coupe-vent de couleur bleue, un sac de couchage, qui appartenaient aux am\u00e9ricains. On constate aussi la pr\u00e9sence d'un contenant un film qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement expos\u00e9, et qui en est rendu \u00e0 la cinqui\u00e8me pose sur un total de huit. Il \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du jeune Claar. On retrouve \u00e9galement un \u00e9tui \u00e0 jumelles dans lequel on peut facilement introduire les jumelles que madame a identifi\u00e9es, et que l'on trouvera plus tard dans la for\u00eat \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 des ossements du jeune ; on trouve \u00e9galement l'\u00e9tui \u00e0 carabine qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 aux environs du camp , non loin des ossements du jeune Claar. Tous ces objets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9s \u00e0 au del\u00e0 de trois milles o\u00f9 la camionnette abandonn\u00e9e par les am\u00e9ricains a \u00e9t\u00e9 localis\u00e9e. Le juillet, une carabine et divers autres objets sont retrouv\u00e9s. Dans le bois de cette carabine ony voit une impression laiss\u00e9e par un coup qui semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d'une balle d'une autre arme \u00e0 feu. Le magasin de cette carabine \u00e9tait plein de cartouches, et le cran de s\u00fbret\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e0 la position \"sure\".\nPr\u00e8s de cent pieds plus loin, de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re qui est large de quinze \u00e0 vingt pieds, on trouve un squelette humain compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9compos\u00e9, et le Docteur Roussel-ayant transport\u00e9 ces restes \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, conclut qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 des restes d'une personne de sexe masculin, mesurant environ cinq pieds sept pouces, \u00e2g\u00e9e d'au del\u00e0 de quarante ans et dont la mort remonte \u00e0 au moins un mois depuis l'examen. On trouve \u00e9galement un porte-feuilles identifi\u00e9 comme appartenant \u00e0 p\u00e8re, avec certains documents qui lui appartiennent, mais il n'y a plus un seul sou des $650 qu'il avait apport\u00e9s avec lui en billets am\u00e9ricains. Il n'est certainement pas permis de douter qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 du cadavre de p\u00e8re.\nLes officiers de police ont continu\u00e9 leurs recherches afin de trouver les cadavres du jeune Claar et du jeune , et ce n'est que le juillet, aux environs du camp qui se trouve \u00e0 deux milles et demi du camp , o\u00f9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s les ossements de p\u00e8re, que sont d\u00e9couverts les restes des deux autres am\u00e9ricains. A proximit\u00e9 on y rel\u00e8ve des pi\u00e8ces de v\u00eatements, une. paire de jumelles qui appartenait au jeune , et madame la m\u00e8re a identifi\u00e9 d'autres v\u00eatements trouv\u00e9s sur les lieux comme appartenant \u00e0 son fils. On a produit en outre \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate un gilet blanc et une chemise de couleur verte \u00e0 travers lesquels on aper\u00e7oit un trou entour\u00e9 d'une tache noir\u00e2tre. Tout pr\u00e8s, on voit dissimul\u00e9e une veste de cuir \u00e0 fermeture \u00e9clair, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du jeune , et dont les poches sont retourn\u00e9es et vides. Il est en preuve que les taches qui entourent les perforations sont du sang humain et que les trous portent des traces de plomb. Leur site correspond au poumon et au coeur, et il est logique de conclure qu'il s'agit de perforation produite par un projectile d'arme \u00e0 feu. Le Docteur Roussel t\u00e9moigne que dans les deux cas il s'agit des cadavres de deux jeunes gens de moins de vingt-cinq ans dont la date de la mort remonte \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode que la date de la mort de p\u00e8re. Sur la chemise du jeune Claar on y aper\u00e7oit \u00e9galement des perforations au niveau du bassin et autour desquelles la pr\u00e9sence de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts m\u00e9talliques indique qu'elles sont attribuables \u00e0 un projectile d'arme \u00e0 feu. Les m\u00eames constatations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites au niveau de la poitrine, par cons\u00e9quent au niveau d'organes vitaux.\nCoffin n'est revenu en Gasp\u00e9sie qu'apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9couverte de la camionnette et des ossements de p\u00e8re, et ce n'est que le juillet que les d\u00e9tectives peuvent l'interroger. Ses r\u00e9ponses ne sont pas satisfaisantes. Ses explications des faits sont boiteuses, contradictoires et incompl\u00e8tes, et le r\u00e9cit de ses all\u00e9es et venues d\u00e9note une obstination persistante \u00e0 vouloir voiler la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Ainsi, il pr\u00e9tend n'\u00eatre jamais all\u00e9 au camp , et apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre repris, il soutient qu'il n'est pas all\u00e9 aux camps et , les deux endroits o\u00f9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s les ossements, quand il est en preuve que ceci est faux.\nLe matin du 10 apr\u00e8s \u00eatre revenu avec MacDonald du bois, et avec qui il est entendu qu'il doit retourner, il lui fausse compagnie, et repart seul dans la direction des chasseurs.Il explique qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait faire de la prospection seul. Mais au lieu d'aller faire de la prospection \u00e0 la fourche sud de la Rivi\u00e8re St-Jean, il se rend au camp 21. Il est certain que quand il est retourn\u00e9, il avait une carabine, car, elle est vue le soir du 12 par MacGregor. Sur ces points, il ne: fournit pas d'explications. Comment s'est-il procur\u00e9 tout cet argent am\u00e9ricain, qu'il distribue \u00e0 profusion? O\u00f9a-t-il pris les \u00e9piceries, cette valise, les v\u00eatements, les jumelles, le canif, la pompe \u00e0 gazoline, tous la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des chasseurs? Il n'explique pas qu'il ait emprunt\u00e9 une carabine d'un nomm\u00e9 Eagle, qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e, et qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9e. Il ne dit pas non plus la raison de son voyage \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al le soir du 12, ni pourquoi il est parti sans avertir personne.\nCoffin pr\u00e9tend, \u00e9videmment pour d\u00e9tourner les soup\u00e7ons, que deux autres am\u00e9ricains sont all\u00e9s \u00e0 la chasse \u00e0 l'ours avec les victimes. Personne cependant n'a eu connaissance de leur s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9 ou ailleurs dans la r\u00e9gion, \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode. Aucun permis ne leur aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, et on ne retrouve aucune de leurs traces. Ce qui est vrai, c'est que deux autres am\u00e9ricains sont venus \u00e0 la chasse, en \"jeep\" de marque , et sont entr\u00e9s dans la for\u00eat 27 le mai par York River, et qu'ils ont quitt\u00e9 Gasp\u00e9 le juin, c'est-\u00e0-dire plusieurs jours avant l'arriv\u00e9e de et de ses compagnons. De plus, ces chasseurs entendus comme t\u00e9moins, ont jur\u00e9 n'\u00eatre jamais all\u00e9s aux camps,21, 24, 25 et .26 Au cours des recherches dans le bois avec les d\u00e9tectives, qu'il a consenti \u00e0 accompagner, il feint de ne pas conna\u00eetre les lieux. Au camp 24, accompagn\u00e9 des chercheurs, il demande au cours du repas, o\u00f9 est la source pour aller j chercher l'eau, lui qui est n\u00e9 et a v\u00e9cu dans ce pays, et qui le 8 au soir s'\u00e9tait rendu \u00e0 ce m\u00eame camp 24 avec MacDonald, et qui le matin du 9, sur le bord du ruisseau, avait allum\u00e9 un feu. Il est en preuve que jamais il ne porte ses regards du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche de la route, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aux endroits o\u00f9 les cadavres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s, et o\u00f9 \u00e9videmment leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9s tous les objets trouv\u00e9s en la possession de Coffin.\nAvec cette preuve, le jury l\u00e9galement instruit, et ma\u00eetre des faits, pouvait raisonnablement trouver l'accus\u00e9 coupable. C'est donc avec raison que devant cette Cour, le procureur de l'accus\u00e9 a abandonn\u00e9 l'un de ses moyens d'appel, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'effet qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve suffisante pour justifier un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9. La question de savoir si la \"common law wife\" de , Marion Petrie, \u00e9tait en vertu de l'article de la Loi de la Preuve du Canada, un t\u00e9moin comp\u00e9tent \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner contre l'accus\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e \u00e9galement, et n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette Cour. Il en est de m\u00eame d'un grief concernant la possession r\u00e9cente des objets vol\u00e9s, et se rapportant aux objets qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9s et n'appartenant pas \u00e0 la victime, que est accus\u00e9 d'avoir assassin\u00e9e. On a aussi abandonn\u00e9 le point concernant une pr\u00e9tendue preuve ill\u00e9gale, se rapportant aux photographies des ossements des victimes, ainsi que celui relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9plique, exerc\u00e9s par l'un des avocats de la Couronne.\nIl reste donc \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par cette Cour, les points suivants, que je reproduis en anglais, la langue dans laquelle ils nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis:\u2014\n1: Did the Learned Trial Judge err in respect to the instructions he gave to the jury \"with reference to the doctrine of recent possession in the following manner:\u2014\n(a) Should .the jury have been permitted to apply the doctrine at all?\n(b) Were the jury misdirected with reference to the burden resting on the Appellant to explain his possession of items allegedly stolen?\n2. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in failing to instruct the jury that they were not entitled to convict the Appellant of murder simply because they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of the theft of the various articles proved to have been the property of the victim, Richard Lindsay, and his associates? 3. Did the Learned Trial Judge err by instructing the jury in a manner that would indicate the statements and declarations made by the Appellant to various witnesses were not to be regarded as circumstantial evidence and evidence therefore to which the rule in Hodge's case should be applied?\n4. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting evidence concerning a certain rifle the property of one Jack Eagle?\n5. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in permitting the jury to attend a moving picture theatre in the company of two police officers who were subsequently called as witnesses for the Crown?\n6. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in refusing the application made on behalf of the Appellant to be tried by a jury composed entirely of English-speaking citizens?\n7. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the failure of the Sheriff of the County in which the Appellant was tried to comply with the provisions of the Quebec Jury Act (1945, 9 George VI, Chap. 22)?\n8. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the improper mixture of the English and French language?\n9. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the fact that Crown Counsel in their addresses to the jury used inflammatory language?\n10. That Marion Petrie, being a Crown Witness, was submitted to a cross-examination by the Crown counsel, although she was not declared hostile.\nAu soutien de son premier point, le procureur de l'accus\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le jury n'aurait pas d\u00fb appliquer la doctrine de la possession r\u00e9cente, pour \u00e9tablir que l'accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait l'auteur des vols commis, et que le juge a donn\u00e9 des instructions erron\u00e9es concernant le fardeau qui repose sur l'accus\u00e9, d'expliquer la possession des objets vol\u00e9s.\nLa doctrine et la jurisprudence enseignent que si une personne est en possession d'objets vol\u00e9s peu de temps apr\u00e8s la commission du crime, elle doit expliquer cette possession, et si elle ne r\u00e9ussit pas \u00e0 le faire de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante, elle est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e les avoir acquis ill\u00e9galement. De plus, c'est aussi la doctrine et la jurisprudence que la possession d'effets r\u00e9cemment vol\u00e9s, peut indiquer non seulement le crime de vol, mais aussi un crime plus grave reli\u00e9 au vol. (Rex v. Langmead 2; Wills pages 61 et 62; Regina v. Exall 3).\nDans le pr\u00e9sent cas, je n'ai pas de doute que le jury n'a pas accept\u00e9 les explications donn\u00e9es par l'accus\u00e9 aux policiers, et que le jury pouvait justement conclure que \u00e9tait l'auteur du vol. En concluant ainsi, le jury pouvait y voir un motif du crime de meurtre, et c'\u00e9tait une circonstance dont il pouvait l\u00e9galement tenir compte. Je ne vois rien dans la charge du juge qui soit de nature \u00e0 vicier le proc\u00e8s sur ce point.\nJe crois \u00e9galement le second point non fond\u00e9. Je suis d'opinion que le juge ne devait pas dire au jury ce qu'on lui reproche d'avoir omis. Le fait pour d'avoir en sa possession des effets r\u00e9cemment vol\u00e9s, faisait na\u00eetre non seulement la pr\u00e9somption, faute d'explication, qu'il les avait vol\u00e9s, mais le jury avait le droit de conclure que c'\u00e9tait un lien dans une cha\u00eene de circonstances, qui indiquait qu'il avait commis le meurtre.Dans Regina v. Exall (supra page ) Pollock C.B. dit:\u2014\nAnd so it is of any crime to which the robbery was incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or murder. For, if the possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the person who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence that the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other crime.\nIl est certain que le juge en adressant le jury leur a dit que la Couronne avait offert deux sortes de preuve, soit la preuve circonstancielle, et la preuve de conversations ou paroles dites par l'accus\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9fini la preuve circonstancielle, et avoir \u00e9nonc\u00e9 aux jur\u00e9s les principes de la cause de Hodge, il ajouta:\u2014\nIl est \u00e9vident que sur l'ensemble de ces faits, l'on ne trouvera aucune preuve directe nulle part et c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u00e0 que l'on vous demande d'extraire des circonstances, la ou les conclusions que, dans votre estimation, vous devez voir comme r\u00e9sultant de ces faits.\nJe suis fermement convaincu que s'il a pu y avoir quelques incorrections au d\u00e9but de ses remarques, sur ce point, le juge y a compl\u00e8tement rem\u00e9di\u00e9 par les derni\u00e8res paroles que je viens de citer. Les r\u00e8gles contenues dans la cause de Hodge ont en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 totalement respect\u00e9es.\nJ'ai signal\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 que avait emprunt\u00e9 une carabine d'un nomm\u00e9 John Eagle, qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 ce dernier, et qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9e. Quand l'accus\u00e9 est revenu du bois dans la soir\u00e9e du juin, on a remarqu\u00e9 dans son camion la pr\u00e9sence d'une carabine. On sait aussi qu'il n'en avait pas le , quand il est all\u00e9 dans le bois avec MacDonald pour prospecter, et qu'il n'en avait pas non plus le , quand il est retourn\u00e9 seul dans la for\u00eat. Il me semble n\u00e9cessaire que la Couronne f\u00eet des efforts pour trouver cette arme. En revenant le 12, Coffin n'a pas laiss\u00e9 la carabine chez son p\u00e8re o\u00f9 il vivait, et il ne l'avait pas avec lui quand il est parti pour Montr\u00e9al le soir du 12. La th\u00e9orie de la Couronne est que le soir du , tel que prouv\u00e9 par MacDonald qui l'accompagnait, est all\u00e9 \u00e0 son camp situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ouest de Gasp\u00e9, pour y chercher la carabine, et qu'il l'avait retourn\u00e9e au m\u00eame endroit apr\u00e8s la commission du crime. Cette th\u00e9orie est d'autant plus vraisemblable, qu'un jour, alors qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu au mois d'ao\u00fbt \u00e0 la prison de Gasp\u00e9, eut une entrevue avec son fr\u00e8re, et dans la m\u00eame nuit, un camion s'est rendu au camp de , dont le conducteur n'a pas demand\u00e9 d'ouvrir la barri\u00e8re qui conduit dans la for\u00eat. Au contraire, cette barri\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 contourn\u00e9e, et des traces fra\u00eeches sur la route indiquaient le passage r\u00e9cent d'un camion que l'on croit \u00eatre d'une capacit\u00e9 d'une tonne, comme celui du fr\u00e8re de . Ces traces indiquent que le camion s'est rendu au camp et en est revenu en contournant toujours la barri\u00e8re.\nAu mois d'ao\u00fbt, le sergent Doyon s'est rendu au camp de , y a constat\u00e9 les m\u00eames traces, et au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il a dit qu'ayant re\u00e7u une \"information pr\u00e9cise\", il s'\u00e9tait rendu faire des recherches au camp de , essayant de trouver quelque preuve qui lui aiderait \u00e0 retrouver cette carabine. On pr\u00e9tend que cette preuve est ill\u00e9gale vu qu'il s'agirait de ou\u00ef-dire. Je ne puis admettre cette pr\u00e9tention. A mon sens, il ne s'agit nullement de ou\u00ef-dire, car quand Doyon a dit qu'il avait agi apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une \"information pr\u00e9cise\", il n'entendait pas prouver la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son information, mais bien \u00e9tablir la raison de sa visite au camp. Comme le dit Roscoe prius, page 53:\u2014\nWhen hearsay is introduced not as a medium of proof in order to establish a distinct fact, but as being in itself part of the transaction in question and explanatory of it, it is admissible, words and declaration are admissible.\nA la page 55, il ajoute:\u2014\nIt has been justly remarked by recent text writers that many of the above cases are not strictly instances of hearsay (i.e. second hand evidence) though commonly so classed. The res gesta in each case is original evidence and the accompanying declaration being part of it is also original. Phipson (hearsay) page 223:\u2014\nIn some cases a verbal act may be admissible as original evidence although its particulars may be excluded as hearsay. Thus, though the fact that the prosecutor made a communication to the Police, in consequence of which they took certain steps, is allowed to be proved, yet what was actually said is excluded as hearsay, is a very dangerous form.\nDans la cause de Rex v. Wilkins 4, M. le Juge Erle dit:\u2014\nHalf the transactions of life are done by means of words. There is a distinction, which it appears to me is not sufficiently attended to, between, mere statements made by and to witnesses, that are not receivable in evidence, and directions given and acts done by word?, which are evidence. The witness, in this case, may say that he made inquiries, and in consequence of directions given to him in answer to those inquiries, he followed the prisoners from place to place until he apprehended them.\nLes d\u00e9tectives agissent souvent comme cons\u00e9quence d'informations qu'ils re\u00e7oivent, et le fait de dire qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \"inform\u00e9s\" ne constitue nullement une preuve ill\u00e9gale. Ce n'est pas un moyen de preuve de nature \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un fait particulier.\nUn autre grief de l'accus\u00e9, est que le juge a err\u00e9 en permettant aux jur\u00e9s, durant le proc\u00e8s, d'assister au cin\u00e9ma, accompagn\u00e9s de plusieurs officiers de police, qui furent subs\u00e9quemment appel\u00e9s comme t\u00e9moins de la Couronne. Je suis satisfait que toutes les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises, \u00e0 la satisfaction du juge pour que rien d'irr\u00e9gulier ne s'est pass\u00e9. Tous les ont \u00e9t\u00e9 asserment\u00e9s, et il n'est pas sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'aucune indiscr\u00e9tion n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. D'ailleurs, cette permission d'assister au cin\u00e9ma a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par le juge lui-m\u00eame, exer\u00e7ant sa discr\u00e9tion, apr\u00e8s qu'il e\u00fbt obtenu le consentement de l'avocat de la Couronne et de celui de l'accus\u00e9.\nEn ce qui concerne le 6\u00e8me grief, il est n\u00e9cessaire en premier lieu de citer l'article du Code Criminel, qui d\u00e9termine les droits d'un accus\u00e9 \u00e0 un jury mixte, ou compos\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement de personnes parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise ou anglaise. Cet article se lit ainsi:\u2014\n923. Dans ceux des districts de la province de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 le sh\u00e9rif est tenu par la loi de dresser une liste de petits jur\u00e9s compos\u00e9e moiti\u00e9 de personnes parlant la langue anglaise, et moiti\u00e9 de personnes parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise, il doit, dans son rapport, mentionner s\u00e9par\u00e9ment les jur\u00e9s qu'il d\u00e9signe comme parlant la langue anglaise, et ceux qu'il d\u00e9signe comme parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise, respectivement; et les noms des jur\u00e9s ainsi assign\u00e9s sont appel\u00e9s alternativement d'apr\u00e8s ces listes. 2. Dans tout district, le prisonnier peut, lorsqu'il est mis en jugement, demander par motion, d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9 par un jury enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue anglaise, ou enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise.\n3. Sur pr\u00e9sentation de cette motion, le juge peut ordonner au sh\u00e9rif d'assigner un nombre suffisant de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue anglaise ou la langue fran\u00e7aise, \u00e0 moins qu'\u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion il n'apparaisse que les fins de la justice sont mieux servies par la composition d'un jury mixte.\nJe suis fermement d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas eu d'erreur de la part du juge en ordonnant un jury mixte. Quand un accus\u00e9 demande la composition d'un jury exclusivement compos\u00e9 de personnes parlant sa langue, comme la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite 'dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il est \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette demande, mais s'il la refuse, il doit accorder un jury mixte. Le droit de l'accus\u00e9 \u00e0 douze jur\u00e9s de sa langue, n'est pas un droit absolu, et le juge devra prendre en consid\u00e9ration ce qui doit le mieux servir les fins de la justice. Malgr\u00e9 que dans un proc\u00e8s criminel, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'accus\u00e9 soit primordial, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne doit pas \u00eatre m\u00e9connu. (Alexander . Regem 5; Mount . Regem 6; Bureau v. Regem 7; Duval v. Regem 8). Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, exer\u00e7ant sa discr\u00e9tion le juge a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les fins de la justice ne seraient pas utilement servies, en: accordant la demande de l'accus\u00e9, car il aurait ainsi \u00e9limin\u00e9 % de la population fran\u00e7aise, \u00e0 la participation de l'administration de la justice. Il n'appartient pas \u00e0 cette Cour d'intervenir dans l'exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion.\nJe disposerai bri\u00e8vement du grief N\u00b0 7, o\u00f9 l'on pr\u00e9tend que les dispositions de la loi (1945, 9 Geo. VI, c. 22) concernant la; liste des jur\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies. Ainsi, et c'est le grief qu'on invoque, les jur\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre choisis dans un rayon de milles de la municipalit\u00e9 (art. ) et ils l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9, non pas dans un rayon de 40 milles, mais bien jusqu'\u00e0 une distance de 40 milles, mesur\u00e9s sur la route.\nM\u00eame s'il y avait l\u00e0 une irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, elle serait couverte par l'article C. Cr. qui dit:\u2014\n1011. Nulle omission dans l'observation des prescriptions contenues dans une loi \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la comp\u00e9tence, du choix, du ballotage ou de la r\u00e9partition des jur\u00e9s, ou dans la pr\u00e9paration du registre des jur\u00e9s, le choix des listes des jurys, l'appel du corps des jur\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s ces listes, ou la convocation de jurys sp\u00e9ciaux, ne constitue un motif suffisant pour infirmer un verdict, ni n'est admise comme erreur dans un appel \u00e0 interjeter d'un jugement rendu dans une cause criminelle. Je trouve que cette objection ne repose sur aucun fondement s\u00e9rieux.\nLe grief N\u00b0 8 ne me semble pas plus s\u00e9rieux. On reproche au juge, aux avocats de la Couronne, comme d'ailleurs pas ricochet aux avocats de la d\u00e9fense d'avoir adress\u00e9 le jury en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Y avait-il rien de plus logique d'agir de la sorte quand il s'agit d'un jury mixte? D'ailleurs, il semble qu'on peut facilement disposer de cette objection en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la cause de Veuillette v. Le Roi 9, et particuli\u00e8rement aux raisons de M. le Juge Brodeur \u00e0 la page 424:\u2014\nCe serait, suivant moi, un droit bien illusoire si, malgr\u00e9 le droit qu'aurait un anglais, par exemple, de choisir un jury mixte, il \u00e9tait permis \u00e0 la couronne de faire entendre les t\u00e9moins en langue fran\u00e7aise et de ne pas traduire leurs t\u00e9moignages en anglais de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que la teneur de ces t\u00e9moignages f\u00fbt comprise par les jur\u00e9s de langue anglaise. Cela constituerait un grave d\u00e9ni de justice.\nIl en serait de m\u00eame pour le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (charge) du juge. Ce dernier devrait voir \u00e0 ce que son allocution soit comprise de tout le jury.\nIl est vrai que la loi est silencieuse sur la mani\u00e8re dont une cause devra \u00eatre conduite devant un jury mixte. Mais je ne veux pas de meilleure interpr\u00e9tation de la loi que cette pratique, constamment suivie depuis plus de cent cinquante ans, que dans le cas de jury mixte les d\u00e9positions de t\u00e9moins sont traduites dans les deux langues et le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du. juge est \u00e9galement fait ou traduit en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais.\nEt M. le Juge Mignault s'exprime de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on aux pages 430 et 431.\nJe ne crois pas n\u00e9cessaire de discuter le 9\u00e8me grief, car je ne trouve pas que les procureurs de la Couronne, s'ils ont parl\u00e9 avec \u00e9nergie, ont employ\u00e9 un langage enflamm\u00e9. Rien dans ce qu'ils ont dit \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 sugg\u00e9rer aux jur\u00e9s de rendre un verdict non pas exclusivement bas\u00e9 sur la preuve, mais aussi sur les sentiments et les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s.\nIl reste donc le dernier motif d'appel qui est \u00e0 l'effet que Petrie, appel\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin de la Couronne, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 transquestionn\u00e9e par le procureur de la Couronne, sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e hostile. L'objection est bas\u00e9e sur l'article 9 de la loi de la Preuve du Canada. Il se lit ainsi:\u2014\n9. La partie qui produit un t\u00e9moin n'a pas la facult\u00e9 d'attaquer sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 par une preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de mauvais r\u00e9putation, mais si le t\u00e9moin est, de l'avis de la cour, d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 la partie en cause, cette partie derni\u00e8re peut le r\u00e9futer par d'autres t\u00e9moignages, ou, .avec la permission de la cour, peut prouver que le t\u00e9moin a en d'autres occasions fait une d\u00e9claration incompatible avec sa pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9position; mais avant de pouvoir \u00e9tablir cette derni\u00e8re preuve, les circonstances dans lesquelles a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite l\u00e0 pr\u00e9tendue d\u00e9claration doivent \u00eatre expos\u00e9es au t\u00e9moin de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9signer suffisamment l'occasion en particulier, et il doit lui \u00eatre demand\u00e9 s'il a fait ou non cette d\u00e9claration.\nOn voit; donc, que ce. que d\u00e9fend cet article est de discr\u00e9diter ou contredire son propre t\u00e9moin, mais nullement de rafra\u00eechir la m\u00e9moire d'un t\u00e9moin, au moyen de t\u00e9moignages ant\u00e9rieurs qu'il a rendus. Quand l'avocat de la Couronne a questionn\u00e9 madame Petrie sur la bouteille de sirop d'\u00e9rable, la pompe \u00e0 gazoline, la pr\u00e9sence des deux autres am\u00e9ricains, retourn\u00e9s aux Etats-Unis avant l'arriv\u00e9e de et de ses compagnons, comme ses r\u00e9ponses ne concordaient pas enti\u00e8rement avec celles donn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, elle a lu elle-m\u00eame ses r\u00e9ponses pour se rafra\u00eechir la m\u00e9moire. Elle admet que sa m\u00e9moire \u00e9tait meilleure au temps de l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire une ann\u00e9e auparavant. Je ne vois aucune tentative de discr\u00e9diter le t\u00e9moin oude la contredire. Il s'agissait seulement de savoir quelle \u00e9tait la v\u00e9ritable version, et le t\u00e9moin a accept\u00e9 celle de l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. C'est l\u00e0 d'ailleurs une question de discr\u00e9tion pour le juge, qui d\u00e9cide suivant les circonstances et; l'attitude du t\u00e9moin.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que j'aurais rejet\u00e9 cet appel, si la Cour avait eu pour l'entendre. Il y a dans toute la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite un faisceau de circonstances telles que m\u00eame si j'avais trouv\u00e9dans les griefs soulev\u00e9s par le procureur de l'accus\u00e9, non pas des erreurs fondamentales, auxquelles on ne peut rem\u00e9dier, mais quelques irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s affectant le proc\u00e8s, je n'aurais pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer l'article (c) du Code Criminel, car il ne s'est produit aucun tort r\u00e9el, ni d\u00e9ni de justice. Allen v. The King 10. Les circonstances \u00e9tablies, ne laissaient aucune alternative au jury. Elles sont enti\u00e8rement compatibles avec la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9, et incompatibles avec toute autre conclusion rationnelle.\nMa r\u00e9ponse, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e par Son Excellence la Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Conseil est que j'aurais rejet\u00e9 l'appel.\nRand J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Kellock, my answer to the question referred to the Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal. Kellock J.:\u2014The appellant first contends that while the jury were properly charged as to the treatment of circumstantial evidence, the learned trial judge removed from the ambit of such evidence all statements made by the accused himself to the various witnesses.\nInitially that is so but the learned trial judge had previously told the jury that, with respect to both direct and circumstantial evidence, the Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the accused who had committed the crime for which he was indicted, and immediately following the direction objected to, proceeded to particularize the evidence of \"the circumstances\" and included therein not only what had been stated by the various witnesses as to the conduct of the appellant but also the statements made by him. Not only so, but he told the jury that \"considering the whole of these facts, no direct proof can be found anywhere\" and charged them that if they were not convinced by the evidence \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the offence for which he stands indicted, this doubt must work in his favour and it is your duty to discharge him.\" In these circumstances, all basis for any objection on the above ground, in my opinion, disappears.\nThe appellant further contends that the examination on behalf of the Crown of the witness Petrie, with respect to whom the learned judge had refused an application to declare her a hostile witness, amounted to cross-examination and was for that reason inadmissible, and, in particular, that the use made by counsel for the Crown of her previous depositions was illegal.\nIn the course of her examination as to articles which Coffin had brought to Montreal, the witness stated that she had seen a certain maple syrup bottle while giving evidence at the preliminary hearing a year before. She went on to say that it was \"like\" the one produced at the trial but smaller \"as far as I can remember\". Crown counsel agreed that \"we are talking about evidence that had been given over a year ago\" and asked the witness if she would care to refresh her memory, to which she responded that she \"wouldn't mind\". After having read her depositions to herself, she stated what she had said at the earlier hearing and agreed that her earlier memory was to be preferred. Similarly, on a question as to her having seen a gas pump with Coffin, the witness at first said she had seen only the box in which it was contained. But on refreshing her memory by reference to her depositions, she said her memory had been better on the former occasion and that she had seen the pump.\nEvidence had already been given at the trial of a statement made to the police by Coffin that when he had last seen the Lindsay party, two other Americans, driving a yellowish-coloured jeep, were with them. Evidence had also been given that two Americans driving a vehicle of the above description had been in the Gasp\u00e9 some days earlier but had recrossed the border to the United States on June 5, the day the Lindsay party had left Pennsylvania. This was the only evidence of the presence in the district at any time of any similar American party.\nOn this subject the witness Petrie deposed that Coffin had, a few days after his arrival, told her the same story he had told the police but not on the night of his arrival, when he had told her the other things. She also said, in answer to; a question to that effect, that she had not made such a statement on any previous occasion, including an occasion when she had given a statement to the police. She was then asked as to her memory of the facts at the time of the preliminary inquiry. Having answered that it was \"a little better than they are now\", she looked at her depositions and testified that she had previously said that Coffin had told her only of the Lindsay party. She said that her memory when she had thus testified was \"not too bad I guess\". In my opinion, in this answer the witness was adopting as the fact what she had said at the preliminary inquiry and her evidence is to be taken accordingly.\nIt is quite true that the initial answers made by the witness as to these three matters were not \"accepted\" by counsel for the Crown but while, as a general rule, a party may not: either in direct or re-examination put leading questions, the court has a discretion, not open to review, to relax it whenever it is considered necessary in the interests of justice, as the learned judge appears to have considered was the situation in the case at bar; ex parte Bottomley 11; Lawder v. Lawder 12. Moreover, the authorities make it clear that a witness may be allowed to refresh his memory by reference to his earlier depositions and that it is only where the object of the examination is to discredit or contradict a party's own witness that s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act applies. In the present case it is evident that the object was to show that the mention by the appellant to the police of having left the Lindsay party in the company of two other persons was an afterthought which had not occurred to him when he gave his earlier account to the witness Petrie. did not wish, therefore, to discredit Petrie to obtain from her the evidence she had given in her depositions if, on bringing the depositions to her attention, her memory would permit her to adopt them.\nIn Reg. v. Williams 13, \u00e0 for the prosecution, having replied in the negative to a question put to him, was permitted by Vaughan Williams J., to have his depositions put into his hands, and, after having looked at them, to answer the question. Similarly, in Melhuish . Collier 14, a witness for the plaintiff was asked by the plaintiff's counsel as to whether or not she had not made a certain answer in previous proceedings before the magistrate. The question being objected to on the ground that it went to discredit the party's own witness, the learned trial judge ruled that the question was a proper one. Upon a rule nisi a new trial, the rule was discharged. At p. 496, Coleridge J., said:\nA witness from flurry or forgetfulness may omit facts and on being reminded may carry his recollection back so as to be able to give his evidence fully and correctly, and a question for that purpose may properly be put.\nAs to the difference between a question directed to refreshing memory and contradicting one's own witness, the learned judge continued:\nBut as to the first point it is objected that the object of the question put here was to contradict and not to remind a witness and that therefore it could not be put. It is certainly very difficult to draw the line of distinction in practice and I am not now disposed to do it. In the present case I do not think the question objected to went further than was proper\nSee also The King v. Laurin 15, distinguishing R. v. Duckworth 16. In the case at bar the learned trial judge, having come to the conclusion that the witness was not hostile in the legal sense land having therefore refused to permit her to be cross-examined, was, nevertheless, entitled, in his discretion, to permit leading questions to be put, and, similarly, was right in allowing the memory of the witness to be refreshed by reference to her previous statements. As in each case the witness adopted what she had previously said, no such situation arose as in Duckworth's case, ubi cit, or Rex v. Darlyn 17, where the earlier statements were not adopted.\nThe very fact that the learned judge did not regard the witness as hostile, i.e., as not giving her evidence fairly and with a desire to tell the truth because of a hostile animus toward the prosecution, would seem to indicate the propriety of his permitting the examination to proceed and the attention of the witness to be called to her statements when her memory as to the matters to which she deposed was, as she herself said, much better than at the time of the trial, a year later.\nA further objection made is that two of the guards attending the jury at a moving picture theatre during an adjournment of the trial, subsequently gave evidence for the Crown. The evidence given was of a statement made by the appellant to his father during the coroner's inquest that \"They are not men enough to break me.\" Only one of the witnesses could depose as to what was said. The other did not understand English and could testify only that Coffin had spoken to his father on the occasion in question.\nThe jury had been permitted to attend the theatre by the learned trial judge upon the consent of counsel for the accused as well as the Crown. The guards were provincial police and all took the usual oath as to communication with the jury. It is not suggested that there was any breach of, this oath on the part of the witness nor any of the other members of the guard. It would appear from the proc\u00e8s-verbal the selection of the guard and the administering of the oath was left by all concerned to the clerk of the court, and that the. inclusion of the two constables was a pure oversight by him. In these circumstances, I see no reason for assuming that either constable was guilty of any impropriety in communicating, in breach of his oath, with the jury on the subject of his prospective evidence, any more than it would be assumed that any constable in attendance at a trial, during the course of which he is required to guard a jury during an adjournment, had discussed with them anything he had heard at the trial or from any other source. We have been referred to reported cases involving facts in which the courts there concerned considered a new trial called for but I cannot agree that the present circumstances call for such a result.\nThe appellant further calls attention to the fact that the trial took place before a mixed jury, the evidence being translated from one language into the other; that the learned trial judge charged the jury in both languages, and that one counsel for the prosecution as well as one for the defence addressed the jury in one language while his associate in each case addressed the jury in the other. It is contended that because of differences between the addresses in one language and the other and between the charges delivered by the. learned judge, the result is that the appellant was really tried by two groups of jurymen composed of six men each. It is also contended that s. 944 of the Criminal Code. requires that the jury be addressed by one counsel only on each side.\nWhen it is remembered (as we were told by Crown counsel without contradiction) that the practice followed with respect to translation, the charge and the addresses has been the invariable practice in the Province of Quebec since 1892 at least, when the Code was first enacted, and that during all of that- time s. 944 has been in its present form, the contention, in so far as it is based on that section, cannot, in my opinion, succeed.\nIn Veuillette v. The King 18, the appellant, being tried on an indictment for murder, stated through counsel that the language of the defence was French. The jury impanelled was a mixed jury, each of the French-speaking members stating to the court on his selection that he understood and spoke both languages. The proceedings were carried on throughout in English and the summing up was in English only. It was held by this court that even assuming there was any error in law in so proceeding, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had been thereby occasioned to the appellant. In the course of his judgment, Mignault J. said at p. 430:\nRevenant maintenant \u00e0 la disposition de la loi -28 Vict. ch. , il est clair que cette disposition serait illusoire si, dans un proc\u00e8s instruit devant un jury mixte, les t\u00e9moignages n'\u00e9taient pas traduits du fran\u00e7ais en anglais, et r\u00e9ciproquement, et si l'adresse du juge pr\u00e9sidant le proc\u00e8s n'\u00e9tait pas faite, du moins quant \u00e0 ses parties essentielles, dans ces deux langues. Telle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 la pratique en la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u2026\nAt p. 431, the same learned judge said:\nJe suis bien d'avis qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait quelque chose de non conforme \u00e0 la loi pendant le proc\u00e8s, c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'accus\u00e9 avait droit \u00e0 ce que le proc\u00e8s f\u00fbt instruit dans les deux langues, et \u00e0 ce que l'adresse du juge au jury f\u00fbt faite ou traduite, au moins dans ses parties essentielles, dans les deux langues, \u2026\nIn my opinion, neither the differences to which we were referred as between the address on behalf of the prosecution in the one language and the other, nor the charges, were of a nature to call for the interference of this Court in the grant of a new trial.\nIt is next contended that the trial judge erred in refusing the appellant's application under s. 923 of the Code to be tried by ah exclusively English-speaking jury. The foundation for this contention is certain evidence given by the sheriff that in preparing \"the list of jurors\", only the names of those who resided within a distance of forty miles by road from the court-house were included. The appellant relies upon the interpretation section of the Jury Act, 9 Geo. VI (Quebec) C. 22, s. 1, para. (a), which defines \"municipality\" as any municipality situated wholly or in part within a radius of forty miles, and he says that \"it would appear from the evidence of the Sheriff that had this method of selection been used, a larger number of jurors of English tongue could then have been obtained.\"\nThe appellant therefore submits that\nwhen it was brought to the attention of the trial judge that the Jurors had not been selected in the manner prescribed by the Jurors' Act, that it was the duty of the trial judge to order the sheriff to summons a sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English language under the provisions of s. 923, ss. (3) and that in the circumstances there was no proper exercise by the trial judge of his discretion in the instant case, and the appellant was thus deprived of a trial according to law.\nThe italics are mine.\nWhile the definition of \"municipality\" is as above, the statute provides, by s. 6 and following, for the preparation of a permanent jury list in each judicial district by a \"special officer\", from extracts furnished to him by the secretary-treasurer of each municipality. Upon the completion of this list, the special officer is required, by s. 23, to submit it for approval to a judge of the Superior Court, which approval \"shall render the list valid and incontestable\" and upon its deposit in the office of the sheriff, s. 18 provides that it shall be the \"only\" list in force in the judicial district.\nIt is from the list thus prepared that the sheriff is required to prepare the panel of jurors for any particular sittings but the sheriff has nothing to do with the preparation of \"the list\" itself. That duty falls upon the special officer and the Superior Court judge. The contention of the appellant under this head is therefore founded upon a complete misconception of the statute. Moreover, it is provided by s. 1011 of the Criminal Code that\nNo omission to observe the directions contained in any Act as respect \u2026 the selecting of jury lists, the drafting of panels from the jury lists \u2026 shall be a ground for impeaching any verdict or shall be allowed for error upon any appeal to be brought upon any judgment rendered in any criminal case.\nOn this reference we are, as is the appellant, restricted to a consideration of \"the grounds alleged\" upon the application for leave. If, however, anything is open under this head of objection which is not disposed of by what I have already said, I am of opinion that there was, in the circumstances of this case, no error on the part of the learned judge in exercising his discretion under s. 923 of the Code against the motion. The learned judge took the view that, even if a full panel of English-speaking jurors could be obtained from the list, which appeared extremely unlikely, \"the ends of justice\" would be better served by a trial with a mixed jury, as to do otherwise would exclude eighty to eighty-five per cent of the population of the district who were French-speaking from all participation in the administration of justice so far as that trial was concerned.\nThe ground of objection concisely put is that \"the ends of justice\" could only be \"better served\" by what the accused conceived to be in his interests. In my opinion, the section is not to be so construed. It is to be noted that the statute does not say \"the interests of the accused\" but the \"ends of justice.\" In my opinion, the interests of the accused are gathered up in the larger interests of the administration of justice. I do not think, therefore, that in the exercise of his discretion under the section for the purposes of this trial, the learned judge took into consideration any matter which can be said to be outside the scope of what was proper in the due administration of justice.\nIt is next contended that certain comment by counsel for the Crown while addressing the jury in French with respect to the statement by the appellant to his father already referred to, was inflammatory. Having considered that comment, however, I am unable to say that it was not one which might not fairly be made.\nThe appellant also contends that the address of Crown counsel was inflammatory in its reference to the responsibility resting upon the jury in a case which had undoubtedly received international attention, as indeed the appellant in his factum expressly states. Having read the portion of the address referred to, the impression made upon my mind is best expressed in the language of Duff J., as he then was, in Kelly v. The King 19, as follows:\n\u2026 although some of the observations of the learned Crown counsel were no doubt excessive heightened, it is impossible to think that in the circumstances of this case the accused could suffer in consequence of them. Such expressions could not deepen the effect of a bare recital of the facts in the story which the officers of the Crown had to put before the jury.\nIt is also contended that evidence relating to a rifle borrowed by the appellant from one Eagle, was irrelevant and inadmissible and of so prejudicial a nature as to call for a new trial.\nIn May, 1953, the appellant had borrowed from Eagle a 32-40 rifle and Eagle also gave him eighteen or twenty cartridges for it. Eagle subsequently gave the police other cartridges of this kind. He further said that early in June, Coffin had told him he had the rifle at his home at York Centre. Eagle, who was quite obviously an unwilling witness for the Crown, further testified that he had had a conversation with Coffin in August following but that the subject of the rifle was not mentioned.\nAn expert witness called by the Crown testified that in the case of the bullet holes found in the clothing of Lindsay Jr., and the bullet mark on the stock of the rifle of Lindsay Sr., there was no deposit of potassium nitrate, which deposit, according to the expert evidence, is found in the case of all calibres of rifle excepting the .32-40. It was also proved that the cartridges Eagle had given to the police, when fired in the type of rifle he had loaned to Coffin, did not leave such a deposit either. None of the four rifles possessed by the Lindsay party were of this calibre.\nWhile, according to the evidence of MacDonald, the appellant did not have a rifle with him on June 8th or 9th, and while the appellant stated to the police that he had not had a rifle with him in the bush between June 10th and 12th, the witness MacGregor saw the muzzle of a rifle in the back of the truck which Coffin was driving immediately upon his coming out of the bush on the evening of the 12th,\nCoffin had a camp of his own some ten miles from Gasp\u00e9 a bush road which led nowhere beyond that point but faded out into the bush. Access to this road was protected by a gatekeeper, as in the case of the other roads in the neighborhood leading into the forest area. The gatekeeper testified that on June 9 Coffin had passed the gate going toward his camp. This could only have been after his return from the bush that day.\nCoffin told the police that he had left for the bush very early on the morning of the 10th. This according to MacDonald, was in breach of Coffin's agreement with MacDonald of the day before to go back into the bush with him at 6.00 a.m. on the 10th. It was also shown that while Coffin had left his home around midnight on June 12 without telling anyone of his plans, he had, by 3.00 a.m., progressed only about thirteen miles on the way to Montreal. He had, therefore, plenty of opportunity to visit his camp in the interim, had he so desired, and to place the rifle there if he did not wish to leave it at his home in York Centre. On arrival in Montreal in the early morning of June 15, he did not have a rifle.\nOn the 27th of August the appellant, while in custody, was visited by a brother who parted from the appellant in tears. The following morning the police went to Coffin's camp and made a search for the rifle, without result. They, however, found tracks in the soft earth of a vehicle which had preceded them, which they were able to follow to the camp, where the vehicle had turned about and gone back. The night of August 27-28 had been a very wet night and: the marks, of the truck were clearly visible in the soft ground. The gatekeeper and his wife deposed that late on the evening of the 27th or the early morning of the 28th, sounds of a vehicle rushing past the barrier had been heard. The driver did not stop to have either his entrance or exit cleared, as was required. The tracks of the vehicle around the barrier, were clearly visible. When the police arrived at the camp, they made a search for the missing rifle but found nothing. Had there been no other evidence with regard to the rifle it might be that the evidence of the visit of the police, as well as that of the nocturnal visitor who preceded them, should be considered too remote to be properly admissible. But there was other evidence.\nEagle testified that when he \"lost\" the rifle loaned to Coffin he bought another in its place in October, 1953. It is a legitimate inference from this evidence, and one the jury were entitled to draw, that Mr. Eagle had learned, from some; source, that his rifle was irrevocably gone when he spent his money on a new one. It is also a fair inference that when; the rifle was not mentioned between them when Eagle was talking to Coffin on the occasion of the August interview, the realization of his \"loss\" must have come to him subsequently. When it is realized that no person would have any business at Coffin's camp except the appellant himself or someone under his direction or with his permission, it is also a fair inference that the object of the police officers and that of the nocturnal visitor of August 27-28, was the same, namely, the rifle. All of the above evidence is part of a whole, which, in my opinion, was admissible, its weight, of course, being a matter for the jury. Moreover, all of this evidence was merely incidental to the main fact deposed to by the witness MacGregor that the latter had seen a rifle in Coffin's truck immediately upon his coming out of the bush on the evening of June 12, as well as to the fact that the rifle loaned to Coffin by Eagle was not accounted for.\nIn Blake v. Albion 20, Cockburn C.J., said at p. 109:\n\u2026 with a few exceptions on the ground of public policy \u2026 all which can throw light on the disputed transaction is admitted\u2014not of course matters of mere prejudice nor anything open to real, moral or sensible objection, but all things which can fairly throw light on the case. In my opinion, however, that portion of the evidence of the police officers that it was because of having obtained \"precise\" information that they had gone to the appellant's camp to make the search, was not proper. For reasons to be given, however, I am satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, neither the admission of this statement nor the reference to it in the judge's charge produced any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nIt is next said for the appellant that the learned judge did not instruct the jury in accordance with the principle in Schama's case 21, with reference to such account as Coffin gave of his possession of the property of the deceased hunters. In so far as the early part of his charge is concerned, I think there is room for objection. However, the learned judge went on to point out to the jury that the appellant had given no explanation at all to account for his possession of some of the articles and, after putting before them such explanation as the appellant did make with regard to others, he asked the jury to consider whether the explanation given was \"likely\". Also, after asking the jury to consider which of the respective contentions of counsel for the Crown and the appellant as to the appellant's conduct they considered \"the most logical, the most plausible, the most likely and the most reasonable, according to the facts\" which had been proved, the learned judge again returned to the appellant's possession of articles belonging to the deceased, of American money and his story of having been paid by Lindsay Sr., as well as his failure to make any explanation at all as to certain articles, and, placing before the jury the theory of the prosecution and the defence; concluded:\nGentlemen, you have two theories which are opposed to one another. Is one more likely than the other? Does the theory of the Crown rest on a body of evidence which points beyond any reasonable doubts towards Coffin and towards his guilt as to the crime he stands indicted? Does the theory of the Defence spring reasonably from the same facts, and may it cause you to believe in the incompatibility of the proven circumstances with the guilt of Coffin and their compatibility with his innocence?\nIn re R. v. Garth 22, Lord Goddard C.J., in reference to the decision in Abramovitch, said, at p. 101, that \"a much more accurate direction to the jury is: 'if the prisoner's account raises a doubt in your minds, then you ought not to say that the case has been proved to your satisfaction.'\" See also Richler v. The King 23, per Sir Lyman Duff C.J. In my opinion, the charge of the learned judge, on this subject, when read as a whole is not open to the objection which the appellant takes. If it could be said to fall short of what is required, I would, in any event, be of opinion that, in the circumstances of this case, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred because of it.\nThe appellant further contends that the learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they were not entitled to convict of murder \"simply because they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of theft\" of the various articles. In his factum the appellant says:\nWhile the jury might well have seen fit to conclude that the appellant had stolen the items found in his possession from the abandoned truck of the victims there was nothing in the evidence to compel them to conclude that he had killed the deceased tourists and had stolen from their persons.\nIn this connection it is necessary to refer to the evidence at some length.\nThe deceased, with his father, Eugene Lindsay, and another youth, Frederick Claar, left their homes in Pennsylvania on June 5, 1953, intending to return by the 15th of that month. As they did not return, a search was instituted and ultimately the remains of all three were found. Little more than bones remained as the bodies had been eaten by bears and other wild animals. According to the expert evidence, the death of each had occurred not later than June 17.\nThe country where the remains were found is a forest area adjoining a bush road which, some distance to the east of the locality in question, has two branches which commence at what is called the \"Mine Road\", which runs from Gasp\u00e9 Murdockville. The westerly end of this bush road again meets the Mine Road approximately six miles to the east of Murdockville. This country is, so far as the evidence shows, completely uninhabited, and resorted to only by prospectors and hunters.\nApproximately midway between the point where the two branches join and the point where its westerly terminus meets the Mine Road, there are four hunting camps- used spasmodically by hunting parties, the camps being numbered, from east to west, 21, 24, 25 and 26. They are approximately three miles apart. Access to the bush road is obtained only through barriers for which a pass must be presented to the attendants in charge.\nOn July 10, the truck of the deceased was found abandoned on the bush road at a point about three miles east of camp 21. On July 23, the remains of Lindsay Jr., were found in a heavily wooded area at a distance of approximately 175 feet from Camp 26. With them were found a sweater and two shirts, each perforated by a bullet hole in what would have been the vicinity of the heart had the clothing been worn at the time of the death. Undoubtedly they had been so worn as the bullet holes were in the same place in each garment. There was also found nearby a watch, a? silver ring, and a cigarette lighter, all belonging to the deceased, as well as his rifle, the muzzle being buried in the earth, suggesting that as he fell the rifle had been pushed into the ground. The left pocket of the trousers of the deceased had been turned inside out and his wallet was missing. It was proved that he had had a wallet made of brown leather.\nIn a locality of the same character approximately 200 feet away, the remains of Claar we're also found the same day. Nearby there were some of his clothing, boots, a camera, as well as his rifle. Beneath a large stump, under which it had been stuffed, a leather windbreaker belonging to Claar was also found, as was also his wallet which had been rifled. Holes in the bones of the lumbar region of Claar were similar to the bullet holes found in the clothing of Lindsay Jr., but the experts were not able to swear positively that they were bullet holes.\nThe remains of Lindsay Sr. had previously been found on July 15, at a distance of approximately one hundred and fifty feet from Camp 24, near the bank of a small stream. On July 27, his wallet was discovered in the bed of this stream. The zipper had been pulled open and most of the documents it contained were partly pulled out, but the wallet was empty of money. When the deceased had left his home on the 5th of June, he had with him at least $650. On the butt of his rifle, which was found approximately fifty feet from his remains, there was evidence of blood and human hair, and there was more hair on the ground. In addition, there was a mark on the butt suggesting it had: been caused by being grazed by a bullet.\nIn the vicinity of Camp 24 also, there were first discovered a sleeping bag containing some bread, a camera case and a couple of jackets. The sleeping bag had been tightly rolled up and tucked under some trees in the bush away from the road. This discovery led to a further examination in the vicinity with the result that, spread over an area of approximately one hundred feet in the bush, other articles were found including a camp stove, the legs of which were in the branches of the trees, while the stove itself was down below in the bushes. All these articles were proved to have belonged to one or other of the deceased. It was apparent to the searchers from the places in which they were found that these latter articles had been thrown away. In addition to the three rifles mentioned, another was found in the abandoned truck, from which nothing else appeared to have been taken. None of the rifles had been recently fired. The Lindsay party had taken with them four rifles only.\nIt is reasonably apparent from the articles not taken, and the jury could so conclude, that the motive for the killing was robbery and that it was money which the robber chiefly wanted.\nCoffin, with one MacDonald, had been in the area in question on the 8th and 9th of June, had spent the night at Camp 24 and had gone as far as a mile and a half west of Camp 26 before returning to Gasp\u00e9 on afternoon of June 9, arranging to meet MacDonald next morning at Coffin's home at six o'clock for the purpose of returning to the area for prospecting purposes. Coffin did not, as already mentioned, keep this appointment. Instead, according to his own story, very early on the morning of June 10, he set out for Camp 21 alone in the truck which he had borrowed from one Baker and which he and MacDonald had used on the two preceding days. He told the police that he had come upon the three Americans about three miles east of Camp 21 and had had breakfast with them.\nAccording to Coffin, Lindsay Sr., had requested him to go to Gasp\u00e9 Lindsay Jr., to have the gas pump of the Lindsay truck, which Coffin said was not working, repaired. He did so and the presence of the two in Gasp\u00e9 day was independently proved. On arrival at Gasp\u00e9, Coffin said they found it impossible to repair the pump and young Lindsay purchased a new one. They then returned, reaching the others about four or five o'clock that afternoon. At this time, according to Coffin's story to the police, there were the two other Americans there with a yellowish plywood jeep. Coffin said he was introduced but did not remember their names.\nCoffin stated that Lindsay Sr. took out his wallet and paid him $40 in American currency, a $20 bill and two $10 bills. Coffin stated that after having a meal with the Americans, he left for Camp 21 and that he prospected in the vicinity until June 12, when he set out on the return trip to Gasp\u00e9. On the place where he had left the five Americans on the evening of the 10th, he said the Lindsay truck was there but no person. After waiting some time, he went on, reaching the home of MacGregor, a neighbour, in the early evening. Subsequently and about midnight, he left for Montreal, where he remained until on or about July 14.\nOn arrival in Montreal, Coffin had in his possession a knife having a number of attachments, the property of Lindsay Jr., as well as a pair of binoculars, the property of Claar's father, which the latter had lent his son for the purposes of the trip. These binoculars had a value of $65. Coffin had also the gas pump and a valise of Claar Jr., which contained a shirt, two pairs of shorts, two pairs of socks, a pair of blue jeans and two towels. According to the witness Petrie, Coffin told her that the knife and the binoculars had been given to him as souvenirs by some Americans he had helped in the Gasp\u00e9 . He made no explanation to her or to anyone else with respect to the valise or any of its contents nor as to the pump. When Coffin returned to Gasp\u00e9 had the valise and the knife with him. The valise was unpacked by his sister, Mrs. Stanley, who found in it the two towels and th\u00e9 pair jeans. He made the same statement to her with regard to the knife as he had made to Petrie but nothing about any of the other articles.\nAs already pointed out, the appellant concedes that there was sufficient evidence of the theft of the various articles but not of any connection between the theft and the killing. With respect to Coffin's account of his possession of the knife and the binoculars, it is to be kept in mind that he made no attempt to explain to anyone his possession of the other articles. That Coffin would be paid $40 for going back to Gasp\u00e9 Lindsay Jr. on June 9 would, taken by itself, seem likely to cause some raising of eyebrows among the jury, but when that story is coupled with the further statement that Coffin had, in addition, been \"given\" binoculars of a value of $65, a gift which no one but Claar Sr., who was in Pennsylvania could make, and the knife, which was of a special character and which had been a special gift to young Lindsay, the limits of credulity are surely overpassed. It cannot, therefore, be said, in my opinion, that the appellant gave any reasonable explanation of how he came to be in the possession of the things as to which he even attempted to make an explanation; R. v. Curnock 24.\nMoreover, if the jury did not believe the story that Coffin had been \"paid\" $40 by Lindsay Sr., it was established out of his own! mouth that he was in possession on June 10 of part, at least, of money belonging to Lindsay Sr.\nIn my opinion, therefore, there was abundant evidence from which the jury could conclude that the possessor of the money and the other items was the robber and the murderer as well. I think they have done so.\nIn Regina v. Exall 25, Pollock C.B., said at 924:\nThe principle is this, that if a person is found in possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that he committed the robbery.\nAnd so it is of any crime to which the robbery was incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or murder. For, if the possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the person who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence that the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other crime.\nThe law is, that if recently after the commission of the crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods, that person is called upon to account for the possession, that is, to give an explanation of it, which is not unreasonable or improbable.\nIn a note to the above case at p. 850 of vol. 176 of the English Reports, the editor refers to the case of R. v. Muller at p. 385 of the same volume, where the murder in question had occurred in a railway carriage on a Saturday evening and on the following Monday the prisoner was found in possession of the watch of the murdered man which he said he had bought off a pedlar at the London docks. The question arose as to whether, supposing the jury were not satisfied of the accused's guilt upon the evidence apart from the recent possession of the hat and watch, such possession would be sufficient proof of the prisoner's guilt of the murder. The note reads:\nThat it would have been sufficient, if no explantion at all had been offered, would be conceded. For the absence of explanation would have amounted to an admission.\nIn the case at bar the evidence which I have thus far discussed, does not stand alone.\nVery shortly after Coffin came out of the bush on the evening of June 12, he went to see the witness Boyle and paid him an \"old debt\" of $5.25. The same evening, also, he went to the hotel of the witness White where he purchased a case of ale, in payment for which he tendered a $20 American bill, and on being told that he owed White $5 \"from last year\", he paid that. Change was given to him in Canadian money.\nAt 1.30 a.m. on June 13, before he had left York Centre for Montreal, he also visited one Tuzo and paid him $10 which the latter had loaned him approximately five weeks earlier.\nAbout 3 a.m. on the same morning, Coffin got into the ditch at a place called Seal Cove about twelve miles on the road to Montreal from Gasp\u00e9 was helped out by the witness Element, who was paid by Coffin $2 in American bills.\nAt about 6.30 a.m. the same day, the witness Despard testified that he had filled the tank of Coffin's truck at Perc\u00e9 repaired the brake at a cost of $8, for which Coffin tendered a $20 American bill, asking for only $10 in change, thereby tipping him $2.\nLater, at a place called Chandler, Coffin received a haircut, a shave and a hair wash at the barber shop of the witness Poirier at a cost of $1.50. In. addition to paying this, he left a tip of $1.50, and paid $1 for a shoeshine. He also paid for the haircut of another customer in the shop and left as well a tip of $1.75. Later the same morning, Coffin got into the ditch again near a place called St-Charles de Caplan, out of which he was assisted by the witness J. P. Poirier, to whom he tendered another $20 American bill. Poirier testified that Coffin took the money out of a brown wallet which was filled with bills to a depth of approximately half an inch.\nAt noon the same day, at Black Cape, Gasp\u00e9, appellant incurred a small garage bill and left the proprietor a tip of $1. About 8.30 a.m. on June 14, he went to the home of the witness Tardif St-Andr\u00e9 de Kamouraska he purchased toast and coffee and seven bottles of beer, for which he paid $5. After he had left, a $10 Canadian bill was found under the chair which he had occupied.\nPrior to leaving York Centre for Montreal, the only money which Coffin was known to have had was $20 which he had received from MacDonald on the evening of the 9th of June to enable him to buy gas and other supplies for their return trip into the bush. This is apart from the $40 in American funds which he alleged he had received from Lindsay Sr. Coffin's last known employment was in May but how long he had worked or how much money he had was not shown.\nThe character of the above expenditures was such as to call as much for explanation as the recent possession of stolen goods; Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th ed., p. 105.\nOn Coffin's return from Montreal on July 20, when the remains of Lindsay Sr. had been found but the search for the others was proceeding, he was asked by the police to assist. He went with them the next day and it was then that he gave the account of his movements between June 10 and 12 to which I have already referred.\nCoffin told the police, also, that on his visit from June 10 to 12 inclusive, he had not gone beyond Camp 21 but on July 21, when the search party were having lunch at Camp 24, Gold water was asked for and Coffin went out to get it. He had, however, gone only five or ten feet beyond the door when he turned and asked \"Where is the brook?\", and did not go farther. The brook was within sixty feet of the shanty and readily visible. Upon Coffin saying this, one of the other men of the party, one Adams, said to him that he knew the country as well as Adams did himself. To this Coffin made no answer. Moreover, MacDonald testified that he and Coffin had eaten a meal within ten feet of that brook on June 9. It will be remembered that it was in the bed of this brook that the rifled wallet of Lindsay Sr. was later found on July 27. When the search party reached Camp 24, Coffin said he remembered having \"come up to\" Camp 24 with MacDonald. According to the latter, he and Coffin had gone beyond Camp 26 about a mile and a half on June 9.\nMembers of the search party testified that Coffin participated on a small scale in the search, during which he kept away from the sides of the road where the various articles thrown into the bush had been found.\nAs was said by Cockburn C.J., in Moriarty v. Ry. Co. 26:\n\u2026 it is evidence against a prisoner that he has said one thing at one time and another at another, as shewing that the recourse to falsehood leads fairly to an inference of guilt.\nThis is clearly applicable to the case at bar, which, in my opinion, is completely covered by the principle stated by Lord Tenterden C.J., in R. v. Burdett 27:\nNo person is to be required to explain or contradict, until enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him, in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but when such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit of explanation or contradiction, if the conclusion to which the proof tends be untrue, and the accused offers no explanation or contradiction; can human reason do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends?\nThis being so, the circumstances, in my opinion, are such as to call for the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by s. 1014(2) of the Criminal Code, notwithstanding error in the proceedings as already mentioned.\nThe effect of the sub-section has been variously expressed but the underlying principle was thus stated by Viscount Simon in Harris v. Director of Public Prosecutions 28:\nIf it could be. said that a' reasonable jury after being properly directed would, on the evidence properly, admissible, without doubt have convicted \u2026, the proviso should be applied. This is the test laid down by this House in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions, 1914 A.C., 315 at 321.\nSimilar language had previously been used by Anglin J., as he then was, in delivering the judgment of the majority in Kelly v. The King 29, where the decisions of the Privy Council in Makin v. Attorney General of New South Wales 30 and Ibrahim y. The King 31, were referred to. It may be observed that in the latter case, Lord Sumner, at p. 616, called attention to the former, as follows:\nEven in Makin's case, however, reservation was made of cases \"where it is impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted can have had any influence on the verdict of the Jury,\" and this reservation is not to be taken as exhaustive.\nAgain, in Stein v. The King 32, Anglin C.J.C., after referring to Makin's case, Ibrahim's case, Allen v. The King 33 and Gouin v. The King 34, said:\nIt may be that sometimes objectionable testimony as to which there has been misdirection is so unimportant that the court would be justified in taking the view that in all human probability it could have had no effect upon the jury's mind, and on that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict.\nIn that case the court considered the section inapplicable as the trial judge had erred in a most vital matter. In my opinion, the error in the case at bar was confined to matter of a comparatively minor character. Even where there has occurred misdirection in a material matter, the section is applicable if the court is satisfied that the jury, properly directed, must have reach the same conclusion: Boulianne v. The King 35.\nIn the case at bar, the evidence being as above reviewed with no explanation attempted by the appellant as to some of the articles in his possession and no explanation as to the others that could reasonably be true, no reasonable jury could, in my opinion, have done \"otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tend(ed).\"\nAccordingly, if the application made by Wilbert Coffin for leave to appeal had been granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said application, I would have dismissed the appeal.\nLocke J.:\u2014The facts, so far as it is necessary to consider them, are stated in the reasons for judgment to be delivered by my brother Cartwright which I have had the advantage of reading. As to the fourth ground of appeal, that portion of the evidence of Sergeant Doyon as to the \"precise information\" on which he acted in searching for the rifle in the vicinity of Coffin's camp was clearly hearsay. During the course of the argument of counsel for the Crown, he was asked if he could suggest any meaning which could be given to the language employed, other than that some one (unnamed) had given the witness information that the rifle was to be found there. He was unable to do so. I also find myself unable to attribute any other meaning to the words. The answer made by Constable Synnett that:\u2014\nWe proceeded to the place where Sergeant Doyon had got his information from\u2014where the indicated spot was supposed to be, and we got there at the indicated place, and the rifle was not there.\namounted to repeating the inadmissible evidence of Doyon.\nThe fact that the learned trial judge and both of the counsel who presented the case of the Crown to the jury accentuated its importance in determining the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused appears to me to be decisive of the question as to the material nature of the evidence.\nIn Allen v. The King 36, this Court considered an appeal, by a person convicted of murder in British Columbia, upon a reserved case, the basis for the appeal being that evidence had been improperly admitted at the trial. At the time Allen's Case was considered, s. 1019 of the Criminal Code (c. 146, R.S.C. 1906), dealing with appeals in criminal cases to a court of appeal, read:\u2014\nNo conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection given, unless in the opinion of the court of appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial.\nIt was contended for the Crown that this section should be applied in disposing of the appeal. Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J., with whom Duff J. (as he then was) agreed, said in reference to this (p. 339):\u2014\nIt was argued that the section of our Code, upon which the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal relied, specially provides that the appeal shall be dismissed even where illegal evidence has been admitted, if there is otherwise sufficient legal evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vit\u0153. say that we are in this case charged with the duty of deciding the extent to which the improperly admitted evidence may have influenced some of the jurors would be to hold, as I have already said, that Parliament authorized us to deprive the accused in a capital case of the benefit of a trial by jury.\nHaving said this, the Chief Justice said that the law on the point had been laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1893 in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales 37, and quoted the following extract from the judgment of Lord Chancellor Herschell:\u2014\nIt was said that if without the inadmissible evidence there were evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict and to shew that the accused was guilty, there has been no substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice. It is: obvious that the construction transfers from the jury to the court the determination of the question whether the evidence\u2014that is to say, what the law regards as evidence\u2014established the guilt of the accused. The result is that, in a case where the accused has the right to have his guilt or innocence tried by a jury, the judgment passed upon him is made to depend not on the finding of the jury, but on the decision of the court. The judges are in truth substituted for the jury, the verdict becomes theirs and theirs alone, and is arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing the evidence with the assistance which this affords.\nIt is impossible to deny that such a change of the law would be a very serious one, and the construction which their Lordships are invited to put upon the enactment would gravely affect the much-cherished right of trial by jury in criminal cases. The evidence improperly admitted might have chiefly, affected the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the evidence which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction might have been reasonably disbelieved by the jury in view of the demeanour of the witnesses. Yet the court might, under such circumstances, be justified, or even consider themselves bound to let the judgment and sentence stand. These are startling consequences. \u2026\nTheir Lordships do not think it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice where, on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider, in arriving at their verdict, matters which ought not to have been submitted to them. In their Lordships' opinion, substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence.\nThe language above quoted was followed by the following, which was the concluding paragraph of the Lord Chancellor's judgment:\u2014\nTheir Lordships desire to guard themselves against being supposed to determine that the proviso may not be relied on in cases where it is impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted can have had any influence on the verdict of the jury, as for example where some merely formal matter not bearing directly on the guilt or innocence of the accused has been proved by other than legal evidence.\nWhile this was not quoted by the Chief Justice, it was clearly adopted by him in the passage from his judgment above recited.\nAnglin J., saying that to accept the construction of s. 1019 urged on behalf of the Crown would be, in effect, to substitute the court for the jury in determining the question whether the evidence which was admissible established the guilt of the accused, quoted that passage from the judgment of the Lord Chancellor in which it was said that in their Lordship's opinion substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon the perusal of the evidence. While both the Chief Justice and Anglin J. noted that the enactment considered in Makin's Case differed from the language of s. 1019 in that it read:\u2014\nProvided that no conviction or judgment thereon shall be reversed arrested or avoided on any case so stated unless for some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice.\nboth clearly were of the opinion that there was no real distinction between the statutory provisions.\nS. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the new Code which applies to the disposition of the present matter by virtue of s. 746 provides that the court may dismiss the appeal, notwithstanding that it is of the opinion that, on any question of law, the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant if \"it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.\" The meaning of the language quoted is indistinguishable from that of the section 1019 considered in Allen's Case. In my opinion, we are bound by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Makin's Case and by that of the majority of this Court in Allen's Case. It cannot, in my opinion, be said that the evidence in question, to which so much importance was attached by the learned trial judge and by Crown counsel when the matter was presented to the jury, was evidence of the nature referred to in the concluding passage of the Lord Chancellor's judgment above referred to. Once it is determined that the evidence improperly admitted is on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, it cannot properly he said that there has been no substantial wrong ] or miscarriage of justice and the section has, in my opinion, no application.\nThe decision of this Court in Schmidt v. The King 38, was not in a case in which there had been an improper admission of evidence of this character and was not intended to be at variance with Allen's Case, in my opinion.\nOn all of the other questions discussed by my brother Cartwright I agree with his conclusions and with his reasons for those conclusions.\nIf leave to appeal had been granted on those grounds advanced on the application for leave to appeal, dealt with by my brother Cartwright and by me, it would have been my opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nCartwright J.:\u2014On August 5, 1954, following his trial at Perc\u00e9 the Province of Quebec before Lacroix J. a jury, Wilbert Coffin was convicted of having, between June 1, 1953 and July 23, 1953, murdered Richard Lindsay. He appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) 39, and his appeal was dismissed without dissent. He then applied to a Judge of this Court for leave to appeal to this Court upon a number of questions of law; this application having been dismissed, he appealed to the Court from such dismissal; and the Court, being of opinion that it was without jurisdiction, dismissed the appeal.\nHis Excellency the Governor General in Council has referred the following question to the Court:\u2014\nIf the application made by Wilbert Coffin for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada had been granted on any of the grounds alleged on the said application, what disposition of the appeal would now be made by the Court?\nWe have had the assistance of full and able arguments by counsel for the Attorney General of Quebec and for Coffin.\nThe grounds alleged on the application for leave to appeal to this Court which were argued before us are as follows:\u2014\n1. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in respect to the instructions he gave to the jury with reference to the doctrine of recent possession in the following manner:\u2014\n(a) Should the jury have been permitted to apply the doctrine at all? (b) Were the jury .misdirected with reference to the burden resting on the Appellant to explain his possession of items allegedly stolen?\n2. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in failing to instruct the jury that they were not entitled to convict the Appellant of murder simply 'because they came to the conclusion that he was guilty of the theft of the various articles proved to have been the property of the victim, Richard Lindsay, and his associates?\n3. Did the Learned Trial Judge err by instructing the jury in a manner that would indicate the statements and declarations made by the Appellant to various witnesses were not to be regarded as circumstantial evidence and evidence therefore to which the rule in Hodge's case should be applied?\n4. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting evidence concerning a certain rifle, the property of one Jack Eagle?\n5. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in admitting the evidence of one Marion Petrie Coffin, common law wife of the Appellant?\n6. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in permitting the jury to attend a moving picture theatre in the company of two police officers who were subsequently called as witnesses for the Crown?\n7. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in refusing the application made on behalf of the Appellant to be tried by a jury composed entirely of English-speaking citizens?\n8. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the failure of the Sheriff of the County in which the Appellant was tried to comply with the provisions of the Quebec Jury Act (1945, 9 George VI, Chap. 22)?\n9. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the improper mixture of the English and French languages?\n10. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by reason of the fact that Crown Counsel in their addresses to the jury used inflammatory language?\nThe evidence indicated that Richard Lindsay, aged 17 years, his father, Eugene Lindsay and a friend Frederick Claar left their home in Pennsylvania on June 5, 1953, in a truck to go on a hunting trip in the District of Gasp\u00e9 which they never returned. Their remains were discovered by search parties in July 1953, those of Eugene Lindsay on July 15 about 150 feet from a camp known as Camp 24 and those of Richard Lindsay and Claar, about two hundred feet apart, in a heavily wooded area in the vicinity of a camp known as Camp 26 which is distant about two and a half miles from Camp 24. Camp 24 is about 60 miles from Gasp\u00e9. medical evidence was that their deaths had occurred not later than June 17. As is pointed out by Hyde J. the Crown's case against Coffin was based on circumstantial evidence. The main circumstances claimed to be established were:\u2014\n(a) that Richard Lindsay was shot;\n(b) that property belonging to him and his two deceased companions was stolen;\n(c) that Coffin had an opportunity to commit the crime;\n(d) that a weapon (Eagle's rifle), which could have been used to shoot Richard Lindsay, was loaned to Coffin prior to the date of the crime and was never returned to its owner;\n(e) that when Coffin came out of the bush on June 12 the muzzle of a rifle was seen in his truck;\n(f) that the motive of the murder was theft;\n(g) that Coffin had possession of articles which were the property of the three deceased;\n(h) that as to some of these he gave no explanation and as to others no reasonable explanation of having them in his possession;\n(i) that when he left home Eugene Lindsay had about $650 in cash but that when his wallet was found there was no money in it;\n(j) that after June 12 Coffin had possession of a substantial amount of money although prior to that date he was shewn to owe some small debts;\n(k) that Coffin made contradictory statements as to his actions during the period when the murder was committed;\n(l) that Coffin's conduct during the search for the remains of some of the deceased, in which he took part, was suspicious;\n(m) that Coffin, after being arrested, arranged to have Eagle's rifle made away with.\nCoffin did not testify and no witnesses were called for the defence. Statements which he had made to police officers and to Marion Petrie , who was described as his common law wife, were proved as part of the Crown's case. Some parts of these statements, if true, were exculpatory; they contained no admission of guilt. This brief summary, while far from complete, is, I think, sufficient to indicate the evidentiary background against which the questions of law raised for decision must be considered.\nGround 4.\nI propose to deal first with ground 4 above. There was evidence that in May 1953 the witness Eagle had loaned his Marlin .32-40 calibre rifle to Coffin; that up to the time of the trial the rifle had not been returned to him; and that the holes in the clothing of Richard Lindsay, indicating that he had been shot, could have been made by a bullet of the calibre of Eagle's rifle. It was part of the theory of the Crown that Coffin had shot Richard Lindsay with Eagle's rifle. The evidence objected to was introduced in an endeavour to establish that at some time after the murder and probably before leaving for Montreal on June 13 Coffin had hidden this rifle near his camp; that on August 27 he had told his brother Donald Coffin where he had hidden it and that in the night of August 27 Donald Coffin had gone in a truck to Wilbert Coffin's camp, got the rifle and made away with it.\nCoffin's camp is in wooded country about 14 miles from Gasp\u00e9. On forest road leading to this camp there is a barrier at which persons going into the bush to hunt are required to obtain a permit. Coffin had been taken into custody on August 10. On August 27 he was allowed to have a private interview with his brother Donald at Police Headquarters in Gasp\u00e9. came out from this interview in tears. In the early morning of August 28 the sound of a motor vehicle was heard rushing past the barrier on the road leading to Coffin's camp. Later on the morning of August 28 Sergeant Doyon and Police Constable Synnett went to Coffin's camp; they saw marks on the road of the tires of a truck. It was said that Donald Coffin had a truck but there was no evidence as to whether the marks of its tires were similar to those seen on the road. Doyon and Synnett made a search in the vicinity of Coffin's camp but found no rifle.\nThe evidence objected to is found in the following passages in the evidence in chief of Sergeant Doyon and Police Constable Synnett. Sergeant Doyon\u2014\nQ Maintenant, il y a un monsieur Eagle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu au sujet d'une carabine qu'il avait pr\u00eat\u00e9e \u00e0 . Voulez-vous dire \u00e0 la Cour et \u00e0 messieurs les jur\u00e9s si vous avez fait quelques recherches au sujet de cette carabine?\nR Oui, j'avais eu une information pr\u00e9cise, et j'ai fait certaines recherches aux alentours du camp de Coffin \u00e0 la grande fourche, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u2026\nQ A quelle date?\nR En date du 28 ao\u00fbt.\nQ Etait-ce quelle partie de la journ\u00e9e?\nR A bonne heure le matin.\nQ Et avec qui avez-vous fait ces recherches?\nR Avec l'agent Synnett de la Police de la Route.\nQ Alors, o\u00f9 vous \u00eates-vous rendus?\nR De Gasp\u00e9, nous nous sommes rendus jusqu'au petit camp de Coffin \u00e0 l'endroit appel\u00e9 Grande Fourche.\nQ Et quelle partie avez-vous visit\u00e9e ou fouill\u00e9e?\nR Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, \u00e0 environ quarante \u00e0 cinquante pieds au nord du petit camp de Coffin.\nQ Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait, l\u00e0?\nR J'ai fait des recherches avec Synnett dans cette partie de la for\u00eat, principalement pr\u00e8s de petits sapins.\nQ Et puis, combien de temps avez-vous cherch\u00e9 comme \u00e7a?\nR A partir de sept heures et demie du matin aller jusqu'\u00e0 onze heures de l'avant-midi, je crois.\nQ Et avez-vous trouv\u00e9 quelque chose?\nR Non monsieur.\nQ Pour aller au camp de et \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 vous avez fait des recherches sur l'information pr\u00e9cise que vous aviez obtenue, est-ce qu'il faut passer par une barri\u00e8re?\nR Oui, il y a une barri\u00e8re \u00e0 environ un demi-mille de la route nationale, qui conduit de Perc\u00e9 \u00e0 Gasp\u00e9.\nPolice Constable Synnett\u2014\nQ. Now, Mr. Synnett, had you the occasion to accompany Mr. Doyon in order, to make any searches in the vicinity of a camp belonging to Coffin?\nA. Yes, we went there on the day of the last Coroner's inquest, or the day following the last Coroner's inquest.\nQ. Do you remember what date it was?\nA. On the 28th day of August.\nQ. Now, will you tell us in what circumstances you made that trip, and what you noticed at that occasion?\nA. We were going to look for a rifle.\nQ. Do you know to whom belonged that rifle?\nA. Yes, I did, at the time.\nQ. Who?\nA. John Jack Eagle.\nQ. Will you go on? A. We proceeded to the place where Sergeant Doyon bad got his information from\u2014where the indicated spot was supposed to be, and we got there at the indicated place, and the rifle was not there.\nQ. How long did you spend for your search?\nA. About an hour.\nIn my view all those parts of these passages which shewed that Doyon had information that Eagle's rifle was concealed in a precisely indicated spot in the neighbourhood of Coffin's camp were inadmissible as being hearsay evidence. Their meaning is not doubtful; and the jury could only understand them as a statement that someone, unnamed and not called as a witness, had told Doyon that Eagle's rifle was concealed near to some small fir trees 40 or 50 feet to the north of Coffin's cabin and had given Doyon precise information as to its hiding-place. On this illegal foundation there was erected and placed before the jury the theory that Coffin had told his brother Donald where the rifle was and had prevailed on him to get it and make away with it and that Donald was\" the driver of the vehicle heard to rush past the barrier in the early morning of August 28. Without evidence that Eagle's rifle was in fact hidden near Coffin's camp prior to the night of August 27\/28 the whole incident was of negligible probative value and connected with the accused so remotely, if at all, as to be inadmissible because irrelevant; but with evidence that the rifle was so concealed counsel for the Crown was in a position to ask and did ask the jury to infer a conspiracy between Coffin and his brother to destroy what was, in the Crown's theory, the murder weapon. Evidence that an accused has suppressed or endeavoured to suppress evidence is admissible circumstantial evidence against him, but here the foundation of the whole incident on which the jury were invited to find that he had suppressed evidence was the inadmissible hearsay evidence dealt with above.\nIn my view, the admission of this hearsay evidence was a grave error in law. I do not think that counsel for the Crown can be heard to say that the evidence was unimportant for it was forcibly put to the jury, in the address of counsel, as a circumstance pointing to Coffin's guilt and throwing upon the defence the onus of calling Donald Coffin as a witness which they had not done. When he came to charge the jury the learned trial judge did so firsi in English and then in French. His charge in English concluded at 12.15 p.m. and the Court adjourned; on resuming at 2.15 p.m. the learned judge addressed the jury in English as follows:\u2014\nGentlemen, before I address you in French, I want to make certain corrections. There is an incident in the evidence which I had noted and I intended to draw your attention to, and I unfortunately overlooked it this morning.\nI told you that on the occasion of that trip in the bush, MacDonald had declared! that he had not seen any rifle in the equipment, and that on the 12th of June MacGregor at Murray Patterson's place, had testified to the fact that he had seen a rifle in the pick-up which was driven by Coffin.\nNow, maybe something could be said to complete that part of the evidence, because there is the testimony of Doyon who later went to Coffin's camp, following what he declared to be a precise information, the nature of which has not been established, though; and he says that he had not found any rifle at that place.\nAnd you have then the conversation which on the previous day Coffin would have had with his brother at Gaspe, and during that night the gate keeper's wife, on the road leading to Coffin's camp, would have heard the noise of an automobile, and the following morning, they saw tracks that didn't cross on the highway through the gate, but went around.\nYou will give to these facts the interpretation that should be given in the light of your judgment and the evidence.\nThe learned trial judge dealt with the incident in substantially similar terms when he charged them in French. We find therefore that inadmissible testimony which had been vigorously stressed by Crown counsel was again brought to the attention of the jury by the learned trial judge with an instruction that they should consider it.\nIn my view the following words of Anglin C.J.C., giving the unanimous judgment of the Court in Stein v. The King 40, are applicable to the case at bar:\u2014\nIt is impossible to say that in the case now before us there has been no miscarriage of justice. It may be that sometimes objectionable testimony as to which there has been misdirection is so unimportant that the court would be justified in taking the view that in all human probability it could have had no effect upon the jury's mind, and, on that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict. But it is impossible so to regard this case, where, in a most vital matter, the learned judge did not merely fail to warn the jury to disregard the objectionable matter contained in the statements which had been admitted in evidence, but actually stressed it.\nIt is my view that this hearsay evidence in the case at bar related to a vital matter and, as I have already mentioned, I do not think that, in view of the way in which they stressed it to the jury, counsel for the Crown can now be heard to belittle its importance. Allegans contraria non est audiendus.\nGround 5.\nI will deal next with ground No. 5. In the memorandum filed on the application for leave to appeal, this ground was extended to read as follows:\u2014\nIt is respectively submitted that the crucial testimony given by Marion Petrie inadmissible for two reasons:\u2014\n(a) Her testimony was privileged by virtue of the provisions of section 4 of the Canada Evidence Act; and\n(b) She was submitted to a severe cross examination by Crown Counsel notwithstanding the fact that the Trial Judge had refused the application of Crown Counsel to have her declared a hostile witness.\nBefore us, Mr. Maloney did not argue ground (a), on which the authorities seem to be conclusive, but pressed ground (b).\nThe witness Marion Petrie was called by the Crown; she was shown to have lived with Coffin for some years as his wife. According to her evidence he arrived at her residence in Montreal at about 2.00 a.m. on June 15 and remained for some days. Some of her evidence assisted the Crown's case, for example she deposed that Coffin had possession of articles which other witnesses testified had belonged to the deceased. Her evidence in chief reads, in part, as follows:\u2014\n\u2026 When we were talking, he told me about when he went in the woods, he met three Americans, they had their truck that was broke down, and he took one of the fellows down to Gaspe to get a gas line or something fixed; he brought the fellow back, they gave him a pair of binoculars and a knife as a souvenir. He didn't mention anything about any money.\nQ. Did he say he had left the three Americans in the bush?\nA. Yes, when he came back, he left the other fellow with the other two.\nQ. You mean the one \u2026\nA. The one that he had taken down to Gaspe, he brought back.\nQ. That he had left him in the bush with the other two?\nA. With the other two.\nQ. Is that all he said?\nA. Oh, when I asked him if they got the truck fixed, he said there was another two chaps there the last time he seen them.\nQ. Did he say who those fellows were? A. He just: said he left them with another two friends, he didn't say who, and I didn't bother to ask him.\nQ. He gave you no more details on that?\nA. No, I was not interested.\n* * *\nQ. So, when did Coffin mention for the first time that there were two others but the three Americans that we are interested in?\nA. Well, it was a few days after he had arrived, I had asked him, it was just something that was going through my head, and I asked him if they got the truck fixed. When I asked him if they got the truck fixed, he said: \"The last time I seen them, there was two chaps with them.\"\nIt is obvious from the record that Crown counsel did not accept as truthful the witness' statement, that Coffin had told her that when he last saw them he had left the Lindsays and Claar in company with two other Americans; and counsel proceeded, against the repeated objections of defence counsel and in spite of the definite refusal of the learned trial judge to declare Miss Petrie an witness, to conduct a cross-examination, in the course of which he referred her to a statement she was alleged to have made to a police officer and to the evidence she had given at the preliminary inquiry. The examination of this witness by Crown counsel concludes as follows:\u2014\nQ. Do you recall having been heard as a witness at the preliminary. inquiry ?\nA. Yes sir.\nQ. And that was about a year ago?\nA. Yes sir.\nQ. Was your memory fresh over the facts we are concerned about, at the time?\nA. A little better than they are now. Q. Now, would you like to refresh your memory?\nA. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nQ. What did your memory tell you at the time?\nMr. Raymond Maher,\nFor the Defence:\nOBJECTED to the way of putting the question.\nMr. Paul Miquelon, Q.C.\nFor the Prosecution:\nQ. What did your memory tell you at the time?\nA. He just said three; he mentioned the three when he went out with them.\nOBJECTION BY Mr. Francois Gravel,\nFor the Defence:\nMr. Paul Miquelon, Q.C.\nFor the Prosecution:\nQ. How did your memory serve you at the time?\nA. Not too bad, I guess. Q. Well, what did it say?\nA. He just said \"three\", he mentioned the three when he went out with them.\nQ. To what question did you give that answer at the time?\nA. Did he talk about one American hunter or a second group or a party.\nQ. And, to that question, the answer was the one you just gave us?\nA. He just said three.\nQ. And that answer was?\nA. He just said three, he mentioned the three when he went out with them.\nIt was argued before us that, whether or not counsel was entitled to cross-examine his own witness, he was entitled to have her refresh her memory by reading inaudibly to herself the evidence which she had given at the preliminary inquiry. In Lizotte v. The King 41, the question whether a witness may refresh his memory by referring to the transcript of his evidence at the preliminary hearing was left open after attention had been called to the views expressed by eminent writers and I do not find it necessary to decide that question in this case, as it seems clear from reading the record that the transcript of the preliminary hearing was used not for the purpose of refreshing the memory of the witness, who had already without assistance testified as to her conversations with Coffin, but for the purpose of endeavouring to have her admit, (i) that at the preliminary inquiry she had not referred to any statement by Coffin that he had left the three deceased with two other Americans, and (ii) that she must have been mistaken or untruthful in her evidence at the trial in saying that Coffin had made such statement to her.\nWhen all of the evidence of this witness is read it does not appear to me that there was any unexplained difference between her evidence at the preliminary inquiry and that which she gave at the trial; but the jury may well have taken a different view as they were invited to do by Crown counsel as appears from the following passages in his address:\u2014\nNow, I am not here to judge Coffin's personal life, nor his wife's personal life, but on the other hand you know that that person who goes around as Mrs. Coffin is not Mrs. Coffin, they live as man and wife, I could not expect, and neither could you expect her to come here and tell us the whole story. I could not expect that, and she wouldn't be his wife, common wife or otherwise, and even if she did deny that Coffin confessed everything to her, but there is one other important point, after many contradictions, she admits\u2014and keep that in mind\u2014she admits that Coffin never mentioned two other American and she, at the last part of her testimony, she came back to what she had said at the preliminary inquiry when she told us her memory served her much better, that he only mentioned three Americans, and remember that later on, when we get Coffin back in Gaspe, because if there is one person in the world to whom he should have confided during that night, it was Mrs. Coffin, not his mother but his common-law wife.\n* * *\nDid Coffin try to point those two Americans as possible culprits? I know he did, we brought them here to tell us their story. Do you think that story is true when you have heard the story of Marion Petrie whom he never mentioned, according to her own testimony\u2014and you can believe that woman when she comes up and says anything that would hurt Coffin\u2014I don't say she should be believed as easily when she says something in favour of Coffin, but when she states something against Coffin, it is because she has to say it and can't get out of it.\nIn my view the cross-examination of this witness by Crown counsel was unlawful, and was attended by a further error in that no warning was given to the jury that any evidence of what the witness had said at the preliminary inquiry was not evidence of the truth of the facts then stated but could be considered by them only for the purpose of testing the credibility of the testimony which she had given before them at the trial. Similar errors were treated as grounds for quashing a conviction in Rex v. Duckworth 42 and in Rex v. Darlyn43.\nGround 6.\nI will deal next with ground No. 6. It appears that during the course of the trial the jury asked permission to attend a moving picture theatre. The learned trial judge consulted counsel and a consent in the following terms was signed by Coffin and his counsel:\u2014\nNous soussign\u00e9s consentons que les jur\u00e9s se rendent au cin\u00e9ma \u00e0 ce 27e jour de juillet , sous les conditions suivantes:\n1. Que six gendarmes aient la charge des jur\u00e9s, sous la direction du sergent Cassista;\n2. Que la repr\u00e9sentation ne repr\u00e9sente aucun proc\u00e8s quelconque;\n3. Que les jur\u00e9s et les gendarmes soient tenus compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 part du public dans le th\u00e9\u00e2tre et \u00e0 la sortie.\nSix constables were sworn to escort the jury to and from the moving: picture theatre at Chandler, the journey being made in automobiles. The record does not disclose the oath administered to the constables. There is. nothing in the record to suggest that during the course of this excursion any of the jury had communication with any member of the public or that there was an improper conversation between the constables and the members of the jury; but a few days later two of these constables were called and examined as Crown witnesses. One of them, Poirier, did not give evidence of any importance, but the other, P\u00e9pin, evidence of a conversation between Coffin and his father which took place after Coffin had been in custody for about 17 days. As to this P\u00e9pin:\u2014\nA. Well, all I heard was this: Mr. Coffin, Wilbert's father, said: \"are they treating you well?\" He says: \"Yes, I am well.\" He says: \"don't worry Dad, I'll be home soon,\" and before he left, the accused: \"they are not man enough to break me.\"\nIn the Court of Queen's Bench, Hyde J. after quoting the above answer continues:\u2014\nThis is certainly not one of the essential links in the chain of circumstances. I do not regard it as necessarily incriminating but certainly, looked at in a certain light, it could be prejudicial to the Appellant.\nAt the trial however it had been stressed by Crown counsel in the following terms:\u2014\nEt je terminerai par ce dernier mot qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement l'un des derniers de la preuve, celui-l\u00e0 qu'il a prononc\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame devant les hommes de police \u00e0 l'adresse de son p\u00e8re: \"They are not man enough to break me.\" Ils ne sont pas assez hommes pour me casser ou me briser.\nMessieurs, est-ce l\u00e0 le langage d'un innocent? Est-ce l\u00e0 le langage d'une personne qui n'a rien \u00e0 se reprocher? Est-ce l\u00e0 le langage d'une personne qui ne fuit pas la justice? Est-ce l\u00e0 le langage d'une conscience qui v\u00e9ritablement est en paix? .\nJe vous pose la question, et je crois que ces derniers mots sont lourds' de signification. Il ne crie pas: \"Je suis innocent, mon p\u00e8re,\" il ne crie, pas: \"Je n'ai rien fait de tel, mon p\u00e8re.\" Non: \"Non, ne vous inqui\u00e9tez pas, ils ne sont pas assez hommes pour me casser ou pour me briser.\" En d'autres termes: Non, la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ils ne la conna\u00eetront jamais, la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, je l'ai enfouie avec mon crime dans les profondeurs des bois o\u00f9 j'ai abattu ces trois Am\u00e9ricains; la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 n'\u00e9clairera pas, et si la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 n'\u00e9clate pas, la justice sera muette.\nEh bien non, messieurs les jur\u00e9s, j'ai confiance que la justice ne sera pas muette, et que vous allez donner l'exemple d'abord \u00e0 votre district, \u2026\nand in his charge the learned trial judge invited the jury to consider whether or not Coffin's statement to his father indicated a guilty mind. I mention this not to suggest that either the learned judge or counsel for the Crown made improper use of this piece of evidence but to shew the importance assigned to it in the conduct of the Crown's case at the trial. While, as mentioned above, there is no evidence to suggest that any improper communication in fact took place between this officer and any member of the jury, this unfortunate incident appears to me to fall within the principle stated by Sloan C.J. in Rex v. Masuda 44, as follows:\u2014\nStripped to its bare essentials, there can be no escape from the fact that three Crown Witnesses dined with the jury during a murder trial. It seems to me that to countenance such a situation as is thus presented, violates two essentials of justice. The one is that the jury must be kept completely free from any opportunity of communication during the trial, except under the most exceptional circumstances calling for a direction from the Court; and, secondly, that nothing must occur during the trial of a case from which a suspicion may arise that any taint attaches to the proper and meticulous fairness which must always surround the administration of public justice, more especially when a man is on trial for his life.\n* * *\nMoreover, if Crown witnesses are permitted to join the jury in an atmosphere of sociability during the adjournment of a murder trial, the confidence of the public in our present system of trial by jury would be shaken. The Courts are the custodians of that confidence and it must be upheld and not weakened. Thus it appears to us that the opportunity for communication, while a factor for consideration, is not the whole test to be applied in the circumstances. The test, in our opinion, is that enunciated by Lord Hewart, C.J. in R. v. Sussex Justices, (1923) 93 L.J.K.B. p. 129 at p. 131 wherein he said: \"Nothing is to be done which so much as creates even a suspicion that there has been an improper interference with the course of justice\", and \"it is \u2026 of fundamental importance, that justice should not only be done, but be manifestly and undoubtedly seen to be done.\"\nI agree with everything that was said by the learned Chief Justice in the passages quoted; and I am unable to find any such essential difference between the circumstances under which the jury were in company with the Crown witness in the case before us and those in the case with which the learned Chief Justice was dealing as would justify our refusing to apply the principle which he enunciated. In my view, unless we are prepared to overrule the judgment in Rex v. Masuda, there is no escape from holding that the incident on which this ground of appeal is founded was fatal to the: validity of the conviction.\nGround 7.\nI will deal next with ground No. 7. It appears from the Proc\u00e8s-verbal Coffin's trial commenced at Perc\u00e9 on 15, 1954, and that on, May 29, 1954 a notice had been served on the Attorney General of Quebec and the Clerk of the Queen's Bench, Criminal Assize Division, Perc\u00e9, on of Coffin, indicating that he could not speak or understand the French language and that he would ask at his trial for a jury of his own tongue. On his arraignment on July 15, 1954 the defence moved that Coffin be tried by a jury composed entirely of jurors speaking the English language. On this motion Crown counsel called as a witness the Sheriff of the district of Gasp\u00e9 deposed that of the jurors on the list of those qualified for the district about twelve to fifteen per cent were English-speaking and the remainder were French-speaking. The learned trial judge reserved judgment on the motion and gave judgment the' following day rejecting the motion and ordering that the trial proceed before a mixed jury. The reasons for this decision are set out in full in Volume I of the record at pages 25 to 30 inclusive. As I read these reasons the decision of the learned judge was based upon the following considerations: (i) that the persons whose names appeared upon the list of jurors who were English-speaking was twelve to fifteen per cent of the total, the remainder being French-speaking; (ii) that because of exemptions granted by the Court and the anticipated challenges, either for cause or peremptory, it appeared almost impossible to obtain a jury composed entirely of persons speaking the language of the accused; (iii) in the words of the learned judge:\u2014\nCONSIDERING that it does not seem to be in the spirit of the law that to exercise its discretion, in the sense of paragraph 3, Section 923, the Tribunal must eliminate eighty-five to eighty-eight per cent of the qualified talesmen in one district;\nSection 923 of the Criminal Code, in force at the date of the trial, reads as follows:\u2014\n923. In those districts in the province of Quebec in which the sheriff, is required by law to return a panel of petit jurors composed, one-half of persons speaking the English language, and one-half of persons speaking the French language, he shall in his return specify separately those jurors whom he returns as speaking the English language, and those whom he returns as speaking the French language respectively; and the names of the jurors so summoned shall be called alternately from such lists.\n2. In any district, the prisoner may upon arraignment move. that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language, or entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language. 3. Upon such motion the judge may order the sheriff to summon a sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English or the French language, unless in his discretion it appears that the ends of justice are better served by impanelling a mixed jury.\nThis section was considered by this Court in Piperno v. The Queen 45 After re-reading the judgment of the majority in that case, delivered by my brother Fauteux, and all the authorities to which reference is made therein, it is my view that the proper construction of s. 923 as applied to the facts of the case before us is as follows. Coffin having moved that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language, and it being conceded that English is his mother tongue and that he does not I speak the French language, was prima facie entitled to be so tried and could be required to stand his trial before a mixed jury only if it appeared to the learned judge presiding at the trial in his discretion that the ends of justice would be better served by empanelling a mixed jury. Provided the learned judge exercised his discretion on relevant grounds and in accordance with the law an appellate court would not interfere with his decision; but, with respect, it appears to me that he did not direct his mind to the question whether the ends of justice in the case before him would be better served by empanelling a mixed jury; that the three reasons, set out above, which he assigns for exercising his discretion in the way he did, and particularly the last mentioned of these reasons, were irrelevant considerations; and that, in the result, Coffin was deprived of a right of which he could only be lawfully deprived by the learned judge exercising his discretion on relevant and legal grounds.\nOn a proper construction of s. 923 of the Criminal Code the question which the learned judge was required to put to himself was whether in the case which he was about to try the ends of justice would be better served by empanelling a mixed jury rather than one composed entirely of jurors speaking the language of the accused, and not whether the empanelling of a jury of the sort last mentioned would be attended with difficulty or whether the language of the accused was or was not that spoken by the majority of the residents of the district in which he was on trial for his life. I respectfully agree with the following passage in the judgment of Langlais J. in Rex v. Twyndham and McGurk 46:\nIf I refer to s. 923 of the Criminal Code, subsection (2), I read: \"In any district, the prisoner may upon arraignment move that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language, or entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language.\"\nTherefore the prisoner when English or French has a right to move for a jury of his own tongue. It is his privilege and unless there are special grounds not to grant him such a motion he has an absolute right to it.\nIs there a restriction and what is it?\nWe find it in subsection (3) of the same section which reads as follows: \"Upon such motion the judge may order the sheriff to summon a sufficient panel of jurors speaking the English or the French language, unless in his discretion it appears that the ends of justice are better served by impanelling a mixed jury.\"\nThat subsection gives a discretion to the presiding Judge.\nThen it is quite clear that the general rule favours granting the motion unless there are special reasons to refuse it.\nIn Piperno v. The Queen (supra) at page 295 my brother Fauteux said:\u2014\nCe qui est sanctionn\u00e9 par la loi, c'est une facult\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 un pr\u00e9venu, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, de demander \u00e0 \u00eatre jug\u00e9 par des jur\u00e9s familiers avec la langue qu'il parle lui-m\u00eame\u2014pourvu que ce soit le fran\u00e7ais ou l'anglais\u2014et le droit d'obtenir alors au moins un jury mixte si, dans la discr\u00e9tion du Juge, il appara\u00eet que les fins de la Justice soient ainsi mieux servies qu'en faisant droit \u00e0 sa demande.\nThere was no need in that case to consider the nature of the grounds on which the exercise of the discretion given to the trial judge by s. 923 (3) can lawfully be based. An examination of the record in the case before us has failed to disclose any ground which appears to me to be sufficient in law to warrant the accused being denied a jury composed entirely of persons speaking his language.\nThis error does not appear to be cured by the provisions of s. 1011 of the Criminal Code. It was, in my respectful view, an error in law on the part of the learned trial judge in deciding how the case should be tried. If the provisions of s. 1011 were an answer in this case they would equally have been an answer to the objection to which effect was given in Alexander v. Regem 47, which was one of the decisions approved in Piperno v. The Queen. Had this ground alone been raised it would, in my opinion, require the setting aside of the verdict; and consequently I do not find it necessary to consider the related grounds numbers 8 and 9.\nGround 3.\nI will deal next with ground No. 3. What is here complained of is not that the learned trial judge failed to direct the jury in the manner required by the rule in Hodge's case but rather that, having properly instructed them as to how they should approach a case resting solely on circumstantial evidence, he mistakenly gave them to understand that the case against Coffin did not consist solely of circumstantial evidence, as, in fact, it clearly did. The passages which are chiefly objected to are as follows:\u2014\nIn the present case, the evidence which has been adduced by the Crown is of two distinctive kinds.\nThere is: 1) The circumstantial evidence which I have explained; and 2) The declarations which would have been made by the accused.\n* * *\nWe can say, I believe, that the evidence offered by the Crown can be divided in two kinds:\n1. Circumstantial evidence.\n2. Evidence of conversation or words spoken by the accused.\nIt is argued by counsel for the Attorney General that any harm done by these passages was remedied later in the charge and particular reference is made to the following passage:\u2014\nIt is evident that considering the whole of these facts, no direct proof can be found anywhere and it is precisely there where you are asked to extract from the circumstances the conclusions which, in your estimation, you must take as the result of these facts.\nIt should tie borne in mind, as was pointed out by Middleton J.A. in Rex v. Comba 48 and by some members of this Court in Boucher v. The Queen 49, that the rule in Hodge's case is quite distinct from the rule requiring a direction on the question of reasonable doubt; and if, on reading the charge as \u00e2 , I came to the conclusion that the jury were left in doubt as to whether the rule in Hodge's did not apply to all the evidence in the case before us I would have regarded this as serious error. When the charge is read as a whole I incline to the view that the jury were not misled in the way suggested; but, as on several other grounds I have concluded that there should be a new trial, I do not pursue this further. For the same reason I find it unnecessary to deal with grounds numbers 1, 2 and 10 and I express no opinion in regard to them.\nMr. Miquelon, while maintaining that there had been no error in law at the trial, argued, alternatively, that, even if we should be of opinion that any of the errors alleged by Coffin's counsel were made out, the legally admissible evidence was overwhelming and that, had such errors not occurred, the jury must inevitably have reached the same verdict; and that the Court should apply the provisions of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code and dismiss the appeal. That the Crown's case was a very strong one cannot be denied but I find myself unable to affirm with certainty that if none of the matters which I regard as errors had occurred the jury must necessarily have convicted. Reading the written record we cannot say to what extent each witness weighed with the jury or how much importance they attached to one or another of the items of evidence; and, to borrow the words of Viscount Sankey in Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions 50, it may well be that the hearsay evidence as. to Eagle's rifle or the effect which the jury were invited to give to the unlawful cross-examination of Marion Petrie may have been the last ounce which turned the scale against the accused. But the matter does not rest here. Section 1014 (2) reads as follows:\u2014\nThe court may also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\nThis sub-section has often been considered by this Court and its meaning is stated in the following passage in the judgment of Kerwin J., as he then was, in Schmidt v. The King 51:\nThe meaning of these words has been considered in this Court in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence had been improperly admitted. The principles therein set forth do not differ from the rules set forth in a recent decision of the House of Lords in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions, i.e., that the proviso that the Court of Appeal may dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation where a reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence properly admissible, without doubt convict.\nIt will be observed that, once error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred. The satisfaction of this onus is a condition precedent to the right of the Appellate Court to apply the terms of the sub-section at all. The Court is not bound to apply the sub-section merely because this onus is discharged. Even if the onus referred to could be regarded as having been satisfied by the Crown in the case before us it would nonetheless be my opinion that the error in law which I have dealt with under ground 4 above was so substantial a wrong that the verdict could not be saved by the application of s. 1014 (2). To hold otherwise would, I think, be contrary to the principles enunciated in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales 52, Allen v. The King 53, Northey v. The King 54 and the judgment of my brother Locke in Boucher v. The Queen 55.\nIn Makin's case at page 70 Lord Herschell L.C. said in dealing with; a provision similar to s. 1014 (2):\u2014\nTheir Lordships do not think it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the. judge to consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to them.\nIn their Lordships' opinion substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the Court founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence. It need scarcely be said that there is ample scope for the operation of the proviso without applying it in the manner contended for.\nThis passage is I think applicable to the case before us.\nWhat I have said as to s. 1014 (2) has been related primarily to the grounds other than grounds numbers G and 7. As to ground 6 the passages which I have quoted from the reasons of Sloan C.J. seem to me to show that the conviction must be set aside on this ground even if the Court should be of the view that there was in fact neither substantial; wrong nor miscarriage of justice because one of the main grounds of the decision of Sloan C.J. rests on : the importance of justice being not merely done in fact but being plainly seen to be done.\nAs to ground 7, I think that the error which occurred is such that by its very nature it cannot be cured by the application of s. 1014 (2).\nIn the result, if leave to appeal had been granted on those grounds advanced on the application for leave to appeal with which I have dealt above, it would have been my opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nFauteux J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Kellock, my answer to the question referred to the Court is that I would have dismissed the appeal.\nSolicitor for the accused: F. de B.

The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 252\nDate: 1956-01-24\nGeorge Ross Davidson Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\n1955: October 6; 1956: January 24.\nPresent: Rand, Kellock, Locke, Fautoux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPension\u2014Whether appellant entitled to benefits of Part V of the Militia Pension Act, S. of C. 1946, c. 59.\nSection 43 of the Militia Pension Act (S. of C. 1946, c. 59), provides that Part V therein \"applies to every member of the forces (a) who was not a member \u2026 on March 31, 1946, and who was or is appointed to or enlisted in \u2026 after the said day\" or (b) \"who was appointed to or enlisted in \u2026 on or before the said day and was still in the forces on the said day and who elects to become a contributor \u2026 on or before March 31, 1948\".\nHeld (affirming the judgment appealed from): That the appellant, who served in the forces from 1935 to July 20, 1946, and who made his election in 1947, was not entitled to the benefits of Part V of the Act.\nPer Rand, Kellock, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.; March 31, 1946, is specified as the day upon which a claimant was either not then in the forces, never having been in, but who joined subsequently, or as having enlisted on or before that day, and if before, then as having been still in on that day. Per Locke J.: Para. (a) refers to members who were appointed or enlisted after March 31, 1946, whether or not they had, prior to that date, been members whose services had terminated, and para. (b) refers to those who were appointed or enlisted prior to March 31, 1946, were in the forces as of .that date and were members when the amendment became effective. To construe the section otherwise would make it and the Part retrospective, an interpretation which is not warranted.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Cameron J., holding that the appellant was not entitled to the benefits of Part V of the Militia Pension Act.\nG. E. Beament, Q.C. and S. A. Gillies for the appellant.\nK. E. Eaton and R. W. McKimm for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKellock J.:\u2014The appellant, who served in the armed forces from the 13th of June, 1935, to the 20th day of July, 1946, on which date he was retired on medical grounds, claims to be entitled to the benefits provided for by Part V of The Militia Pension Act enacted on the 31st of August, 1946. As to whether he is so entitled depends, in the first instance, upon a proper construction of s. 43, which is as follows:\n43. This Part applies to every member of the forces\n(a) who was not a member of the forces on the thirty-first day of March, 1946, and who was or is appointed to or enlisted in the forces after the said day, or\n(b) who was appointed to or enlisted in the forces on or before the said day and was still in the forces on the said day and who elects to become a contributor under this Part on or before the thirty-first day of March, 1948.\nS. 42(1) (f), speaking in the present, defines \"member of the forces\" (unless the context otherwise requires) \"as any officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer or man of the forces, excluding an officer appointed temporarily or under a commission for a fixed term.\"\nIt is the contention of the Crown, and this was given effect to in the court below, that as the appellant was not a member of the forces at the date of the passing of the Act, he is not entitled to claim under it. For the appellant, it is contended that it is sufficient that he was a member on the 31st day of March, 1946. Appellant contends that if the words \"every member of the forces\" in the opening line of the section are construed as meaning \"every member of the forces on or after the effective date of this Part\", then the phrase \"and was still in the forces on the said day\" (i.e., March 31, 1946) is superfluous, whereas if no such qualification is implied in the quoted words in the first line, the quoted words from para. (b) are meaningful as defining a class by reference to circumstances antecedent to the date upon which Part V came into force. It is also contended that even if the quoted words in para. (b) are not to be considered as superfluous, the word \"still\" indicates the continuance of the condition of being in the forces existing prior to March 31, 1946, in contrast to a future continuance beyond that day, and indicates that any continuance beyond that day is not a requirement of the statute.\nI am unable to accept these contentions. Para. (a), which deals with persons who are compulsorily subject to Part V, is, of course, by itself, entirely unambiguous. It specifies a person who enters the forces after March 31, 1946, not having been in the forces on that day, and is not concerned with whether or not such person was or was not a member of the forces prior to that day. Apart from para. (b), therefore, this paragraph would include an officer who was in the forces both before and after the day specified, so long as he was not a member on that day.\nPara. (b), however, which deals with persons who may be subject to Part V if they elect to do so, refers specifically to a person who was in the forces prior to the day named. Para. (a), therefore, must be taken as dealing only with persons who entered the forces after that day.\nIn this view it cannot be said that the words \"and was still in the forces on the said day\" are surplusage, or otherwise, a person who was a member of the forces before the day mentioned but was not a member on that day, would be included. This is clearly contrary to the intention of the statute as the very words said to be superfluous require that such a person must have continued a member down to and including the named day. These words, of course, have no function with respect to one who entered the forces on the named day. The clear intention of both paragraphs read together, in my view, is to specify the 31st day of March, 1946, as the day upon which the person claiming was either not then in the forces, never having been in the forces, but who joined subsequently, or as having enlisted \"on or before the said day\", and if before, then as having been \"still in the forces on the said day\".\nThere is nothing, therefore, to exclude the operation of the words in the first line of the section in that, whether para. (a) or (b) applies, the person in question must be a \"member of the forces\" in order that Part V may have any application to him. Accordingly, as the appellant did not qualify at the time he sought to elect, he was not entitled to do so. In this view it is not necessary to consider the other points argued.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J.:\u2014The facts, in so far as they affect the claim advanced by the appellant, are stated in the judgment from which this appeal is taken.\nPart V of the Militia Pension Act (c. 133, R.S.C. 1927) is stated by s. 43 to apply to every member of the Forces. The appellant was not a member of the Forces on August 31, 1946, when the amendment came into force.\nS. 44 provides that every person to whom Part V applies shall, by reservation from his pay and allowances, contribute to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The word \"contributor\" is defined by s. 42 to mean a member of the Forces who contributes under the Part to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The appellant was not and could not at any time become a contributor since he was not a member of the Forces on August 31, 1946, or thereafter.\nThese considerations, in my opinion, are sufficient to make it clear that para. (a) of s. 43 refers to members of the Forces who were appointed or enlisted after March 31, 1946, whether or not they had, prior to that date, been members of the Forces whose services had terminated, and that para. (b) refers to those who were appointed or enlisted prior to March 31, 1946, were in the Forces as of that date and were members when the amendment became effective. None of the language of the latter paragraph appears to me to be superfluous. I respectfully agree with Mr. Justice Cameron that to construe s. 43 otherwise would be to interpret the section and the Part retrospectively. I see no warrant for any such interpretation.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beament, Fyfe & Ault.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. P. Varcoe.\n",

Leave to appeal to this Court in forma pauperis should, therefore, be refused (Benson v. Harrison [1952] 2 S.C.R. 333 applied).\nMOTION by the applicant before Mr. Justice Abbott in Chambers for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.\nS. J. Gorman for the motion.\nR. K. Laishley, Q.C. contra.\nAbbott J.:\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The affidavit of the applicant made under Rule 142 sets out that he is \"not worth five hundred dollars in the world excepting my wearing apparel and my interest in the said matter of the intended appeal\" and that he has debts amounting to $2,003, of which approximately one-half represent unpaid medical bills arising out of his injury and the other half a loan from a relative to cover costs of the litigation in the courts below.\nThe applicant was examined on his affidavit and from this examination it appears that he is a locomotive engineer, twenty-eight years of age, employed by the Canadian Pacific Railway with ten years' seniority. He is unmarried, lives at home with his parents and two unmarried sisters, the two latter, with himself, contributing to the expenses of running the house. He earns about $3,600 a year and testified that these earnings would probably be increased in the near future under the operation of the seniority system in force in the railway. He has no debts or liabilities other than those set out in his affidavit, is contributing about $70 to $75 a month to the expenses of the family home, and during the past year has been paying off about $100 a month on account of obligations incurred, largely arising out of this litigation. He has insurance policies on his life of a face value of $5,000 and with a present cash surrender value of approximately $450.\nThe onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that he is not worth $500, the amount fixed by the rule, and as to the test to be applied in determining this question, I am in agreement with the view expressed by my brother Rand in Benson v. Harrison 1 when he said:\u2014\nIn determining that question, the matter should, I think, be approached, not as an inquiry whether the person has actually $500 worth of property, but whether, in the ordinary business judgment, it can be said that he is good for $500. That was the view taken by Buckley L.J. in Kydd v. The Watch Committee of Liverpool 24 T.L.R. 257.\nApplying this test to the present case, the applicant has failed to satisfy me that he is not worth the amount fixed by the rule.\nThe application is therefore dismissed but without costs.\nLeave refused.\n1 [1952] 2 S.C.R. 333 at 334.\n",

Fortier, [1956] S.C.R. 258\nDate: 1956-02-10\nLa Compagnie de Transport Provincial (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nClement Fortier (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1955: November 17; 1956: February 10.\nPresent: Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nDamages\u2014Assault committed by bus driver on disembarked passenger\u2014Whether driver in the performance of his work\u2014Whether employer ratified action of driver\u2014Whether employer liable\u2014Article 1054 C.C.\nThe respondent and a companion boarded the appellant's bus at Montreal. Both were under the influence of alcoholic liquors. During the voyage, they spoke almost continuously in loud voices, making insulting remarks about the driver who did not speak to them during that time. At Ste-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, the destination of the bus, all the passengers disembarked, including the respondent and his companion who were the last to do so. They crossed in front of the bus and were half-way between the left side of the bus and the opppsite sidewalk when they were violently assaulted from behind by the driver.\nThe respondent sued the driver and the appellant for damages. The action was maintained jointly and severally against both defendants by the trial judge. This judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The driver did not appeal in the Court of Appeal nor in this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nThere was nothing in the alternative plea of the appellant which constituted an approbation or ratification of the action of its employee, the driver (Roy v. City of Thetford Mines [1954] S.C.R. 395 applied).\nA delict caused \"a l'occasion des fonctions\" is a delict caused \"pendant le temps des fonctions\" and, consequently, is not the one contemplated by Art. 1054 C.C. where the responsibility of the master is engaged by a delict caused in \"the performance of the work for which the servant is employed\". The assault here was committed when the voyage had terminated and the contract with the passengers had come to an end. The appellant was at that time relieved of its duties towards the passengers. There was no relation between the work and the assault. The relations between the passengers and the driver were purely personal and foreign to the driver's functions. The latter was not, therefore, within Art. 1054 C.C.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming, Barclay and McDougall JJ.A. dissenting, the judgment at trial in an action for assault. J. L. O'Brien, Q.C. and E. E. Saunders for the appellant.\nJ. Fortier, Q.C. and C. L. de Martigny, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nTaschereau J.:\u2014L'appelante est une compagnie de transport, propri\u00e9taire d'autobus, faisant le service dans divers endroits de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et entre autres de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Ste-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, dans le comt\u00e9 de Terre-bonne. Le 16 juillet 1947, l'intim\u00e9, accompagn\u00e9 d'un nomm\u00e9 Parent, \u00e9tait passager \u00e0 bord de l'un de ces autobus en destination de Ste-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, et conduit par un nomm\u00e9 Coulombe. Rendu au point d'arriv\u00e9e, alors qu'il \u00e9tait descendu du v\u00e9hicule, l'intim\u00e9 fut violemment assailli par le chauffeur et subit de s\u00e9rieuses l\u00e9sions corporelles.\nIl institua des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires contre Coulombe et la compagnie appelante leur r\u00e9clamant des dommages, et l'honorable Juge Brassard devant qui la cause fut entendue \u00e0 St-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, a maintenu l'action contre les deux d\u00e9fendeurs, conjointement et solidairement, pour la somme de $3,667.05 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens. La Cour du Banc de la Reine 2 a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement, MM. les Juges Barclay et McDougall \u00e9tant dissidents. Ces derniers auraient maintenu l'appel et rejet\u00e9 l'action. Seule la compagnie de transport a interjet\u00e9 appel devant cette Cour.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 que l'appellante doit \u00eatre tenue responsable des actes de son employ\u00e9 parce qu'en premier lieu, l'appelante, en prenant fait et cause dans son plaidoyer pour le conducteur, aurait engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9, et en second lieu, parce que Coulombe, au moment o\u00f9 il a commis l'assaut qui lui est reproch\u00e9, \u00e9tait dans l'exercice des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9.\nJe ne vois rien dans le plaidoyer qui puisse constituer une approbation ou une ratification de l'acte pos\u00e9 par Coulombe. Le plaidoyer \u00e9crit se r\u00e9sume \u00e0 dire que Coulombe dans les circonstances n'a pas commis de d\u00e9lit ou de quasi-d\u00e9lit, et alternativement, l'appelante all\u00e8gue que si une faute \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 commise, elle ne peut en supporter les cons\u00e9quences, car Coulombe, au moment o\u00f9 il aurait commis l'assaut, n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'exercice de ses fonctions. Un cas semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment soumis \u00e0 cette Cour dans une cause de Roy v. La Cit\u00e9 de Thetford Mines 3, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un plaidoyer alternatif comme celui dont nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence, ne constitue nullement une ratification des actes d'un employ\u00e9. Les principes expos\u00e9s 'dans la cause ci-dessus doivent donc sur ce point nous guider dans la d\u00e9termination de la pr\u00e9sente.\nLe second point invoqu\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s plus s\u00e9rieuses. Coulombe, quand il a assailli l'intim\u00e9, \u00e9tait-il dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9? Il faut tout d'abord bien se garder de confondre les expressions \"\u00e0 l'occasion des fonctions\" et \"dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\". Dans le premier cas, il n'y a aucun rapport entre la faute et la fonction du service, aucun lien qui rattache cette. faute \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du mandat confi\u00e9 au pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. (Eaton v. Moore 4). Le d\u00e9lit caus\u00e9 \"\u00e0 l'occasion des fonctions\" est un d\u00e9lit caus\u00e9 \"pendant le temps des fonctions\", (Moreau v. Labelle 5) et, en cons\u00e9quence, n'est pas celui envisag\u00e9 par l'article 1054 qui exige, pour qu'il y ait responsabilit\u00e9 du patron, un d\u00e9lit caus\u00e9 \"dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\". Mazeaud (Vol. 1, 4e \u00e9d. pages 840 et 841) illustre ce principe de quelques exemples concrets:\u2014\nAu contraire, il n'y a aucun lien entre la fonction du conducteur d'une camionnette, charg\u00e9 de transporter des journaux, et le fait, par ce conducteur, apr\u00e8s avoir arr\u00eat\u00e9 sa voiture au bord de la route, de tuer un faisan aper\u00e7u dans un champ voisin: m\u00eame dans la th\u00e9orie extensive, le commettant ne peut \u00eatre tenu des cons\u00e9quences civiles du d\u00e9lit de chasse ainsi commis.\nPas plus que le patron d'un caf\u00e9 n\u00e9 doit r\u00e9pondre de l'incendie allum\u00e9 par l'un des ses gar\u00e7ons en jetant un p\u00e9tard, alors qu'il revenait de faire une course.\nLe commettant n'a pas non plus \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre des cons\u00e9quences d'une rixe survenue entre le chauffeur et un cycliste, m\u00eame si la discussion a pour origine la mani\u00e8re dont le chauffeur a doubl\u00e9 le cycliste.\nPour une raison identique, on ne saurait rendre le commettant responsable du d\u00e9lit d'outrage public \u00e0 la pudeur commis par un chauffeur dans la voiture de son patron, bien que la personne avec .laquelle le d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis ait \u00e9t\u00e9 recontr\u00e9e sur la route.\nIl n'y a pas de lien non plus entre les fonctions d'une infirmi\u00e8re en chef et le d\u00e9tournement de sommes qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es volontairement par des infirmi\u00e8res; le commettant de l'infirmi\u00e8re en chef n'est donc pas responsable en vertu de l'article 1384, par. 3. On refusera \u00e9galement d'engager, en vertu de l'article 1384, par. 3, la responsabilit\u00e9 du fermier dont le domestique se rend coupable d'un incendie volontaire; celle d'un patron dont l'employ\u00e9, charg\u00e9 de surveiller l'ex\u00e9cution de travaux, se fait donner une le\u00e7on de conduite par l'entrepreneur charg\u00e9 d'effectuer ces travaux.\nDans le m\u00eame volume, \u00e0 la page 835, Mazeaud dit \u00e9galement ce qui suit:\u2014\nSi l'on consulte les travaux pr\u00e9paratoires du Code civil, l'h\u00e9sitation n'est pas permise. D\u00e8s que le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 non plus \"dans l'exercice des fonctions\", mais seulement \"\u00e0 l'occasion des fonctions\", le commettant ne doit pas \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 responsable.\nEn France, tous les auteurs ne partagent pas ces vues de Mazeaud et plusieurs soutiennent que la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'employeur est engag\u00e9e, du moment que le d\u00e9lit ou le quasi-d\u00e9lit de l'employ\u00e9 est commis \"\u00e0 l'occasion du travail\". Mais je crois que la v\u00e9ritable doctrine est celle de Mazeaud et qu'elle est plus conforme au texte de l'article 1054 et de l'enseignement de la. jurisprudence dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 par cette Cour dans la cause de Eaton v. Moore (supra). D'ailleurs, dans cette cause, la Cour ne faisait que rappeler ce qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit \u00e0 maintes reprises. Ainsi, dans Curley v. Latreille 6, voici ce que disait M. le Juge Mignault:\u2014\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l'interpr\u00e9tation stricte s'impose en cette mati\u00e8re, je ne puis me convaincre que le texte de notre article nous autorise \u00e0 accueillir toutes les solutions que je viens d'indiquer. Ainsi, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le ma\u00eetre et le commettant sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l'ex\u00e9cution des jonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s, ou, pour citer la version anglaise de l'article 1054 C.C., in the performance of the work for which they are employed: Ceci me para\u00eet clairement exclure la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre pour un fait accompli par le domestique ou ouvrier \u00e0 l'occasion seulement de ses jonctions, si on ne peut dire que ce fait s'est produit dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. Il peut souvent \u00eatre difficile de d\u00e9terminer si le fait dommageable est accompli dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions ou seulement \u00e0 leur occasion, mais s'il appert r\u00e9ellement que ce fait n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions du domestique ou ouvrier, nous nous trouvons en dehors de notre texte. L'abus des fonctions, si le fait incrimin\u00e9 s'est produit dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ces fonctions, entre au contraire dans ce texte et entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre.\nDans The Governor and Company of Gentlemen Adventurers of England v. Vaillancourt 7, Sir Lyman Duff s'exprimait dans l'es termes suivants:\u2014\nLe fait dommageable must be something done in the execution of theservant's functions as servant or in the performance of his work as servant.If the thing done belongs to the kind of work which the servant is employedto perform or the class of things falling within l'ex\u00e9cution des jonctions, then by the plain words of the text responsibility rests upon the employer.Whether that is so or not in a particular case must, I think, always be in substance a question of fact, and although in cases lying near the border line decisions on analogous states of fact, may be valuable as illustrations, it is not, I think, the rule itself being clear, a proper use of authority to refer to such decisions for the purpose of narrowing or enlarging the limits of the rule.\nEt plus loin, \u00e0 la m\u00eame page, il ajoutait:\u2014\nIn France the doctrine has been widely accepted and has more than once been affirmed by the highest tribunal that the employer is responsible for acts done by his employee \u00e0 l'occasion of his service. It cannot be insisted upon too strongly that an act done by an employee \u00e0 l'occasion of his service may or may not be one for which the employer is responsible under Article 1054 C.C., depending in every case upon the answer to the question: \"Was the act done, in the execution of the employee's service or in the performance of the work for which he was employed?\"\nDans Moreau v. Labelle (supra) \u00e0 la page 210, M. le Juge Rinfret disait:\u2014\nIls font sentir d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s nette l'erreur qui assimilerait au d\u00e9lit commis dans l'ex\u00e9cution des jonctions du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 le d\u00e9lit commis pendant le temps de ces fonctions.\nDans la cause qui nous est soumise, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la distinction qui doit \u00eatre faite. Sans doute, Coulombe \u00e9tait l'employ\u00e9 de la compagnie intim\u00e9e, et c'est \u00e0 lui qu'incombait la charge de conduire les passagers \u00e0 destination. Tant qu'il \u00e9tait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, la compagnie appelante. \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessairement responsable des d\u00e9lits ou q\u00fbasi-d\u00e9lits dont il pouvait \u00eatre l'auteur. M\u00eame s'il abusait de ses fonctions, il existait quand m\u00eame un lien de droit entrera victime de son d\u00e9lit et l'employeur dont il \u00e9tait au service. (Curley v. Latreille, supra, page 175).\nIci, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'\u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, au point de d\u00e9part, apr\u00e8s une assez longue h\u00e9sitation, le conducteur Coulombe, parce que l'intim\u00e9 et son compagnon Parent semblaient en \u00e9tat d'ivresse, consentit finalement, apr\u00e8s un refus, \u00e0 les accepter \u00e0 bord de l'autobus. Au cours du trajet, ces derniers, assis pr\u00e8s du chauffeur, ne cess\u00e8rent de l'invectiver, de parler \u00e0 haute voix, et certainement de cr\u00e9er une atmosph\u00e8re de querelle. Coulombe supporta le tout avec patience, mais rendu \u00e0 Ste-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, au point de destination, quand l'intim\u00e9 et son compagnon furent descendus le l'autobus, pour prendre un autre moyen de transport pour se rendre \u00e0 St-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Coulombe les suivit et les assaillit violemment. Cet assaut pour lequel Coulombe, avec raison, a \u00e9t\u00e9 personnellement tenu responsable par les tribunaux civils, a cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 commis alors que le voyage \u00e9tait termin\u00e9, P et que le contrat vis-\u00e0-vis les passagers avait pris fin. La compagnie \u00e9tait lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de ses devoirs, et les obligations de cette derni\u00e8re envers ceux-l\u00e0 \u00e9taient remplies. Les querelles des employ\u00e9s avec les passagers devenaient des affaires personnelles, qui ne regardaient pas l'employeur. Sans doute, Coulombe a commis cet acte r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible \"durant les heures de travail\", mais \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 il n'y avait aucune relation entre son travail, et l'acte qu'il a pos\u00e9. Rien ne peut nous justifier de dire qu'il existe un lien entre ses fonctions et l'assaut qu'il a commis. Entre lui et la victime, une fois rendus \u00e0 destination, seules des relations personnelles entre deux individus, \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux fonctions de l'employ\u00e9, \u00e9taient en cause. Le chauffeur n'\u00e9tait plus dans l'exercice de ses fonctions au sens de l'article 1054 (Code Civil). Il a agi en dehors du cadre qui limite ses activit\u00e9s vis-\u00e0-vis les clients de son employeur, et ce dernier ne peut donc \u00eatre tenu responsable des dommages subis par l'intim\u00e9.\nJe m'accorde avec Messieurs les Judges Barclay et McDougall de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, et je maintiendrais l'appel, et rejetterais l'action, avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St-Germain & Renaud.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

City of Halifax, [1956] SCR 264\nDate: 1956-01-24\nLord Nelson Hotel Company Limited\nAppellant;\nAnd\nThe City of Halifax\nRespondent.\n1955: Nov. 10, 11; 1956: Jan. 24.\nPresent: Rand, Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA\nIN BANCO\nTaxation\u2014Assessment, municipal\u2014Hotel\u2014Whether assessment as hotel or lodging-house\u2014Transient and permanent guests\u2014Portion of building rented to tenants\u2014Ss. 357 and 375(B) of the Halifax City Charter.\nThe appellant, who operates a hotel in Halifax, was assessed for business tax under s. 357 of the city charter for the whole building less a portion rented to tenants. There were 25 permanent guests residing therein and occupying 15% of the bedroom area. These received the same facilities and services as transient guests, although some had their own furniture. The appellant contends that it should have been assessed under s. 375(B) of the charter since its entire business was within its description, and alternatively that the rooms of the permanent guests should have been excepted.\nBy s. 357, a business tax is payable by the occupier of a real property for the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for purposes of gain, ... and is payable by such occupier, whether as owner, tenant or otherwise, and whether assessed as owner of such property for real property tax or not.\nS. 375(B) deals with an occupier conducting the business of \"a lodging-house or rooming-house or renting rooms for living purposes or for sleeping purposes only or who is engaged in the business of providing meals for gain in such real property and who has in any one building,. . . during the civic year ...provided accommodation for five or more lodgers, roomers, or boarders\". The resulting tax under the latter section is less than under s. 357.\nThe appeal from the assessment was dismissed by the Court of Tax Appeals and by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kellock, Locke and Abbott JJ.: The business of the appellant was not that of a lodging-house or rooming-house, but in so far as the words \"renting rooms for living purposes or sleeping purposes or providing meals for gain\" are concerned, they describe one of the functions of a hotel, and, therefore, of the appellant.\nThe statute is to be applied distributively. It contemplates that if any part of a building is not occupied for one or other of these purposes, such part would fall outside the section.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): The language of s. 375(B) excludes the appellant's business. The appellant neither keeps a lodging-house nor conducts the business of a rooming-house nor is it the keeper of either kind of house. The words \"or who is engaged in the business of providing meals for gain in such real property\" cannot be taken independently. They do not describe a restaurant. They refer back to the real property occupied by a person carrying on the business of lodging-house or rooming-house.\nExcept as to the rented portions, the appellant was in possession of the entire building and, therefore, within s. 357.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], affirming the appellant's assessment for business tax under s. 357 of the Charter of the City of Halifax.\nI. M. MacKeigan, Q.C. for the appellant.\nC. P. Bethune, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by:\u2014\nRAND J.:\u2014This appeal is against the assessment of the business carried on by the appellant in the City of Halifax. The main contention is that the assessment should have been made under s. 375B of the city charter; a subsidiary claim is that if properly made under s. 357 it should have excepted the general bedroom space of the hotel as occupied for residential purposes and the rooms of permanent guests as being in their possession.\nThe only qualification of ordinary hotel activities here is the presence of these special guests. They reside in the hotel and are charged a weekly or monthly rate. A number of them are winter residents only but the remainder live there the Year round. They receive substantially the same facilities and services as transient guests, though a number have brought furnishings of their own with them. Of a total of 17Q rooms the permanent guests occupy 25, about 15% of the total bedroom area.\nThe two sections of the charter read as follows:\n357 (1) The Business Tax shall be a tax payable by every occupier of any real property for the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for purposes of gain, except such as is exempt as is herein provided, and shall be payable by such occupier, whether as owner, tenant or otherwise, and whether assessed as owner of such property for real property tax or not.\n(2) (a) Except as in this section hereinafter provided such tax shall be at the rate fixed as hereinafter provided by sub-section 3 of section 409, on fifty per cent of the value of the premises so occupied, except in the case of premises the value of which is less than two thousand dollars and occupied solely for the purpose of selling merchandise by retail, in respect to which the tax shall be at the said rate on twenty-five per cent of the value of the premises so occupied.\n(3) The occupant of any real property for any purpose other than for the purpose of any trade, calling or profession, or other calling carried On for purposes of gain, and not for residential purposes and not otherwise exempted, shall be liable to a tax and such tax shall be at the rate fixed as hereinafter provided on 25 per cent of the value of the premises so occupied.\n375B (1) Any person occupying real property whether or not such person resides therein in which such person conducts the business of a lodging-house or rooming-house or renting rooms for living purposes or for sleeping purposes only or, who is engaged in the business of providing meals for gain in such real property and who has in any one building, at any time during the civic year in which the assessment is being made, provided accommodation for five or more lodgers, roomers, or boarders, shall be liable to pay a Business Tax on twenty-five per cent of the total value of such real property at the rate then current in respect of real property of a business character or nature, in place of fifty per cent of the value of the premises occupied, as provided in sub-section (2) of section 357, and a Household Tax at the rate hereinafter provided for such tax on ten per of the remaining seventy-five per cent of such\nvalue.\n(2) Where any person occupies real property, whether or not such person resides therein, and such real property is divided and let out by such person' for living purposes but the occupants of more than one of the portions into which the said, real property is let out use in common a bathroom or other sanitary facilities, such person shall be deemed to be conducting the business of a lodging-house or rooming-house in such real property and the persons occupying the said portions of such real property shall for the purpose of this Section be deemed, to be lodgers or roomers.\nIt seems to have been assumed by MacDonald J. in the court below that the contention of the application of s. 375B , was based on the occupancy of the special guests, but that was disclaimed on the argument before us; it is rather that the entire business carried on by the appellant is within the description of that section and alternatively as already mentioned.\nI am unable to entertain any doubt upon either of these propositions. S. 375B is, in my opinion, an exception to s. 357 and the ordinary rule of interpretation is that one claiming under an exception must show that he is clearly within it. So far from that being so here, an examination of the language satisfies me that the section clearly excludes the company.\nThe person who comes, within s. 375B is an occupant of real property who \"conducts the business of a lodging-house, etc.\" The words \"lodging-house\" and \"lodger\" are of current and long established meaning. Both are examined in the Encyclopedia of the Laws of England, vol. 8, pp. 385-395; and in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 2nd ed., vol. 2, pp. 1190 to 1192: and Black's Law Dictionary, 4th ed., deals with them at p. 1091. From the authorities, cited by these works it is clear that, in its plain and ordinary meaning and although in any case there may be various incidental features annexed, \"lodging-house\" signifies a house containing furnished rooms which are privately let out by the week or month. In the complementary sense a lodger is a qualified occupier of a room so let in a house of and over the whole of which the owner or proprietor retains possession, dominion and control. The interest of the lodger is in the exclusive enjoyment, that of the owner in the control. The situation of a transient guest in a hotel resembles that of the lodger in the respect that the proprietor retains an underlying control and the guest a qualified possession; to that extent there is a minimum of apparent identical use of the property; but, as will appear, even that identity is not complete. Lodging-houses, rooming-houses and the renting of rooms for sleeping purposes ordinarily furnish modest and relatively cheap living quarters; and when meals are served in connection with the lodging there is the unmistakable category to which the word \"boarder\" in the section harks back. One who should describe the Lord Nelson. Hotel as a \"lodging-house\" or \"rooming-house\" or as in the business of providing meals for \"lodgers, boarders or roomers\" in the context of the section would not be speaking in the vernacular of Canadians generally. Lodging-houses in most cases are undoubtedly maintained on a high level of care and cleanliness, but that does not qualify their main function as being to furnish more or less permanent accommodation to persons of moderate means. This, at one extreme, is illustrated by the fact that as to sanitary and other features \"lodging-houses\" at seaports are specifically subject to s. 214 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 (Imp.), c. 60; and that by 34-35 Vic., c. 112, s. 10 (Imp.), the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, the harbouring of thieves by a keeper of a lodging-house is punishable on summary conviction.\nThe characteristic differences between a hotel and a lodging-house are many and significant. An inn is bound by law, to the extent of its means, to receive as guests and to furnish lodging and food to all travellers; the innkeeper is, at common law, an insurer of the property carried by guests; that property is not liable to distress by a superior landlord: the innkeeper has a lien on goods and effects brought by the guest even though they may be stolen; if a guest ceases to be a traveller, the innkeeper may turn him out after reasonable notice: a guest has no contractual right to a particular room and, for good cause, he may be transferred. These incidents are dealt with in Halsbury (2nd ed.) vol. 18, pp. 144, 145, and Bullen on Distress (2nd ed.) p. 110. The lodging-house keeper has no such obligations; his lodgers or roomers, as licensees, are selected and, subject to contractual terms and, strictly at law, may, at any time, be ejected; his liability for their property is not that of an insurer; at common law he has no lien on the goods or effects of the lodger, and the latter were subject to distress by a superior landlord although by R.S.N.S. (1954), c. 287, s. 15 certain relief is now given. The unquestioned distinction between various modes of accommodation in the way of lodging and food is exemplified by the Innkeepers Act, R.S.N.S. (1954), c. 129, s. 2(6) where it speaks of \"innkeeper, boarding-house keeper, lodging-house keeper\" which puts beyond serious controversy their disparate classification by the legislature. In the Halifax charter itself, the distinction is made: s. 724 dealing with building restrictions and specifications defines \"lodging-house\" for those particular purposes as \"a building in which persons are accommodated with sleeping apartments, and includes hotels and apartment houses in which cooking is not done in the general apartments.\"\nIt is argued that the sentence in the section \"or who is engaged in the business of providing meals for gain in such real property\" is to be taken as independent of and so detached from what has gone before that it extends the section to a restaurant. I think this would be an extraordinary circumlocution by which to describe a restaurant. The phrase \"such real property\" refers back to real property occupied by a person carrying on a business described; and its expansion to include restaurant keepers seems to be a conclusive demonstration of the error of such a construction.\nThe essence of the appellant's case is that we must look inside the concept of \"the business of a lodging-house\"\u2014and similarly of the others\u2014to the element of \"lodging\" in its purely functional form: the hotel does give \"lodging\". But the section does not deal with lodging or the renting of rooms in that sense; it describes certain self-contained businesses; and the simple and testing question is whether the appellant; can properly, in ordinary parlance, be said to conduct any such business or can be called a lodging-house keeper or, rooming-house keeper. It seems to me that the answer is almost self-evident: the company neither keeps a lodging-house nor conducts the business of a rooming-house nor is it the keeper of either kind of house. The defect of the contention lies in the confusion of functional uses with business entireties.\nThese views furnish an answer likewise to the second ground. The company is, in law, except as to certain portions rented, in underlying possession of the entire building that being so the assessment comes squarely within s. 357.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe juldgment of Kellock, Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\nKellocx J.:\u2014This appeal involves the interpretation of s-s. (1) of s. 375(B) of the Halifax City Charter, which provides for payment of a business tax on twenty-five per cent of the total value of real property in which the person \"occupying\" conducts the business of \"a lodging-house or rooming-house or renting rooms for living purposes or for sleeping purposes only or who is engaged in the business of providing meals for gain in such real property and who has in any one building, at any time during the civic year in which the assessment is being made, provided accommodation for five or more lodgers, roomers, or boarders.\" Unless this section applies the appellant would fall within s. 357, under which it has been assessed.\nIn the construction of this statute it is relevant to refer to what was said by Viscount Simon in Canadian Eagle Oil Company, Limited v. The King[2], as follows:\nIn the words of the late Rowlatt J., \"... in a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. one can only look fairly at the language used.\"\nThe italics are mine. As, however, s. 375(B) is to be regarded as an exception to the provisions of s.` 357, it is also relevant to point out, as stated by Cohen L.J., as he then was, in Littman v. Baron[3], that\n. . . the principle that in case of ambiguity a taxing statute should be construed in favour of a taxpayer does not apply to a provision giving a taxpayer relief in certain cases from a section clearly, imposing liability.\nWhere the excepting provision is clear, however, the ordinary principle referred to by Viscount Simon applies.\nIn construing s. 375(B) I agree with the court below that merely because some of the guests of the appellant may have taken on the character of \"lodgers\", the appellant is not thereby brought within the meaning of \"lodging-house\" or \"rooming-house\" as those words are to be understood in this statute. I do not think that in ordinary parlance a hotel would be understood to be either a \"rooming-house\" or a \"lodging-house\" or be referred to as such. Probably the main difference in ordinary understanding between a \"hotel\" and either a \"lodging-house\" or a \"rooming-house\" is that the former holds itself out as accepting all applying for accommodation while the latter do not. If, therefore, there were nothing more in the sub-section, the appellant would fail.\nHowever, that is not the case as the statute differentiates between businesses of the character mentioned and those of \"renting rooms for living purposes\" or \"for sleeping purposes\" or of \"providing meals for gain\". The question accordingly is whether these latter words, to which some effect must be given, include, in whole or in part, the business of the appellant which, as I have stated, is not that either of a \"lodging-house\" or a \"rooming-house\" within the meaning of the statute.\nThe respondent contends that the words \"renting rooms for living purposes\" are confined to rooms rented for the purposes of all the ordinary activities of living, including the getting of meals. I cannot accept this contention. In my opinion the business described by the statute would come within the fair meaning of these words whether the tenants do or do not prepare their own meals. \"Living\", in contradiction to \"sleeping only\" connotes merely something more than is comprised by the latter. In consideration of the question as to what businesses, other than that of a lodging- or rooming-house, are included within the language of the section, one must have in mind not only hotels of the class of the respondent which supply a varied number of services under the one roof, but also the smaller and humbler hostelries whose only services, apart from the sale of liquor, may be confined to the renting of rooms and the provision of meals. In many cases, the renting of rooms and the provision of meals are the only services furnished. This is also the case with the modern \"motel\"; many of whom do not, however, provide food. The motel is, of course, in direct competition with the hotel. In so far, therefore, as the words \"renting rooms for living purposes\" or \"for sleeping purposes\" are concerned, they clearly describe one of the functions of a hotel, and therefore of the appellant.\nAs to the words \"providing meals for gain\", it might; at first blush, appear, in the light of the presence in the section of the word \"boarders\", that they could be equated with \"boarding-house\", a term not normally applied to a hotel any more than the words \"lodging-house\" or \"rooming-house\".\nIt is significant, however, that the statute has not employed the word. Had this been the intention, it would have been very easy for the legislature to have so said, as it did in 1931 in c. 7 of the statutes of that year, by s. 3 of which provision is made for a lien in favour of every \"innkeeper\", \"boarding-house keeper\" and \"lodging-house keeper\" on the baggage of his \"guest\", \"boarder\" or \"lodger\" for the value or price of any food or accommodation furnished to him or on his account.\nAs the words \"boarding-house\" are not mentioned in the present statute, I do not think that the word \"boarder\", which is used, can be said to have been used to exclude its quite ordinary application to people who obtain meals at hotels as well as at private houses with some degree of regularity. In this view, the words \"providing meals for gain\" also apply to the appellant.\nIf it be the fact that any part of the appellant's premises are not occupied for one or other of the above purposes, it follows that such part or parts would fall outside the section. This is a situation which the statute expressly contemplates. By s. 379(A) the duty is imposed upon the assessor of determining, in the first instance, the character or nature of all real property which he proposes. to assess. S. 381 provides that if any real property occupied for either residential, business or other purposes, is a part only of a property which has been valued as an entirety for real property tax, the assessor shall determine the value of such part for the purposes of the residential, business or other occupation tax as the case may be in respect of the occupancy of such part. If, therefore, for example, the appellant were carrying on a. retail merchandising business in a part of the building otherwise occupied for the purposes of any of the businesses mentioned in s. 375(B), such part would require assessment under s. 357.\nNor do I think that the statute is to be interpreted as producing the effect that an occupier who carries on one or more of the specified businesses dealt with by s. 375(B) as well as other types of business in the same building, is, for that reason, to be classified as carrying on a business not named in the section with the result that the section ceases to apply to any part of the premises. In my opinion, the fair reading of the statute is that it is to be applied distributively so that such parts of a building occupied for the purposes of the kinds of businesses mentioned in s. 375(B) shall be assessed under the terms of that section and the remainder as may be otherwise provided for by the statute. I see no reason why a person carrying on the business of a rooming-house, who also provides meals for gain in the same premises, comes within s. 375(B) with respect to both businesses or what may be really one business, while if he also carries on in conjunction therewith the business of a retail gift shop, the sub-section would have no application to him at all.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be allowed and the matter referred back to the Court of Tax Appeals to be dealt with in accordance herewith. The appellant is entitled to its costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: I. M. MacKeigan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. P.

Estey J. died before the delivery of the judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA; APPELLATE DIVISION\nContract\u2014Agreement to build house\u2014Interpretation\u2014Evidence\u2014Rectification\u2014Substantial performance.\nThe appellant, who had some twenty years experience as a building contractor, signed a contract to build a house for the respondent. During the negotiations, prior to the signing, he had been supplied with a set of plans, which were later attached to the contract, supplying the data for finishing both the main floor and the basement of a one-storey building. The appellant testified that he quoted a price of $30,000 for the completion of the ground floor and basement and a price of $18,000 for the completion of the ground floor but only structural parts of the basement, and that the latter figure was agreed upon. The respondent denied that any other figure than $18,000 was ever mentioned.\nThe appellant claimed for a balance owing upon the contract and for a lien upon the land under the Mechanic's Lien Act. A claim for rectification of the contract was later made by the appellant. The defence was that the appellant had not completed the building as required by the agreement since, as admitted, the basement had not been finished. The trial judge rejected the claim for rectification, found that the contract had not been substantially performed and dismissed the action. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting) : The appeal should be allowed and a new . trial directed.\nPer Rand, Kellock and Abbott JJ.: The evidence, which the appellant attempted to make at the trial to support the case that it would have been absurd for an experienced contractor to have agreed to \"finish\" the entire building at the price of $18,000, that ambiguities and uncertainties in the plan demonstrated that the actual contract was for the finish of the ground floor and rough structural completion of the basement only, and which would also have shown the amount of money required to finish the basement, should not have been rejected by the trial judge. That rejection was not material nor warranted. The evidence might have had a decisive influence on the mind of the trial judge in coming to an opinion on the veracity of the appellant, particularly in view of the fact that the reasons for judgment give no indication that the anomalies and inconsistencies in the plan and the evidence were given serious consideration. There is no doubt that its rejection operated to the serious detriment of the case for the, appellant.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): As the evidence of the respondent and the witness Hoffman had been accepted by the trial judge and the Appellate Division, the claim for rectification failed. The proposed evidence which, it was claimed, had been rejected was not properly tendered (Perm v. Bibby (1866) L.R. 2 Ch. 137). As the appellant had deliberately refrained from arguing the question as to the rejection of the evidence raised by his notice of appeal in the Appellate Division and the matter had accordingly not been considered in that Court, the point should be treated as abandoned or waived (Hamelin v. Bannerman (1901) 31 S.C.R. 534; Attorney General of Canada v. Ritchie Contracting Co. (1915) 52 S.C.R. at 92).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming the dismissal of the action by the trial judge.\nM. J. A. Lambert for the appellant.\nJ. W. K. Shortreed for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal concerns a contract by which the appellant as contractor agreed to build a house for the respondent, the owner. Following preliminary discussions plans were prepared for the owner by a third person and the contractor was called in for a general examination of them with the owner and her stepson Hoffman who lived with her. Certain changes of a minor nature were made after which the contractor was furnished with a set on which to give a price. On their face they supply data for finishing both the main floor and the basement of a one-storey dwelling. The basement layout included bedrooms, bathroom, den, rumpus room, etc.\nLater, in submitting a price to the owner, the contractor says he mentioned two figures : one for the final completion of both ground floor and basement and the other for the completion of the ground floor but only structural parts\u2014 a rough finish\u2014of the basement. The former is said to have been $30,000 and the latter $18,000. In the result it was agreed that the latter amount should be the contract price, and the dispute is whether the house was to be completed in its entirety or to the modified extent mentioned.\nA written contract in simple form was drawn up which, generally, provided for the construction according to the plans, that the work should be prosecuted with diligence, and that payment would be made in three instalments of $4,000 each and a final instalment of $6,000 \"on completion of the building\". Clause 3 reads:\u2014\nThe contractor covenants that he will well and sufficiently execute and perform in a thorough and. workmanlike manner the erection and completion of the said building, and will purchase, use and obtain the best of materials and labour that may be available to him as may be necessary in connection with the construction of the said building, and in particular but without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Contractor agrees to use Number One materials throughout and to install standard double plumbing. \"and to furnish & install the items listed in Schedule 'A' hereto.\"\nSchedule \"A\" was as follows:\u2014\n1. Forced air furnace worth approximately $1,000.\n2. One-half inch oak floor throughout except in the kitchen and bathroom'.\n3. Rubber tile on floor of bathroom and kitchen. Plastic tile 4\u00bd feet in kitchen and bathroom walls.\n4. Colored toilet, bath and wash basin in bathroom and kitchen.\n5. Thermopane windows in living room, dining room, front bedroom.\n6. Asphalt red shingles on roof.\n7. Fireplace in living room.\n8. Mercury light switches throughout.\n9. Single garage.\nThe contract was signed on May 15, 1953 and the work was begun about that time. On November 23 the contractor presented a bill for the final instalment plus certain extras which are not disputed; on some excuse, he was told to return in a few days. Three days later he was informed that the work had not been completed according to the contract although he contends that no mention then was made of the omission to finish the basement. A mechanics' lien was thereupon filed and in January, 1954, these proceedings were brought.\nIn the course of the trial the plaintiff offered the evidence of an architect to support the case that it would have been utterly absurd for an experienced contractor such as the appellant to have agreed to \"finish\" in the manner indicated the entire dwelling at the price of $18,000 and that ambiguities and uncertainties in the plan, including items in Schedule \"A\", demonstrated the actual bargain between the parties to have been not for the finish of the two floors but the finish of the ground floor and rough structural completion of the basement. That evidence would have led not only to the comparison of any reasonable range of price for the one degree of completion as contrasted with the other, but also the amount of money which it would have taken to finish the basement. On the objection of counsel for the respondent the evidence was rejected, and the question which meets us at the outset is whether that rejection was, in the circumstances, material and warranted.\nIn considering that question, there are certain indisputable and significant facts which should be mentioned. It will be seen that section 3 provides that the contractor will install \"standard double plumbing\". That may or may not be intended to include fixtures but light is thrown on this by Schedule \"A\". In item 2 we find that a one-half inch oak floor is to be laid throughout except in the kitchen and bathroom. Item 3 speaks of the floor of \"bathroom and kitchen\" and \"kitchen and bathroom walls\". Item 4 specifies the type of \"bath and wash basin in bathroom and kitchen\". The bathroom fixtures were chosen by the respondent and only one set selected. In these circumstances it is obviously striking that the singular \"bathroom\" is used through the Schedule and that only one set of fixtures was selected. Its effect seems, in fact, to define \"standard double plumbing\" as meaning what the contractor contends: the installation of the pipe system exclusive of fixtures.\nThen, on the plan a four-inch concrete floor in the basement is specified. That, on its face, seems to me to exclude oak flooring which is claimed under the word in item 2 \"throughout\"; and no light is thrown on the method or practicality of placing oak over a concrete basement floor. In this aspect the word \"throughout\" in Schedule \"A\" is confined to the ground floor, as its ordinary signification in the context seems to indicate.\nA further item is of importance. The third instalment of $4,000 was to be paid \"when the building has been plastered\". A request for this payment was made shortly before or after the 1st of August but was refused on the ground that some of the work done was defective. This refusal was followed by a letter dated August 5 from solicitors of the contractor to the respondent which pointed out that by the terms of the contract she was \"to pay $4,000 when the building has been plastered\"; that Mr. Scharfenberg had informed them that \"the plastering was completed several weeks ago\"; and that \"We are writing to remind you of the terms of the contract into which you entered \u2026\"; and it asked; for immediate payment. Evidently the respondent then had some communication with the solicitors and on August 11 a further letter was written to the effect that the contractor was unwilling to consent to any variation of those terms. It was again pointed out that according to the agreement the $4,000 was to be paid \"when the building had been plastered\" and it reiterated the completion of the plastering. The stepson Hoffman in his evidence said that sometime in July or \"even in June\" he had spoken to; the contractor about the plastering and was told, \"don't you worry, I am. building the house\". In spite of all of this!, the payment was made shortly after the receipt of the letter of August 11.\nAnother such circumstance is that the wires running through the concrete walls of the basement which held the construction forms together were only in part clipped off and the remaining four or five inches left as they were. The significance of this is that according to the contractor cutting was discontinued when Hoffman indicated that he would like to have them left to be used later in finishing the walls of the basement. If that request was made, it would tell strongly against the contention that the contractor was to plaster the basement walls. Mr. Lambert urged that it would be quite unreasonable to assume that when the contractor had finished plastering the walls on the ground floor he would discontinue that work, complete the ground floor 'and then weeks later return to finish plastering in the basement. At least this item of plastering shows beyond question that from the early part of July the understanding of the contractor in this respect was clearly indicated to the owner.\nThere were also on the plans two descriptions that remain yet to be explained if the contract is as urged by the respondent. One corner of the basement is on the plan described as \"future rumpus room\". To give the adjective \"future\" any meaning at all it is that the finishing was not intended at that time. This is supported by the absence of any mention of the room on Schedule \"A\". Then an area is marked \"proposed bath\". How that description can be reconciled with complete finishing, including fixtures, remains to be shown. The appellant, although, he has been a contractor in Edmonton for about thirty years, has not, as his evidence indicates, such an acquaintance with the English language as gives him facility in its use; on the other hand, both the respondent and her stepson appear to be quite at home with it. Since the plan and Schedule \"A\" furnished the data not only for a final completion of both floors but also for that of the ground floor and the partial construction of the basement, it does not require much imagination to appreciate how the contractor could have fitted his understanding of what had been agreed to be done into the inclusion of the plan in the contract. If evidence had been admitted to show the extreme unlikelihood of a bargain to build for $18,000 a finished house such as claimed, then obviously it might have had a decisive influence on the mind of the trial judge in coming to an opinion on the veracity of the contractor, particularly in view of the fact that the reasons give no indication that the anomalies and inconsistencies which I have, in part, mentioned, were given serious consideration. The evidence tendered should, in my opinion, have been admitted and that its rejection might have operated to the serious detriment of the case for the contractor I have no doubt.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct a new trial. The appellant will be entitled to his disbursements of the appeal in this Court but otherwise there will be no costs in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The costs of the first trial will be in the discretion of the judge presiding at the rehearing\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant, by the Statement of Claim, alleged that the defendant was indebted to him for a balance owing upon a contract dated May 15, 1953, for the erection of a house in the City of Edmonton, and claimed a lien upon the land for such amount under the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act of Alberta.\nBy the Statement of Defence the respondent pleaded that the plaintiff had not completed the building, as required by the agreement, and, in addition, claimed that there had been various defects in certain of the work which had been done. Particulars of the work called for by the contract which had not been done and of the alleged defective work were furnished by the respondent on demand. The unfinished work related almost entirely to the; basement of the dwelling. Upon this defence the appellant joined issue. :\nAt the opening of the trial before Macdonald J. the appellant obtained leave to amend the Statement of Claim by the addition of the following:\u2014\n3. (a) The Plaintiff says that the said contract to which were attached a certain set of plans inadvertently and by mistake incorporated certain plans for a finished basement whereas the Plaintiff says that the parties hereto had agreed verbally prior to the execution of the said contract that the basement would not be finished as shown in the said plans and would contain the bearing partitions only and roughed in double Plumbing and the Plaintiff asks that the said contract be rectified to correct the said mutual mistake.\n(a.a.) An Order of this Honourable Court directing that the certain contract dated the 15th day of May, 1953, be rectified to delete any plans for a finished basement as shown in the plans attached to the said contract. ,\nThe Statement of Defence contained a general denial of the allegations of fact in the Statement of Claim and upon these issues the action was tried.\nThe appellant has had twenty years' experience as a building contractor in the Edmonton District. Shortly prior to May 15, 1953, the parties entered into negotiations for the erection of a house upon the respondent's property. During most of the negotiations the respondent was represented by her adopted son, Hubert Hoffman. The learned trial judge accepted the evidence of the respondent and Hoffman, in preference to that of the appellant, and, accordingly, it is their version of what took place that is to be considered.\nAfter some preliminary discussions, the appellant introduced Hoffman to a Mr. MacDonald, an employee of the City of Edmonton, who, the appellant had suggested, was a suitable person to prepare a plan. Upon the information given to him by Hoffman, MacDonald prepared plans for a one storey house, with a basement, the latter to contain two bedrooms, a den or study, a bathroom, what was called a rumpus room, a utilities room where the furnace was to be placed, and at least two other rooms which bore no designation. Upon receiving this, the parties and Hoffman met at the respondent's home, went over the plans in detail, and, upon one of the blue prints taken from them, marked in the appellant's presence certain changes which, it was agreed, were to be made. The appellant said that he would consider the plans and give an estimate of the price for which he would construct the building and, two days afterwards, Hoffman says that he came and quoted the figure of $18,000. . The appellant suggested that they have an agreement drawn by a solicitor he knew. The respondent and Hoffman were strangers in Edmonton and did not know any solicitor and agreed to this. The appellant went alone to Mr. J. H. Jamieson, a member of a well known Edmonton firm, taking with him a copy of the blue prints upon which the agreed changes were marked, and instructed him to draw the agreement.\nAccording to Hoffman, it was on May 11 that he and the respondent went to Mr. Jamieson's office and read the draft agreement which had been prepared. The agreement, as drawn, required the appellant as contractor, inter alia, to:\u2014\nprovide all materials and perform all the work mentioned in the specifications and shown in the drawings and details supplied by the owner.\nthe contract price to be the sum of $18,000 and the building to be completed by October 1, 1953. No specification had been prepared. There were certain discussions between the parties in the solicitor's presence but the matter was not then concluded and the respondent and Hoffman left taking the draft agreement home to-be studied. Some two days after, Hoffman says he went with the respondent to Mr. Jamieson's office and there met again Scharfenberg and a discussion took place in regard to certain changes which the respondent wished to have made. Hoffman had made a list of these and the details were taken down by Mr. Jamieson after they had been agreed to by the appellant. The respondent returned alone to the solicitor's office on May 15. A change had been written into clause 3 of the draft in pen and ink, requiring the contractor to furnish and install the items listed on a page described as Schedule A, which was attached. These included a forced air furnace worth approximately $1,000 and eight other changes or additions to the plans. In the presence of Mr. Jamieson, the parties then signed the agreement upon which the action was brought and the blue prints, being the \"drawings\" referred to in it.\nThe appellant gave evidence that when he received the plans he gave an estimate of $30,000 to build the house, this including the entire work indicated. According to him, the respondent and Hoffman said this was too much. He then claims to have said to them that the property was in a one family zone and that he could not \"build a suite\" (referring to the basement rooms) and that it was then agreed that he would build only the first floor shown on the plans and \"roughed in double plumbing\" in the basement. The respondent and Hoffman both flatly denied this and said that no figure other than $18,000 was ever mentioned during the negotiations. According to both the respondent and Hoffman, their only discussion with the appellant during the negotiations was for a price for all of the work indicated by the plans, evidence which the learned trial judge, after hearing the witnesses, has accepted, a finding that has been affirmed on appeal. While, in view of this, it is unnecessary in my opinion, to consider further the evidence bearing upon these questions of fact, it may be noted that the appellant can read, and that he himself gave instructions to Mr. Jamieson for the drawing of the agreement, in the absence of the respondent, that Hoffman and the respondent were in the solicitor's office twice discussing the matter with the appellant in his presence, and the respondent alone, on the day that the agreement was signed, again in the presence of the appellant, and that Mr. Jamieson was not called as a witness by the appellant to support the contention that there had been some mistake. It may be added that the statement that there was any difficulty in getting a building permit from the City for the house as shown on the plans, if ever made, was shown to be untrue.\nIt may further be noted that both the respondent and Hoffman were in touch with the work as the building progressed and both questioned the appellant as to when he was going to do the work called for in the basement. Hoffman asked him as to this several times from June onward, but the only answer made to him was that he was not to worry as the appellant was building the house. Mrs. Kortes says that she also asked him specifically when he was going to finish the basement, to which he replied:\u2014\"I will see\", or some such phrase, and she says that at no time did he tell her that he was not going to do the work called for by the plan. All this is completely inconsistent with the appellant's story. To this evidence there was no answer as the appellant did not give evidence in rebuttal.\nThat there was a material part of the work called for by the plans which had not been completed at the time the action was commenced and which the appellant declined to complete is admitted. Of the work required to be done in the basement, only what the appellant referred to as the bearing partitions were erected. In addition, there was what he referred to as \"roughed in double plumbing.\" Asked as to what was meant by standard double plumbing, the term employed in the contract, he said that it included a bath, toilet and a basin. The walls of the various rooms, the closets in the bedrooms and the den or study and the doors were not built and none of the lathing and plastering, which the appellant admitted were indicated by the plans was done.\nThe learned trial judge found that the claim for the rectification of the agreement failed, that the appellant had not substantially performed the contract, and dismissed the action. Upon the later point, he applied, properly in my opinion, the principle referred to in the judgment of our brother Cartwright in Fairbanks Soap Company v. Sheppard 1. In a short judgment delivered by Johnson J.A. for the Appellate Division, agreeing, after consideration of the evidence, with the findings of the learned trial judge, the appeal was dismissed.\nAs to the claim for the rectification of the agreement, the matter does not appear to me to admit of argument when, as here, the evidence of the respondent and Hoffman as to what took place during the negotiations which led up to the signing of the agreement has been accepted. The learned trial judge, in considering the evidence necessary to support such a claim, referred to a passage from the judgment of Duff J., as he then was, in The Ship M. F. Whalen v. Point Anne Quarries Ltd. 2, where the following language, taken from the judgment of Sir W. M. James in MacKenzie v. Coulson 3, was adopted, reading:\u2014\nthat it is always necessary for the plaintiff to show that there was an actual concluded contract antecedent to the instrument which is sought to be rectified \u2026 It is impossible for this court to rescind or alter a contract with reference to the terms of the negotiation which preceded it.\nThere was no such proof in the present matter, in the opinion of the learned trial judge and of the learned judges of the Appellate Division.\nA point which arose during the argument of this appeal remains to be considered, touching what was then said to be a wrongful rejection of evidence tendered by the appellant. Upon this ground a new trial is sought. The appellant called an architect, James B. Bell, who had examined the plans and the building as constructed. Counsel for the plaintiff at the trial said that he wished to show by the witness the cost of the house as it stood and \"that the house is a house without a completed basement.\" Later, he said that:\u2014\nmy question now would be limited to that particular phase of the cost of this house and the cost of building the house according to the letter of those plans as corroboration of the position taken by the plaintiff.\nBoth of these statements appear to me to be lacking in clarity. When the learned trial judge said at once that he did not see that the suggested evidence would be relevant, counsel for the plaintiff made no attempt to explain the ground upon which he contended that it was and dropped the matter. Some explanation of the nature of the proposed evidence and of its suggested relevancy may perhaps be found in the Notice of Appeal given by the plaintiff in appealing to the Appellate Division. Of the seven grounds of appeal given, the fifth alone complains of the wrongful rejection of evidence and reads:\u2014\nThat the learned trial judge erred in failing to accept evidence as to the interpretation of the contract.\nThis is not what was suggested to the learned trial judge at the time and he, accordingly, had not ruled as to whether it was admissible for this purpose. We are informed that no question as to the improper rejection of evidence was argued before the Appellate Division. There is no reference to any such question in the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Johnson to that, apparently, the matter was not considered. Had the question been argued and the suggested evidence found to be admissible, no doubt the court would have considered the application of Rule 604 of the Supreme Court of Alberta which provides, inter alia, that a new trial shall not be granted on the ground of the improper rejection of evidence unless, in the opinion of the court, some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\nThe argument advanced on behalf of the appellant before us, if I correctly appreciate it, is that the evidence proposed to be given was to show that the cost of completing the entire work shown on the plans was so much in excess of the contract price of $18,000 that no experienced contractor would have agreed to do so for that amount, and not, as suggested in the Notice of Appeal, as an aid to the interpretation of the blue prints. If this was what was intended at the time, it does not appear to have been made clear to the presiding judge. Had it been admitted on the suggested basis, I think it is most probable that the defendant would have called evidence on the point.\nOn the argument before us, counsel for the appellant was asked if it was his opinion that the evidence that was rejected would have had any effect upon the judgment of the trial judge as to the veracity of the witnesses. He candidly stated that, in his opinion, it would not. Had the question, which was clearly considered to be not worth arguing before the Appellate Division, been raised there and had such a question been asked of counsel, no doubt the same answer would have been given, with the result that the Appellate Division, I would expect, would have applied Rule 604.\nIn Penn v. Bibby 4, where the defendant had not been permitted at the trial to cross-examine some of the plaintiff's witnesses upon matters which, it was contended, were relevant, Chelmsford L.C. said in part:\u2014\nIn order to ground this objection, however, the question proposed to be put should have been formally tendered to the Judge, and rejected by him as inadmissible. Now, it appears that his Honour was never distinotly requested to admit any specific question, but from some cursory remarks it is assumed that he would not have permitted a particular line of cross-examination.\nThis, however, is not sufficient. The Judge should have an opportunity of deciding upon some distinct question, and have refused to allow it, before there can be a motion made for a new trial on account of the rejection of evidence.\nIn my opinion, this principle is applicable in the present matter. I do not think that the nature of the proposed evidence was adequately explained to the learned trial judge to enable him to rule upon its admissibility. Nor was any distinct question put to the witness upon which he was asked to rule.\nI am further of the opinion that where litigants deliberately refrain from arguing questions such as this before the Appellate Court of the Province, it should not be open to them to raise the question in this Court. The failure to argue the question as to the rejection of evidence raised by the fifth ground of the Notice of Appeal to the Appellate Division was obviously deliberate. Had the matter been argued, we would have had the advantage of having the opinion of the Appellate Division as to whether, in their judgment, the matter was one for the application of Rule 604. The course followed in this case has deprived us of that advantage. In Hamelin v. Bannerman 5, where an appellant sought to raise for the first time in this Court an objection that arbitration and award were conditions precedent to the right to bring an action for damages, Taschereau J.; whose judgment was concurred in by Sir Henry Strong C.J., Sedgwick and Davies JJ., said that, as the matter had not been mentioned in the factums filed in either court, the point must be considered as abandoned. The improper rejection of evidence is not one of the errors alleged in Part 4 of the appellant's factum in this Court, though the matter is briefly mentioned in the following written argument. In my opinion, this is a case for the application of| the same principle and the point should be considered as abandoned or waived. See also Attorney General for Canada v. Ritchie Contracting Company [(1915) 52 S.C.R. at 92)], Fitzpatrick C.J.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed; new trial directed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lindsay, Emery, Ford, Massie, Jamieson & Lambert.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Shortreed & Shortreed.\n1 [1953] 1 S.C.R. 314.\n2 (1921) 63 Can.

In 1928, the father purchased shares and caused them to be registered in the name J.J.C. He used his own money for the purchase and retained physical possession of the certificates during his lifetime. At the same time he bought other shares which he registered in the names of his daughter, his other son and the name J.C.C.\nThe appellant sued his father\u2019s executors to recover the shares registered in the name J.J.C. The trial judge dismissed the action and the Court of Appeal for Ontario, by a majority, affirmed this judgment.\nHeld (Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kerwin C.J., Rand and Cartwright JJ.: The inference from the evidence is irresistible that by causing the certificates to be issued in the name J.J.C., the father was designating the appellant and not himself. The respondents have failed to adduce sufficient evidence of any contemporaneous act or declaration by the father to rebut the presumption of advancement. Furthermore, there was evidence of subsequent declarations of the father to support the view that the appellant was the beneficial as well as the legal owner of the shares. There was no evidence that the appellant gave up that ownership and became a trustee for his father.\nPer Abbott J. (dissenting): The father was designating the appellant and not himself and, in consequence, a rebuttable presumption of advancement was created. The contemporaneous acts of the father in dealing with the certificates are not only inconsistent with any intention on his part to convey the beneficial interest in the shares to the appellant, but they indicate clearly that he intended to retain the right to deal with them as he might see fit. These acts are in themselves sufficient to rebut the presumption of advancement; the presumption is further rebutted by the acts and declarations of the appellant since he first learned of the shares registered in the name J.J.C., showing that he considered himself only a trustee.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming, Laidlaw J.A. dissenting, the dismissal by the trial judge of the action.\nJ.J. Clemens in person.\nH.F. Parkinson, Q.C. and M.J. Mowbray for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014After anxiously considering the evidence in the record, the judgments in the Courts below and the arguments addressed to us I have concluded: (1) That when the deceased caused the Certificates of Shares to be issued in the name of John Joseph Clemens he meant them to be in the name of, and for, the appellant; (2) the presumption is that he intended to advance the appellant and there is nothing in the record to rebut that presumption. I have had the opportunity of perusing the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Cartwright and I agree with them. On the second point, I merely add a reference to the decision of the House of Lords in Shephard v. Cartwright[2].\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, pronounced on January 12, 1953, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Judson J., delivered at the conclusion of the trial on May 1, 1952, dismissing the appellant\u2019s action. Laidlaw J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.\nThe respondents are the executors of the last will of the appellant\u2019s father, hereinafter usually referred to as Clemens Senior, who died on January 31, 1943.\nIn the pleadings the appellant asks (a) an order requiring the respondents to deliver to him 3,300 shares of the common stock of The International Nickel Company of Canada, Limited, represented by certificates numbers T.T.C. 9613 to 9645 inclusive, each for 100 shares and registered in the name of John Joseph Clemens; (b) payment of all dividends received by the respondents on such shares; (c) an order requiring the respondents to account for 200 shares of the common stock of International Nickel Company of Canada, Limited, represented by certificates numbers T.T.C. 9646 and 9647 registered in the name of John C. Clemens alleged to have formed part of the estate of Clemens Senior and to have been wrongfully given by the respondents to the appellant\u2019s sister Elizabeth Clemens Brown; (d) damages for wrongfully depriving the appellant of his property in the said shares; and (e) such further and other relief as might seem meet.\nThe respondents plead that 400 of the shares referred to in (a) above, represented by certificates numbers T.T.C. 9642 to 9645 inclusive, and the 200 shares referred to in (c) above never came into their hands; that the other shares referred to in the Statement of Claims were the property of Clemens Senior; and that the appellant is estopped by reason of the accounts of the estate having been passed in the Surrogate Court of the District of Sudbury on October 18, 1946. They also plead the Statute of Limitations and the Trustee Act.\nClemens Senior was born on or about December 24, 1879. He was married to Catherine (or Katherine) Droste on September 27, 1911. Three children were born of this marriage, Elizabeth Louise Clemens on September 18, 1912, the appellant on December 20, 1914, and Richard A. Clemens on April 5, 1917.\nThroughout his life and in all his business dealings, except in a few instances to be mentioned hereafter, Clemens Senior was known as John C. Clemens or John Casper Clemens. It appears however from copies of a birth certificate and a baptismal certificate, which while not strictly proved were filed without objection, that Clemens Senior was baptized John Joseph so that his baptismal name was the same as that of the appellant.\nOn a date or dates not fixed by the evidence but prior to October 30, 1928, Clemens Senior purchased shares of common stock in the International Nickel Company of New Jersey and received certificates of deposit under an agreement dated October 30, 1928, in the following names and amounts:\u2014\nElizabeth Louise Clemens..........................................................\n200 shares\nRichard A. Clemens.....................................................................\n600 shares\nJohn Joseph Clemens.................................................................\n600 shares\nJohn C. Clemens..........................................................................\n140 shares\nIn exchange for these certificates of deposit certificates for shares of the common stock of The International Nickel Company of Canada Limited were issued, on a basis of six for one, on January 25, 1929, as follows:\u2014\nto Elizabeth Louise Clemenso...................................................\n1,200 shares\nto Richard A. Clemens................................................................\n3,600 shares\nto John Joseph Clemens............................................................\n3,600 shares\nto John C. Clemens.....................................................................\n840 shares\nThe certificates for the 3,600 shares in the name of John Joseph Clemens were each for 100 shares, were numbered T.T.C. 9610 to T.T.C. 9645 inclusive, and so include the certificates for 3,300 shares claimed by the appellant in this action.\nThe two main questions which arise in this appeal are (i) whether Clemens Senior in causing the original 600 shares and the 3,600 shares which were issued in exchange therefor to be registered in the name John Joseph Clemens intended to designate himself or to designate the appellant, and (ii) whether, if he intended to designate the appellant, the transaction was an advancement to the appellant or created a resulting trust for Clemens Senior.\nAs to the first of these questions, the learned trial judge was of opinion that Clemens Senior caused the 3,600 shares to be registered in his own name but that if his intention was to register them in the name of the appellant he did not intend the latter to become the owner thereof but was using his son\u2019s name \u201cas a mere alias\u201d. In the Court of Appeal, Henderson J.A. agreed with the learned trial judge; Aylesworth J.A., with whom Hope J.A. concurred, also agreed with the learned trial judge and added reasons for holding that even if a presumption of advancement arose it was rebutted by the evidence; Laidlaw J.A. and Hogg J.A. were both of opinion that the shares in question were registered in the name of the appellant; Laidlaw J.A. held that the presumption of advancement had not been rebutted and would have allowed the appeal; Hogg J.A. held that such presumption had been rebutted and so concurred with the majority in dismissing the appeal.\nI share the view of Laidlaw J.A. and am in substantial agreement with his reasons, but, as I am differing from the learned trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal, I will state my reasons in my own words.\nWith the greatest respect for those who entertain a contrary view, the reasons given by Laidlaw J.A. and by Hogg J.A. for holding that Clemens Senior was designating the appellant when he caused the certificates in question to be registered in the name John Joseph Clemens appear to me to be unanswerable.\nThe evidence that both in his domestic and business life Clemens Senior used the name, and was known as, John C. Clemens or John Casper Clemens is overwhelming. I propose to mention only some of the items. In the certificate of his marriage on September 27, 1911 he is described as \u201cJohn C. Clemens\u201d. On October 8, 1924, he applied to the Sun Life Assurance Company for a policy on the life of the appellant whom he described in the application as John Joseph Clemens while describing himself and signing as \u201cJohn C. Clemens\u201d. On December 6, 1934, he applied to the same company for another policy on the life of the appellant whom he described as John J. Clemens while describing himself and signing as John C. Clemens. He did all his banking in the name John C. Clemens and signed all cheques in that name. Mr. Van Norman, manager of one of the banks at Sudbury where Clemens Senior had his account and who knew and dealt with him from September 1929 until his death did not know that his baptismal name was John Joseph until he heard it at the trial. Clemens Senior invested in the stocks of numerous companies and at the time of his death held shares registered in the name John C. Clemens in the International Nickel Company of Canada, Limited and in eleven other companies and shares represented by street certificates in four other companies. There was no suggestion in evidence or in argument that he had ever used the name John J. Clemens or John Joseph Clemens in purchasing any stock for himself in any company other than the International Nickel Company. In conveyances of land and in affidavits attached thereto he described himself as John C. Clemens. On June 16, 1938, he obtained a power of attorney from the appellant in which he was described as John C. Clemens. His sister, Mrs. Kaiser, who was 12 years his junior, always knew him as John C. Clemens. She said that the \u201cC.\u201d stood for Casper which was a family name and she did not know that he had been baptized John Joseph until she was told so at the trial. Elizabeth Louise Brown stated that she knew her father as John C. Clemens and her brother, the appellant, as John Joseph Clemens.\nIn addition to the above there were other items of evidence given and it is not surprising to find the learned trial judge saying to the appellant\u2019s counsel who was tendering further evidence on this point:\u2014\nThere is a limit to this. It is abundantly established that Mr. John Clemens, Senior, was known everywhere as John C. Clemens, and it is merely proving the obvious. I know this now, and I do not need to be told this.\nand a little later:\u2014\nI am convinced that he was known as John C., everybody knew him as John C. or John.\nThe only instances disclosed in the record in which Clemens Senior referred to himself or caused himself to be referred to as John Joseph Clemens or John J. Clemens or J.J. Clemens are as follows:\u2014\nIn a will dated February 9, 1939, and a codicil thereto dated December 2, 1941, he was described as \u201cJohn Joseph Clemens (sometimes known as John C. Clemens)\u201d. He signed both will and codicil John C. Clemens. He was similarly described in a will dated September 22, 1942, which he signed John J. Clemens. In his last will dated December 12, 1942, he was similarly described and signed John C. Clemens. In certain correspondence carried on in 1939 and 1940 by the witness Stanley R. Brunton with Bankers Trust Company of New York on the instructions of Clemens Senior the latter is referred to as John Joseph Clemens Senior or as \u201cJohn Joseph Clemens, father\u201d. In a trust agreement dated December 31, 1942, signed by the appellant and which was prepared on the instructions of Clemens Senior, the latter is referred to as \u201cJohn Joseph Clemens Sr., father of the Settlor\u201d. It will be observed that the earliest of these instances is in 1939 ten years after the registration of the shares which are in question in this action.\nIt is against the background of this evidence as to how Clemens Senior described himself and was known in his business affairs that the dealings in International Nickel stock with which we are particularly concerned must be examined.\nParticulars of the shares of International Nickel issued on January 25, 1929, have already been stated. Certain other transactions in the stock of this company must now be considered. On December 28, 1928, certificates T.T.C. 2709 to T.T.C. 2713, inclusive, each for 100 shares, were issued in the name of John Joseph Clemens. On January 4, 1929, these certificates, each of which was endorsed \u201cJohn Joseph Clemens\u201d in the handwriting of Clemens Senior, were cancelled and certificates replacing them were issued, for 475 shares to Stewart McNair and Company, and for 25 shares to William Thomas Brown. On January 26, 1929, certificates for a total of 1,000 shares, being numbers T.T.C. 9704 to T.T.C. 9713, inclusive, for 100 shares each, were issued in the name of \u201cJohn Joseph Clemens\u201d and on the same day there were issued certificates for a total of 1,000 shares in the name of Elizabeth Louise Clemens and certificates for a total of 1,000 shares in the name of Richard A. Clemens. All the shares above mentioned were purchased on the instructions of Clemens Senior and the certificates were received and kept by him. While it was questioned during the argument, I will assume for the purposes of this appeal that, as contended by the respondents, all of the purchase money of all of these shares was furnished by Clemens Senior and was his own money.\nAs a result of the transactions of Clemens Senior up to and including January 26, 1929, certificates had been issued and were in his hands for shares of the common stock of the International Nickel Company of Canada, Limited, in the following names and amounts:\u2014\nElizabeth Louise Clemens..........................................................\n4,180 shares\nJohn Joseph Clemens.................................................................\n4,600 shares\nRichard A. Clemens.....................................................................\n4,600 shares\nJohn C. Clemens..........................................................................\n840 shares\nAylesworth J.A. attaches considerable significance to the purchase of 500 shares in the name of John Joseph Clemens on December 28, 1928 and the sale thereof a week later, but this circumstance does not appear to me to be of assistance in determining whether Clemens Senior was at that time designating himself or the appellant by that name. There is nothing to indicate that he did not intend these shares to be registered in the name of the appellant or that he did not use the proceeds of their sale in part payment for the 1,000 shares purchased in the name John Joseph Clemens on January 26, 1929. In dealing with the shares registered in the names of each of his children Clemens Senior appears to have proceeded on the view that he was entitled to endorse their names, a view which was clearly erroneous even on the theory that they held such shares on a resulting trust for him. The probative effect of the transaction in these 500 shares appears to me to be neutral.\nI agree with Laidlaw J.A. and Hogg J.A. that the inference is irresistible that by the name John Joseph Clemens in which he caused the certificates for the 4,600 shares above mentioned to be issued Clemens Senior was designating the appellant and not himself. Whatever may have occurred some years later, the evidence establishes that at the time of the issue of such shares he was devoted to his three children, all of whom were then still infants. That he should purchase shares in the names of two of his infant children, Elizabeth and Richard, and none in the name of his elder son, John Joseph, seems unlikely. It is more unlikely that when he caused 3,600 shares to be registered in the name of John Joseph on the same day that he caused 3,600 to be registered in the name of Richard and 1,000 to be registered in the name of John Joseph on the same day that he caused 1,000 to be registered in the name of Richard he was not designating the appellant by the name John Joseph. The inference is clear that he was placing an equal number of shares in the name of each of his infant sons. The matter appears to me to be put beyond doubt when it is remembered that on the same day that he caused 3,600 shares to be registered in each of the names John Joseph and Richard he caused 840 shares to be registered in the name John C. Clemens which, so far as the record discloses, was the only name in which up to that time he had ever described himself in any transaction. I conclude that the 4,600 shares above referred to, registered in the name John Joseph Clemens, were registered in the name of the appellant and not of the father.\nTurning now to the second point, as to whether, in causing the shares to be registered in the name of the appellant, Clemens Senior intended to advance his child or to create a resulting trust in his own favour, it must be borne in mind that the question is what was his intention at the time of the transaction. It is nothing to the point to shew that years later he endeavoured to appropriate some of the shares in question to his own use or purported to dispose of them as his own property.\nThere is, of course, a rebuttable presumption that a gift was intended. The principle is succinctly stated in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd Edition, Vol. 17, page 677, as follows:\u2014\nWhere a father purchases either real or personal estate in the name of a child alone\u2026 there is no resulting trust for the father; but the father is presumed to have intended to advance the child, especially where he is an infant\u2026 The presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a contrary intention.\nIn speaking of the nature of the evidence required to rebut the presumption the Master of the Rolls in Jeans v. Cooke[3] said:\nStill, however, as it is a presumption, it may be repelled by evidence, and, in my opinion, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff to rebut the presumption of advancement, by evidence sufficiently strong to lead to an opposite conclusion. The evidence ought to be distinct, because, as observed in several cases, this is a principle which is not to be frittered away by nice refinements. The evidence ought to be contemporaneous, or nearly so, because subsequent acts or subsequent declarations by a father will not enable him to convert an advancement for his son into a beneficial purchase for himself. As to what evidence is admissible, the law appears to me to be correctly stated in Lewin on Trusts, 15th Edition at page 152, as follows:\u2014\nSo the father may prove a parol declaration of trust by himself, either before or at the time of the purchase, not that it operates by way of declaration of trust, for the Statute of Frauds would interfere to prevent it; but as the trust would result to the father, were it not rebutted by the sonship as a circumstance of evidence, the father may counteract that circumstance by the evidence arising from his parol declaration of intention. The father cannot defeat the presumption of advancement by any subsequent declaration of intention, but his evidence is admissible for the purpose of proving what was the intention at the time.\nOn the other hand, the son may produce parol evidence to prove the intention of advancement, and a fortiori such evidence is admissible on his side, as it tends to support both the legal operation and equitable presumption of the instrument. And it seems the subsequent acts and declarations of the father may be used against him by the son, though they cannot be used in his favour, and so the subsequent acts or declarations of the son may be used against him by the father, provided he was a party to the purchase, and his construction of the transaction may be taken as an index to the intention of the father; but not otherwise, for the question is, not what did the son, but what did the father, mean by the purchase.\nIn my opinion the effect of the evidence in the case at bar is accurately summarized by Laidlaw J.A. when he says:\u2014\nThere is no evidence of any act or expression of the father or of the appellant contemporaneous with the transfer and there is no evidence of any subsequent act or expression of the appellant touching the question of the father\u2019s intention when he transferred the shares and directed that they be registered in the name of the appellant.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that the learned trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal, when considering the evidence as to the conduct and statements of the appellant, have failed to take into consideration the fact that he took no part whatever in the transactions in which the shares in question were purchased in his name and indeed, as it is put in the respondent\u2019s factum, \u201che was not even aware of the existence of the shares until long after their acquisition.\u201d It is impossible that the appellant could have any knowledge of his father\u2019s intention at the time of the purchase of the shares except such as he might have acquired by hearsay long after the event.\nI am unable to find evidence of any contemporary act or declaration by the father sufficient to defeat the presumption of advancement. It was suggested in argument that the father endorsed all the certificates in question in blank in the name of John Joseph Clemens at about the time of their issue. As has already been pointed out there is ample evidence that Clemens Senior endorsed the names of all of his children on share certificates that he had caused to be registered in their names. All the 36 certificates T.T.C. 9610 to T.T.C. 9645 issued in the name of John Joseph Clemens on January 25, 1929, are endorsed John Joseph Clemens in the handwriting of Clemens Senior but I can find no evidence that these endorsements were made at or near the date of the issue of the certificates. The endorsements bear the following dates; Numbers T.T.C. 9610 to T.T.C. 9612 inclusive, November 11, 1932; Numbers T.T.C. 9613 to T.T.C. 9641 inclusive, December 1, 1943; on Numbers T.T.C. 9642 to T.T.C. 9645 inclusive, the endorsements are undated. The 3 certificates in the first mentioned group were cancelled and new certificates were issued to Livingstone and Company on April 20, 1933. The endorsements on the 29 certificates in the second group bear a date subsequent to the death of Clemens Senior; they all came into the possession of the respondents. The 4 certificates in the third group are those alleged to have been given by Clemens Senior to his daughter shortly before his death; they never came into the hands of the respondents or either of them in their character of executors. It is said for the respondents that it may be inferred that when Clemens Senior endorsed the certificates he left the endorsements undated. This would seem to be probable as obviously he could not have filled in the date in the group of 29 certificates; but assuming this to be so it does not assist the respondents for it leaves the date on which the endorsements were signed uncertain. In the case of all 36 certificates the signature John Joseph Clemens is guaranteed by The Bank of Toronto and the guarantee stamp is signed by W.E. Van Norman, Manager, Sudbury, Ont. It is in evidence that Mr. Van Norman did not come to Sudbury until September 1929, that is nine months after the certificates in question were issued in the appellant\u2019s name. As there is no proof that Clemens Senior endorsed the certificates in question at or near the time of their issue it is unnecessary to consider whether it would have assisted the case of the respondents if there had been such proof. The learned trial judge appears to have placed some reliance on the correspondence carried on between Mr. Brunton and Bankers Trust Company to which some reference has been made above but when Mr. Brunton\u2019s evidence is examined it becomes clear that this whole correspondence was carried on on the instructions of Clemens Senior and there is no evidence that the appellant had any knowledge of it or that he ever signed or even saw any of the letters of which it was said to consist.\nThe fact that the appellant signed the trust agreement of December 31, 1942, does not assist the respondent\u2019s case. The effect of the evidence on this point is that in 1942 the appellant at the request of his father signed the agreement which had been prepared on the father\u2019s instructions placing in a trust for the appellant\u2019s own benefit, but subject to a spendthrift clause, 900 of the 1,000 shares which his father had caused to be registered in his name on January 26, 1929. This is not evidence to rebut the presumption of gift which arose when the father purchased in the appellant\u2019s name, some time prior to October 30, 1928, the 600 shares in exchange for which 3,600 shares were issued to him on January 25, 1929. The fact that the father retained possession of the certificates and received the dividends and that the appellant, after he came of age and learned that his father had possession of certificates registered in his name, failed to demand delivery thereof and to ask for an accounting of the dividends does not rebut the presumption as to the father\u2019s intention at the time the shares were placed in the appellant\u2019s name some years before. On this point reference may usefully be made to Sidmouth v. Sidmouth[4], and to Commissioner of Stamp Duties v. Byrnes[5].\nIn my view the respondents have failed to adduce evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption that the shares in question were a gift to the appellant. But the decision of the appeal need not rest on a mere failure of the respondents to discharge the onus which rested upon them. The evidence of Mr. Cushing and the terms of the will of November 7, 1933 which he prepared on the instructions of Clemens Senior and which was duly signed and attested support the view that the children were the beneficial as well as the legal owners of the shares which Clemens Senior had purchased in their names. Clause (c) of paragraph 7 of the will reads as follows:\u2014\n(c) Upon the death of my said wife the corpus of my estate shall be divided into three parts, and in such division I direct my trustee to take into consideration the following facts and govern such division, having such facts in mind, namely:\u2014I have in the past invested and speculated with private funds of my children and have accumulated for each of them as their own respective separate property certain stocks, bonds, cash and securities in varying amounts for each of them. I direct my trustee to investigate and ascertain as of the date of my wife\u2019s death what the value then may be of the said stocks, bonds, cash and securities of my said children and, then, when that has been so ascertained to divide the said corpus of my estate in such a manner that the three shares thereof, when respectively added to the ascertained value of each of my said children\u2019s securities, shares, bonds and cash, shall respectively make three equal amounts, such shares to be then held for the benefit of my children, Elizabeth Louise, John Joseph and Richard Aloysius, in manner hereinafter set forth.\nIt is difficult to see how the executors could carry out the direction in this clause to ascertain the value of the stocks of each child otherwise than on the assumption that shares in the possession of Clemens Senior registered in the name of a child of his belonged to that child.\nIn the course of Mr. Cushing\u2019s evidence there is the following passage the effect of which was in no way weakened in cross-examination and which is not contradicted by any other evidence:\u2014\nQ. Did Mr. Clemens indicate to you whether or not he considered that the children owned the shares that were registered in their names?\nA. I would have to answer your question in this way\u2014he stated to me that he had from time to time purchased shares in the names of his children, and that in so doing he was building up separate estates for them, putting stock in their names, mentioning to me in particular this point\u2014that if he lost his own fortune, there would always be something in the name of his children.\nIt is, of course, true that although Clemens Senior had made a gift of the shares in question to the appellant the latter, after coming of age, could have given them back to his father or constituted himself a trustee for his father. I am in complete agreement with the reasons given by Laidlaw J.A. for holding that there is no evidence of any such action on the part of the appellant.\nIn my opinion it is established that from the time Clemens Senior purchased the 600 shares of The International Nickel Company of New Jersey in the name of the appellant the latter was both beneficial and legal owner thereof and that he was equally the beneficial and legal owner of the 3,600 shares of The International Nickel Company of Canada, represented by certificates T.T.C. 9610 to T.T.C. 9645 inclusive, which were issued in exchange.\nWe are not concerned with the 300 shares, represented by certificates T.T.C. 9610 to T.T.C. 9612 inclusive, transferred to Livingstone and Company on April 20, 1933, as no claim in regard to them is asserted in this action.\nOf the remaining 3,300 shares 2,000, represented by certificates T.T.C. 9622 to T.T.C. 9641 inclusive are still in the hands of the respondents, and the appellant is entitled to an order that they be forthwith delivered to him. The respondents in the course of administration sold 900 of the shares represented by certificates T.T.C. 9613 and T.T.C. 9621 inclusive. In regard to these shares the appellant is entitled to an accounting. The certificates T.T.C. 9642 to T.T.C. 9645 inclusive representing 400 shares were given by Clemens Senior to Elizabeth Louise Brown shortly before his death. On June 7, 1944 Mrs. Brown surrendered these certificates and received new certificates in her own name. Mrs. Brown is not a party to these proceedings. It follows from the holding that these shares were the property of the appellant, that Clemens Senior could not pass title to them and that the certificates were invalidly endorsed. It has already been mentioned that these shares did not at any time come into the hands of the respondents in their character of executors. It does not appear to me that the claim in regard to these 400 shares can be satisfactorily dealt with in an action to which neither Mrs. Brown nor The International Nickel Company of Canada Limited is a party.\nThe claim asserted in the pleadings in regard to the 200 shares represented by certificates T.T.C. 9646 and T.T.C. 9647 registered in the name of John C. Clemens fails on the evidence.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be varied to provide:\u2014\n(a) that the respondents do forthwith deliver to the appellant certificates T.T.C. 9622 to T.T.C. 9641 inclusive representing 2,000 shares of the common stock of The International Nickel Company of Canada Limited; (b) that it be referred to the proper officer of the Supreme Court of Ontario to ascertain and report what amounts are due from the respondents to the appellant in respect of dividends received by them on the 2,000 shares referred to in (a) and in respect of their dealings with the 900 shares represented by certificates T.T.C. 9613 to T.T.C. 9621 inclusive;\n(c) that further directions including the costs of the reference hereby directed be reserved until after such officer shall have made his report;\n(d) that this judgment be without prejudice to the right of the appellant to assert such claim in respect of the 400 shares represented by certificates T.T.C. 9642 to T.T.C. 9645 inclusive as he may be advised.\nThe appellant moved under the provisions of Section 68 of The Supreme Court Act for special leave to have further evidence received. This motion was adjourned to be heard, and was heard, at the time of the hearing of the appeal. As in my view the appellant is entitled to succeed on the record as it stands I do not find it necessary to consider this motion further and I would make no order as to the motion or as to the costs thereof.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs of the trial, of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court.\nABBOTT J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment to be delivered by my brother Cartwright and which I understand are concurred in by a majority of the Court. For the reasons which he has given, I agree that by the name John Joseph Clemens, in which the deceased caused shares of the International Nickel Company stock to be issued, he was designating the appellant and not himself, and that in consequence a rebuttable presumption of advancement was created. Since I am of the opinion, however, that such presumption has been rebutted, I should perhaps state briefly the reasons which have led me to this conclusion.\nThe contemporaneous acts of the father relied upon to rebut the presumption of advancement are (a) the purchase of 500 shares of International Nickel stock in the name of John Joseph Clemens on December 28, 1928, and the subsequent sale of the same shares a few days later, on January 5, 1929, and (b) the endorsement in blank by the father of certificates for 4,600 shares of International Nickel stock, registered in the name of John Joseph Clemens.\nSo far as the purchase and sale of the 500 shares are concerned, which took place shortly before the issue of the 4,600 shares in the name of John Joseph Clemens, there is no evidence in the record as to the reason for such purchase and sale or whether it resulted in a profit or a loss.\nAs to 1,000 shares of the said stock purchased on January 26, 1929, and evidenced by Certificates Nos. TTC9704\/13 there can be no question but that these certificates were endorsed in blank by the deceased on or about the date he received them. This is admitted by the appellant in his factum when he states:\u2014\u201cThe endorsements on Certificates TTC9704\/13 were forged on January 29, 1929.\u201d The endorsements on these certificates were guaranteed by Stewart McNair and Co., the brokers through whom the shares had been purchased, thus putting these certificates in what is commonly known as \u201cstreet form\u201d.\nAs to the certificates representing the 3,600 shares registered in the name of John Joseph Clemens on January 25, 1929, here again appellant has admitted in his factum that his father had converted the shares \u201cinto negotiable securities by endorsing in his own handwriting \u2018John Joseph Clemens\u2019 on each and every certificate.\u201d The exact time when such endorsement was made is not established but it most certainly was prior to April 20, 1933, when the father sold 300 of the said shares. In my opinion, an examination of the certificates themselves and of the surrounding circumstances, indicates clearly that the father endorsed all these certificates in blank at or about the time he received delivery of them, namely, on January 25, 1929.\nThese acts of the father in purchasing and selling securities in the name of John Joseph Clemens, endorsing the certificates in blank, and having some of them, at any rate, converted into street form, in my opinion, are quite inconsistent with any intention on his part to convey the beneficial interest in such shares to the appellant. On the contrary, I think they indicate clearly that the deceased intended to retain the right to deal with the shares as he might see fit, and as in fact he did deal with them, as well as with other shares issued in the names of other members of his family which were similarly endorsed.\nThese contemporaneous acts of the father are, in my opinion, in themselves sufficient to rebut the presumption of advancement arising out of the registration of the shares in the name of the appellant but I am further of opinion that this presumption is also rebutted by acts and declarations of the appellant between 1936, when he testified he first learned that there were several thousand shares of International Nickel stock registered in his name, and June 21, 1950, when the present action was taken.\nThese acts and declarations have been fully reviewed by Mr. Justice Hogg in his reasons delivered in the Court below and I need not repeat them here. To borrow the words of Sir John Romilly, Master of the Rolls, in Jeans v. Cooke[6], evidence of such acts and declarations of the appellant \u201cmay be used for the purpose of showing that he considered himself only a trustee.\u201d\nFor the reasons I have given and since I find myself in entire agreement with the findings of the learned trial judge, concurred in by the majority of the Court of Appeal, that any presumption of advancement was rebutted by evidence of contemporaneous acts of the father and of subsequent acts and declarations of the son, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Facer & Shea.\n[1] [1953] O.R. 87; 2 D.L.R. 290.\n[2] [1955] A.C. 431.\n[3] (1857) 24 Beav. 513 at 521.\n[4] (1840) 2 Beav. 447.\n[5] [1911] A.C. 386.\n[6] (1857) 24 Beav. 513 at 521.\n",

Upon application by the Crown, the trial judge directed that an order of prohibition issue under s. 31 of the Combines Investigation Act. The appellants appealed against that order and contended that s. 31 was ultra vires the Parliament of Canada in whole or in part. The appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, with a variation in the terms of the order.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed. The portion of s. 31 invoked by the trial judge is intra vires.\nPer Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Kellock, Locke and Fauteux JJ.: Even though the offence for which the prohibitory order was made is prohibited by s. 498 of the Criminal Code and penalties are provided by the Code and by the Combines Investigation Act, the power of Parliament to deal with the matter under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act is not exhausted. Whether the portion of s. 31, giving the power to make the order of prohibition, was intended to define a new crime or to provide the means of preventing the commission of the offence, it is within the power of Parliament under s. 91(27) (Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan [1941] S.C.R. 396 and A.G. for Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation [1946] A.C. 193 referred to).\nThe words in s. 31 \u201cany other person\u201d should be construed in the case of corporations as meaning their directors, officers, servants and agents.\nPer Rand J.: The scope and object of s. 31 are to provide additional means for suppressing a public evil of the order of those cognizable by Parliament under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act. The section is not concerned with the civil aspect of the relations involved in the agreement condemned, but solely with their harmful effects upon the economic life of the public.\nThe incidental objection that the order is unlimited as to time, that it is aimed against \u201cany other person\u201d, that the act seized upon is one \u201cdirected towards\u201d, that it may be made at any time within three years of the conviction, that it may affect intra-provincial trade and that the procedure of civil courts is to apply, do not go to the matter of jurisdiction.\nThe part of the section dealing with mergers, trusts or monopolies has no relevancy to the proceedings taken here. In any event, the clause is severable.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming with a variation an order of prohibition and holding that s. 31 of the Combines Investigation Act was intra vires.\nJ.J.

GRIFFITH & SONS, LTD.; VICEROY MANUFACTURING COMPANY LIMITED; FIRESTONE TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY OF CANADA, LIMITED and CANALCO LIMITED to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply in the City of Toronto, in the County of York, and other places throughout the Province of Ontario, and in the City of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, and other places throughout the Province of Quebec and elsewhere in Canada where the articles or commodities hereinafter mentioned are offered for sale, of articles or commodities which may be the subject of trade or commerce, to wit,\n(then followed a description of the commodities)\ncontrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code, Section 498, sub-section 1(d).\nS. 31 of the Combines Investigation Act reads:\u2014\n31. (1) Where a person has been convicted of an offence under section thirty-two or thirty-four of this Act or under section four hundred and ninety-eight or four hundred and ninety-eight A of the Criminal Code\n(a) the court may at the time of such conviction, on the application of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of the province, or\n(b) a superior court of criminal jurisdiction in the province may at any time within three years thereafter, upon proceedings commenced by information of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of the province for the purposes of this section,\nand in addition to any other penalty imposed on the person convicted, prohibit the continuation or repetition of the offence or the doing of any act or thing by the person convicted or any other person directed towards the continuation or repetition of the offence and where the conviction is with respect to the formation or operation of a merger, trust or monopoly, direct the person convicted or any other person to do such acts or things as may be necessary to dissolve the merger, trust or monopoly in such manner as the court directs.\n(2) Where it appears to a superior court of criminal jurisdiction in proceedings commenced by information of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of the province for the purposes of this section that a person is about to do or is likely to do any act or thing constituting or directed towards the commission of an offence under section thirty-two or thirty-four of this Act or section four hundred and ninety-eight or four hundred and ninety-eight A of the Criminal Code, the court may prohibit the commission of the offence or the doing of any act or thing by that person or any other person constituting or directed towards the commission of such an offence.\n(3) A court may punish any person who contravenes or fails to comply with a prohibition or direction made or given by it under this section by a fine in the discretion of the court, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.\n(4) Any proceedings pursuant to an information of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of a province under this section shall be tried by the court without a jury, and the procedure applicable in injunction proceedings in the superior courts of the province shall, in so far as possible, apply.\n(5) This section applies in respect of all prosecutions under this Act or under section four hundred and ninety-eight or four hundred and ninety-eight A of the Criminal Code whether commenced before or after the coming into force of this section and in respect of all acts or things, whether committed or done before or after the coming into force of this section.\n(6) In this section \u201csuperior court of criminal jurisdiction\u201d means a superior court of criminal jurisdiction as defined in the Criminal Code, 1952, c. 39, s. 3.\nAll of the appellants pleaded guilty to the charge and Crown counsel, representing The Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of Ontario, then applied for an order under the provisions of s. 31 and, on September 24, 1953, the learned trial judge imposed a fine of $10,000 upon each of the accused and directed that an order of prohibition issue, as permitted by the section.\nOn September 25, 1953, an order issued out of the Supreme Court of Ontario which, after reciting the convictions, read:\u2014\n1. This Court doth prohibit the continuation or repetition of the said offence by the persons convicted.\n2. This Court doth further prohibit the doing of any act or thing by the persons convicted or by any other person directed towards the continuation or repetition of the said offence.\nThe appellants obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal and contended before that court that s. 31 was ultra vires of Parliament. That appeal was dismissed, the court, however, directing that para. (2) of the order be altered so that it reads:\u2014\nThis Court doth further prohibit the doing of any act or thing by the persons convicted, and\/or their directors, officers, servants and agents, directed towards the continuation or repetition of the said offence.\nWhile, pursuant to the direction of this Court, all of the provincial attorneys general were notified of the questions to be raised on the appeal, none were represented before us, the argument in support of the validity of the legislation being made on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada.\nStated shortly, the contention of the appellants is that s. 31 is either wholly or partially ultra vires of Parliament, being a colourable attempt, under the guise of enacting legislation in relation to criminal law, to trench upon the field of property and civil rights in the province assigned exclusively to the legislature by head 13 of s. 92 of the British North America Act. A subsidiary point is that the Court of Appeal erred in interpreting the reference in s-ss. 1 and 2 of s. 31 to \u201cany other person\u201d as meaning only those who stood in such a relation to the accused that a prohibitory order against them would affect the accused and be a penalty on the accused.\nCounsel for the Attorney General supports the legislation as a valid exercise of the powers of Parliament under head 27 of s. 91 as criminal law, and under head 2 as the regulation of trade and commerce.\nSince 1888 there has been legislation in Canada prohibiting the offences referred to in s. 498 of the Code. In substantially the same form, that section appeared as s. 520 when the Code was first enacted in 1892 (c. 29).\nFollowing the decision of the Judicial Committee finding the Board of Commerce Act and the Combines and Fair Prices Act, enacted in 1919, to be ultra vires[2], the Combines Investigation Act, 1923 (c. 9), which repealed the said statutes, was enacted.\nIn 1929 the Governor General in Council referred to this Court the question as to whether that Act, either in whole or in part, and s. 498 of the Criminal Code were ultra vires. Both the statute and the section were held to be within the power of Parliament[3] and that decision was upheld by the Judicial Committee in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General of Canada[4]. In dealing with the argument that s. 498 of the Criminal Code could not be supported under head 27, Lord Atkin, who delivered the judgment of the Board, said in part (p. 323):\u2014\nIn their Lordships\u2019 opinion s. 498 of the Criminal Code and the greater part of the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act fall within the power of the Dominion Parliament to legislate as to matters falling within the class of subjects, \u201cthe criminal law including the procedure in criminal matters\u201d (s. 91, head 27). The substance of the Act is by s. 2 to define, and by s. 32 to make criminal, combines which the legislature in the public interest intends to prohibit. The definition is wide, and may cover activities which have not hitherto been considered to be criminal. But only those combines are affected \u201cwhich have operated or are likely to operate to the detriment or against the interest of the public, whether consumers, producers, or others\u201d; and if Parliament genuinely determines that commercial activities which can be so described are to be suppressed in the public interest, their Lordships see no reason why Parliament should not make them crimes. \u201cCriminal law\u201d means \u201cthe criminal law in its widest sense\u201d: Attorney General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Ry. Co. 1903 A.C. 524. It certainly is not confined to what was criminal by the law of England or of any Province in 1867. The power must extend to legislation to make new crimes.\nAs to ss. 29 and 30 of the Act, he said (p. 325):\u2014\nIt is, however, not enough for Parliament to rely solely on the powers to legislate as to the criminal law for support of the whole Act. The remedies given under ss. 29 and 30 reducing customs duty and revoking patents have no necessary connection with the criminal law and must be justified on other grounds. Their Lordships have no doubt that they can both be supported as being reasonably ancillary to the powers given respectively under s. 91, head 3, and affirmed by s. 122, \u201cthe raising of money by any mode or system of taxation,\u201d and under s. 91, head 22, \u201cpatents of invention and discovery.\u201d\nIt had been contended also before the Board that the legislation could be supported by reference to head 2 of s. 91 but, after saying that it was unnecessary to discuss this matter in view of their conclusion previously expressed, Lord Atkin said that their Lordships desired to guard themselves from being supposed to lay down that the legislation could not be supported on that ground.\nS. 31 was not part of the Act in 1929, having been first enacted by c. 39 of the Statutes of 1952. It is not a valid objection, in my opinion, to that portion of the section which has been invoked in the present matter that, since, the offence is prohibited by s. 498 of the Criminal Code and penalties are provided both by the Code and by the Combines Investigation Act, the power to deal with the matter under head 27 is exhausted. It is to be noted that the making of a prohibitory order is authorized \u201cin addition to any other penalty\u201d, being thus treated as a penalty. The power to legislate in relation to criminal law is not restricted, in my opinion, to defining offences and providing penalties for their commission. The power of Parliament extends to legislation designed for the prevention of crime as well as to punishing crime. It was, apparently, considered that to prohibit the continuation or repetition of the offence by order, a breach being punishable under s-s. 3 of s. 31, would tend to restrain its repetition. As to the language:\u2014\nor the doing of any act or thing by the person convicted\u2026directed toward the continuation or repetition of the offence,\nthis appears to me to be properly construed as forbidding the taking of any step by the person to whom the order is directed, looking to the continuation of the offence dealt with by the conviction or its repetition by forming another combine, and I do not think it is intended to deal only with attempts to commit the offence. The language appears to me to permit the prohibition of any act such as a preliminary proposal to others regarding the formation of a combine which, in itself, might not fall within the definition of an attempt under s. 72. As Parliament apparently considered that such an order might be of use in preventing the formation of such combines, I think the matter to be wholly within its powers.\nThis view is supported, in my opinion, by a passage from the judgment of Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[5]. S. 285(7) (a) of the Code provides that, where a person is convicted of an offence defined by s.-ss. (1), (2), (4) or (6) of that section, the court may:\u2014\nin addition to any other punishment provided for such offence, make an order prohibiting such person from driving a motor vehicle or automobile anywhere in Canada during any period not exceeding three years.\nDealing with the argument that the making of such a prohibitory order did not fall under head 27, the Chief Justice said (p. 400):\u2014\nI may say at once I cannot agree with this view\u2026 It appears to me to be quite clear that such prohibitions may be imposed as punishment in exercise of the authority vested in the Dominion to legislate in relation to criminal law and procedure.\nIn Attorney General for Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation[6], Viscount Simon, referring to and rejecting an argument that Parliament was without power to reenact provisions with the object of preventing a recurrence of a state of affairs which had been deemed to necessitate the passage of an earlier statute, said that to legislate for prevention appears to be on the same basis as legislation for cure.\nWhether or not it can properly be said that the language referred to was intended to define a new offence, or whether it should be construed as merely providing the means of preventing the commission of the offence, it is, in my opinion, equally within the power of Parliament under head 27 of s. 91.\nIt is further contended that the power to make a prohibitory order directed to the person convicted \u201cor any other person\u201d is not legislation authorized by head 27. While, literally construed and divorced from the context, these words would permit the making of an order against persons quite unconnected with those against whom a conviction has been made, it is impossible that this was the intention of Parliament and I agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that it should properly be construed as meaning, in cases such as this where the accused are corporations, the directors, officers, servants and agents of the various companies.\nThe appellants further submitted that that part of s-s. 1 which reads:\u2014\nand where the conviction is with respect to the formation or operation of a merger, trust or monopoly, direct the person convicted or any other person to do such acts or things as may be necessary to dissolve the merger, trust or monopoly in such manner as the court directs.\nis ultra vires.\nThis power was not exercised by the court in the present case and as, in my opinion, this portion of the subsection is clearly severable from that portion which has been invoked, the point as to whether this is within the powers of Parliament should not, in my opinion, be determined. This is not a reference to the court in which we are asked to determine the validity of s. 31 as a whole, but rather that portion of it purporting to give to the court the powers which have been exercised in making the order complained of.\nIn view of my conclusion that the impugned legislation is intra vires of Parliament under head 27, it is unnecessary to consider the question as to whether it might not also fall within head 2.\nI would dismiss the appeals.\nRAND J.:\u2014The appellants were charged before the Supreme Court of Ontario with conspiracy unduly to prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, sale, etc. in Canada of certain specified rubber products contrary to s. 498, s-s. (1)(d) of the Criminal Code, to which a plea of guilty was entered. Upon this, counsel on behalf of the Attorneys\u2011General of Canada and of Ontario applied for and obtained an order of prohibition under s-s. (1) of s. 31 of the Combines Investigation Act which, in part reads: 31. (1) Where a person has been convicted of an offence under section thirty-two or thirty-four of this Act or under section four hundred and ninety-eight or four hundred and ninety-eight A of the Criminal Code\n(a) the court may at the time of such conviction, on the application of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of the province, or\n(b) a superior court of criminal jurisdiction in the province may at any time within three years thereafter, upon proceedings commenced by information of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of the province for the purposes of this section,\nand in addition to any other penalty imposed on the person convicted, prohibit the continuation or repetition of the offence or the doing of any act or thing by the person convicted or any other person directed towards the continuation or repetition of the offence and where the conviction is with respect to the formation or operation of a merger, trust or monopoly...\nS-s. (3) provides that:\nA court may punish any person who contravenes or fails to comply with a prohibition or direction made or given by it under this section by a fine in the discretion of the court, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.\nWhat is challenged is the power of Parliament within its jurisdiction over criminal law to enjoin a continuation or repetition or the doing of any act \u201cdirected towards\u201d the continuation or repetition of such an illegal combination and its enforcement by fine or imprisonment. It is accepted that head 27 of s. 91 of the Confederation statute is to be interpreted in the widest sense, but that breadth of scope contemplates neither a static catalogue of offences nor order of sanctions. The evolving and transforming types and patterns of social and economic activities are constantly calling for new penal controls and limitations and that new modes of enforcement and punishment adapted to the changing conditions are not to be taken as being equally within the ambit of parliamentary power is, in my opinion, not seriously arguable.\nWhat has called for the device of injunction and punishment for its contravention is undoubtedly the experience in dealing with these offences. The burden of proving the combination and its operation is, for obvious reasons, complicated and time consuming and the procedure of enforcement by conviction and fine has tended to exhibit a course of things bearing a close likeness to periodic licensing of illegality. That sanctions cannot be made more effective, that an offence by its nature continuing cannot be dealt with as criminal law by an enjoining decree that will facili- tate enforcement, might go far towards enabling self-confessed lawlessness to set the will of Parliament at defiance.\nMr. Robinette stressed language used by members of this Court and in the reasons given by Viscount Haldane in the Judicial Committee in In re The Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and The Combines and Fair Prices Act[7] and[8]. I do not think it necessary to say more than that the statutes there challenged were found by the Judicial Committee to have been in substance enactments for the regulation in a civil aspect of the production and distribution of the necessaries of life throughout the Dominion and the penal measures authorized were necessarily bound up with that primary object. The essence of the judgment is stated at p. 199:\nIt is quite another thing, first to attempt to interfere with a class of subject committed exclusively to the Provincial Legislature, and then to justify this by enacting ancillary provisions, designated as new phases of Dominion criminal law which require a title to so interfere as basis of their application.\nSo far as the language of Viscount Haldane at p. 198 on the scope of head 27 appears to require the subject matter of criminal law to be such as \u201cby its very nature belongs to the domain of criminal jurisprudence\u201d it must be taken to have been rejected by the Committee in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General for Canada[9], where the validity of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. (1927) c. 26 and of s. 498 of the Criminal Code was in issue. In the reasons there given, Lord Atkin at p. 324 buries any lingering notion that acts denounced as criminal by law possess any special taint or quality in themselves which places them in that category:\nThe criminal quality of an act cannot be discerned by intuition; nor can it be discovered by reference to any standard but one: is the act prohibited with penal consequences?\nThis view was affirmed by the Judicial Committee in the Margarine case[10].\nAs it has so many times been reiterated, the first and fundamental question in these matters is whether the real purpose and object of the enactment is a legislative accomplishment within one or other of the heads of s. 91 or s. 92. Here it is whether the purpose and object are to provide additional means for suppressing a public evil of the order of those cognizable by Parliament under head 27. To this my answer is unhesitatingly yes. The section is not concerned in the slightest degree with the civil aspects of the relations involved in the agreements condemned; it is concerned solely with the harmful effects upon the economic life of the public of the control and the exactions for which they provide.\nThe incidental objections that the order is unlimited as to time, that it is aimed against \u201cany other person\u201d, that the act seized upon is one \u201cdirected towards\u201d, that it may be made at any time within three years of the conviction, that it may affect purely intra-provincial trade and that the procedure of civil courts is to apply, do not go to the matter of jurisdiction; and their wisdom or unwisdom is not a question for the courts. The interpretation to be given them will be determined when the appropriate situation arises.\nThe last clause of s-s. (1), s. 31 dealing with mergers, trusts or monopolies was brought into the argument, but it has no relevancy to the proceedings taken. The most that could be contended is that the subsection must be treated as an entirety and that the invalidity of the clause debases the whole. I do not find it necessary to examine the contention of invalidity because I take it to be clear that the clause is severable: it is one of a number of cumulative measures towards eliminating what Parliament has declared to be criminal activity; and from the purpose and object of the subsection I have no doubt that the intention was to authorize the several steps each independently of the others.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeals.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitor for the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. of Canada, Ltd.: J.J.

That determination by the Board is not conclusive nor binding between the two parties.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division1, holding, Michaud C.J.Q.B. dissenting, that the finding of the Workmen's Compensation Board was conclusive in a subsequent negligence action.\nP. E. Pelletier for the appellants.\nE. N. McKelvey for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J.:\u2014The question here arises out of the Workmen's Compensation Act of New Brunswick. The appellant, Oliva Rossignol, wife of Rodolphe, was ' a fellow employee of the respondent Hart and was allegedly injured in the course of her employment through the negligence of Hart. A claim for compensation was made on her behalf but the Compensation Board found that she had not in fact suffered any injury. This action was thereupon commenced in which the defence raised the ground that that finding of fact by the Board was binding in this proceeding on the appellants. A question of law was by consent referred to the Appellate Division 2 in the following words:\nIs the determination by the Workmen's Compensation Board of the Province of New Brunswick that the plaintiff Oliva Rossignol did not suffer an injury of any kind or degree as a result of an accident occurring on the 6th day of April, 1951, while she was in the employ of Dalfen's Department Store in the City of Edmundston in the said province, in which said accident she was hit on the head by a falling manikin, conclusive and binding between the plaintiffs and the defendant herein, so that this court, in determining the issues herein, is precluded from reconsidering the question determined as aforesaid by the said Board?\nThe court by a majority judgment of Richards C.J. and Hughes J. held the ground to be well taken and answered the question in the affirmative; Michaud C.J. of the Trial Division dissented and the question comes before us by special leave.\nThe respondent relies upon certain sections of the statute :\n9. (1) Where an accident occurs to a workman in the course of his employment in such circumstances as to entitle him or his dependents to an action against some person other than his employer, the workman or his dependents, if entitled to compensation under this Part, may either claim compensation or bring the action.\n(2) If the workman or his dependents bring an action, and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the compensation to which the workman or his dependents would be entitled under this Part, the workman or his dependents shall be entitled to compensation under this Part to the extent of the amount of such difference.\n(3) If the workman or his dependents, or any of them, have claimed compensation under this Part, the Board shall be subrogated to the position of such workman or dependents as against the other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of such workman or dependents against such other person.\n11. The provisions of this Part are in lieu of all claims and rights of action, statutory or otherwise, to which a workman or his dependents are or may be entitled against the employer of the workman for or by reason of an accident in respect of which compensation is payable under this Part. 32. (1) Except as provided in Section 34 the Board has exclusive jurisdiction to examine into, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Part and as to any matter or thing in respect to which any power, authority or discretion is conferred upon the Board, and the action or decision of the Board thereon shall be final and conclusive and shall not be open to question or review in any court, and no proceedings by or before the Board shall be restrained by injunction, prohibition or other process or proceeding in any court or be removable by certiorari or otherwise into any court.\n(2) Without thereby limiting the generality of the provision of subsection (1), it is declared that such exclusive jurisdiction extends to determining,\n(a) the existence of, and degree of, disability by reason of any injury;\n* * *\nIt is clear that the statute deals primarily with the relations between employers and employees and except in certain cases of wilful or reckless conduct gives an absolute right to compensation regardless of negligence in the employer or third person; injuries to employees occurring within the course and out of their employment are gathered within the area of ordinary wastage of business and industry and are accorded compensation analogous to any other loss or expense therein.\nOnly incidentally are third persons, whether fellow employees or not, affected. S. 9(3), in providing subrogation, does not effect a statutory novation of the claim against the third person to the Board, as s-s. (2) conclusively indicates, and that interpretation was given to similar language of the Ontario Act in Toronto Railway Company v. Hutton 3 and of the British Columbia statute, in the case of The King v. Snell 4 Whatever rights in such a claim vest in the Board are equitable in nature and are a matter of interest only between the Board and the employee receiving compensation.\nI think it beyond serious argument that the respondent has no interest in the investigation by the Board of a claim for compensation; and it would be contrary both to the statutory provisions and to principle generally that a person should be bound by a finding pronounced in his absence. If he is to be bound, then certainly he is entitled to notice of and to participate in the enquiry. Not only the actual wrongdoer but every other third person liable vicariously for his tortious act should also be brought before the Board. But the statute is silent on this essential consideration and counsel could not point to any case in which such a third party has ever been treated as interested in the adjudication of a claim. But if, as between the respondent and the appellants, the latter are barred, so must the former be; a ruling in rem such as was found below would bind everybody: it would be impossible, as between themselves, that one should be free and the other bound.\nIt would, moreover, in any case, be a novel procedure that a claimant or a third party, employee or employer, must submit to the adjudication of such an administrative body on an essential element of his common law right or liability. It would in ordinary cases be ultra vires of the province to confer that power on a provincial tribunal. Even assuming that the issue of negligence could ever be committed to an inferior court, beyond petty jurisdiction the judges, for such purpose, must, by the Confederation Act, be of Dominion appointment.\nThe case of Noell v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company 5, was relied upon by Richards C.J., but with the greatest respect the question there raised was wholly different from that here. An action had been brought in Ontario against the employer company and an application was made by the latter to the Compensation Board of New Brunswick for a determination whether the accident from which the injury arose had arisen \"out of and in the course of the employment\". If that had been determined affirmatively, by the express language of s. 11 no action at law against the employer would lie. What was held by this Court was that the employer was entitled to call upon the Board to decide that question and that the finding by the Board to that effect was, vis a vis the claimant, binding on the employer for all purposes. The decision involved the provisions of the Act both as to the conclusiveness of the findings of the Board and the effect on the right of action against the employer and it dealt solely with the issue as between the parties before the court. The reasons for a judgment must, as it has so frequently been said, be read secundum subjectam materiam; the subject matter of the Noell issue was whether the accident was or was not a case for compensation. Who, then, was interested in that question? As I have endeavoured to show, not any third person who might, by his own negligence or vicariously, have caused or was liable for the injury. It must be one whose interest is derived through or bound up with that of the injured employee or his employer. For example, another employer in the same class whose assessment would depend on the claims established against his class might possess that interest. How, then, the case can be taken to be an authority for the proposition that a finding as between employer and employee, on a subsidiary issue, the fact and degree of injury, can, in the absence of clear statutory provision, absolve a third party from liability under the general law I am quite unable to appreciate. This was the view of Michaud C.J. and with it I am in entire agreement.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the question answered in the negative. The appellants will be entitled to their costs in both courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pichette & Pelletier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McKelvey, Macaulay & Machum.\n1 [1955] 2 D.L.R. 823; 37 M.P.R. 284.\n2 [1955] 2 D.L.R. 823; 37 M.P.R. 284.\n3 (1919) 59 Can.

By Regulation 20(4), the Governor in Council enacted that admission is prohibited \u201cwhere in the opinion of a Special Inquiry Officer such person should not be admitted by reason of\u201d the same enumerated list of matters that are found in s. 61 of the Act.\nThe respondent, a citizen of the United States of America and who did not have a Canadian domicile, was ordered deported by a special immigration officer as unsuitable under this regulation. The respondent applied for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid and also for an order by way of certiorari quashing the deportation.\nThe judge of first instance ordered her discharged from custody. In view of the decision of this Court in Masella v. Langlais ([1955] S.C.R. 263), the Court of Appeal for Ontario struck out the direction for the respondent\u2019s discharge but quashed the deportation order.\nHeld: Upon appeal by leave of the Court of Appeal its order should be confirmed.\nRegulation 20(4) is invalid because there is no power, under s. 61 of the Immigration Act, in the Governor in Council to delegate, as was done by this regulation, his authority to immigration officers. In view of this invalidity, s. 39 of the Act does not prevent the Court from exercising its jurisdiction by way of certiorari and quashing the deportation order.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], quashing a deportation order.\nD.W. Mundell, Q.C., J.S. Pickup, Q.C. and L.A. Couture for the appellant.\nF.A. Brewin, Q.C., and J.F. McCallum for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014At the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the appellant, this appeal was dismissed with costs.\nThe respondent is a citizen of the United States of America and has not a Canadian domicile. She applied at the Immigration Station in Toronto for admission to Canada for permanent residence where she was examined by an Inspector and referred to a Special Immigration Officer. The latter made an order for her deportation and her appeal to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was dismissed. She then applied for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to determine the validity of the deportation order and also made application for an order by way of certiorari quashing that order. Mr. Justice Wilson, before whom the matter came in the first instance, ordered her discharge from custody. In view of the decision of this Court in Masella v. Langlais[2], the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3], since the appellant was not in custody, amended the order of Wilson J. by striking out the direction for her discharge but quashed the deportation order. By leave of the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General of Canada appealed to this Court. It is sufficient to refer to one of the reasons for which the Court of Appeal quashed the deportation order.\nBy s. 61 of The Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, 325:\u2014\n61. The Governor in Council may make regulations for carrying into effect the purposes and provisions of this Act and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may make regulations respecting...\n(g) the prohibiting or limiting of admission of persons by reason of\n(i) nationality, citizenship, ethnic group, occupation, class or geographical area of origin,\n(ii) peculiar customs, habits, modes of life or methods of holding property,\n(iii) unsuitability having regard to the climatic, economic, social, industrial, educational, labour, health or other conditions or requirements existing, temporarily or otherwise, in Canada or in the area or country from or through which such persons come to Canada, or\n(iv) probable inability to become readily assimilated or to assume the duties and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship within a reasonable time after their admission.\nThe relevant part of the Order-in-Council purportedly passed in pursuance of this section is paragraph (4) of Clause 20 which reads:\u2014\n(4) Subject to the provisions of the Act and to these regulations, the admission to Canada of any person is prohibited where in the opinion of a Special Inquiry Officer such person should not be admitted by reason of\n(a) the peculiar customs, habits, modes of life or methods of holding property in his country of birth or citizenship or in the country or place where he resided prior to coming to Canada;\n(b) his unsuitability, having regard to the economic, social, industrial, educational, labour, health or other conditions or requirements existing, temporarily or otherwise, in Canada or in the area or country from or through which such person comes to Canada, or\n(c) his probable inability to become readily assimilated or to assume the duties and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship within a reasonable time after his admission.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Aylesworth, speaking an behalf of the Court of Appeal, that Parliament had in contemplation the enactment of such regulations relevant to the named subject matters, or some of them, as in His Excellency-in-Council\u2019s own opinion were advisable and not a wide divergence of rules and opinions, everchanging according to the individual notions of Immigration Officers and Special Inquiry Officers. There is no power in the Governor General-in-Council to delegate his authority to such officers.\nS. 39 of the Act was relied upon by the appellant:\u2014\n39.

The driver, to her knowledge, had started drinking intoxicating liquor at breakfast and had kept it up until the accident about an hour and a half later. The trial judge found gross negligence against the driver. This finding was affirmed in the Court of Appeal and was not questioned in this Court. The defences of volenti non fit injuria and of contributory negligence were raised. The trial judge found that the passenger had assumed the risk. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment but found contributory negligence.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe defence of volenti non fit injuria had not been established. However, there had been contributory negligence on the part of the passenger, and the apportionment of liability, made below, should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco[1], in an action by a gratuitous passenger for damages.\nA. L. Thurlow, Q.C. and J. W. E. Mingo for the appellant. N. D. Blanchard and L. A. Bell for the respondent.\nRAND J.:\u2014This action arises out of injuries to the young woman plaintiff through an accident while in an automobile driven by the respondent Maloney. Two defences are raised, assumption of risk, and contributory negligence. The risk lay in the fact that Maloney, at the time of and for some time prior to the occurrence, was, in some degree, under the influence of alcohol, and the question of its assumption in such circumstances comes before us directly for the first time. It is an important question and calls for an examination of that conception.\nThe form in which the principle has traditionally been stated is that if a person is aware of all the facts of a danger and voluntarily exposes himself to it, he is held to have accepted the risk of any resulting injury. It seems to have originated in matters between master and servant involving hazardous conditions, the simplest case being that of entering upon work inherently dangerous. The next step was taken in Priestley v. Fowler[2], which extended the risk to the negligence of a fellow servant. In the developing conceptions of duty, the scope of the assumption was reduced by the requirement of reasonably safe working conditions including statutory provision for machinery and other protection. Complications of the principle are presented by the multiplying risks of modern modes of carrying on business and of social life, and among them is that of the relation between a driver of an automobile and a gratuitous passenger. In several provinces the judgment of the legislature has been expressed in an absolute denial of any claim against the operator; but in Nova Scotia where gross negligence has, as here, been found, the question is at large.\nThe risk in this case arises out of a special relation which, in turn, results from an undertaking in the original sense of that word: Maloney accepts from the respondent Seymour a commitment of herself to a quasi-custody which he assumes for a purpose involving special hazards under his control or within his general responsibility on terms which include one relating to care in executing the purpose. The degree of care on his part engaged or the risk on hers assumed, qualified or unqualified, may be expressly stipulated, and if so, it would be as determinative during the course of the undertaking as if consideration had passed; but in the generality of cases this term including qualifications is to be implied from the total circumstances. The initial question is whether the undertaker is capable, as if it were in contract, of entering into such an engagement; if he is, what is to be implied as to continued fitness and ability to carry it out until the relation is ended or modified? If he is not originally capable, the passenger acts alone; if self-caused incapacity develops during the performance, its effect will depend on the original terms. No other aspects of the relation are brought into discussion; it is not argued, for instance, that there was a joint venture which would introduce new elements.\nThis stress upon the deduction of terms is made because whether we treat the duty of care as being an incident imposed by law or as an element of the understanding taken to be present between the parties, the actual implication of the facts as it would be inferred by the ordinary reasonable man should, in any event, constitute the legal imposition. The argument, therefore, proceeding on either basis, should reach the same result.\nIn its application to such a situation, I demur to the usual form of the question by which the principle is raised: did the injured person assume the risk that has brought about the injury? The injured person is generally the passenger but it might be the operator not only of automobiles but of airplanes and other machines. So put, the question tends to disguise the governing fact that the other party is setting up in defence the acceptance of the risk as a term of the undertaking, the burden of proving which lies upon him. In such commitments the question ought, I think, rather to be, can the defendant reasonably be heard to say, as an inference from the facts, that the risk of injury from his own misconduct was required by him to be and was accepted by the complainant, as such a term? At common law an undertaking of this species, regardless of consideration, was pleaded in the sub-form of case called assumpsit (he undertook), originally in tort but possibly developing into an independent category: Maitland, Forms of action at Common Law .p. 68-9; its essence was the commitment of an interest of one person to a course of action by another; and its terms were to be gathered as an interpretation of the total circumstances on the footing of which the commitment was made and accepted. That the risk should be so dealt with follows from what was said by Lord Watson in Smith v. Baker[3]. That was a case of master and servant in which a workman, engaged in an employment which was not in itself dangerous, was exposed to danger arising from an operation in another department over which he had no control. At p. 355 Lord Watson, in his speech, says:\nThe maxim, \"Volenti non fit injuria,\" originally borrowed from the civil law, has lost much of its literal significance. A free citizen of Rome who, in concert with another, permitted himself to be sold as a slave, in order that he might share in the price, suffered a serious injury; but he was in the strictest sense of the term volens. The same can hardly be said of a slater who is injured by a fall from the roof of a house; although he too may be volens in the sense of English law. In its application to questions between the employer and the employed, the maxim as now used generally imports that the workman had either expressly or by implication agreed to take upon himself the risks attendant upon the particular work which he was engaged to perform, and from which he has suffered injury. The question which has most frequently to be considered is not whether he voluntarily and rashly exposed himself to injury, but whether he agreed that, if injury should befall him, the risk was to be his and not his masters. When, as is commonly the case, his acceptance or non-acceptance of the risk is left to implication, the workman cannot reasonably be held to have undertaken it unless he knew of its existence, and appreciated or had the means of appreciating its danger. But assuming that he did so, I am unable to accede to the suggestion that the mere fact of his continuing at his work, with such knowledge and appreciation, will in every case necessarily imply his acceptance. Whether it will have that effect or not depends, in my opinion, to a considerable extent upon the nature of the risk, and the workman's connection with it, as well as upon other considerations which must vary according to the circumstances of each case.\nWhether, in any event, the parties could engage that the risk might extend to such recklessness as would likely cause maiming or death would depend on considerations of policy mentioned later in dealing with contributory negligence; but for the generality of cases, the circumstances may present such variety in particulars that a reference to typical situations may clarify what is intended.\nIf A is driving an automobile for private purposes from X to Y and is hailed on the road by B who requests a lift toward Y, what would most likely be said by A if the question of misconduct of either during the trip was at that moment raised? I think he would ordinarily say, or at least it could reasonably be found that he implies\u2014as he does when asked to allow a licensee to pass over his land\u2014\"You may come along, but you must take my skill and care and the risk of my ordinary conduct as I myself am doing, from which I am not likely to but might have a minor lapse\". At the same time it would equally be understood that he would not engage in reckless or grossly careless driving. This is not in conflict with the holding in Harris v. Perry & Company[4], in which other elements were present.\nIf, on the other hand, A, for his own purpose, takes the initiative by inviting B\u2014assuming always the absence of any special circumstances or notice\u2014then it could be deemed to be unreasonable for A to urge that he did not intend to assure B that he could expect the ordinary care of prudent drivers to be exercised in operating the machine. The question, as before, is what conditions as terms can A reasonably claim to have laid down, and B reasonably held to have accepted. If the driver was a beginner, that, again, would be a special circumstance. These examples illustrate the fact that the basic understanding must be reduced to an actual or constructive exchange of terms under which the commitment of the interests of both is brought. To this we have an analogy in Bailment the exposition of which is given by Holt C.J. in Coggs v. Bernard[5].\nThe evidence shows that on Sunday morning the respondent Maloney started drinking at breakfast and in some measure kept it up until the fatal event which was estimated to be about an hour and a half later. There is no serious complaint of reckless or even excessive speed until the last mile or so. Maloney was apparently able to stand considerable liquor and still to retain much, at least, of his ability as a competent driver. Some minutes before the accident an argument between him and his brother had arisen over the year of make of a car that had just then passed them and a bet was made. Speeding ahead and drawing to the side of the road, he waved the other car to a stop. Going back and calling in a curt manner upon the driver, a Mrs. Sweeney, to lower the window, he mentioned the bet and asked her the model of her car and upon being informed returned to his own. Mrs. Sweeney in her testimony did not mention any indication that he was unfit through drink to be driving; his shirt collar was unbuttoned, his necktie loose, he was perspiring and was ill-mannered, but nothing else was referred to. On the other hand, one of the occupants of her car, a Mr. Sterne, spoke of glassiness of eyes and that he talked thickly. But neither mentioned any staggering or swaying in his walk although they had noticed earlier the car as \"weaving\" or \"zigzagging\" over the centre line of the road.\nFollowing this incident, the Sweeney car again passed Maloney. He seems to have been annoyed at the \"snootiness\" of Mrs. Sweeney, and immediately set out to overtake her. In doing so he is said to have reached a speed estimated by the witness Sterne at 70 or more miles an hour, and by Mrs. Sweeney at between 40 and 50. In the course of this career the car went out of control at a curve, jumped the ditch, crashed into a high embankment, skidded back to the other side of the road and ended overturned in the reverse direction. One of the young women occupants was killed and serious injuries were caused the respondent.\nThe latter is a young woman of 19 years of age whose home w.as in Windsor and who, for some months, had been engaged as a waitress at Halifax. We have very little of her history, but there is sufficient to conclude that her sophistication was not of the deepest sort. Maloney seems, toward those with him, to have been somewhat dominating and aggressive. We have no more than general circumstances surrounding the original decision to make the journey; but there is enough to enable me to infer that the weight of the proposal and persuasion came from him. Neither at that point, Halifax, from which they originally set out nor at Chester can his capacity to engage for the journey and for careful driving to the destination, Windsor, be successfully challenged; is it then to be implied that he did so engage? Or was the engagement subject to the condition that he should not render himself incapable through liquor either of reaching Windsor or of driving safely or, put conversely, that the respondent would take the risk of any negligence which could be attributed to that eventuality?\nThe road they were travelling led from Chester to Halifax from which they were still over 30 miles distant, and Windsor is about 45 miles northwest of Halifax. They had originally tried out a gravelled road from Chester in a more direct line to Windsor but after going some miles turned back to the paved road and the route via Halifax. The young woman was, therefore, in a section of country with which she was not familiar and in surroundings by which she was most likely to be intimidated. The answer to her request to him to let the brother drive is significant: it was to the effect that he knew what he was doing and did not want to be interfered with.\nIn that situation the prima facie implication of reason= able care in the original undertaking\u2014subject to the provisions of the statute\u2014is confirmed and that of any such qualifying condition rebutted.\nThese considerations are, in my opinion, substantially the same as those underlying Dann v. Hamilton[6], where Asquith J. on facts almost identical found against the driver. The decision has been the object of some criticism. In Insurance Commissioner v. Joyce[7], Dixon J., dissenting, after an analysis of the principle in terms of relations, observes,\nIf he knowingly accepts the voluntary services of a driver affected by drink he cannot complain of improper driving caused by his condition, because it involves no breach of duty.\nThat conclusion depends on the terms of the undertaking and so far as it implies the determination to be unilateral I am unable to agree with it. Of the judgment in Dann v. Hamilton he says:\nNo doubt the issue his Lordship propounded for decision was one of fact, but, with all respect, I cannot but think that the plaintiff should have been 'precluded. Every element was present to form a conscious and intentional assumption of the very risk from which she suffered.\nFor the reasons already given, I cannot concur in the validity of that criticism. It fails, in my opinion, to give sufficient emphasis to the original undertaking in which the passenger has primarily the interest and the driver, the responsibility, and in the performance of which itself the risk resides. The unilateral formula, adequate to the early situation's, is both inadequate and inappropriate to a bilateral relation in which two persons are co-operating in complementary action. It confines the enquiry into the fact sought to the external conditions evident to the passenger, paying\u2014apparently\u2014no regard to the elements of the undertaking or the governing role of the driver. In the other view the court starts with his original acceptance of responsibility, whatever it may have been, and from the subsequent circumstances finds whether the undertaking has been carried out according to its terms.\nIn the light of these considerations, Maloney has not established his case that the passenger at any time accepted the continuing journey, or gave him any reason to infer that she did, on the terms that she released him from responsibility for care and would take the risk of any consequences resulting from the effects on him of liquor. Nor has he shown that any condition arose which modified that responsibility within the terms of the original undertaking.\nThere remains the question of contributory negligence. The theory underlying that defence is not as clear as it might be. In recent times the idea of a breach of duty owing to one's self has been introduced: the injury suffered by A has been caused by the breach of duty toward A by B and the joint or concurrent breach of a duty toward A by A himself. But if B at the same time suffered injury, is it to be taken as caused by a breach of duty on the part of A towards B and a similar breach of duty towards himself by B, so that the same act in each case becomes a breach of one of two different duties depending on which claim for injury is being considered? The self-duty would seem to be a rationalization for the purpose of logical consistency and completeness of the theory of a several duty toward an injured party as against a generalized duty to be prudent in every situation and in all directions. These contrasting conceptions have their clearest statement in Palsgraf v. Long Island Railway Company[8]. There Cardozo C.J. gave that of the former and Andrews J. of the latter, in the setting of which causation becomes the determinant of liability. In the illustration just put it seems clear that the so-called duty to one's self is of the same standard and content as that toward another and is identical with the duty under the second or generalized principle.\nThe rule that courts will not assist a claimant to recover damages to person or property which he could reasonably have mitigated is analogous to, although, as regards the character and extent of measures required to be taken, perhaps not identical with the duty involved in contributory negligence; and both seem cognate with the principle that a person may ordinarily injure his person or damage or destroy his property or allow others to injure him or damage or destroy his property as he pleases, except that, in the aspect of criminal law at least, leave and licence do not extend to maiming, much less killing, and attempted suicide is a crime.\nOn either principle injury or damage to one's own interest attributable to failure to observe the standard of care of. ordinary prudence, and conceived either as having been so caused or as having been licensed or suffered, will be given no redress by courts. In this case the failure charged against the plaintiff is that she maintained herself in a situation fraught with too great possibility of danger. On that question I am unable to say that the finding of either the fact or the degree of fault by the trial judge and by the Appeal Division is wrong.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is as to whether or not upon the evidence the appellant is entitled to invoke the maxim volenti non fit injuria. The learned trial judge, having found Maloney (the defendant) guilty of gross negligence, applied the maxim and dismissed the action of the respondent Seymour (the plaintiff). Had he not been of that view, the learned judge would have held the defence of contributory negligence established and the plaintiff entitled to recover seventy-five per cent of her loss. The full court[9] considered the latter to be the correct view, the plaintiff's appeal being allowed accordingly.\nThe defendant, having invited the plaintiff to ride in his automobile to her home in Windsor, thereby placed himself in the position of a person \"who undertakes to provide for the conveyance of another\" and although he did so gratuitously, he was \"bound to exercise due and reasonable care\"; per Parke B. in Lygo v. Newbold[10]. This statement of the law was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Harris v. Perry[11]. In the course of his judgment in the latter case, the Master of the Rolls referred to the statement of Blackburn J. in Austin v. G. W. Ry. Co.[12], namely: \"I think that what was said in the case of Marshall v. York, Newcastle and Berwick Ry. Co.[13], was quite correct. It was there laid down that the right which a passenger by railway has to be carried safely does not depend on his having made a contract, but that the fact of his being a passenger casts a duty on the company to carry him safely.\"\nA finding of volenti involves the consequence that no such duty existed, the onus of establishing which lay upon the defendant.\nIn Smith v. Baker[14], Lord Halsbury points out at p. 338 that a person who relies upon the maxim must show that the plaintiff consented to the \"particular thing being done and consented to take the risk upon himself.\" While such consent may be inferred from a course of conduct as well as proved by express consent, it is not established merely by showing that the plaintiff knows there is a risk of injury to himself. The question in each particular case is, in the language of Lindley L.J., in Yarmouth v. France[15], \"not simply whether the plaintiff knew of the risk, but whether the circumstances are such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion that the whole risk was voluntarily incurred by the plaintiff.\" As put by Lord Watson in Smith's case at p. 355, the question \"is not whether he (the plaintiff) voluntarily and rashly exposed himself to injury, but whether he agreed that, if injury should befall him, the risk was to be his and not his master's.\"\nIt is useful also to refer to the language of Lord Herschell in the same case at p. 362, where, in speaking of the particular facts there before the House, his Lordship said:\nIt was a mere question of risk which might never eventuate in disaster. The plaintiff evidently did not contemplate injury as inevitable... .\nThe principle of these judgments was formulated by the Judicial Committee in Letang v. Ottawa Electric[16], per Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, in the language of Wills J., in Osborne v. London & North Western Railway[17]:\n. . . if the defendants desire to succeed on the ground that the maxim \"Volenti non fit injuria\" is applicable, they must obtain a finding of fact \"that the plaintiff freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk he ran, impliedly agreed to incur it.\" In my opinion, these authorities establish that the true question is that stated in Salmond, 10th ed., at p. 34, \"Did the plaintiff give a real consent to the assumption of the risk without compensation; did the consent really absolve the defendant from the duty to take care?\" Having regard to the statute law in force in Nova Scotia, that question becomes in the case at bar, \"Did the plaintiff agree, expressly or by implication, to exempt the defendant from liability for any damage suffered by the plaintiff during the carrying out of the undertaking of the latter, occasioned by the gross negligence of the defendant?\"\nIn his finding as to the applicability of the maxim in the case at bar, the learned trial judge said:\nThat when the final phase of the journey (from Ingramport) began, the plaintiff was aware of the intoxicated condition of the defendant and of the character of his driving; she appreciated the risk of proceeding with him under those circumstances; and she knew that he was likely to continue his dangerous mode of driving and would not be deterred therefrom by protests from his passengers; and \u2022that with such knowledge \u2022of his condition and appreciation of the risk obviously incident to the driver's manner of driving, she freely and voluntarily accepted that risk by continuing with him as driver.\nIn my opinion, the learned trial judge does not address his mind to the proper point of time, namely, the inception of the defendant's undertaking which, at the latest, was the commencement of the journey at Chester on the morning of the accident. I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of my brother Rand and agree with him that that was the relevant time. In this view, I do not think it arguable that the situation was then such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion either that the plaintiff agreed to take upon herself the whole risk or that the defendant accepted her into his automobile on such a footing.\nIf this be so, then, again in agreement with my brother Rand, I do not understand how the defendant has established that, by reason of anything thereafter occurring, the terms of his undertaking were altered. The result is, as was the view of the court below, that the present is a case of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, who \"did not in her own interest take reasonable care of herself and contributed, by this want of \u2022care, to her own injury,\" to \u2022adapt the language of Viscount Simon delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Nance v. B.C. Electric Railway Co.[18]. The plaintiff had full opportunity to leave the car while it was stopped at Ingramport and she then had the knowledge of the facts and an appreciation of the risk to herself in continuing, which the learned trial judge has above described.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The learned trial judge found that the accident in which the respondent Thelma Seymour, to whom I will refer hereinafter as the respondent, suffered the grave injuries giving rise to this action, was caused by the gross negligence of the respondent Maloney, and this finding has been affirmed by the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court in banco and is not questioned on this appeal.\nUpon the issue as to whether the respondent had voluntarily assumed the risk attendant upon driving with Maloney when he was under the influence of liquor, the learned trial judge made the following finding:\u2014\nThat when the final phase of the journey (from Ingramport) began, the plaintiff was aware of the intoxicated condition of the defendant and of the character of his driving; she appreciated the risk of proceeding with him under those circumstances; and she knew that he was likely to continue his dangerous mode of driving and would not be deterred therefrom by protests from his passengers; and that with such knowledge of his condition and appreciation of the risk obviously incident to the driver's manner of driving, she freely and voluntarily accepted that risk by continuing with him as driver.\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court in banco has reversed this finding, the learned judges being all of the opinion that the defence volenti non fit injuria had not been made out.\nUnder Order LVII, Rule 1, of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, all appeals to the court are by way of rehearing, the rule being a replica of Order LVIII, Rule 1 of the Supreme Court in England. Rule 5 of the same Order declares that on the appeal the court shall have power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made. The corresponding rule in England is Rule 4 of Order LVIII. In Powell v. Streatham Manor[19], Lord Atkin, speaking of the English Rules referred to, said in part:\u2014\nI wish to express my concurrence in the view that on appeals from the decision of a judge sitting without a jury the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is free and unrestricted. The Court has to rehear, in other words has the same right to come to decisions on the issues of fact as well as law as the trial judge.\nThis statement which expresses the opinion \u2022of the House was followed by a statement as to the considerations which apply when the findings at the trial turn on the conflicting testimony of witnesses and their credibility.\nIn the present matter, the question as to whether or not the respondent \"freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk\" she ran \"impliedly agreed to incur it\", the test approved by the Judicial Committee in Letang v. Ottawa Electric Railway Company[20], was one of fact. As to the veracity of the respondent, the learned trial judge said that, having observed her closely at the trial and having since scrutinized her evidence with great care, he had come to the conclusion that she was a truthful witness in the main, but that her evidence as to the character \u2022of the various protests as to the speed of the car made by herself and the other passengers was not too reliable. In my opinion, the question as to whether the evidence showed that the plaintiff had given a real consent to the assumption of the risk, absolving the defendant from the .duty to take the limited degree of tare imposed upon him by s. 183 of the Motor Vehicles Act (c. 6, .1932), did not in this case depend upon the views of the trial judge as to the respondent's veracity, but rather upon the inferences to be drawn from facts which were not in dispute.\nIn exercising the powers vested in the learned judges who heard this appeal to draw inferences of fact, they have unanimously concluded that the necessary agreement to support the plea had not been made out. This conclusion, as is indicated by the reasons for judgment delivered, has been reached after the most careful examination and consideration of the evidence and is not based upon the opinion of the members of the court as to the credibility of the plaintiff on any matter which would, in my opinion, affect the issue. In these circumstances, I think that finding should not be interfered with in this Court.\nUpon the issue of contributory negligence, I agree that it was shown that the respondent did not, in her own interest, take reasonable care of herself and had contributed by this want of care to her own injury, to adopt the language of Viscount Simon in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway[21]. I think we should not interfere with the apportionment of liability made by the judgment appealed from.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts are stated and the applicable authorities are collected and discussed in the reasons of other members of the Court, all of which I have had the advantage of reading, and I propose only to state shortly the conclusions at which I have arrived.\nI agree with my brother Rand that the question to be answered in deciding whether the defence of volenti non fit injuria was established in this case is whether the defendant can reasonably be heard to say, as an inference from the facts, that the risk of injury from his own misconduct was required by him to be and was accepted by the complainant as a term of his undertaking to carry her gratuitously; and I agree that, on the evidence, the answer should be in the negative and that accordingly the defence mentioned should be rejected.\nAs to the defence of contributory negligence, it will be observed that the respondent plaintiffs do not question the decision of the Court en bane attributing 25% of the responsibility for the accident to the infant plaintiff. I can find nothing in the evidence to warrant interference with the apportionment made by the learned trial judge and concurred in by the Court en banc.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.

Estey J. died before the delivery of the judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCrown lands\u2014Lease\u2014Transfer of leased land from Dominion to Province\u2014Whether Province entitled to alter terms of lease on renewal\u2014Whether compromise agreement enforceable\u2014Railway Belt Re-transfer Agreement Act, 1930 (B.C.), c. 60; 1930 (Can.), c. 37; 1930 (Imp.), c. 26.\nIn 1910, the predecessors in title of the respondent obtained two renewable quarrying leases from the Dominion for 21 years, at a fixed rental, the lessees covenanting to observe regulations made from time to time. There was no mention of royalty. In 1930, the lands subject to the leases were, by statute, vested in the Province of British Columbia, the Province being bound to carry out the leases. When the respondent applied to the Province in 1931 for renewal, the latter claimed the right to vary the rental and to impose a royalty. A compromise agreement was made providing that the leases would be \"thereafter subject to adjustment . . . both with regard to rental and to royalty\". The rental was subsequently increased and a royalty was demanded. The respondent paid the increased rent only and sued the Province for a declaration that it was not liable for the royalty. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal for British Columbia held the compromise to be ultra vires the Province and maintained the action.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed. The agreement by way of compromise was not ultra vires the Province. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming the judgment at trial in a declaratory action.\nD. N. Hossie, Q.C. for the appellant.\nA. Bull, Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This appeal may be disposed of on a short ground. The parties compromised a dispute which had arisen between them and the terms thereof appear in the following endorsement on each lease:\u2014\nRenewed for a period of twenty-one years from June 20, 1931, at a rental of one dollar per acre per annum, free from royalty, for the first five years and thereafter subject to adjustment for each successive five year period both with regard to rental and royalty.\nI agree with the trial Judge that there is no uncertainty about this agreement and that its terms gave the Minister power to vary the rentals and impose a variable royalty in order to have the leases conform with similar leases granted by him. There was a dispute, as to which the Minister believed he was in the right, and, therefore, the easing of the provisions in favour of the respondent constituted good consideration. Under these circumstances there appears to be no doubt as to the law which, for present purposes, is sufficiently stated in para. 203 of Vol. VII of the Second Edition of Halsbury's Laws of England.\nThe respondent succeeded in the Courts below on the ground that the agreement was ultra vires the Province. This, however, is not a case of an attack on legislation enacted by the Legislature. In Attorney General of Canada v. Western Higbie and Albion Investments, Ltd.[2] , it was held that para. 4 of a certain British Columbia Order-in-Council was an admission by the executive authority of the Province that certain harbours were \"public harbours\" within the meaning of Item 2 of Schedule 3 of The British North America Act, 1867. While that was a case of the power of the executive to make an admission, the circumstances, here present, that it might be held if action had then been taken that the Province could not insist upon altered terms, does not affect the matter. The decision of this Court in Anthony v. Attorney General for Alberta[3] , is quite distinguishable, as Alberta's claim had not been agreed to by the other party. In Attorney General for Alberta v. West Canadian Colleries, Ltd. et al. and Attorney General for Manitoba and another[4] , s. 8 of an Alberta statute of 1948 was \"a naked assertion\" that the terms of pre-1930 Dominion leases and grants could be wholly disregarded (p. 549). Here there was no such attempt, but a bona fide agreement was entered into by two parties, each of which was capable of so contracting.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock, Locke, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The liability asserted by the appellant herein to rest upon the respondent depends, in the first place, upon the binding nature or otherwise of an agreement of compromise made at the time of renewal by the province of two quarrying leases made on August 13, 1910 by Canada to predecessors in title of the respondent, and, in the second place, upon the proper construction of that agreement.\nEach lease was for a term of twenty-one years from June 20, 1910, at an annual rental of $1 per acre,\nrenewable for a further term of twenty-one years, provided the lessee can furnish evidence satisfactory to the Minister of the Interior to show that during the term of the lease he has complied fully with the conditions of such lease, and with the provisions of the regulations regarding the disposal and operation of quarrying allocations which may have been made from time to time by the Governor in Council.\nThe leases were granted pursuant to regulations passed by virtue of s. 4 of the Dominion Lands Act, 7-8 Ed. VII, c. 20, which authorized the Governor in Council \"from time to time to make such regulations for the survey, administration and disposal\" of the lands as \"he deemed suited to the conditions thereof.\" While by the terms of the regulations, as well as by the leases themselves, the lessee was required to keep books showing the quantities of material obtained under the leases, to make returns as to its working and operations and to \"abide by all the obligations, conditions, provisoes and restrictions in or under the said regulations imposed upon lessees or upon the said lessee\", neither in the leases nor in the applicable regulations is there any mention of royalty.\nBy an agreement between the Dominion and the province under date of the 20th of February, 1930, validated by Imperial, Dominion and provincial legislation, the interest of the Dominion in these and other lands was vested in the province upon terms, inter alia. binding the province to carry out, in accordance with the terms thereof, \"every contract to purchase or lease any interest in the lands transferred and every arrangement whereby any person had become entitled to any interest therein as against Canada.\"\nSubsequent to the expiry of the original term, negotiations took place between the respondent and the province as to renewal. The province claimed to be entitled to stipulate that the rent should be \"subject to adjustment\" for each succeeding five-year period after the first five years of the renewal term and that the lessee should pay a royalty of five cents per cubic yard on all material removed, it being contended that such right had pertained to the Dominion upon the proper construction of the regulations as well as the provision as to renewal in the leases themselves, and that the province had succeeded to the rights of Canada under the terms of para. 4 of the Dominion-Provincial agreement, which provides that\nany power or right which, by any agreement or other arrangement relating to any interest in the lands hereby transferred or by any Act of Parliament relating to the said lands, or by any regulation made under any such Act, is reserved to the Governor in Council, or to the Minister of the Interior or any other officer of the Government of Canada, may be exercised by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province in Council or by such officer of the Government of the Province as is authorized to exercise similar powers or rights under the laws of the Province relating to the administration of Crown lands therein.\nThe respondent's solicitors took the position that neither under the terms of the leases nor the regulations had the Dominion reserved any power to alter the rent or impose any royalty, and they threatened proceedings to compel the issuance of the renewals in accordance with their view of the respondent's rights. In the result, a compromise was arrived at and embodied in an endorsement on each lease as follows:\nRenewed for a period of twenty-one years from June 20, 1931, at a rental of one dollar per acre per annum, free from royalty, for the first five years and thereafter subject to adjustment for each successive five year period both with regard to rental and royalty.\nWhile in the correspondence prior to the making of this agreement the province had stated that provincial regulations were in force providing for the payment of royalties, that was not the fact, but the parties have made no point of this in argument before us. That this matter may have been the subject of discussion when the agreement of compromise was entered into, is perhaps indicated by the letter of May 16, 1932, to the respondent from the provincial Superintendent of Lands which does not refer to any provincial regulations but to the understanding arrived at between the parties that the respondent had \"no objection to the principle of the conditions attached to all Provincial leases of this nature.\" These conditions were inserted in provincial leases by the Minister of Lands under the authority of s. 80 of the Provincial Lands Act; R.S., 1924, c. 131.\nUpon the expiry of the first five years of the renewal period, the province advised the respondent that thereafter the leases would be subject to royalty, but this claim was waived for a further five year period when the province increased the rental and demanded payment of royalty. The increased rental has been in fact paid so that no question arises with regard to it. The royalty, however, has not been paid.\nThe respondent contends that the agreement of compromise was without consideration in that the leases themselves and the Dominion regulations properly construed conferred no right upon the Dominion and therefore none on the province, to insist upon the inclusion of a term as to royalty. The respondent thus seeks to revert to the position taken by it when the discussion arose which eventuated in the compromise. It is further contended that the compromise itself did not, properly construed, impose liability for royalty upon the respondent but amounted to no more than an agreement to discuss. The learned trial judge was of opinion as a matter of construction that the agreement did obligate the respondent to pay, with which opinion I agree, and that the province, at the time the agreement was negotiated, entertained a reasonable hope that its contention would be maintained if litigated and that it had an honest belief in its chances of success. He therefore concluded that the endorsement on the leases constituted a binding compromise, and authorized the increase in rental and imposition of the royalty \"unless it was ultra vires the Province.\"\nAs to this, the learned judge was of opinion that, upon the proper construction of the terms of the leases and the regulations, the position taken by the province in 1931 as to its rights was, in reality, untenable in law, and that because the obligation of the province toward the respondent under the Dominion-Provincial agreement of 1930 had been constituted by statute, \"the compromise, if not illegal, was at least beyond the powers of the Minister and the Province, and was therefore invalid.\" The learned judge saw no distinction in principle between unilateral action on the part of a province by way of legislation which proved ultimately to be ultra vires as in opposition to the terms of the statutory agreement between the Dominion and the province and an agreement between a province and a lessee arrived at by way of composition of conflicting views as to the proper construction of that agreement and the rights thereby accruing to each.\nThe learned judge said:\nThe present case is one of the Province of British Columbia asserting and thereby exacting by compromise rights which it did not enjoy under the original lease, or the Railway Belt Agreement, by which it nullified in part its obligation under clause 3 of the latter agreement to carry out the lease granted by the Dominion according to its terms, and the Plaintiff's rights under those contracts.\nThere is no distinction in principle. The Imperial Act and the Statute of Canada confirming the Railway Belt Agreement imposed the same constitutional limitation on the prerogative of the Crown, in the right of the Province of British Columbia, that Natural Resources Agreement and the confirming Statutes imposed on the authority of the Alberta Legislature; in neither case would the consent of the contracting parties allow the Province to break the bounds imposed by that limitation. In this view, for which he found support in the decision of this court in Mark Anthony v. Attorney General of Alberta[5] , the learned judge decided:\nIt is unnecessary to consider whether the Province and the lessee could amend the leases without the authority of Dominion and Provincial legislation by an agreement fairly and freely made to meet their mutual requirements under circumstances which did not involve a compromise of untenable claims made by the Province in conflict with the Railway Belt Agreement.\nThis judgment was upheld on appeal[6] , O'Halloran J.A., who wrote the judgment of the court, stating:\nOnce it appears, therefore, that the Province has no power to impose a royalty on the leased lands, it is beyond the capability of the Province, or of any official on its behalf, to enter into an agreement in virtual effect forcing the Respondent to subscribe to payment of a royalty which there was no power in the Province to demand.\nIf, therefore, it is argued that a compromise agreement came out of such conditions it becomes apparent that such compromise agreement must be invalid and not binding on the Respondent, because the subject-matter of such attempted agreement was ultra vires the Province to bring into being. Since the subject-matter never could have had a legal existence, there remains no foundation for an agreement; in short, there could not be an agreement.\nWhat is, in effect, being said by both these learned judges is that, having construed the terms of the leases and the regulations and come to the conclusion that the province was wrong in law in the view taken by it in 1931 when the compromise was entered into, the province lacked the capacity which an ordinary individual, entertaining an honest opinion as to the construction of an instrument or a statute and his rights arising thereunder, would have had to compromise a dispute with a person holding a conflicting view of such rights. In forming his own opinion on the question of construction in the case at bar, the learned judge himself had \"not found it easy to decide whether the terms of the original lease authorized a subsequent imposition of royalty or increase in rent.\"\nI find it impossible to agree with the view upon which the courts below have proceeded. It clearly cannot be said that the province was without capacity to accept a surrender of even the entire interest of the respondent in the leases nor of something less than the entire interest had such been proferre Nor can it be said that the province was without capacity bona fide to place its interpretation on the terms of the leases and the regulations even though such interpretation might subsequently be found to be in error. In my opinion, this is self-evident and any question of constitutional limitation on the part of the province does not arise. The question involved is merely as to whether or not the agreement of compromise was validly arrived at, the test not differing in the case at bar from that which applies as between individuals. What is really being said by the learned judges below is that a claim which may subsequently be determined to be unfounded in law, cannot validly form the basis of an agreement of compromise. That was undoubtedly the law formerly, as the earlier authorities show. But it has not been the law for a considerable period.\nIn Cook v. Wright[7] , the plaintiffs, trustees under a local Act, had called upon the defendant, who was not the owner but the agent of the owner, of certain houses, to pay expenses chargeable under the statute to the owner. The defendant attended a meeting of the trustees at which he advised them that he was not the owner and gave them the name of his principal. The trustees, however, took the position that the defendant was the owner within the statutory definition of that term and advised him that unless he paid he would be proceeded against. As a result, a compromise was entered into under which the defendant agreed to pay.\nIt was held that although the defendant was not personally liable under the statute, the plaintiffs honestly believed that he was and that was sufficient even although the defendant himself never did so believe but entered into the agreement in order to avoid being sued. Blackburn J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 324:\nThe real consideration, therefore, depends not on the actual commencement of a suit, but on the reality of the claim made, and the bona fides of the compromise.\nIt will be observed that in this case the dispute between the parties was, as in the case at bar, namely, the construction of a statute.\nAgain, in Callisher v. Bischoffsheim[8] , the plaintiff, alleging that certain monies were due and owing to him from the Government of Honduras, threatened legal pro- ceedings to enforce payment, whereupon the defendant promised to deliver to him certain securities provided he would forbear taking proceedings for an agreed time. It turned out that in fact there were no monies owing by the Honduras Government but that the plaintiff honestly believed there were. The defendant was held liable. Cockburn C.J., said, at p. 452:\nEvery day a compromise is effected on the ground that the party making it has a chance of succeeding in it, and if he bona fide believes he has a fair chance of success, he has a reasonable ground for suing, and his forbearance to sue will constitute a good consideration\u2026.\nIt would be another matter if a person made a claim which he knew to be unfounded, and, by a compromise, derived an advantage under it: in that case his conduct would be fraudulent.\nBlackburn J., said also, on the same page:\nIf we are to infer that the plaintiff believed that some money was due to him, his claim was honest, and the compromise of that claim would be binding, and would form a good consideration, although the plaintiff, if he had prosecuted his original claim, would have been defeated.\nIn Miles v. New Zealand Alford Estate Company[9] , Cotton L.J., at p. 283, put the matter thus:\nNow, what I understand to be the law is this, that if there is in fact a serious claim honestly made, the abandonment of the claim is a good \"consideration\" for a contract; \u2026Now, by \"honest claim\", I think is meant this, that a claim is honest if the claimant does not know that his claim is unsubstantial, or if he does not know facts, to his knowledge unknown to the other party, which shew that his claim is a bad one. Of course, if both parties know all the facts, and with knowledge of those facts obtain a compromise, it cannot be said that that is dishonest. That is, I think, the correct law, and it is in accordance with what is laid down in Cook v. Wright and Callisher v. Bischoffsheim and Ockford v. Barelli (20W.R. 116).\nBowen L.J., in the same case said at p. 291:\nI think therefore that the reality of the claim which is given up must be measured, not by the state of the law as it is ultimately discovered to be, but by the state of the knowledge of the person who at the time has to judge and make the concession.\nThe learned Lord Justice went on to say:\nOtherwise you would have to try the whole cause to know if the man had a right to compromise it, and with regard to questions of law it is obvious you could never safely compromise a question of law at all. Again, in Jayawickreme v. Amarasuriya[10] , Lord Atkinson, speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee said, at p. 873:\nThe legal validity or invalidity of the claim the female plaintiff threatened to enforce by action is entirely beside the point if she, however mistakenly bona fide, believed in its validity.\nThe effect of the authorities was thus expressed by Lord Westbury in Dixon v. Evans[11] , as follows:\nIn dealing with a compromise, always supposing it to be a thing that is within the power of each party, if honestly done, all that a Court of Justice has to do is to ascertain that the claim or the representation on the one side is bon\u00e2 fide and truly made, and that on the other side, the answer, or defence, or counter claim, is also bon\u00e2 fide and truly made. I mean by bona fides, the truth of parties, and above all this, that the compromise is not a sham, or an instrument to accomplish or to carry into effect any ulterior or collateral purpose, but that the thing sought to be done is within the very terms of the compromise\u2014that all that the parties contemplate and desire to effect and to deal with is, whether the claim on the one side or the defence on the other side shall be admitted or not; or whether, if both things are bon\u00e2 fide brought forward, there may not be some concession on the one side, and some concession on the other side, so as to arrive at terms of agreement, which, if honestly made, is an honest settlement of an existing dispute. That is the characteristic of a compromise, and if it be not manifestly ultr\u00e0 vires of the parties, it is one that a Court of Justice ought to respect, and ought not to permit to be questioned.\nThe last mentioned case affords an illustration of a situation in which one of the parties to a compromise (there the directors of a corporation), may lack capacity to enter into a particular agreement. Reference may also be made to Holsworthy Urban District Council v. Rural District Council of Holsworthy[12] . In the present case no such question arises.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the compromise here in question fully meets the requirements of the authorities. There was, as the learned trial judge found, an honest difference of opinion as to the construction of the leases and the regulations to which they were subject. Although the respondent was at the time acting under the advice of solicitors and had been advised that it was entitled to receive renewals free from the claims being put forward by the province, it saw fit to enter into the compromise which involved concessions on both sides. In these circumstances, as it cannot be said, in my opinion, that the provincial claims were either frivolous or vexatious or other than \"real\" within the meaning of the authorities, the compromise was a binding one.\nIn my opinion also, the decision of this court in Anthony v. Attorney General for Alberta affords no support for the judgments below. The licensee in that case, while he had accepted renewals from the province in which a reference to the Provincial Lands Act was substituted for the Dominion Lands Act, and regulations passed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council for the former Dominion regulations, was held not to have consented by such acceptance to any alteration in the agreement with the Dominion which would vest in the province a right to destroy or nullify indirectly the contract which he had with the Dominion Government. The consent, therefore, which was in question in that case did not, in the view of the court, involve a consent to the claim which the province was there putting forward, namely, a claim to exact fees which, as the court found, amounted to a destruction of the grants themselves. The decision, therefore, has no application in the case at bar where the claim which the province is asserting was covered by an express term of the agreement of compromise.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. N. Hossie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G. E. Housser.\nREPORTER'S NOTE: Following the handing down of the judgment on March 2, 1956, Mr. R. G. McClenahan, appearing for both parties, moved on March 15, 1956, to vary the judgment as to the disposition of costs in view of the provisions of the Crown Costs Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 85. The motion was granted and the Court ordered that the judgment be amended to read as follows: \"The appeal is allowed and the action dismissed.

They entered into an agreement providing for the managing, renting, improving and repairing of the property; all the costs of the repairs were to be provided by the respondent, and W.Z. covenanted to repay his proportionate share ; the agreement also provided for a semi-annual accounting and division of the net rentals. Mutual rights of preemption were also provided. The respondent filed a caveat specifying as the interest which he claimed his right of pre-emption. The agreement was later amended to prohibit the sale of the interest of either party without the consent of the other. A caveat was filed by the respondent to protect his interest under the amending agreement but after W.Z. had transferred his interest for good consideration to the appellants and they had received certificates of title. At the time of the transfer W.Z. had not paid his proportionate share of the repairs to the respondent.\nThe respondent commenced this action after being required by the appellants to take proceedings on the two caveats. The appellants counter-claimed for a declaration that they had acquired a good title and for an accounting. In this Court, there was no question of fraud on the part of the appellants nor of setting aside the transfer to them; but the respondent contended, as was held by the trial judge and the Appellate Division, that the appellants' title was subject to a lien or charge for the proportionate share of the repairs owed by W.Z.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, and it should be declared that the appellants have a good title free from the claims asserted in the caveats and in the agreements. The purpose of filing a caveat is to give notice of what is claimed. If an unregistered document gives a party more rights than one in a parcel of land and such party files a caveat claiming one only of such rights, any person proposing to deal with the land is entitled to assume that the claim expressed is the only one made. Even if the caveats were to be regarded as claiming every interest conferred on the respondent by the agreement, on. its proper construction, the agreement gave the respondent no interest in or charge on W.Z.'s share in the land other than the first right to purchase, which the respondent no longer seeks to enforce.\nApart from contract the right of a tenant in common who has made repairs to the property of which his co-tenant has taken the benefit is limited to an equitable right to an accounting which can be asserted only in a suit for partition; he does not acquire a lien or charge on the property itself. Even if the respondent had acquired an equitable charge on W.Z.'s interest, s. 189 of the Land Titles Act provides in plain words that as purchasers from a registered owner the appellants (fraud having been negatived) would take free from such a charge unless registered, even if they had notice of it.\nThe fact that the agreement was expressed to be binding upon the assigns of the parties does not assist the respondent, since the covenant to pay for repairs, being positive, would not run with the land and there is no question of novation.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, affirming, with a variation, the judgment at trial continuing a caveat on the appellants' title to an interest in land.\nW. G. Morrow, Q.C. for the appellants.\nL. D. Hyndman, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J.:\u2014On and prior to June 23, 1951 the respondent was the registered owner of an undivided 213\/332 interest in a parcel of land in Edmonton known as the Craig Nair block and his brother William Zawick was the registered owner of the remaining 119\/332 interest therein. The building on this land was in a run down condition and the income therefrom was not sufficient to pay the carrying charges. Apparently the respondent had the necessary financial resources to undertake the renovation of the building and William Zawick had not. Following some negotiations they entered into an agreement under seal dated and executed on June 23, 1951, made between the respondent of the first part and William Zawick of the second part, the recitals and terms of which are as follows:\u2014\nWHEREAS the parties hereto are now the owners of the Craig Nair Block situate on part of Lot \"H\" River Lot 10, Plan \"A\", Edmonton, the said First Party owning an undivided 213\/332nds thereof and the Second C Party owns the remaining 119\/332nds thereof.\nAND WHEREAS the First Party also owns the business and assets formerly carried on by Georgia Cafe Limited in the said building;\nAND WHEREAS there is pending in the Supreme Court of Alberta an action between the parties hereto and others and the parties hereto have agreed to settle such action;\nNOW THEREFOR IN CONSIDERATION OF the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree each with the other as follows:\u2014\n1. Each of the parties hereto agree that the agreement of sale dated 24th August 1948 made by the Second Party as Vendor to the First Party as Purchaser in respect of the Second Parties estate and interest in the said Craig Nair Block premises be and the same is hereby cancelled and determined.\n2. It is agreed that as from the date hereof the Party of the First Part shall be the Manager of the said Craig Nair Block premises and shall have full authority and discretion to repair and fix up the said building and to rent the same and\/or all parts thereof upon such terms and conditions as the First Party may deem fit; and to collect all rents therefrom and out of the moneys collected pay all taxes, fire insurance premiums and costs of repairs and upkeep thereof, and the Party of the Second Part agrees not to interfere with the Party of the First Part's management thereof so long as such management is efficient.\n3. The Party of the First Part will at least twice in each year prepare in writing statements showing all receipts and disbursements which the Party of the First Part may receive or pay out, and deliver a copy thereof to the Party of the Second Part.\n4. The Party of the First Part will at least twice in each year divide any net profits from the renting of the said Block, paying 119\/332nds thereof to the Party of the Second Part and the remaining 213\/332nds thereof to himself the Party of the First Part.\n5. The Party of the First Part agrees to open a separate Bank Account in the Bank of Toronto, Edmonton, and deposit therein all rents and other receipts from the said Block and pay all expenses in connection therewith by cheques drawn against said Bank Account.\n6. The Party of the Second Part agrees to vacate and deliver up possession of all parts of the said Block now in his possession to the Party of the First Part.\n7. The Party of the First Part hereby releases all claims which he may now have or be entitled to against the Party of the Second Part in respect of any and all rents in respect of the said Block up to the date hereof.\n8. Each of the parties agree to the said action now pending in the Supreme Court of Alberta, Action No. 40979, be discontinued, including Counterclaim, and that each of the parties hereto pay their own respective costs of their respective solicitors. 9. The Party of the Second Part agrees to pay and contribute to the Party of the First Part 119\/332nd share of all costs of repairing the said Block.\n10. It is agreed that the term of this agreement shall be for a term of five years ending oh the 31st day of August, 1956 or until the parties hereto mutually agree to the determination thereof prior thereto provided that should either party make a bona fide sale of his interest in said property the party selling may cancel this agreement on thirty (30) days' notice to the other party.\n11. If either party desires to sell his interest in said property he shall first offer it for one month to the other party at the price and on the terms he is willing to accept and if the other does not accept such offer within said period the party offering may proceed to sell to any other person, but no sale may be made to any other person at a price or on terms more favourable, without first again offering it to the other at such better price and terms.\n12. The terms, covenants and provisions of this agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon each of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\nAt the date of this agreement William Zawick was occupying some of the rooms in the Craig Nair Block and he continued to do so for a few months thereafter. The respondent arranged with a contractor to undertake the renovation and repair of the building; the work was done during the period from February 1952 to May 1952 at a cost somewhat in excess of $20,000. According to the respondent's evidence the value of the property before the doing of this work was between $25,000 and $30,000 and after it was done was in the neighbourhood of $50,000.\nOn November 19, 1951 the respondent filed a caveat giving notice that he claimed an estate or interest in the Craig Nair Block, which was duly described by metes and bounds, and specifying that the estate or interest claimed consisted of the first right to purchase the 119\/332 share and interest of William Zawick in the premises described in the event of the said William Zawick desiring or deciding to sell his said share or interest therein, \"which said right has been granted by the said William Zawick to David Michael Zawick under an agreement in writing dated the 23rd day of June A.D. 1951, and which said agreement inter alia grants and provides:\u2014\" Immediately following the words just quoted the wording of paragraph 11 of the agreement is set out in full in the caveat. Apart from the use of the words \"inter alia\" the caveat makes no reference to any of the other terms of the agreement of June 23, 1951. On December 13, 1951, the respondent and William Zawick entered into a further agreement under seal reciting the agreement of June 23, 1951 and providing:\u2014\n1. Clause 10 of the agreement between the parties hereto dated June 23rd, 1951 is hereby cancelled and the following clause substituted in its place.\n10. It is agreed that the terms of this agreement shall be for a term of twelve years from the 23rd day of June A.D. 1951.\nClause 11 of the said agreement dated June 23rd, 1951 is cancelled and the following substituted in its place\u2014\n11. Neither party is to sell his interest in the said property without the consent of the other party.\nIn all other respects the parties hereto ratify and confirm the said agreement dated the 23rd day of June, A.D. 1951.\nBy transfer dated January 28, 1953, executed on behalf of William Zawick by his attorney Nicholas Hrehorick, William Zawick transferred his 119\/332 interest as to \u2154 thereof to the appellant Ruptash and as to \u2153 thereof to the appellant Lumsden. This transfer was apparently executed on the date which it bears as the attached affidavits are sworn on that date. In the affidavits of the transferor and of the transferee it is stated that the true consideration passing between the parties is $19,000 which is fairly apportioned between land and improvements as follows: Land $1,239.65, Improvements $17,760.35. It appears that of the $19,000, $4,637 was paid in cash and the balance of $14,363 by the transfer to William Zawick of a third mortgage held by the appellants on other property.\nBefore the completion of this purchase the solicitor who was then acting for William Zawick sent four letters to the respondent, dated November 2, 1951, August 5, 1952, September 17, 1952 and September 29, 1952; the last of these read:\u2014\nFurther to my letter of September 17, 1952, I have been instructed to inform you that William Zawick will be selling his shares in the Craig-Nair Block only for $19,000. If you wish to carry out your option you must notify me within 30 days, otherwise the share will be sold. To date you have ignored my correspondence.\nThe respondent denied having received any of these letters ; the learned trial judge found as a fact that he had received them all, but was of opinion that they failed to comply with the terms as to notice contained in the agreement of June 23, 1951 and were consequently ineffective. On May 1, 1953, the transfer from William Zawick to the appellants was registered in the Land Titles Office and on the same day a Certificate of Title was issued certifying that as to an undivided 238\/996 interest the appellant Mike Ruptash and as to an undivided 119\/996 interest the 'appellant William C. Lumsden were the owners of an estate in fee simple in the Craig Nair Block, subject to the caveat filed on November 19, 1951, and to an earlier caveat and a lease, as to which two last mentioned instruments no question arises in this appeal.\nOn May 27, 1953, the respondent filed a further caveat-claiming:\u2014\nan estate or interest in the 119\/332 thereof formerly registered in the name of William Zawick by virtue of an Agreement in writing made between myself of the one part and William Zawick of the other part, and dated the 23rd day of June, A.D. 1951, as varied and amended by a further agreement in writing dated the 13th day of December, 1951, made between myself and the said William Zawick under which we mutually covenanted and agreed each with the other that neither of us would sell our respective estates or interests in the hereinafter described property without the consent of the other and under such Agreement and amending Agreement I was appointed Manager of the said premises with full power and authority to fix up and repair the building situate thereon and to collect rents and pay liabilities, all as set forth in such agreement as amended and that the terms of such appointment and the other provisions of such agreement should continue and be in force for a term of twelve (12) years from the 23rd day of June, 1951, and whereby the said William Zawick further agreed to pay and contribute to me 119\/332 share of all costs of repairing such block.\nOn August 11, 1953, the appellants served on the respondent notices, pursuant to section 137 of the Land Titles Act, requiring him to take proceedings on both caveats. This action followed; and was tried before Primrose J. without a jury.\nIt is not necessary to review the pleadings, which were amended at the opening of the trial and again after all the evidence had been heard, as the issues presented to us are considerably narrower than those raised at the trial.\nThe learned trial judge expressly negatived the charges of fraud made against the appellants although he found that they deliberately refrained from making any inquiry into the state of the accounts between the respondent and William Zawick as to the operation of the block. He found that the appellants knew of the existence of the agreement of June 23, 1951 and the amending agreement of December 13, 1951, to the extent at least of knowing that the respondent was entitled to notice before William Zawick could sell his interest, \"although they did not make any specific inquiry or have the terms of the agreements fully explained to them by their solicitor\" ; and that the appellants intended the four letters referred to above to operate as compliance with the agreement of June 23, 1951 as to notice.\nThe learned trial judge held that the appellants could not be heard to say that paragraphs 10 and 11 of the agreement of June 23, 1951 were not effective at the date they obtained registered title since they were not willing to accept as effective the paragraphs substituted therefor by the amending agreement of December 13, 1951; that the agreement of June 23, 1951 in its original form must be regarded as binding in toto; that the respondent had a lien on the interest of William Zawick for the latter's proportionate share of the amount, expended by the former in repairs; that this lien bound the interests acquired by the appellants; that both the caveats should be maintained; that, subject to the caveats and subject to the agreement dated June 23, 1951 and all the rights of the respondent thereunder and the provisions therein contained, the title of the appellants to the undivided 119\/332 interest was a good and valid title ; that the respondent had the right to purchase the title acquired by the appellants from William Zawick at the same price and on the same terms as they had acquired it from William Zawick; that the respondent was entitled to contribution from the appellants of an amount equivalent to 119\/332 of the expenditures made by him on the block, such amount to be determined on an accounting by the Clerk of the Court; that all other questions of accounting between the parties should also be referred to the Clerk of the Court; and that the respondent should recover his costs of the action from the appellants. Judgment was entered accordingly.\nThe appellants appealed to the Appellate Division; and the respondent served a notice of intention to apply to vary the judgment of Primrose J. to provide that the appellants did not acquire a valid title from William Zawick and that the former title of William Zawick should be restored subject to the respondent's rights. The Appellate Division 2 varied the judgment of Primrose J. by striking out the declaration that the respondent was entitled to purchase the interest of the appellants in the block, and by depriving the respondent of the costs of the trial because of his having made charges of fraud which 'he failed to substantiate and because it was only after all the evidence had been heard that he amended the Statement of Claim to ask that it be declared, that he had a lien on the appellants' interest, and subject to such variations dismissed the appeal with costs.\nFrom this judgment the appellants appeal to this Court. The respondent did not serve any notice of cross-appeal or of intention to apply to vary the judgment of the Appellate Division but states his position in his factum as follows:\u2014\nTherefore, Respondent's position now is that the judgment of the Trial Judge as amended by the decision of the Appellate Division should be affirmed subject to the restoration to the Respondent of his costs of the trial.\nIn the result, William Zawick is not made a respondent in this Court; and there is now no question of setting aside the transfer of his interest to the appellants. The question to be determined is whether the title of the appellants is subject to a lien or charge in favour of the respondent for 119\/332 of the amount expended by the latter in repairing the buildings.\nIt is clear that the concurrent findings of fact absolving the appellants from fraud cannot be questioned successfully; and, that being so, the relevant facts are substantially undisputed. The appellants have purchased the 119\/332 interest in the block of which William Zawick was the registered owner ; accepting as accurate the valuation made by the respondent of the property after the completion of the repairs and improvements, the appellants have paid William Zawick the full value of his proportional interest in the improved property (subject only to the suggestion as to which no finding was made, that the mortgage which they assigned in part payment was not worth its face value) ; their transfer has been registered and they have received a certificate of title expressed to be subject only to the caveat dated November 19, 1951, referred to above. In these circumstances the appellants rely on the terms of s. 189 of The Land Titles Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n189. Except in the case of fraud no person contracting or dealing with or taking or proposing to take a transfer, mortgage, incumbrance or lease from the owner of any land in whose name a certificate of title has been granted shall be bound or concerned to inquire into or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which the owner or any previous owner of the land is or was registered or to see to the application of the purchase money or of any part thereof, nor shall he be affected by notice direct, implied or constructive, of any trust or unregistered interest in the land, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding; and the knowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\nFraud having been negatived it is argued for the appellants that they have obtained an indefeasible title to the 119\/332 interest in the block free of any unregistered interest of the respondent; that the lien which has been declared by the learned trial judge was not registered when they obtained title; that they had in fact no notice of its existence (if as between the respondent and William Zawick it did exist) ; and, that if they had had notice direct, implied or constructive, it would have been irrelevant in view of the express terms of s. 189.\nTo this two answers are made. First, it is said that the caveat of November 19, 1951 sufficiently protected the respondent's alleged lien and, secondly, that, quite apart from the effect of the caveat the provisions of The Land Titles Act, and particularly s. 189, have no application to the equities of tenants in common or to their consequent rights to liens. These will be considered in the order in which they are stated.\nSection 132 of the Land Titles Act provides that every caveat filed shall state, amongst other matters, \"the nature of the interest claimed\". The words, in which the nature of the interest claimed is stated in the caveat with which we are concerned, have already been quoted and limit the claim to \"the first right to purchase the interest of William Zawick\". No doubt the caveat protected that right but the respondent no longer seeks to enforce it. While such right was declared by the judgment at the trial it has been disallowed by the order of the Appellate Division and the respondent has not appealed from that order except as to the disposition of costs. It was suggested in argument that as the caveat made reference to the agreement of June 23, 1951, and stated that it granted the right claimed \"inter alia\", it had the effect of a caveat claiming every right conferred upon the respondent by such agreement. I am unable to accept this view. The purpose of filing a caveat is to give notice of what is claimed by the caveator against 'the land described. If an unregistered document in fact gives a party thereto more rights than one in a parcel of land and such party sees fit to file a caveat claiming one only of such rights it appears to me that any person proposing to deal with the land is entitled to assume that the claim expressed is the only one made. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. With the greatest respect for the contrary view expressed by the learned trial judge and the Appellate Division it is my opinion that the filing of the caveat was effective to protect only the respondent's first right to purchase the interest of William Zawick. If, contrary to the view which I have just expressed, the appellants were to be treated as having purchased subject to a caveat claiming every estate or interest in William Zawick's undivided share of the land conferred on the respondent by the agreement of June 23, 1951, I would be of opinion that on its proper construction such agreement gave the respondent no interest in or charge on William Zawick's share in the land, other than the first right to purchase.\nFor the purpose of construing it, I will assume, as was found by the courts below, that the agreement of June 23, 1951 in its original form remained binding notwithstanding the cancellation of paragraphs 10 and 11 thereof by the amending agreement. It is, I think, too clear for argument that the appellants were unaffected by the terms of the amending agreement of which no notice appeared on the registered title.\nThe only paragraphs affecting the question whether on its proper construction the agreement conferred upon the respondent any lien or charge on, or other interest in, the share in the land owned in fee simple by William Zawick appear to me to be the following:\u2014\nParagraph 2: The respondent is appointed manager of the premises with full authority (i) to \"repair and fix up\" the building, (ii) to rent the same, (iii) to collect all rents, (iv) out of the moneys collected, i.e., the rents, to pay all taxes, fire insurance premiums and costs of repairs and upkeep; but the continuance of this arrangement is to be so long only as such management is efficient.\nParagraphs 3 and 4 : There is to be a semi-annual accounting and division of net profits. This appears inconsistent with the view that the respondent was to be entitled to retain all the rents until he had recouped himself for his capital expenditure of over $20,000.\nParagraph 6: William Zawick agrees to vacate possession of all parts of the said building \"now in his possession\".\nParagraph 9 : William Zawick agrees to pay to the respondent 119\/332 of all costs of repairing the block.\nParagraph 10: The term of the agreement is to be five years; but it is of significance that either party may terminate it on 30 days notice in the event of making a bona fide sale of his interest.\nParagraph 11: Mutual rights of pre-emption are provided.\nIt will be observed; (i) that no charge or mortgage on William Zawick's share is given in express terms, nor is his share of the future rents assigned as security for payment of the sum which, in paragraph 9, he covenants to pay; nothing would have been simpler than to insert either or both of such provisions had they been intended by the parties; (ii) that the obligation undertaken by William Zawick under paragraph 9 is to pay 119\/332 of all costs of repairing and, as no time is stated in which such payment is to be made, the respondent could have brought action for the amount payable as soon as the repairs were completed; (iii) that the rights of termination of the contract contained in paragraphs 2 and 10 are inconsistent with the view that the respondent was to have a continuing charge on the rents.\nWith respect, I am unable to accept the view of the effect of paragraph 6 which was taken in the Appellate Division. As to this, Clinton Ford J.A., with whom Porter J.A. agreed, says:\u2014\nThe defendant, William Zawick, granted to his co-tenant, the plaintiff, sole possession <of the property held in common, thereby relinquishing to him his equal right of possession to the property; and also gave him the right as sole occupant and landlord to rent it and collect the rents, carrying with it the sole right to distrain for rents in arrear. He also gave to his co-tenant the right to repair and improve the property and charge such expenditures to the rents. I think that this created not only the legal right to sole possession, but also an equitable interest in the land, both properly protected by the caveat.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Alberta took the view that paragraphs 2 and 6 of the agreement constituted a lease of William Zawick's interest.\nRead in the context of the whole agreement, paragraph 6 appears to me to provide no more than that William Zawick was to relinquish to the respondent possession of those parts of the building of which he was in actual physical possession so that the contemplated repairs could be carried out. The provisions for termination of the respondent's powers and for periodical accounting and division of the proceeds of the property are, I think, inconsistent with the view that William Zawick was transferring his rights as a tenant in common or leasing his interest.\nFor the above reasons I conclude that on its proper construction the agreement did not by its terms grant any estate or interest to the respondent in the undivided share in the land owned by William Zawick or give him any charge thereon or any assignment of the future rents. It gave him rather a terminable right to manage the property and collect the rents on behalf of William Zawick as well as on his own behalf and the personal covenant of William Zawick to pay his proportionate share of the cost of the repairs.\nThis leaves for consideration the respondent's contention secondly mentioned above. This may be briefly stated as follows. Firstly, even if it should be held that the agreement of June 23, 1951, in so far as it relates to the repairing of the building, did not in terms give the respondent any charge on the undivided share owned by William Zawick but only his personal covenant to pay his proportion of the cost, it is clear that the repairs were made and paid for by the respondent with the consent and approval of William Zawick who accepted the benefit of the resulting increase in value of the property, and, in such circumstances, by operation of law an equitable lien on the undivided share owned by William Zawick was conferred upon the respondent until his claim for payment of the proportion of the cost of repairs chargeable to William Zawick was satisfied; and, secondly, even if it should be held that the caveat of November 19, 1951, was ineffective to protect or give notice of such lien, the title of the appellants is nonetheless subject to it as s. 189 of the Land Titles Act has no application to the equities of tenants in common or to their consequent rights to liens.\nThe first branch of this argument appears to have been accepted by Clinton Ford J.A. but not the second. The learned Justice of Appeal says in part:\u2014\nI do not think that the lack of a restrictive covenant running with the land could be said to over-ride what I have just concluded to be the rights of co-tenants to contract with respect to improvements and repairs to the premises held in common so as to bind themselves and their assignees who had actual knowledge of the agreement under a caveat filed pursuant to Section 131 of the Act.\nIn this connection I quote from Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 86, at p. 460:\u2014\nRecording laws have no application to the equities of tenants in common or to their consequent rights to liens. Where one co-tenant agreed to pay his proportionate share of necessary expenditures, but sold his interest without making payment thereof, his co-tenant has a lien on the interest conveyed for the amount due him.\nI think that the last part of this statement is true in this jurisdiction only where the purchaser had, as here, notice in accordance with the provisions of The Land Titles Act.\nImmediately after the passage from Corpus Juris Secundum quoted by Clinton Ford J.A. this sentence follows:\u2014\nWhile a proportionate share of necessary expenditures could have been impressed as a lien on the noncontributing cotenant's interest in the realty prior to conveyance of such interest to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, on failure to do so, the cotenant making the expenditure is merely a creditor of the noncontributing cotenant as against a purchaser of the latter's interest.\nand earlier on the same page there is the following statement:\u2014\nA claim for contribution does not of itself constitute a lien on the premises but only a right to have a lien decreed on a cotenant's interest for the protection of the claim against such cotenant.\nIn Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd Ed. Vol. 20, p. 573 under the title \"Lien\" the learned author says:\u2014\nThus a tenant in common has been held to have no lien against the share of his co-tenant for payments made for the benefit of the estate. I have examined all the cases cited as authority for this statement and they appear to me to support it. The contrary view which was expressed by Lord Hardwicke in Doddington v. Hallet 3, has been over-ruled by the cases collected in Halsbury at the page mentioned above.\nIn view of the wording of the passage from Corpus Juris Secundum quoted by Clinton Ford J.A. it may be observed that the following passage from the judgment of the Vice-Chancellor in Green v. Briggs 4, indicates that a different view of the law was adopted in America:\u2014\nThe case of Doddington v. Hallet was referred to in argument by the plaintiff's counsel, but only (as I understand) for the purpose of excluding the suggestion that the plaintiff relied upon it, or upon the doctrine it contains, for supporting his claim in this suit. I collect from Story on Partnership that upon principles of public policy and convenience, America has adopted Doddington v. Hallett. But, however that may be, it is certain that Lord Eldon, in Ex parte Harrison and in Ex parte Young deliberately overruled it.\nIn the case at bar the respondent had a contractual right to recover from William Zawick the latter's proportionate share of the moneys expended by the former on repairs. I have already stated my reasons for concluding that on its proper construction the contract did not create a lien or charge. The nature of the rights of the respondent apart from contract is, I think, accurately stated in the following passage from the judgment of Cotton L.J. in Leigh v. Dickeson 5:\nTherefore, no remedy exists for money expended in repairs by one tenant in common, so long as the property is enjoyed in common; but in a suit for a partition it is usual to have an inquiry as to those expenses of which nothing could be recovered so long as the parties enjoyed their property in common; when it is desired to put an end to that state of things, it is then necessary to consider what has been expended in improvements or repairs; the property held in common has been increased in value by the improvements and repairs; and whether the property is divided or sold by the decree of the Court, one party cannot take the increase in value, without making an allowance for what has been expended in order to obtain that increased value; in fact, the execution of the repairs and improvements is adopted and sanctioned by accepting the increased value. There is, therefore, a mode by which money expended by one tenant in common for repairs can be recovered, but the procedure is confined to suits for partition. Tenancy in common is an inconvenient kind of tenure; but if tenants in common disagree, there is always a remedy by a suit for a partition, and in this case it is the only remedy. In my opinion, apart from contract the right of a tenant in common who has made repairs to the property of which his co-tenant has taken the benefit is limited to an equitable right to an accounting which can be asserted only in a suit for partition; he does not acquire a lien or charge on the property itself. This view is I think supported not only by the English cases referred to in Halsbury but also by at least some of the American decisions referred to in Corpus Juris. For example, in Deitsch v. Long 6, one of the questions which arose was whether the purchaser in good faith of the share of one of several tenants in common took such share subject to a claim for contribution to the cost of repairs made prior to the transfer and which could have been enforced against the transferor by his co-tenants. In holding that the purchaser did not take subject to such claim it was said, per curiam, at page 917:\u2014\nThe persons seeking to impress their claims on the real estate conveyed were not at any time owners of any interest in the real estate conveyed but had only equitable rights for an accounting against the grantor, which, if they had pursued their remedies prior to the transfer, by proper proceedings in equity, could have had impressed as liens on the real estate conveyed. Hence they were creditors.\nThe second branch of this argument was not accepted by Clinton Ford J.A., as appears from the last sentence in the passage from his reasons last quoted above; he was however of opinion that the interest claimed by the respondent was sufficiently protected by the caveat filed.\nI have already indicated my reasons for holding that the caveat noted on the register when the appellants obtained title did not give notice of the claim for the proportionate share of the cost of repairs. It follows that the appellants are in the position of purchasers in good faith and for value who have obtained the legal title to the land formerly owned by William Zawick without notice of an equitable right claimed against him. While in my opinion that right was a personal one only and did not amount to a charge on the land, the appellants having acquired the legal estate would (fraud having been negatived) hold it free of an equitable charge of which they had no notice; this would be so apart from the provisions of the Land Titles Act; and s. 189 of that Act appears to me to provide in plain terms that as purchasers from a registered owner who have received a certificate of title they take free from such a charge, even if they had notice of its existence, unless it is registered. To hold that a purchaser from the registered owner of an undivided fractional share in a parcel of land is put upon inquiry as to the state of the accounts between his vendor and the latter's co-tenants and takes the land subject to a charge for the balance if any in favour of such co-tenants as of the date of purchase would, I think, be to disregard the plain wording of s. 189.\nThe fact that the contract of June 23, 1951, was expressed to enure to the benefit of and be binding upon each of the parties and their respective assigns does not assist the respondent, in the circumstances of this case, as the covenant to pay for repairs being positive would not run with the land and there is no question of novation. In the result the respondent is left to his rights against William Zawick personally under the contracts referred to above.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and substitute for the judgments below a judgment (i) declaring that the title registered in the name of the appellants is a good and valid title free from the claims asserted in caveats Numbers 7063 H.V. and 6823 J.H. and free from the claims of the respondent under the agreements of June 23, 1951 and December 13, 1951, (ii) directing that the said two caveats be expunged from the Register, and (iii) referring it to the Clerk of the Court to take the accounts between the appellants and the respondent in respect of the Craig Nair Block from January 28, 1953, pursuant to the applicable Rules of Court. The appellants are entitled to their costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Morrow & Morrow.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Harvie, Yanda & Nisbet.\n1 [1955] 15 W.W.R. 518; 4 D.L.R. 195.\n2 [19551 15 W.W.R. 518; 4 D.L.R. 195.\n3 (1750) 1 Ves.

The deceased, a member of the Toronto Flying Club Ltd., crashed and was killed when flying at night in an aircraft piloted by him and owned by the club. The respondent contested liability under the policy on the ground, inter alia, that the insured flying club had breached the warranty in the policy that \u201call air navigation and airworthiness orders and requirements issued by any competent authority should be complied with in every respect\u201d.\nThe Department of Transport had issued certificates authorizing this plane to fly by night \u201cfor instructional purposes only\u201d and further prohibiting the club from \u201cflying for recreational purposes by night\u201d.\nHeld (affirming the judgment at trial and of the Court of Appeal): That the appeal should be dismissed. The flight made at night by the deceased was not a training or instructional flight but a recreational one, and as such was prohibited as was the use of the aircraft.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the dismissal by the trial judge of an action upon a policy of aviation personal accident insurance.\nB.J. MacKinnon for the appellants.\nB.V. Elliot, Q.C. and W.L.N. Somerville for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The facts in this appeal can be briefly stated.\nThe action is one by appellants against the respondent under a policy of aviation personal accident insurance issued by the respondent, and arises out of the death of Kermit Ernest Bjorkman which occurred during the night of March 31-April 1, 1950, on a flight which he was making from Malton airport to Detroit, Michigan, via Buffalo. After leaving Buffalo at about 9.15 p.m. the deceased apparently encountered bad weather, lost his way, crashed into Lake Huron on the Michigan side, and was drowned.\nThe deceased was flying a single engine aircraft owned by appellant, Toronto Flying Club Limited, of which he was a member, and he had taken off from Malton airport at about 6.15 p.m. in the evening of March 31, 1950, on a flight which apparently he had planned to make to Wichita, Kansas, and return.\nThe policy covered \u201call persons riding in the Club\u2019s aircraft excluding Instructors\u201d. Unless otherwise provided by special endorsement, the policy excluded from the risk, loss sustained arising out of death or bodily injury while the insured was engaged in night flying, but in fact the policy did contain such an endorsement extending the risk to night flying \u201cprovided all such flying is carried out in accordance with the regulations of the Toronto Flying Club Limited\u201d.\nThe respondent contested liability under the policy on the principal grounds (1) that the onus was on the plaintiffs to establish compliance with the regulations referred to in the endorsement and that they had not discharged this onus; (2) that in any event the deceased had not complied with the regulations of the Flying Club respecting night flying as required by the endorsement and (3) that under the terms of the policy, the named insured, the Toronto Flying Club Limited, had \u201cwarranted that all air navigation and airworthiness orders and requirements issued by any competent authority should be complied with in every respect\u201d, and that this warranty had been breached.\nI find it necessary to deal only with this third defence.\nOn this aspect of the case a vital point to be determined, it seems to me, is whether the flight in question was an \u201cinstructional\u201d flight or a \u201crecreational\u201d flight. If it was in the latter category, I do not think the appellants can succeed.\nThe Certificate of Airworthiness issued by the Department of Transport for the plane flown by the deceased bore the following endorsement:\u2014\nValid for day flying only\nValid for night flying (instructional purposes only) 1\/12\/48 C.A.B. The Operating Certificate issued by the Department of Transport to the appellant club contained the following conditions:\u2014\n5. Special Conditions\n(1) Operations from Malton Airport are permitted as follows:\u2014\n(a) By day\u2014with aircraft equipped with a radio receiver capable of receiving radio telephone messages on the Malton Tower frequencies;\n(b) By night\u2014with aircraft equipped with functioning two-way radio capable of receiving and transmitting radio telephone messages on the Malton Tower Frequencies.\n(2) In addition to The Air Regulations governing night flight, cross-country nights by night are subject to the following conditions:\u2014\n(a) Authority to carry out Night Flying is to be obtained from the District Inspector, Air Regulations, and prior clearance is to be obtained from the Aerodrome Control Officer where aerodrome control is provided;\n(b) Night cross-country training nights may only be undertaken if:\u2014\n(i) the student is accompanied by an instructor holding a valid Public Transport Pilot\u2019s Licence;\n(ii) undeteriorating VFR weather conditions are forecast;\n(iii) the aircraft is equipped with functioning two-way radio capable of communicating with D.O.T. control towers and radio range stations;\n(iv) flight plans and arrival reports are filed.\n(3) Flying for recreational purposes by night is not permitted.\nAfter a careful consideration of all the evidence, I have regretfully reached the conclusion that the flight which the deceased made on the evening of April 1, 1950, was not a training or instructional flight, and as such permitted under Condition 5(2) of the Operating Certificate.\nThe Superintendent of Air Regulations of the Ontario District one D.W. Saunders testified that the type of flight upon which the deceased was engaged at the time of his death was not necessary for the purpose of qualifying him for the advanced certificate for which he had applied, and that he was at the time merely getting more experience. So far, therefore, as the ordinary meaning of the word \u201crecreational\u201d is concerned, the meaning which must be given to it in the certificate the flight on which the deceased was engaged was of a recreational nature.\nThe appellants tendered in evidence, subject to objection, a circular letter written some six months after the death here in question by the Secretary-Manager of the Royal Canadian Flying Clubs Association, in which he gives an interpretation of \u201crecreational flying\u201d which he had obtained from some unnamed officials of the Department of Transport to the effect that the meaning of the term as used in the certificate was \u201ccarrying passengers for hire or reward on sight-seeing flights.\u201d\nThe document was, in my opinion, inadmissible for the purpose for which it was tendered. Although Mr. Saunders placed the same meaning upon the term, he admitted that was merely his own interpretation and was not justified by anything in the Air Regulations. In the circumstances, I think the flight in question must be considered as having been a flight for \u201crecreational purposes\u201d which was prohibited under Condition 5(3) of the said certificate, as was the use of the aircraft under the certificate of airworthiness.\nOn this point I do not think there was any error in the judgment of the Court below and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Kennedy & Ross.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Kilmer, Rumball, Gordon & Beatty.\n[1] [1954] 3 D.L.R. 224.\n",

Lamport, [1956] S.C.R. 366\nDate: 1956-03-02\nThomas Ross (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nAllan Lamport (Defendant) Respondent.\n1955: December 13, 14, 15; 1956: March 2.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLibel and Slander\u2014Defamation\u2014Statements to reporters published in newspapers\u2014Whether all innuendos should have been placed before jury\u2014Whether words in relation to calling of plaintiff\u2014No actual damage shown\u2014Inflammatory address to jury\u2014Excessive damages awarded.\nThe appellant, a taxi cab driver and owner, brought this action for damages for libel and slander against the respondent who, at the time, was the Mayor of the City of Toronto and Chairman of its Board of Police Commissioners, a body responsible for the issuance or refusal of licences to taxi cab drivers and owners. The appellant had appealed successfully from a refusal by the Board to grant him a licence and had moved to commit the respondent for failing to comply with the decision of Lebel J. that a licence should be issued. Oral reasons given by the Chief Justice of the High Court in disposing of this motion were published in the press and contained statements which the respondent regarded as reflecting on himself and the Board. The respondent, in interviews with reporters from two newspapers commented on these statements and charged the appellant with, inter alia, \u201ctrafficking in licences\u201d. The interviews were reported in these newspapers. The trial judge ruled that the statements made by the respondent were published on an occasion of qualified privilege. The jury found that the words spoken referred to the appellant in his occupation, that in their natural and ordinary meaning they were defamatory of the appellant, that they were also defamatory of him in the sense ascribed to them in some of the innuendos pleaded, that they were published with express malice, and assessed the damages at sums totalling $40,000.\nIn this Court the respondent contended, as was held by the Court of Appeal, (1) that all the innuendos should not have been placed before the jury as the words published were not capable of bearing the meaning assigned to some of them, (2) that the words spoken were not in relation to the appellant in his calling and that no actual damage was shown, (3) that the address of counsel for the appellant had been inflammatory and (4) that the damages were excessive.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the new trial directed should be limited to the amount of damages. If the appellant does not elect to have his damages assessed only on the basis that the words were defamatory of him in their natural and ordinary meaning, the judge presiding at the new trial will decide on each innuendo as to whether the words are reasonably capable of the meaning ascribed and will instruct the jury accordingly.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Rand J.: In view of the position taken at the trial by counsel for the respondent where he sought to use all the innuendos in order to strengthen his argument that the respondent had brought himself within his claim of privilege and was therefore entitled to comment fairly on a matter of public interest, counsel cannot now change his ground and complain that one or more innuendos were not capable of the meaning ascribed.\nPer Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.: The course of the trial in regard to the submission of the innuendos to the jury was not satisfactory, and it has not been established that it was such as to preclude counsel for the respondent from relying on that ground of appeal.\nPer Curiam: Since the words \u201ctrafficking in licences\u201d clearly referred to the appellant in relation to his calling as a taxi cab driver and owner, they were actionable without proof of special damage.\nConsidering the circumstances, the address of counsel for the appellant to the jury was not inflammatory.\nIt cannot be said that the Court of Appeal was wrong in holding that the jury acting reasonably could not have awarded so large a sum. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], ordering a new trial in an action tried by a jury for damages for libel and slander.\nR.N. Starr, Q.C. for the appellant.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014In an action for libel and slander the plaintiff secured a judgment for $40,000 damages against the respondent upon the answers of the jury made to these questions:\u2014\n1. Were the words complained of spoken to:\n(a) Hamilton Yes\n(b) Belland Yes\n2. Did the defendant authorize or intend the publication of the words complained of\n(a) in Exhibit 2\u2014Globe and Mail Yes\n(b) in Exhibit 4\u2014Toronto Star Yes\n3. With respect to slander do the words refer to the Plaintiff in the way of his trade or calling? Yes.\n4. Are the words defamatory to the plaintiff\n(a) in their natural and ordinary meaning Yes\n(b) in any of the meanings attributed to them in the innuendo Yes\n5. Are the words in their natural and ordinary meaning true in substance and in fact? No\n6. In so far as the words are comment, are they fair comment on facts truly stated? No\n7. Was there express malice on the part of the defendant? Yes\n8. Damages:\nfor slander to Hamilton and\/or...........................................................\n2,500.00\nfor slander to Belland and\/or.............................................................\n2,500.00\nfor libel in Globe and Mail and\/or......................................................\n25,000.00\nfor libel in Toronto Star.......................................................................\n10,000.00\nWe find for the Plaintiff.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario1set aside the judgment and ordered a new trial generally, because, in the opinion of the Members of that Court:\u2014(1) The trial judge erred in allowing all the innuendos to be placed before the jury; (2) The address to the jury of Counsel for the appellant at the trial was inflammatory; (3) The damages awarded by the jury were so excessive as to amount to a wholly incorrect estimation. The plaintiff now appeals. The appellant\u2019s calling was that of a taxi driver and owner and the respondent was Mayor of Toronto and Chairman of the Board of Police Commissioners for the city. The appellant and one Smith had been partners in various taxi cab businesses and in 1950 these businesses were sold for a substantial sum. The necessary approval of the Board was given to the transfer of the licenses from the appellant and Smith. In the spring of the following year Smith obtained the Board\u2019s approval of the purchase by him of a business known as Imperial Taxi and in this new business the appellant was a partner.\nSmith was drowned in the autumn of 1951 and the appellant, in addition to doing what he could for Smith\u2019s widow, applied to the Board for a taxi cab license in his own name. This was refused, but, on appeal, Mr. Justice Lebel ordered the Board to issue the license. It becoming apparent that the Board did not intend to obey this order, a motion was launched to commit the Members of the Board who thereupon moved to rescind, or vary, the order of Lebel J. Both motions were heard before the Chief Justice of the High Court on the 29th and 30th of October, 1953. On the morning of the latter day Counsel on behalf of the Board Members undertook that the appellant would be granted the license if the appellant would withdraw the committal proceedings. An order was subsequently issued incorporating these terms and disposing of the question of costs which had been left by the parties to Chief Justice McRuer, but, in the meantime, on October 30, the respondent was interviewed by Hamilton, of the Globe and Mail newspaper, and by Belland, of the Toronto Star newspaper. The words spoken by the respondent to these men and the reports in the two newspapers contain the slanders and libels in issue.\nAs to the first point upon which the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment at the trial, I am of opinion that, in view of the position taken at the trial by Counsel for the respondent, the latter cannot change his ground and complain that one or more innuendos were not capable of the meaning ascribed. What occurred at the trial is set out at pages 340, 341 and 342 of the record at a point in the trial where Counsel for the respondent was seeking to use all the innuendos in order to strengthen his argument that the respondent had brought himself within his claim of privilege and was therefore entitled to comment fairly on a matter of public interest.\nAt this stage a point raised by Mr. Robinette may be dealt with. He argued that no actual damages having been proved, the spoken words were not said in relation to the appellant in his calling. The calling of the appellant was that of a taxi cab driver and owner and, in view of the authority conferred upon the Board in relation to licensing, the charge, as it appears in the defamations of \u201ctrafficking in licenses\u201d refers clearly, in my opinion, to the appellant in relation to his calling. The Board, including the respondent, had taken a decided stand with reference to people who, in their opinion, were obtaining licenses and then attempting to build up a good will, for both of which they might be able to obtain a substantial sum upon the transfer of the license, the approval of which transfer came under the jurisdiction of the Board. A license was necessary for the plaintiff to carry on a taxi business and the charge that he was trafficking in licenses, in my opinion, clearly brings the case within the well settled rule as set forth in the 3rd edition of Gatley on Libel and Slander, at pp. 61 et seq. Upon this point the 4th edition of this textbook must be read with care in view of The Defamation Act, 1952, which was enacted in Great Britain subsequent to the appearance of the 3rd edition. The decision of the House of Lords in Jones v. Jones[2], is distinguishable as is apparent from a reading of this part of the headnote:\u2014\nAn action of slander will not lie for words imputing adultery to a schoolmaster, in the absence of proof of special damage, unless the words are spoken of him touching or in the way of his calling.\nHere the defamations claimed show that there was nothing personal like that which occurred in the case of the schoolmaster but it affected the very means of livelihood of the appellant.\nThe Court of Appeal considered that the address of the appellant\u2019s Counsel had been inflammatory. It is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule, but it should be emphasized that in such an action as this the damages may be punitive and furthermore it must be remembered that by reason of the holding of the trial judge that the occasions were privileged, it was necessary to secure from the jury an affirmative finding that there was malice. The reference by Counsel for the appellant to the larger question of autocratic behaviour on the part of some Boards was made only to bring in the particular application of the words in issue in this litigation. Upon consideration of what was said by Counsel, I am, with respect, unable to agree that, considering the setting and all the circumstances, his address was inflammatory.\nFinally, the Court of Appeal considered that the amount awarded amounted to a wholly incorrect estimation. In Deutch v. Martin[3], this Court decided that:\u2014\nWhen an appellate court is considering whether a verdict should be set aside on the ground that the damages are excessive (there being no error in law), it is not sufficient for setting it aside, that the appellate court would not have arrived at the same amount; its rule of conduct is as nearly as possible the same as where the court is asked to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is against the weight of evidence; this is the rule in contract cases Mechanical and General Inventions Co. Ltd. v. Austin (1935) A.C., 346, at 378), and the same rule applies in cases of tort.\nIn the Mechanical case[4], Lord Wright referred to Praed v. Graham[5], where the Court of Appeal had refused to set aside a judgment in an action for damages for libel because they thought that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the damages were not so large that no jury could reasonably have given them. I would certainly not have awarded the substantial sums fixed by the jury in the present case, but that by itself is not sufficient and the question to be determined is whether the jury appreciating the evidence could reasonably have awarded the appellant the various amounts. My conclusion is that they could not.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and a new trial directed but only as to the amount of damages. The appellant has the finding of the jury in his favour that the words were defamatory of him in their natural and ordinary meaning and he may decide to have his damages assessed on that basis only. However, as a practical matter, if he elects to ask the jury for damages in the light of any of the innuendos set forth in the statement of claim, the presiding judge will decide in each case as to whether the words are reasonably capable of the meaning ascribed. Where he decides in the negative, that will be the end of the matter; but, where he decides in the affirmative, it will be left to the jury to assess the damages. The appellant should have his costs of the action down to and including the trial and the costs of the appeal to this Court, but the respondent should have his costs in the Court of Appeal. The costs of the new assessment of damages should be in the discretion of the presiding judge.\nRAND J.:\u2014This is an action for slander and libel. The respondent Lamport was mayor of Toronto when, in 1953, the Police Commission of which he was chairman was directed by an order of a judge of the High Court to issue a taxi-cab owner\u2019s license to the appellant Ross. The Commission did not comply with the order and a motion was made before the Chief Justice of the High Court to attach the respondent and one other member in contempt. At the same time a cross-motion was launched to set the order aside. By consent and on the undertaking of the Commission to issue the license both motions were dismissed except as to costs which were to be settled by the court. A direction that they should be paid by the Commission was accompanied by reasons which reviewed the facts of the controversy in detail. Upon these being called to his attention, the mayor in an interview gave out for publication, first, to a reporter of the Toronto Star newspaper and a few hours later to two representatives of the Globe and Mail, a violent criticism of the original order and of the reasons given by the Chief Justice. Included in the remarks were words to the effect that Ross had been guilty of \u201ctrafficking\u201d to his profit in taxi licenses and that the Commission had been acting in the best interests of the public in its refusal to issue one. This action was thereupon brought.\nThe jury found that the words had been spoken maliciously of Ross in the way of or relating to his occupation and were defamatory, and fixed the damages as follows: for the words spoken to the first reporter, $2,500 and for the publication in the Star $10,000; for the second communication, $2,500 and on the publication in the Globe and Mail $25,000. On appeal a new trial was directed. Mr. Robinette, for the respondent, supported that direction on four grounds: that of four innuendoes alleged, two were beyond any reasonable interpretation of the language used; that the words spoken were not in relation to Ross in his calling and that no actual damage was shown; that the address of counsel had been inflammatory; and that the damages were excessive.\nThe first of these objections is disposed of by what took place at the trial. The role of the court in dealing with innuendoes was expressly raised by counsel for Lamport at the trial, and the following exchange is sufficient to conclude the point taken:\nHIS LORDSHIP: Of course, if the jury comes to the conclusion\u2014if it is left to them, for instance, the innuendo in paragraph 5 that Ross had obtained in some way the good offices of the Chief Justice of the High Court, in my view I have grave doubts whether they believe that was a fact that would be germane to the business of his living.\nHON. MR. HAYDEN: My friend has set up that innuendo and there is no way in which\u2014that I know in law in which we can get the benefit of the opinion of the jury\u2014\nHIS LORDSHIP: Any defence\u2014\nHON. MR. HAYDEN: No, or even on the question of whether it is capable\u2014whether that innuendo has been established or not, because the verdict of the jury is a general verdict on the libel but I think your lordship has the right to determine whether or not the words in their natural and ordinary meaning are capable of a defamatory\u2014are capable of being said to be of a defamatory nature, and also I think your lordship is entitled to rule so far as the innuendo is concerned they are capable of such an innuendo, I think that is all part of the duty which your lordship has, but what I am arguing in connection with the qualified privilege is something more basic, your lordship\u2019s function as to determine whether or not qualified privilege exists on this occasion.\nThese remarks were made in the course of an argument which sought to bring all the innuendoes within the privilege of fair comment on a matter of public interest. For the purposes of the trial the respondent thus committed himself to allowing them to go to the jury as fair interpretations of the language used; and having done so, he cannot be heard to complain on appeal that they should have been withdrawn.\nThe second point presents a question of some nicety in the examination of which a distinction must be made between the several statements made. The main charge was that of \u201ctrafficking in licenses\u201d: could this be found to be a slander actionable without proof of actual damage? The law on this question was thoroughly reviewed by the House of Lords in Jones v. Jones[6], from which the scope and character of this genre of slander can be summarized as follows: words spoken of a person following a calling, imputing lack of fitness for or misconduct in the calling, are per se actionable. The statement here was expressly made of Ross and in its plain meaning it is directed to him in his calling. \u201cTrafficking in licenses\u201d implied both a lack of good faith toward the Commission and a direct object in obtaining licenses which the appellant knew to be in the face of its administrative policy, an object which would justify the Commission in refusing a license or a transfer. The business was the carrying of passengers and with that as the sole end in view; to enter upon it for the purpose of building up a quasi\u2011franchise that could be sold at a profit is, I should say, carrying on that business illegitimately and is misconduct in the course of it.\nThe cases in which difficulties have been encountered in this category have generally been concerned with moral or other delinquency not necessarily incompatible with the continuance of the calling but an imputation of which might have repercussions upon it. In them the courts have required that the imputation either by express reference or necessary implication touched the calling prejudicially, and it is argued that a license in no aspect can in the proper sense be said to do that to a taxi business. In considering this we must take the law of slander to be more than a mere series of specific and disparate rulings; as Lord Sumner in Jones v. Jones, supra, at p. 500, says:\nThe Court of Appeal in the present case says (1) \u201cthe law of slander is an artificial law\u2026 It is not like a law founded on settled principles, where the Court applies established principles to new cases, as they arise.\u201d I think this does the common law on the subject less than justice\u2026 (4) when words are spoken of a person following a calling, and spoken of him in that calling, which impute to him unfitness for or misconduct in that calling. The classification is one of words, not of persons, but it is a classification only. There is no reason why all four classes of words should be held to import legal damage for the same or for some analogous reason. I think these rules are as well established, as worthy of being called principles, and as capable of being applied to new cases when they arise, as are most rules or principles of law or equity. Perhaps they are neither ideally just nor ideally logical, but principles are like that. Apart from special cases, the consideration underlying oral defamation is that the language in the reasonable judgment of men could not but have a damaging effect on the person in the occupation he pursues; anything short of that would open the door to a flood of actions over mere \u201cwords\u201d which experience shows, for the most part, to be evanescent in effect. But the language before us describes not only misconduct but also a want of capacity: a license is as essential as the skill to drive, which also must be satisfactorily shown; and in this there is a clear analogy in the cases. A charge of insolvency spoken of a trader \u201ctouches a man in his trade because it is an attack upon a necessary part of his trading equipment\u201d: Lord Wrenbury in Jones v. Jones, supra, at p. 507: in like manner the license is a necessary part of the equipment of a taxi business; and both in this aspect and as misconduct, the imputation of trafficking takes us directly within the structure of the operations.\nOn the other hand the innuendoes imputing dishonesty toward the Chief Justice of the High Court in the application for attachment and that in some way Ross had succeeded in winning his good offices do not touch Ross, the taxi operator; their stigma affects him as a litigant and an individual. But, as Pickup C.J. says, the failure to make this distinction clear to the jury could have affected only the quantum of damages which will now be dealt with.\nThe third ground was argued as interlocked with the fourth. The inflammatory address was said to have produced damages beyond the limits of any reasonable relation to the offence and the authorities cited in support of the objection were, without exception, cases where the damages were found to be in that sense excessive. But the grounds are distinct and severable. An inflammatory address, in the proper understanding of that expression, is sufficient in itself to call for a re-assessment unless, among other things, it can be said that the amount awarded demonstrates that the jury could not have been influenced by it. But an excessive award as an individual objection must be examined from the standpoint of other considerations.\nOn the former ground I am constrained to observe that, as it was once, in effect, put in the Court of Appeal for Ontario by Riddell J.A., a lawsuit is not a tea party, and except where there has been a clear and objectionable excess, we should hesitate to put shackles on the traditional scope allowed counsel in his plea to the tribunal of his client\u2019s countrymen. The attempt to divest a trial of any feeling would not only be futile but might defeat its object which is to ascertain the reality of past events. In libel damages can be punitive or exemplary, and malice can be an ingredient, and from these it is impossible to dissociate all feeling. The objectionable elements in inflammatory remarks are primarily irrelevant ideas which are highly provocative of hostility; but I should have found difficulty in finding anything in Mr. Starr\u2019s address of this character. The reference to the tendency of present day administrative bodies to become arbitrary and to resent interference with their action is surely legitimate: the illustration of the particular by the general has been a useful and effective device since the institution of the jury. In many cases it is almost necessary to convey a real appreciation of the full nature and significance of the action assailed. But that the verdict here represents a castigation of the respondent for the sins of all of his brother administrators does not, I fear, do justice to those who found it. The best test for such a question is experience, and I doubt that the previous generations of advocates would have been moved to raise an eyebrow, much less be shocked, by anything uttered in this case.\nBut I put that question aside. I am unable to say that the Court of Appeal was wrong in finding the damages awarded were excessive in the second sense. Although in such a matter damages are substantially what a jury thinks fit to find, whether as speculatively estimated actual damages, as so\u2011called general damages, or as exemplary or punitive damages\u2014the words simply define an area almost at large\u2014yet the judgment upon these considerations must be proportionate to the situation in which they were uttered. Here Lamport was acting as a public official. Towards Ross as an inconspicuous individual he can be taken to have had no resentment but toward him as an applicant for a license who had been guilty of causing a violent irruption upon the otherwise placid proceedings of the Commission, amounting almost to a subversion, the attitude was quite different. The view of the jury was probably that the mayor had struck out against him as against a marauder, recklessly and regardless of the facts intending to administer a chastisement that would demonstrate both his culpability and the outrageous treatment accorded the Commission. That was not the object or purpose of the privileged occasion, the protection of which he sought to invoke: Royal Aquarium v. Parkinson[7]. What resulted was a substantial wrong to Ross. On the other hand, the mayor was attempting, though in a somewhat crude manner, to vindicate the action of a public body; and however objectionable the insolence of office may be, it is certainly not desirable that zeal, however misguided, in protesting what can be taken to be believed to be an injury to the public interest, should draw upon itself such an exorbitant condemnation.\nBut I see no reason to have all of the issues in this case threshed out anew. As Laidlaw J.A. in Arland v. Taylor[8], in his valuable review of the law dealing with new trials, said, it is against the interest of the administration of justice that they should be directed if it is clear that substantial justice has been done in determining the real issues; and although it was intimated by Pickup C.J. that in some other but unstated respects the trial seemed to be unsatisfactory, that there was substantial justice done here on the main questions is, I think, beyond controversy. I should add that before the Court of Appeal the circumstances of the two innuendoes objected to do not appear to have been made as clear as they were in the argument before us. I would therefore limit the rehearing to a re-assessment of damages.\nOn that rehearing, however, the answer of the jury to question 4(b),\nAre the words defamatory to the plaintiff\u2026\n(b) in any of the meanings attributable to them in the innuendo? Answer, yes.\nrequires consideration. The innuendoes set forth in para. 5 of the statement of claim can be treated as being five in number, and the jury were asked to find whether \u201cany\u201d of them were defamatory. In that situation it cannot be said which specifically is or are intended by the answer \u201cyes\u201d, and the answer, concluding an undisclosed fact, cannot form a factual basis of damages for a new jury. If, then, the appellant desires to rely upon the innuendoes, the verdict as to them must be opened and it will be necessary for the new jury to deal with them ab initio. I should remark, however, that whether the innuendoes are relied upon or abandoned, the item included in para. 4 by the words \u201cthat he was concerned only in trafficking in licenses as a profit to himself and in preference to serving the public in his trade\u201d is not to be taken as restricting the plain and ordinary meaning of the libel to be drawn from the words used.\nI would allow the appeal and modify the judgment of the court below by limiting the new trial accordingly. The appellant will be entitled to his costs of the trial and of the appeal to this Court and the respondent to the costs in the Court of Appeal. The costs on the re-assessment will be as directed by the judge before whom it is made.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The facts out of which this action arises and the questions raised before us are set out in the reasons of my Lord the Chief Justice and of my brother Rand. I agree with the conclusion at which they have arrived and propose to state my reasons briefly.\nBefore charging the jury the learned trial judge submitted to counsel the questions which are set out in the reasons of my Lord the Chief Justice. Counsel for the appellant indicated that he found these satisfactory. Counsel for the respondent, while not expressly objecting to questions being put, made it clear that he did not consent to this course being followed and submitted that if questions were to go before the jury they should be amended. Having heard the submissions of counsel the learned judge decided to put the questions before the jury without amendment. At the beginning and again at the end of his charge the learned judge made it clear to the jury that they were free to answer the questions or to leave them unanswered and to bring in a general verdict. This was, in my opinion, a permissible course authorized by the terms of s. 4 of the Libel and Slander Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 204, reading as follows:\u2014\nOn a trial of an action for libel the jury may give a general verdict upon the whole matter in issue in the action, and shall not be required or directed to find for the plaintiff, merely on proof of publication by the defendant of the alleged libel, and of the sense ascribed to it in the action; but the court shall according to its discretion, give its opinion and directions to the jury on the matter in issue as in other cases, and the jury may on such issue find a special verdict, if they think fit so to do, and the proceedings after verdict, whether general or special, shall be the same as in other cases.\nBy answering the questions the jury have in effect returned a special verdict, as they were free to do. In adding at the end of their answers the words\u2014\u201cWe find for the Plaintiff\u201d\u2014they may be said to have also found a general verdict but such general verdict is consistent with the facts found in the special verdict and in my view the case should be treated as one in which a special verdict has been found.\nI am of opinion that the findings of the jury in the answers to questions 1(a), 1(b), 2(a), 2(b), 3, 4(a), 5, 6 and 7 are all supported by the evidence, that the charge of the learned trial judge in respect of the matters dealt with in such answers was adequate and that such findings established the appellant\u2019s right to recover damages. I do, however, share the view of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that the course of the trial in regard to the submission of the innuendoes to the jury was not satisfactory, and I am not altogether satisfied that the course of the trial was such as to preclude counsel for the respondent from relying on that ground of appeal. It is true that counsel who appeared for the respondent at the trial used the words\u2014\u201cI think your Lordship is entitled to rule so far as the innuendo is concerned they (i.e. the words complained of) are capable of such an innuendo\u201d\u2014but after reading the whole of the discussion in the course of which this statement was made I am doubtful whether it was intended or understood as an invitation to the learned judge to so rule; and I am unable to see that such a ruling if made would have assisted the argument as to qualified privilege with which counsel was then dealing. The basis of that argument was that the respondent and the commission of which he was the chairman had been attacked as arbitrarily depriving the appellant of his living, that such attack had been published in the press, that is to the world, that the respondent was entitled and under a duty to address a reply and defence to the same audience and that, so long as in so doing he did not go beyond what was reasonably germane to answering such attack, what he caused to be published was published on an occasion of qualified privilege. The duty of the learned judge in dealing with such a submission is stated as follows in Douglas v. Tucker[9]:\n. . . The appellant was entitled to reply to such a charge and his reply would be protected by qualified privilege, but I think it clear that this protection would be lost if in making his reply the appellant went beyond matters which were reasonably germane to the charge which had been brought against him. It is for the judge alone to rule as a matter of law not only whether the occasion is privileged but also whether the defendant has published something beyond what was germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion so that the privilege does not extend thereto.\nA ruling that the words complained of were capable of bearing all the meanings ascribed to them in the innuendoes would appear to have increased the likelihood of the learned trial judge ruling that the respondent\u2019s answer had gone beyond what was germane to the occasion. However, as the jury have found that the words complained of were defamatory of the appellant in their natural and ordinary meaning, any error that occurred in regard to the innuendoes could affect only the quantum of damages; and, as I have concluded that there must be a new assessment of damages, I do not pursue this point farther.\nWith the greatest respect for the contrary view entertained by the Court of Appeal I am unable to find anything in the address of counsel for the plaintiff to the jury which would warrant any interference with the verdict found.\nI have already indicated my view that the finding that the spoken words complained of referred to the appellant in the way of his trade or calling cannot be successfully attacked.\nThere remains the question of the amounts at which the damages were assessed. These amounts are much larger than I would have fixed had it been my duty to assess them but that, of course, would not of itself be a sufficient reason for interference. However, the Court of Appeal have unanimously reached the conclusion, as a distinct ground of decision, that the jury acting reasonably could not have awarded so large a sum and I am unable to say that they were wrong in so deciding.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Rand I agree with his conclusion that the new trial should be limited to the assessment of damages and I wish only to add that a similar course has been followed in actions for libel by the Judicial Committee in Abraham v. Advocate Company[10], and, as has been called to my attention by my brother Locke, by the House of Lords in Tolley v. J.S. Fry and Sons, Limited[11].\nIn regard to the innuendoes, it is my opinion that, even if it should be held that counsel for the respondent is precluded from complaining of the manner in which they were left to the jury at the first trial, the position of the parties at the new trial will not be affected by the findings of the jury in answer to question 4 (b), as that answer is inconclusive. Paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim ascribes five innuendoes to the words published, viz, that the plaintiff, both in his personal capacity and in his capacity as a taxi-driver and owner, (i) had been dishonest with the Honourable the Chief Justice of the High Court; (ii) had been dishonest with the Board of Police Commissioners for the City of Toronto; (iii) had been dishonest in his relations with the public; (iv) was concerned only in \u201ctrafficking\u201d in licenses at a profit to himself in preference to serving the public in his trade, and (v) had obtained in some way the good offices of the Chief Justice of the High Court. It is impossible to tell from the answer of the jury whether they found that the words were understood to have the meaning alleged in one only or in some or in all of the innuendoes.\nAs it has now been established in the plaintiff\u2019s favour that the words in their natural and ordinary meaning are defamatory of him and that he is entitled to have his damages assessed, it may be that at the new trial he will not insist on the questions raised by the innuendoes being submitted to the jury. If he does, it will be for the presiding judge, after having heard the evidence, to decide as to each innuendo whether the words published are reasonably capable of bearing the meaning thereby attributed to them and in the case of those innuendoes in regard to which he decides this question in the affirmative to leave it to the jury to say whether the words were understood to have the meaning so ascribed to them. I do not mean by anything I have said above to suggest that the jury at the new trial should be asked to answer any questions other than a question as to the amounts at which they assess the damages on the four heads set out in question 8 put at the first trial. The whole conduct of the new trial will, of course, be in the hands of the presiding judge subject only to this that the findings of the jury at the first trial in their answers to questions 1(a), 1(b), 2(a), 2(b), 3, 4(a), 5, 6 and 7 must all be taken as established.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my Lord the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed and new trial directed limited to the amount of damages.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Sinclair, Goodenough, Higginbottom & McDonnell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McCarthy & McCarthy.\n[1] [1955] O.R. 542; 4 D.L.R. 826.\n[2] [1916] 2 A.C. 481.\n[3] [1943] S.C.R. 366.\n[4] [1935] A.C. 346.\n[5] (1889) 24 Q.B.D. 53.\n[6] [1916] 2 A.C. 481.\n[7] (1892) 1 Q.B. 431.\n[8] [1955] O.R. 131 at 138.\n[9] [1952] S.C.R. 275 at 286.\n[10] [1946] 2 W.W.R. 181.\n[11] [1931] A.C. 333.\n",

This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nAt the trial, the judge, in the absence of the jury and without deciding as to its admissibility, heard evidence, subject to objection, of a plea of guilty which had been entered by counsel for the appellant E. in the latter\u2019s presence in a court of criminal jurisdiction on a charge of careless driving under the Highway Traffic Act. No conviction was tendered in evidence. Following the admission of this evidence, the trial judge, of his own motion and without hearing counsel, decided to discharge the jury and continue the trial himself. Counsel for the appellants did not take objection to that course, and the parties agreed that the evidence taken in the absence of the jury should be treated as evidence in the case. The trial judge, in his reasons for judgment, did not find it necessary to rule on the admissibility of the evidence. Before the Court of Appeal and this Court, the appellants contended that the jury should not have been discharged. Held (Cartwright and Abbott JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J.: The trial judge\u2019s discretion to discharge the jury was properly exercised since the evidence of the plea of guilty was admissible. The contention that the plea was inadmissible because it had been entered by counsel and not by the appellant, that it was only for the purposes of the criminal proceedings and that counsel\u2019s authority did not extend to that fact being treated as an admission in the present trial, is not tenable.\nThe appellants failed to establish that the trial judge\u2019s finding of negligence, concurred in by the Court of Appeal, was wrong.\nPer Locke J.: There were concurrent findings as to the negligent act which caused the accident, and no sufficient grounds have been shown for interference with that finding.\nIn view of the undoubted jurisdiction of the trial judge by virtue of the Judicature Act to discharge the jury, and in view of the fact that, as was found by the Court of Appeal, it was not shown that in so doing he proceeded upon a wrong principle, no appeal lies to this Court from that discretionary order by reason of s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act.\nFurthermore, since the trial had proceeded on the footing that there was no objection by counsel for the appellants to what had been done, it was too late thereafter to raise the objection that the order dispensing with the jury had been improperly made (Scott v. Fernie Lumber Co. (1904) 11 B.C.R. 91 at 96 referred to).\nThe evidence of the charge and of the plea of guilty was relevant and admissible. Even if it were not so, there should not be a new trial as it would be impossible to find that any wrong or miscarriage had resulted: s. 28 of the Judicature Act.\nPer Cartwright J. (dissenting): The rule that the trial judge should decide questions as to the admissibility of evidence as they arise applies not only to criminal but also to civil cases whether tried with or without a jury.\nIn the circumstances of this case, counsel should not be held to have acquiesced in the course taken at the trial simply because he did not attempt to argue against it after the trial judge had not merely stated that he proposed to follow such course but had announced his decision to do so, and consequently the rule in Scott v. Fernie Lumber Co. ((1904) 11 B.C.R. at 98) has no application.\nThe failure of the trial judge to rule as to the admissibility of the evidence at the time when it was his duty to do so, deprived the appellants of their substantial right to have the action tried by a jury and there should be a new trial before a jury.\nSemble, for the reasons given by Abbott J., that the evidence in question was inadmissible.\nPer Abbott J. (dissenting): The plea of guilty implied no more than a desire for peace, and as such was not an admission at all, had no probative value in the subsequent civil action and the evidence that it had been entered should have been rejected. Furthermore, an admission made by counsel on behalf of an accused in a criminal proceeding is not evidence in a civil matter unless the authority to make such admission was an authority to make it for the purposes of a civil action as well (Potter v. Swain and Swain [1945] O.W.N. 514 referred to). In view of the inadmissibility of that evidence, there was in fact no reason for depriving the appellants of their prima facie right to a trial by jury. There was here a deprivation of a substantial right and not an exercise of discretion.\nEven had the evidence been admissible, counsel should have been given full opportunity to be heard on the point as to whether the trial should proceed with or without a jury.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment at trial and dismissing two actions arising out of a motor vehicle collision.\nR.N. Starr, Q.C. for the appellants.\nW.E. McLean, Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. was delivered by:\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014These are appeals by the plaintiffs from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgments at the trial which dismissed two actions and awarded damages in a third action brought by one of the defendants in those two actions against one of the plaintiffs. Previously in a court of criminal jurisdiction an information charging the plaintiff English under the Criminal Code with the crime of dangerous driving had been withdrawn and a plea of guilty accepted to a charge of careless driving under the provisions of The Ontario Highway Traffic Act. This plea was entered by Counsel for English in the latter\u2019s presence. All this was admitted by English in his cross-examination at the trial of the three actions and certain alleged explanations were given as to the reason of the plea of guilty. This testimony was given in the absence of the jury. The trial judge decided to admit in evidence, subject to objection, the fact that the plea had been entered, but he considered that the trial of the actions should then continue before him alone, and the jury, already empanelled, was thereupon discharged.\nMr. Starr objected to the discharge of the jury on the ground that the plea of guilty was improperly admitted. It must be emphasized that no conviction was tendered in evidence. It has been held in this Court in a case from the Province of Quebec, La Fonci\u00e8re Compagnie d\u2019Assurance de France v. Dame Blanche Perras and Ren\u00e9 Mongeau and Octave Daoust[1], that a conviction registered by a court of criminal jurisdiction has not the effect of creating before the civil courts the presumption juris et de jure resulting from the authority of a final judgment, but several decisions in England on the common law were referred to, among them Castrique v. Imrie[2], in which Blackburn J., speaking for himself and Baron Bramwell, Mellor J., Brett J. and Baron Cleasby, stated as follows:\u2014\nA judgment in an English Court is not conclusive as to anything but the point decided, and therefore a judgment of conviction on an indictment for forging a bill of exchange, though conclusive as to the prisoner being a convicted felon, is not only not conclusive, but is not even admissible evidence of the forgery in an action on the bill, though the conviction must have proceeded on the ground that the bill was forged.\nMr. Justice Davis, who wrote a separate judgment in the Perras case (1), referred to In re Crippen[3] and Mash v. Darley[4], and to the judgment at the trial in Hollington v. Hewthorn & Co. Ltd.[5] Subsequently, in the last mentioned case, the Court of Appeal[6], while affirming the judgment at the trial, in a judgment delivered by Lord Goddard considered the whole matter carefully and overruled the Crippen and Mash cases. Even there, however, Lord Goddard pointed out at pp. 599 and 600:\u2014\nIt may frequently happen that where bigamy or any other crime has to be proven in a civil proceeding, the prisoner on his trial had pleaded guilty. Proof of the confession by a witness present at the trial is admissible because an admission can always be given in evidence against the party who made it. In the present case, had the defendant before the magistrates pleaded guilty or made some admission in giving evidence that. would have supported the plaintiff\u2019s case, this could have been proved, but not the result of the trial.\nAll that was proved in the present case was the fact that English had pleaded guilty through his Counsel and, while I understood Mr. Starr to admit that if English himself had pleaded guilty that fact would be admissible in evidence, in case I am wrong as to his position, I think such a statement would be admissible. Mr. Starr raised the narrow point that since here it was the Counsel for English who had entered the plea, that was only for the purpose of the particular proceedings before the Magistrate and that his authority did not extend to that fact being treated as an admission in the trial of these actions. He relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ontario in Potter v. Swain[7]. The note of that decision is not a full report, but if it purports to decide that an admission by Counsel in the form of a plea of guilty to a charge of crime, or what is known as a provincial crime, in the presence of the accused is not admissible, I am unable to agree with it.\nThe statement in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., vol. 4, p. 24, also relied on, relates to offers of compromise and the cases referred to by Mr. Starr at p. 44 do not detract from the statement at p. 43 \u201cbut conversely all his (i.e. the attorney\u2019s) admissions during that management including the utterances in the pleadings do affect the client\u201d. The statement in the 11th ed. of Bowstead\u2019s Digest of the Law of Agency, at p. 232, is as follows:\u2014\nA solicitor or counsel is retained to conduct an action. Statements made by him in the conduct and for the purposes of the action are evidence against the client. But statements made by him in casual conversation, and not in the course and for the purposes of the action, are not. So, statements made by a solicitor for the purposes of one action cannot be used as evidence in another action which the solicitor is conducting on behalf of the same client; and admissions made by counsel at a trial have been held not to be binding at a new trial which had been ordered by the Court of Appeal (d).\nThe case referred to in note (d), Dawson v. Great Central Railway[8], is merely a decision that an admission by counsel at the first trial of an action is not binding on a new trial.\nMr. Starr\u2019s next contention that even if there were an admission by or on behalf of English it was not evidence as to the cause of the accident really goes to the question of weight and not admissibility.\nThese are the only grounds suggested as to the impropriety of the trial judge dispensing with the jury and, in my opinion, the trial judge\u2019s discretion was properly exercised.\nFinally, it was argued that the judgment of the trial judge, although concurred in by the Court of Appeal, was wrong. As to this, it is sufficient to say that Mr. Starr has not persuaded me that this is so. The trial judge disregarded the evidence of the plea of guilty in coming to his conclusion and the reasons given by him for dismissing the two actions and awarding damages in the third appear to me to be well founded as it is admitted that the plaintiff Margaret Millicent Laing is in the same position as English.\nThe appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014These two actions were tried together by Wilson J., and dismissed upon the ground that the sole cause of the accident was the negligence of the appellant English. As Murray Gordon Laing, who died of the injuries sustained by him, was a passenger in the car driven by English, the action brought by his widow failed by reason of the provisions of s. 2(2) of the Negligence Act (R.S.O. 1950, c, 252).\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Hope J.A. dismissed the appeals taken from the judgment at the trial, the reasons delivered stating that no grounds had been shown upon which the court should interfere with the trial judge\u2019s finding of negligence. There are thus concurrent findings as to the negligent act which caused the accident.\nThe appellants appeal against this finding and alternatively ask for a new trial on the ground that evidence was improperly admitted at the hearing and upon the further ground that in discharging the jury during the course of the trial the learned trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.\nIt is necessary to consider with some care the record as to what took place upon this latter aspect of the matter at the hearing. The appellant English was the first witness called by the plaintiffs and gave evidence as to the manner in which the accident occurred. When cross\u2011examined, counsel for the defendants asked him whether a charge had been laid against him in connection with the matter. The learned trial judge at once raised the question as to the relevancy of this and directed that the jury retire while the matter was argued. After hearing counsel for the respective parties, in the absence of the jury, he permitted the appellant English to answer the question as to whether it was a fact that a charge had been laid against him in the Police Court at Barrie arising out of the accident, charging him with unlawfully driving a motor vehicle without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway, contrary to the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 167). This he admitted and, further, that the information was read to him and that, in his presence, counsel representing him pleaded guilty on his behalf. Following this, English was reexamined by counsel appearing for the plaintiffs and explained the circumstances under which this plea had been entered. This disclosed that a further charge had been laid against him under the Criminal Code, charging him with dangerous driving, and that, after this charge had been partially heard, counsel for the prosecution had informed the magistrate that he did not consider the evidence supported the charge and that he proposed to withdraw it and that, immediately afterwards, English pleaded guilty to the charge under the Highway Traffic Act. Counsel for English then called Mr. Thompson, the Crown Attorney for the County of Simcoe who had prosecuted the two charges, who said that before he withdrew the charge under the Code he had suggested to counsel for the accused that, if the latter would plead guilty to the charge under the Act, he would withdraw the charge under the Code and that this was done.\nFollowing the taking of this evidence in the absence of the jury, the learned trial judge decided, without determining the question as to the admissibility of the. evidence, that he would admit it subject to the objection but would discharge the jury. His reasons for adopting this course were explained in the following terms:\u2014\nI think it is obvious that the question of the admissibility of the statement made by Mr. English on the occasion of his prosecution on the charge of dangerous driving is one which presents some difficulties. If the evidence is admitted the plaintiffs fear they may be adversely affected. On the other hand, the importance of such an admission to the defendant is not to be overlooked. I think the proper course in this case is to admit the evidence but I shall discharge the jury, which will mean that in the event of either side being dissatisfied with the judgment the Court of Appeal will be able to pronounce a final judgment without the necessity of sending this action back for another trial, which undoubtedly would be the case if it did not agree with the ruling which I should make concerning admissibility.\nAs to the admissibility itself. I have still an open mind but I propose to take the evidence subject to objection and, of course, I shall have to reserve judgment.\nThe parties then agreed that the evidence taken in the absence of the jury should be treated as evidence in the case and, without objection on the part of counsel for the plaintiffs, the trial proceeded before Wilson J. Seven witnesses in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 case gave evidence following the dismissal of the jury and six were called for the defence. The jury had been discharged early in the afternoon of November 23 and the balance of that day, all of the day following, and part of the morning of November 25 were taken up with the hearing of this evidence. The matter was then argued and judgment reserved.\nAs I have pointed out, counsel for the plaintiffs raised no objection to the order made dismissing the jury and, as the reasons for judgment thereafter delivered by Wilson J. make no mention of the matter, I assume that the propriety of that order was not questioned on the argument.\nS-s. 3 of s. 57 of the Judicature Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 190) provides that, notwithstanding the giving of the notice referred to in s-s. 1:\u2014\nthe issues of fact may be tried or the damages assessed without the intervention of a jury if the judge presiding at the sittings so directs or if it is so ordered by a judge.\nFor the reasons given in the passage above quoted, the learned trial judge evidently thought that, since he considered the admission of the evidence as to the plea of guilty upon the charge under the Highway Traffic Act might be injurious to the plaintiffs if improperly admitted before the jury and to the defendants if it were improperly excluded, and, being in doubt as to its admissibility, the proper course to pursue was to discharge the jury and try the issues of fact himself. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal have said that it had not been shown that the trial judge exercised his discretion either improperly or upon any wrong principle.\nThe trial judge\u2019s jurisdiction being undoubted and as it is not shown that he proceeded upon a wrong principle, in my opinion no appeal lies to this Court from the order dealing with this aspect of the mater by reason of s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThere is a further and equally fatal objection to this aspect of the appellant\u2019s claim. As I have stated, the trial, from the early afternoon of the second day, proceeded before the learned judge, the plaintiffs proceeding to put in their further evidence and that for the defendants being taken, apparently on the footing that there was no objection to what had been done. It was too late thereafter, in my opinion, for the present appellants to raise the objection that the order dispensing with the jury had been improperly made.\nTo permit such a course would be to allow these plaintiffs, having decided to take their chances of success before the trial judge sitting alone and having lost, to have thereafter a second opportunity to recover damages. In Scott v. Fernie Lumber Company[9], Duff J. (as he then was) delivering the judgment of the full Court of British Columbia, referred to:\u2014\nthe rule long established, which holds a litigant to a position deliberately assumed by his counsel at the trial, . . . The rule is no mere technicality of practice; but the particular application of a sound and all-important maxim\u2014that litigants shall not play fast and loose with the course of litigation\u2014finding a place one should expect, in any enlightened system of forensic procedure.\nAn illustration of the practical application of this salutary rule may be found in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Elk River Timber Co. v. Bloedel, Stewart and Welch[10]. I refer particularly to the judgments of Macdonald C.J.B.C. at pp. 496-7 and that of McDonald J.A. (as he then was) at pp. 524-5. The rule is, in my opinion, applicable and should be invoked in the present case.\nAs to the evidence which, it was claimed, was improperly admitted, no ruling as to its admissibility was made in the judgment delivered following the trial. Dealing with the matter, the learned judge said:\u2014\nIn arriving at my conclusion I have disregarded evidence of English\u2019s conviction on a charge of driving without due care and attention which was admitted subject to objection because counsel for English admitted in the course of his argument that his client had been guilty of some negligence.\nIt may be noted that the evidence tendered was not as to the conviction but rather that the charge under the Highway Traffic Act had been laid and that counsel for English had, in his presence and on his behalf, pleaded guilty.\nIn the Court of Appeal the learned judges were of the opinion that evidence as to the plea made was admissible. In my opinion, since the learned judge did not consider the evidence in arriving at his conclusion, the question as to its admissibility is of academic interest only. As it was not considered, the situation does not differ from that which would have resulted had the evidence been tendered and rejected.\nI think that the evidence was relevant and admissible as showing conduct of the appellant English which, on the face of it, was inconsistent with his evidence at the trial, directed to showing that he was not at fault. Its weight, however, was negligible in view of the evidence as to the circumstances in which the plea of guilty was made.\nHad the evidence not been admissible, I cannot think that there should be a new trial in these circumstances. S. 28 of the Judicature Act provides that anew trial shall not be granted on the ground of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned. In my opinion, it would be impossible to find that either wrong or miscarriage resulted in the present matter.\nMr. Starr, who did not appear for the appellants at the trial, has in his able argument said everything that could properly be urged on behalf of the appellants against the concurrent findings that it was the negligent act of English alone which caused the accident. I am, however, of the opinion that no sufficient grounds have been shown for any interference with the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal, with costs if they are demanded.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts out of which these appeals arise are sufficiently stated in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nTwo points were argued before us, but, because of the conclusion to which I have come on the second of these, it is unnecessary for me to deal with the first, which was that, on the evidence, the learned trial judge ought to have attributed part of the blame for the collision to the respondent Richmond.\nThe second point may be summarized as follows. It is said (i) that the learned judge erred in not rejecting evidence, sought to be brought out in cross-examination by counsel for the respondents, that the appellant, English, had, through counsel, entered a plea of guilty to a charge of careless driving under the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950 Ch. 167, (ii) that this error in law on the part of the learned trial judge was the sole reason for discharging the jury, and (iii) that we should therefore say that he was wrong in law in discharging the jury and should direct a new trial to be held before a jury.\nThe reasons of my brother Locke show that at the time when the learned judge decided to discharge the jury he had not yet decided the question of the admissibility of the evidence referred to, and that his only reason for discharging the jury was his decision to reserve this question. This is, I think, made clear by the passage quoted by my brother Locke and by what the learned trial judge said to the jury at the time of discharging them, as follows:\u2014\nMembers of the jury while you have been out I have been listening to some evidence and an argument on a difficult question of law. In the exercise of my discretion, and because the ruling which I shall have to give on an important point of law is one which I shall have to reserve for further consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I should finish this case without a jury being present. It is not possible to adjourn the trial until I should make up my mind with regard to what should be done with the matter I have been concerned with in your absence. The most practical, and in the long run I think the best interest of the litigants will be served by discharging you now and finishing this case myself.\nWith the greatest respect, I am of opinion that it was the duty of the learned trial judge to make his decision, as to whether the evidence should be admitted or rejected, at the conclusion of the evidence taken on the \u201cvoir dire\u201d and the argument which followed. The law is, I think, correctly stated in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd Edition, Vol. 13 at page 530, where the learned author says:\u2014\n. . . The admissibility of evidence must be decided, as a preliminary question, by the judge as such when it is tendered.\nThe rule that the trial judge must decide questions of the admissibility of evidence as they arise is, in my opinion, applicable to actions tried either with or without a jury. That it applies in criminal cases tried before a jury is put beyond question by the following passage from the unanimous decision of the Court delivered by Rinfret J., as he then was, in Cloutier v. The King[11]:\nNous n\u2019ignorons pas combien il est difficile parfois de d\u00e9cider sur-le-champ certaines objections \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. D\u2019autre part, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9ces- saire d\u2019insister pour d\u00e9montrer le pr\u00e9judice qui peut \u00eatre caus\u00e9 \u00e0 un accus\u00e9 dans l\u2019esprit du jury par certaine preuve qu\u2019on laisse faire devant lui, m\u00eame si, plus tard, le juge d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e et que le jury ne doit pas en tenir compte. Nous sommes d\u2019avis que, dans une cause criminelle devant un jury, les objections \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate ne devraient jamais \u00eatre prises sous r\u00e9serve.\nThe reasoning of the Court in the Cloutier case applies with equal force to a civil action tried with a jury.\nWhile the necessity of the rule may be more obvious in a case tried with a jury, there are reasons in addition to those given in the Cloutier case which make it difficult to see how in a case tried with or without a jury counsel on either side can satisfactorily conduct the remainder of the trial unless it is known whether a piece of evidence already tendered and actually heard has or has not been received by the Court. Let us suppose, for example, that the evidence in question has been tendered on behalf of the plaintiff and, if admitted and not contradicted, is sufficient to establish an essential ingredient of his cause of action. Is counsel for the plaintiff to call further evidence on the point? If the evidence in question is admitted this is unnecessary but if it is rejected it is essential. Is counsel for the defendant to cross\u2011examine? Can he do so \u201cwithout prejudice to his objection\u201d? If so, what becomes of the evidence elicited during the cross-examination in the event of the trial judge ultimately deciding to reject the evidence in question; is it to be treated as expunged from the record? Is counsel for the defence to call evidence to contradict the evidence in question? Once again if the evidence is admitted it is essential that he do so but if it is rejected it is unnecessary. What of the argument at the conclusion of the trial? Are there to be two sets of argument, one on the basis that the evidence in question is admitted and the other on the basis that it is rejected? The foregoing is not, I think, an exhaustive list of the difficulties which may arise in any trial in which the question of admissibility of a piece of evidence is not decided by the trial judge when it is tendered.\nWith some hesitation, I find myself unable to agree with the conclusion of my brother Locke that counsel who appeared for the appellants at the trial acquiesced in the course taken by the learned trial judge so as to be precluded from objecting thereto on appeal. As is pointed out by my brother Abbott, counsel really had little opportunity to object. At the conclusion of the argument as to the admissibility of the evidence the learned trial judge announced his decision to discharge the jury. I do not say that it would have been improper for counsel to have raised an objection at that point and to have asked the learned judge to reconsider the matter; but I do not think that counsel must necessarily be regarded as having acquiesced in a course of action taken at the trial because he does not attempt to argue against it after the judge has not merely stated that he proposes to follow such course but has announced his decision to do so. Counsel may have had in mind the words of Lord Verulam:\u2014\nAnd let not counsel at the bar\u2026 wind himself into the handling of the cause anew after the judge hath declared his sentence:\nI wish to make it clear that I do not question the accuracy of the rule quoted by my brother Locke from the judgment in Scott v. Fernie Lumber Company[12], but only its application to the facts of the case before us.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Abbott I incline to agree with his conclusion that in the particular circumstances of this case the evidence in question was inadmissible and ought to have been rejected; but the basis of my judgment is not that the learned trial judge ruled wrongly as to whether the evidence should be admitted but rather that he did not rule at the time when he was bound to do so.\nIn the result I am of opinion that the appellants were deprived of the right to have their action tried by a jury, which was described by Kellock J. giving the unanimous judgment of this Court in Telford v. Secord[13], as \u201ca substantial right\u201d, not by an order made by the learned trial judge in the exercise of his discretion as to how the case could best be tried but solely as the result of his erroneous decision that it was open to him to reserve the question of the admissibility of the evidence.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeals, set aside the judgments in the courts below and direct that a new trial be had before a jury. The appellants are entitled to their costs in the Court of Appeal and to such costs in this Court as are provided under rule 142. There should be no order as to the costs of the first trial. ABBOTT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts which gave rise to these appeals can be briefly stated.\nThe appellant Margaret Millicent Laing brought an action on behalf of herself and of her infant children for damages for the loss of her husband, Murray Laing, killed in a motor vehicle accident which occurred on July 26, 1952, when he was a passenger in a car driven by his brother-in-law, the appellant English, which car was struck by a car owned by the respondent Richmond and alleged to have been driven by the respondent Pulver.\nThe appellant English brought another action for damages for the loss of his motor vehicle and for personal injuries arising out of the said accident.\nThese actions were tried together by Wilson J., sitting with a jury.\nAt the trial, subject to objection, the learned trial judge heard evidence of the circumstances under which a plea of guilty was made in the Magistrate\u2019s Court by the appellant English through his counsel, on a charge of \u201cDriving without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway\u201d, under the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act of the Province of Ontario.\nHaving decided to accept this evidence under reserve, after taking evidence on voir dire and after argument as to its admissibility in the absence of the jury, the learned trial judge, on his own motion but without hearing counsel as to whether the actions should proceed with or without a jury, dismissed the jury and proceeded to try the actions himself. In the result, he dismissed both actions, and these judgments were confirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe appellants appealed on two grounds. First that on the evidence the learned trial judge should have found the respondent Richmond partly responsible for the accident. As to this first ground, I agree with other members of the Court that no sufficient grounds have been shown for any interference with the concurrent findings of negligence by the Courts below.\nAs their second ground appellants submitted (i) that the plea of guilty was made expressly by agreement and for the purpose of buying peace and was not a concession of wrong done, (ii) that an admission made by counsel on behalf of an accused in a criminal proceeding is not evidence in a civil matter unless the authority to make the admission upon the criminal proceeding was authority to make the admission for the purposes of the civil proceeding, (iii) that evidence on such plea should have been rejected and (iv) that in discharging the jury the judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.\n. After ordering the jury to withdraw, the learned trial judge took evidence as to the circumstances under which the plea of guilty, on the charge of careless driving, was entered. From this evidence it appears that the appellant English had been arraigned on a charge of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code, and after the prosecution had completed its case and some evidence had been heard on behalf of the defence, Crown counsel suggested that the evidence might not be sufficient to support the charge.\nA brief adjournment was taken and counsel appear to have discussed the matter in the magistrate\u2019s chambers, following which, on the Court resuming, the charge of dangerous driving was withdrawn and the respondent English, through his counsel, pleaded guilty to the charge of careless driving under the Highway Traffic Act.\nMr. W.M. Thompson, Q.C., Crown Attorney for the County of Simcoe, testified as to the circumstances under which this plea was taken. His evidence is important and I quote it in full. It is as follows:\u2014\nQ. You are the Crown Attorney for the County of Simcoe?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you prosecute a charge of dangerous driving against John English on the 3rd day of September, 1952?\nA. May I see the transcript? Yes, from the transcript it appears on the 3rd of September, 1952, I appeared for the prosecution on that charge.\nQ. I believe that evidence\u2014You proceeded first with a dangerous driving charge. Is that not correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Was evidence adduced on the dangerous driving charge?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And was defence evidence adduced on the part of Mr. English?\nA. It appears from the transcript that two witnesses gave evidence for the defence. The prosecution appears to have been completed.\nQ. Yes. During the trial of the dangerous driving charge did you make this statement to the court:\nIf I may interrupt, I feel that on the evidence, including the evidence of Mr. English who must impress one to some extent at least, that the Prosecution might not be justified in saying there is sufficient wantonness to support a charge of dangerous driving and the result of the accident is no concern of the court. I feel under the circumstances\u2014my friend is prepared, I understand, to make a plea to the other charge and I think I would ask the court to have this charge withdrawn or dismissed, whichever the Court thinks appropriate.\nA. That is in the transcript and I am quite satisfied that is what took place, although I cannot remember word for word.\nQ. Before you made that statement did you have an arrangement with counsel that if the plea of guilty be put in on the careless driving charge the dangerous driving charge would be withdrawn?\nA. I think that is obvious from the situation. It is obvious there was some discussion beforehand and it was indicated the plea of guilty would be entered.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Q. Who took the initiative on that?\nA. My recollection is that I did, my Lord. At a certain stage in the proceedings I informed Mr. Weekes that I did not think there was enough evidence to support a dangerous driving charge and he might consider pleading guilty to careless driving. I am sorry, my Lord, my memory is not better but it is a year ago.\nMr. WEEKES: Q. Yes, I understand that. And my understanding is that the dangerous driving charge would have been continued and been prosecuted had there not been a plea of guilty to the careless driving charge.\nA. Yes.\nQ. There was an adjournment to the Magistrate\u2019s Chambers?\nA. I see there was an adjournment but I do not recall what happened in that adjournment.\nBy agreement of the parties, after the jury had been dismissed, the evidence taken on voir dire was considered a part of the evidence at the trial.\nIt seems clear that the plea of guilty by English to the complaint under the Highway Traffic Act was entered by his counsel following an arrangement with the Crown Attorney made at the latter\u2019s suggestion, and by virtue of which the charge laid under the Criminal Code was withdrawn.\nIn my opinion the plea of guilty made by counsel in these circumstances, in the presence of English and with his concurrence, implied no more than a desire for peace and not a concession of wrong done. See Wigmore, 3rd Edition, Vol. 4 at pp. 28 and 29.\nAs such, in my opinion the plea was not an admission at all, had no probative value in the subsequent civil action, and evidence that such a plea had been entered should have been rejected. Even if I am mistaken in my view that evidence as to the plea in question was inadmissible in the circumstances of this case for the reasons which I have given, I am also of opinion that an admission made by counsel on behalf of an accused in a criminal proceeding is not evidence in a civil matter unless the authority to make the admission in the criminal proceedings was an authority to make it for the purposes of a civil action as well. In this connection the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Potter v. Swain and Swain[14], is in point, and I am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by McRuer J.A., as he then was, at p. 516 when, speaking for the Court, he said:\u2014\nWhile an admission by an agent will bind the principal, if made within the scope of the authority of the agent, counsel appearing on behalf of the accused at a criminal trial has no implied authority to make an admission that would bind his client in subsequent civil proceedings.\nAs I have said, the learned trial judge heard evidence of the plea of guilty, under reserve of the objection taken to it, and stated in his reasons for judgment that he had disregarded such evidence in arriving at the conclusion which he did. He made it quite clear however in taking the case from the jury that he did so solely because he had decided to postpone ruling upon the admissibility of the evidence objected to.\nSince in my view that evidence was inadmissible and should have been rejected, there was in fact no reason for depriving plaintiffs of their prima facie right to a trial by jury, and in the circumstances of this case, in my opinion, its denial was not an exercise of discretion by the learned trial judge but the deprivation of a substantial right.\nIn a case such as this (which is clearly one to be tried by a jury so long as the jury system prevails), even if the evidence objected to had been admissible, it would seem to me, that on the authorities, counsel for the parties should have been given a full opportunity to be heard on the point as to whether the trial should proceed with or without a jury, or be traversed for trial by another jury. See Filion v. O\u2019Neill[15] and Craig et al. v. Milligan[16]. In the instant case the learned trial judge announced his decision to dismiss the jury without inviting the views of counsel, and in these circumstances there would seem to me little which counsel could do but accept such decision subject, of course, to a right to question it on appeal.\nIn the result, therefore, I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Allen, Weekes & Lawson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fennell, McLean & Seed.\n[1] [1943] S.C.R. 165.\n[2] (1870) L.R. 4 H.L. 414.\n[3] [1911] P. 108.\n[4] [1914] 1 K.B. 1.\n[5] [1943] K.B. 27.\n[6] [1943] K.B. 587.\n[7] [1945] O.W.N. 514.\n[8] (1919) 88 L.J.K.B. 1177.\n[9] (1904) 11 B.C.R. 91 at 96.\n[10] (1941) 56 B.C.R. 484.\n[11] [1940] S.C.R. 131 at 133, 134.\n[12] (1904) 11 B.C.R. 91 at 96.\n[13] [1947] S.C.R. 277 at 282.\n[14] [1945] O.W.N. 514.\n[15] [1934] O.R. 716.\n[16] [1949] O.R. 806.\n",

His conviction was unanimously affirmed, without written reasons, by the Court of Appeal.\nThe Crown, to rebut the evidence given by the accused that he had never seen the victim, called a witness who, notwithstanding the objection of counsel for the accused, was allowed to introduce incriminatory answers and declarations allegedly made by the accused to police officers while under arrest. The Crown did not attempt to prove that these answers and declarations had been made freely and voluntarily.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nThe burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from the accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Crown. The phases of trial at which the Crown seeks to introduce such statements, whether it be part of its case in chief, or upon cross-examination of an accused heard in defence, or in rebuttal of evidence adduced by the defence, is foreign to and in no way affects the ratio of the principle Confirmed under the authorities. In the absence of affirmative proof of the free and voluntary character of the statements, the impeached evidence was illegally admitted before the jury, and it could not be said that the verdict would have been the same without such illegal evidence.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming the appellant's conviction before a jury on a charge of rape.\nA. Chevalier Q.C. for the appellant.\nG. W. Hill, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nFautetjx J.:\u2014By a unanimous judgment, the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec 2 maintained, without written reasons, the conviction of the appellant on a charge of rape.\nThe grounds upon which leave to appeal to this Court was granted involved, amongst others, the point whether answers given by the accused, while under arrest for the offence, to questions put to him by a detective in authority, were admissible to contradict his testimony at trial, in the absence of any voir dire as to the free and voluntary character of these answers.\nExamined in chief, on his defence, the accused denied having ever seen the victim of the offence. In cross-examination, he admitted that the police had several conversations with him but, when referred to the substance of the latter, he testified having said nothing indicating any knowledge of the facts of the charge, declaring rather, in the occurrence, that he thought his failure to inform the authorities of a change of address, with respect to the registration of his automobile, was the reason for his arrest.\nTo contradict this testimony, the Crown, in rebuttal, called Detective Joyal who, notwithstanding the objection made by counsel for the defence, was allowed to refer to these conversations and give the following evidence, unpreceded by any examination on voir-dire:\u2014\nQ. Est-ce qu'il a dit qu'il la connaissait?\nR. Non. Il n'a pas dit qu'il la connaissait non plus.\nQ. Est-ce qu'il a dit qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en automobile avec elle? R. Non. Je peux rapporter les paroles: \"Je peux pas reconter ce qui s'est pass\u00e9, vous allez me donner dix ans de p\u00e9nitencier\".\nQ. Il a dit simplement : \"Je peux pas raconter ce qui s'est pass\u00e9, vous allez me donner dix ans de p\u00e9nitencier\"?\nR. C'est cela.\nQ. Est-ce qu'il a dit qu'il \u00e9tait ailleurs ce soir-l\u00e0?\nR. Non plus.\nIn Sankey v. The King 3 and in Thiffault v. The King 4, this Court made it very clear that the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Court that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from the accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Crown ; and that such a burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of opinion on oath by the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely and voluntarily.\nThe phases of trial at which the Crown seeks to introduce such statements, whether it be as part of its case in chief, or upon cross-examination of an accused heard in defence, or in rebuttal of evidence adduced by the defence, is foreign to and in no way affects the ratio of the principle confirmed under these authorities. As stated by Humphreys J. delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England, in Rex v. Treacy 5, a statement made by a prisoner under arrest is either admissible or not; if it is admissible, the proper course for the prosecution is to prove it, and, if it is not admissible, nothing more ought to be heard of it; and it is wrong to think that a document can be made admissible in evidence which is otherwise inadmissible simply because it is put to a person in cross-examination.\nIn Hebert v. The Queen 6 Cartwright J., at page 141, refers to the Canadian jurisprudence in the matter. In the latter case, the Crown, upon cross-examination of the accused, made use of such statements. Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. decided that such evidence was inadmissible, and Estey J., without determining the matter, said that \"a cross-examination upon such a statement, by the great weight of authority in our Provincial Courts as well as in the Court of Criminal Appeal in England has been condemned\". The other Members of the Court, who refrained from expressing their views in the matter, did so because, being of the opinion that the application of the provisions of section 1014(2) was warranted on the evidence, it was unnecessary to determine the question.\nIn the present case, there was no serious attempt, on behalf of the Crown, at the hearing of this appeal, either to justify the admissibility of such evidence or an application of section 1014(2). The answers given to the police by the appellant were incriminatory and, had they been proved to have been freely and voluntarily given, would undoubtedly have been proper evidence as part of the case for the Crown ; and while the propriety of introducing such evidence on rebuttal might be open to question, this particular aspect of, the case was not raised by the appellant; counsel for the latter being content to rest the appeal on the major question flowing from the lack of affirmative proof of the free and voluntary character of these answers.\nUnder all the circumstances of this case, the Court being unanimously of opinion that, in the absence of such affirmative proof, the impeached evidence was illegally admitted before the jury and that it could not be said that the verdict would have been the same without such illegal evidence, the appeal was maintained and a new trial ordered.\nAppeal allowed, conviction quashed and new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

Saumure, [1956] S.C.R. 403\nDate: 1956-03-02\nRaphael Danis (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHermas Saumure (Defendant) Respondent.\n1956: February 1, 2; 1956: March 2.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAutomobile\u2014Negligence\u2014Pedestrian struck by car\u2014Finding by jury exonerating driver\u2014Whether perverse\u2014Whether affidavits of jurors as to intention to give verdict in favour of pedestrian, receivable. While attempting to cross a road, the appellant was struck by a car owned and driven by the respondent. The appellant sued for damages for personal injuries and the action was tried before a judge and jury. In answer to questions, the jury found that the respondent had satisfied them that there had been no negligence or improper conduct on his part. They also assessed the damages suffered by the appellant. The trial judge dismissed the action in accordance with these findings.\nBefore the Court of Appeal and this Court, the appellant contended that the verdict was perverse, and also sought to file affidavits signed by nine members of the jury purporting to show that the findings made by the jury were not the findings intended to be made by them and that they had intended to give the appellant a verdict for the amount of the damages assessed.\nHeld (affirming the judgment appealed from): That the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe jury\u2019s finding exonerating the respondent was not perverse.\nThis was not a case where affidavits from jurors should be received. Under s. 63 of The Ontario Judicature Act the duty of the jury was to answer questions and after answering them it could not award the appellant damages.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment at trial and refusing to receive affidavits of the jurors.\nL. Choquette, Q.C. for the appellant.\nA.T. Hewitt for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. was delivered by:\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This action was tried before Mr. Justice Wilson and a jury and after a charge that was not objected to at the trial, before the Court of Appeal or before this Court, six questions were submitted to the jury, of which they answered only three. These questions and answers are as follows:\u2014\n1. Was the plaintiff\u2019s loss or damage sustained by reason of the defendant\u2019s motor car on the highway?\nAnswer: Yes or No.\n2. Has the defendant satisfied you that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff did not arise from the negligence or. improper conduct on the part of the defendant?\nAnswer: Yes or No.\n7 5\n10 2 3. If your answer to Question 2 is \u201cNo\u201d was there any fault or negligence on the part of the plaintiff which caused or contributed to the accident? Answer: Yes or No.\n4. If your answer to question 3 is \u201cYes\u201d and your answer to question 2 is \u201cNo\u201d, state fully particulars of every act of such fault or negligence of the plaintiff. Answer:\n5. If your answer to question 2 is \u201cNo\u201d and your answer. to question 3 is \u201cYes\u201d, apportion the degree, of fault or negligence.\nPlaintiff\n%\nDefendant\n%\nTotal\n100%\n6. At what amount do you assess the total loss or damage sustained by the plaintiff?\nSpecial\n$ 6,702.68\nGeneral\n$ 5,100.00\nTotal\n$ 11,802.68\nIn accordance with these findings judgment was given dismissing the action with costs. The Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed an appeal by the plaintiff and he then appealed to this Court.\nThe plaintiff seeks to file and use nine affidavits,\u2014one from the foreman, and the others from eight members, of the jury. All of these are practically in the same form but the one by the foreman indicates that the sum of $11,802.68 was about one-half of what the jury thought was the total of the damages proved. It might be immediately pointed out that it is difficult to accept this suggestion in view of counsel\u2019s answer to a question from the Bench that the item of $6,702.68 would not be one-half of the special damages.\nThe instructions of the trial judge were clear and undoubtedly the jury intended to answer, and did answer, Question No. 2 affirmatively. Furthermore, if as was intimated, it was considered by the jury that both parties were equally to blame, there is no explanation why no answers were given to Question No.5. If one is to judge from the marks made, presumably by the foreman, on the original list of questions handed the jury, there was considerable discussion among its members before the answers were arrived at. This is not a case where the written answers do not correspond to the actual decision arrived at by the jury, nor was there any slip, or error, in the answers given to any of the three questions.\nStatements or affidavits by any member of a jury as to their deliberations or intentions on the matter to be adjudicated upon are never receivable. Halsbury (2nd ed.) Vol. 19, p. 317, note (i). The rule is set forth in the 9th edition of Phipson on Evidence, p. 199, Taylor on Evidence, 12th edition, Vol. 1, p. 599, and Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd edition, Vol. 8, s. 2352 et seq. As early as Vaise v. Delaval[1], an affidavit of a juror that the jury, having been divided, tossed up, and that the plaintiff had won, was rejected. Lord Mansfield said:\u2014\nThe Court cannot receive such an affidavit from any of the jurymen themselves, in all of whom such conduct is a very high misdemeanor: but in every such case the Court must derive their knowledge from some other source: such as from some person having seen the transaction through a window, or by some such other means.\nIn Cogan v. Ebden[2], it had already been held that a verdict wrongly delivered by the formean of a jury might be amended. In Jackson v. Williamson[3], the King\u2019s Bench would not allow, after a delay, the admission of an affidavit by all the jurymen stating that they intended to give \u00a361 instead of \u00a330, although the question of delay may have had some effect upon the matter. Even though the rule has been criticized in certain Courts in the United States, it has been followed consistently in England and here, including the Court of Appeal in the present case. In Ellis v. Deheer[4], to which Mr. Justice Kellock referred on the argument, the Court of Appeal decided that it was not precluded from granting a new trial on the ground that the verdict as delivered by the foreman was not the verdict of the whole jury, but Lord Justice Banks, at p. 117, and Lord Justice Atkin, at p. 121, stated as undoubted law that evidence could not be received as to what occurred in the juryroom. McCulloch v. Ottawa Transportation Commission[5], was a case of the foreman of a jury inadvertently interchanging the degrees of fault on the part of the parties, and reference might be made to the decisions of single judges in Fletcher v. Thomas[6] and Knowlton v. Hydro-Electric Power Commission[7].\nIt should be emphasized that the jury\u2019s duty was to answer questions. S. 63 of The Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, provides:\u2014\n63. (1) Upon a trial by jury, except in an action for libel, the judge, instead of directing the jury to give either a general or a special verdict, may direct the jury to answer any questions of fact stated to them by him; and the jury shall answer such questions, and shall not give any verdict.\n(2) Judgment may be directed to be entered on the answers to such questions.\nTherefore, in the present case, even if the jury had wished the plaintiff to recover a sum of money, the answer to Question No. 3 and the absence of any answer to Question No. 5 show the serious effect if it were permitted for a juryman, or any number of jurymen, to come forward later and state such desire.\nAt the hearing we found it unnecessary to call upon Mr. Hewitt to answer the argument that the judgment was perverse, as we agreed with the Court of Appeal that this has not been shown.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014For the reasons given by the Chief Justice and Kellock J., I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014In my opinion, this appeal fails. The jury\u2019s duty under s. 63 of the Judicature Act was to answer questions and not to give a verdict. By their answer to question 2, the defendant was completely exonerated.\nEven assuming we are entitled to look at the affidavits tendered, they do not suggest any error in the answer to question 2 but merely that the deponents were laboring under the misapprehension that, notwithstanding the answer to that question, or any other question, they could give the appellant a verdict for the amount of the damages fixed.\nThis is not a case of error arising between the verdict which the jury had agreed upon and that which was actually rendered and formed the basis for the judgment delivered. The law is clearly laid down in Ellis v. Deheer[8], and prohibits what is here attempted. No case appears for the interference of the court on the ground that the verdict was perverse.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs if demanded.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

Estey J. died before the delivery of the judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nAutomobile\u2014Negligence\u2014Collision at night with rear of disabled truck\u2014Flares put out by truck driver\u2014Truck lights off\u2014Whether lighting equipment disabled \u2014 Damages for loss of life \u2014 Trustee Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 221\u2014Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 93. The respondent and his wife (plaintiffs) were killed when the bus in which they were passengers collided at night with the respondent company's disabled tractor and trailer, which was stopped on the right-hand side of the pavement with a clearance for traffic of sixteen and a half feet. The administrators of the respective estates sued the owners and drivers of both the truck and the bus for damages under the Trustee Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 221.\nThe right rear wheels of the trailer had come off some hours before but the driver had been able to make the repairs and to continue his trip. Some forty miles further, the same wheels came off again and the driver pulled up on the side of the road. As the repairs could not be made at the time, the driver placed lighted flares as required by the Highway Traffic Act, turned off all the lights of both the tractor and the trailer and went to sleep in the cab of the tractor. The collision occurred some three hours later.\nThe driver of another truck of the respondent company, who had been following him and who stopped when the breakdown occurred, did not stay with him. He continued on his way, put his truck in the company's garage some fourteen miles away and went home without communicating with anyone.\nThe trial judge found that the sole cause of the accident had been the failure of the bus driver to keep a proper lookout, that the lighting equipment of the truck was disabled within s. 18(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, that the company had satisfied the onus under s. 82 of the Act with regard to its failure to have the lights of the truck burning and with regard to the moving of the truck, and awarded damages of $2,500 for each deceased. A majority in the Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment but increased the general damages to $5,000 for each deceased.\nHeld (Kellock J. dissenting in part) : That the appeal should be dismissed other than as to the quantum of damages, and the award of general damages made at the trial restored.\nPer Curiam: The trial judge had proceeded on the proper principles in assessing the damages under the Trustee Act.\nPer Taschereau, Locke and Abbott JJ.: There were concurrent findings that the real and effective cause of the accident had been the failure of the bus driver to keep a proper lookout.\nAlthough there had been a contravention of ss. 17 and 18 of the Highway Traffic Act on the part of the truck driver, in that the lights at the rear of the trailer were carried at the bottom instead of at the top of the box and in the failure to have the lights lit since the lighting equipment was not disabled as found by the trial judge, the concurrent finding that these defaults did not cause or contribute to the occurrence of the accident has not been shown to have been wrong.\nPer Kellock J. (dissenting in part) : The truck company has not proved that the lighting equipment on its truck was disabled and that the failure to have the lights lit and to move the vehicle did not contribute to the accident. The effect of the breach of duty on the part of both drivers continued up to the moment of impact and rendered them both equally responsible. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1, affirming, Beaubien J. dissenting, the judgment at trial and increasing the award for damages.\nA. A. Moffat, Q.C. and P. S. Morse for the appellant.\nW. P. Fillmore, Q.C. for the respondent (defendant).\nW. A. Molloy and J. F. O'Sullivan for the respondent (plaintiff).\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nLocke J.:\u2014The learned trial judge has found that the real and effective cause of the accident was the failure of the appellant Stavos to see the trailer in time to avoid it, which I interpret in the context simply as a finding that he did not keep a proper lookout. The majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal 2 have agreed with this, and there are thus concurrent findings upon this question of fact.\nOther than the question as to the quantum of the damages allowed in respect to the claim under the Trustee Act (c. 221, R.S.M. 1940), the sole matter to be determined in this appeal, in my opinion, is as to whether there has been error in failing to give effect to the provisions of s. 82 of the Highway Traffic Act (c. 93, R.S.M. 1940), which declares that, when a motor vehicle is operated upon a highway in contravention of any provision of the Act and loss or damage is sustained by any person thereby, the onus of proving that it did not arise by reason of such contravention is upon the owner or driver thereof.\nI am unable, with great respect, to agree with the learned trial judge that the lighting equipment of the truck and trailer of the respondent, Royal Transportation Limited, was disabled within the meaning of that expression in s. 18(1) of the Act. The provisions of para. (c) of s. 17(1) of the Highway Traffic Act applied to the truck with its attached trailer, so that, in addition to the head lamps required by s. 17(1)(a), it was required to exhibit at night four lighted clearance lamps in a conspicuous position as near the top as practicable, one on each side of the front casting a green light only, and one on each side of the rear casting a red light only, the lights to be such as to be visible under normal atmospheric conditions for a distance of at least 500 feet. The lights at the rear of the trailer in question did not comply with the statute, in that they were carried one on each side at the bottom of the box of the trailer.\nWhen Sopko had put out the flares on the highway, he turned off all of the lights, assigning as his reason for this that to leave them on would soon have exhausted the battery. Other than to say that the battery was a little weak, he did not amplify the matter or attempt to estimate bow long it would have sustained the lights. He said, however, that when he stopped he thought he had only two or three gallons of gasoline left in the truck, and that this was insufficient to enable him to keep the engine running and thus charging the battery until daylight. It would have been unnecessary to have kept the head light burning and it was shown that the other lights could be left on independently, which would have materially reduced the drain on the battery. The evidence upon this aspect of the matter is indefinite and, in my opinion, unsatisfactory. Apart from this, it was shown that, at the time of the breakdown, another truck driver employed by the appellant, who had helped Sopko when the truck had broken down earlier that night, was at the scene after the breakdown south of St. Norbert and could readily have obtained an additional supply of gasoline, either at that village which was only some two or three miles distant, or from Winnipeg some fourteen miles away, so that any difficulty in keeping the lights burning until daylight could readily have been overcome. Had the lights been kept on for as long as the battery with the aid of the engine, and the limited supply of gasoline would have made this possible, any subsequent disablement would have been due to the failure to obtain the required fuel.\nThe learned trial judge found that all three flares were burning as the bus approached the respondent company's vehicle, and accepted the testimony of several witnesses who had theretofore driven north upon the highway that they were visible from one-half a mile to a mile to the south, and that while the night was dark the visibility was otherwise good. He considered that the flares, particularly the one placed alongside the stranded truck, must have lighted it up clearly. After finding that the lighting equipment was disabled, within the terms of s. 18(1) of the Act, and that this was not due to negligence on the part of Sopko or the respondent company, he said in part:\u2014\nIn order to make the defendant liable it must be shown that the failure to have the truck lights burning in some way caused the loss or damage, but the onus is on the defendant Sopko to prove that such loss or damage did not arise by reason thereof: sec. 82 of the Highway Traffic Act, supra. I have already found that the three flares were burning, one of which was alongside the Sopko truck and to the west of it and about 1\u00bd feet from the centre line of the highway. The flare in this position could readily have been seen by Stavos, who was in the driver's seat on the left hand side of his bus. Several other parties had seen the Sopko truck immediately before Stavos approached. I accept the evidence of the witness Adams, a man of considerable experience, that flares constitute a better warning than vehicle lights. I am satisfied that the absence of such clearance lights on the truck made no difference so far as this accident is concerned and that the defendant Sopko has satisfied the onus upon him.\nThe point was not dealt with more explicitly in the reasons delivered by Adamson J.A. (now C.J.M.), other than to say that he agreed with the learned trial judge that Stavos:\u2014\n\"was negligent in not seeing this trailer in time to avoid the accident and that such negligence was the real cause of the accident\", and with his finding that the bus company is wholly liable for the damage.\nI think that, when the learned judge said that in order to make the defendant liable, it must be shown that the failure to have the truck lights burning in some way caused the loss, he intended that it should be construed as caused or contributed to the occurrence. Despite the fact that the language quoted might indicate that, in determining whether it had been shown that the absence of the red clearance lights and tail light had not caused or contributed to the accident the test was whether the flares that were set out gave a more effective warning of the presence of the stranded vehicle and that that was the decisive-point, I do not think the learned judge's language should be so construed but rather as saying that the failure of Stavos to see the flares, which were so plainly visible, showed that he was not keeping any proper lookout and would not have seen the clearance lights or the tail light had they been lighted. I can assign no other meaning to the words \"the -absence of such clearance lights on the truck made no difference so far as this action is concerned.\" I think that, had I been the judge of first instance, the evidence would not have satisfied me that this was so. But where, as here, a learned and experienced trial judge and a majority of the Court, of Appeal have come to this conclusion, the former having had the benefit of observing the demeanour of the witnesses as they gave their evidence, that finding of fact should not, in my opinion, be disturbed in this Court unless we are satisfied that it is clearly wrong. In this case I think that has not been shown.\nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment to be delivered by my brother Kellock in this matter and I agree, for the reasons stated by him, that the award of damages under the Trustee Act made at the trial should be restored.\nI would dismiss this appeal other than upon the issue as to the quantum of damage. As between the appellants and the respondent Bryce, the success being divided, I would allow no costs either in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. I would allow the respondents, Royal Transportation Limited and Sopko, their costs of this appeal, and would make no change in the order as to costs contained in paragraph 4 of the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nKellock J. (dissenting in part) :\u2014The tractor and trailer of the respondent company, driven by the respondent Sopko, first broke down about seven o'clock on the evening of July 2, 1952, while proceeding northerly on the highway from Emerson to Winnipeg. The tractor and trailer weighed between 12,000 and 13,500 pounds, while the load was 20,000 pounds. The breakdown was due to the shearing of the bolts holding the dual right rear wheels on the axle, which dropped to the pavement when the wheels came off.\nSopko and one Smith, driver of another truck of the respondent company, put the wheels back on after Sopko had obtained the necessary bolts and nuts from a village in the neighbourhood. He then, followed by Smith, proceeded toward Winnipeg. On reaching a spot approximately three miles south of the Village of St. Norbert, the same wheels came off again and the truck was brought to a stop on the right-hand side of the pavement, which was twenty-four feet in width. This left some sixteen and a half feet clear to the west.\nSopko place three lighted flares, one some seventy-five paces south of the truck and to the east of the centre line of the highway, one alongside the left rear wheels, and one to the north. He and Smith then went back along the highway where they found one of the wheels although not the other. As Sopko had a spare wheel, he was in a position, on obtaining the necessary bolts and nuts, to make the same repair as before. Smith then left for Winnipeg in his truck, while Sopko got into the cab of his tractor and went to sleep, first turning out all the lights on both tractor and trailer. On arriving in Winnipeg, Smith put his truck away in the respondent company's garage and went home to bed. He made no attempt to communicate with anyone.\nAt approximately 2.15 a.m. a passenger bus, belonging to the appellant company and driven by the appellant, Stavos, crashed into the rear of the Sopko truck, the respondent Miller, as well as other passengers, being killed. This occurred, as found by the learned trial judge, over three hours after the truck had stopped.\nThe learned judge found also that the flares Sopko had put out were burning at the time of the accident, accepting in that regard the evidence of witnesses who had driven past the standing truck on their way to Winnipeg within a comparatively short time earlier. I do not think this finding, affirmed as it was by the court below, has been successfully challenged.\nStavos did not see the flares nor did he see the standing truck until too late to avoid striking it. He said that he had seen the red tail lights of a car travelling about 1,000 feet in front of him as he was some distance from the place of the accident, and that as he approached closer he observed another bus of the appellant company approaching from the north which he had recognized from its lights. He also had seen the lights of another vehicle behind that bus. These last mentioned vehicles were observed by some of the witnesses who had seen the flares near the standing truck as they had passed on their way to Winnipeg. One of these put the place of meeting of the southbound bus and truck about three miles north of the Sopko truck, while another in another car placed it some four or five miles to the north.\nStavos says that as he approached the southbound vehicles, he put the lights of his bus on low beam in order to pass. The southbound bus in fact came to a stop some seventy-five feet to the north of the place of accident.\nThe learned trial judge found that the negligence of the appellant Stavos in failing to keep a proper lookout was the sole cause of the accident. As to the contention that the respondents ought to have moved the standing truck off the pavement on to the shoulder, he considered the nature of the ground would have involved danger of overturning had that been attempted, and that it was not unreasonable for the respondents to have waited until the morning in order to have the vehicle unloaded, repaired and removed. In this view he considered that as far as concerned the moving of the tractor-trailer, the respondents had satisfied the onus placed on them by s. 82 of the Highway Traffic Act.\nWith regard to the conduct of Sopko in turning off the lights, the learned judge, in the view that Sopko had given evidence that the battery on the truck was not strong enough to have kept the lights burning all night, an erroneous view of the evidence as I shall point out, considered that the lighting equipment of the truck was \"disabled\" within the meaning of s. 18(1) of the statute, basing this finding also upon his view that Sopko had testified that he did not have sufficient gasoline to run the engine for more than an hour and that he would have to keep the engine going in order to maintain the battery. The learned trial judge made this finding \"with some hesitation\" but considered that it was not, in any event, material in view of his conclusion that it was the negligence of Stavos in failing to keep a proper lookout which was the effective cause of the accident. Further, the learned judge, basing his finding upon the evidence of one of the witnesses that, as the learned judge said, \"flares constitute a better warning than vehicle lights\", found that the onus under s. 82 arising from the failure to have burning the lights which the statute required, was satisfied. In the Court of Appeal, Adamson J.A., as he then was, with whom Coyne J.A., concurred, accepted the findings of the learned trial judge, as did Montague J.A., the latter with some reluctance as he \"was not entirely satisfied with the conduct of the driver of the Royal Transportation truck\". Beaubien J.A., however, did not agree that the lighting equipment of the standing truck was disabled within the meaning of the statute or that the respondents had satisfied the onus thrown upon them by s. 82. In his view, Smith was in a position to have secured any necessary gasoline in a very short time, either at St. Norbert or a very few miles farther north, and that on the admission of Sopko that the battery was charging all the way from Winnipeg to Emerson and return, he could not be heard to say there was any danger of it running down. The learned judge pointed out that, as Sopko had admitted, he could have turned off the headlights and left the clearance and rear lights on, thus using a negligible amount of current.\nBeaubien J.A., was also of the view that, coupled with the lights of the southbound bus and truck, the gray colour of the canvas over the Sopko trailer must, to some extent, have made it difficult to see that vehicle. He considered that had Sopko kept lighted the rear clearance lights on the trailer as the statute required him to do, those lights would have been visible a considerable distance from the trailer and, being upon the side of the highway upon which the bus was proceeding, could have been seen in time to avoid the collision. He was therefore of opinion that the negligence of Sopko had contributed to the accident and would have assessed the degrees of negligence at twenty per cent and eighty per cent respectively as between the respondents and appellants.\nS. 17(1) (a) of the statute requires every motor vehicle after sundown and before sunrise to carry a lamp at the back of the vehicle casting a red light only, clearly visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of not less than five hundred feet to the rear of the vehicle, and in the case of vehicles such as the tractor trailer here in question, to carry, in addition, two lighted clearance lamps in a conspicuous position as near the top as practicable, one on each side of the rear, also casting a red light only. These lights are similarly required, when lighted, to be visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of at least five hundred feet.\nIt will be convenient to set out relevant part of s. 18(1) :\n(1) In any case where any public service vehicle, commercial truck, or motor truck, the registered gross weight of which is in excess of eight thousand pounds, is stopped on a highway during the period when lighted lamps are required to be displayed on vehicles, and the lighting equipment required by this Act is disabled and the vehicle or truck cannot immediately be removed from the travelled portion of a highway outside a city, \u2022 town or village, the driver or other person in charge of the vehicle or truck shall cause to be placed on the highway in the manner hereinafter provided\ntwo lighted flares, lamps or lanterns, one at a distance of at least two hundred feet in advance of the vehicle and the other at least two hundred feet to the rear.\nS. 67(1) and s. 82 read:\n67(1) No person shall park or leave standing any vehicle, whether attended or unattended,\n(a) upon the travelled portion of a highway, outside of a city, town or village, when it is practicable to park or leave the vehicle off the travelled portion of the highway;\n(d) in such a manner that it obstructs traffic on a highway.\n(3) The provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of a vehicle so disabled while on a highway that it cannot be readily moved until a reasonable time has elapsed to permit its removal.\n82. Where a motor vehicle is operated upon a highway in contravention of any provision of this Act and any person claims to have sustained loss or damage thereby the onus of proof that such loss or damage did not arise by reason of the contravention of the Act shall be upon the owner or driver thereof.\nWith regard to turning off his lights, Sopko's evidence is as follows :\nQ. Why did you leave your electric lights off?\nA. On account of my battery dying out.\nQ. Your battery had been charging all the way to Emerson?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And on the way back to where you broke down south of St. Jean?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Wouldn't it be well charged up then?\nA. Well, it would be.\nQ. Your battery was not defective?\nA. She was a little weak because starting up a truck from one place to another takes quite a bit of juice.\nQ. You only started up two or three times from Emerson?\nA. Yes. Sopko did not testify, as the learned trial judge seemed to think, that the battery was not strong enough to keep the lights burning all night. While he did testify that he had only enough gasoline to keep the engine operating about an hour, the battery was not dependent upon the operation of the engine, and, in any event, neither he nor Smith made any effort to obtain gasoline, which could no doubt have been readily obtained in the neighbourhood. If it was not, the onus of establishing that fact was upon the respondents. I agree, therefore, with Beaubien J.A., that it is impossible for the respondents to contend in these circumstances that the lighting equipment of the standing truck was \"disabled\" within the meaning of the statute. The onus of proof that the accident did not arise by reason of this contravention of the statute was upon the respondents.\nThe respondents contend that the onus is satisfied by the finding of the learned trial judge that the effective cause of the accident was the failure of the appellant Stavos to keep a proper lookout and to see the flares. In taking this view, the learned judge accepted, as already pointed out, the opinion of a witness that flares constitute a better warning than vehicle lights. The statute, however, does not enable the court to make any such substitution. It provides for flares only when the lighting equipment is disabled in the case of a truck with a registered gross weight in excess of eight thousand pounds. In the case at bar, neither condition was met. The statutory requirement was for three red lights showing to the rear of the vehicle.\nThe paramountcy of the requirement for red to be shown on the rear of a standing vehicle is further emphasized by s-s. (2) of s. 7, which permits a vehicle, when standing upon a highway at a time when lighted lamps are required to be displayed, to show \"in lieu of the lights hereinbefore required\", one light on the left side of the vehicle in such a manner as to be clearly visible both to the front and the back for a distance of at least two hundred feet in normal atmospheric conditions, such light to show white or green to the front and \"red only\" to the rear: In the view of the legislature, flares are second best and are only authorized when the vehicle is disabled from showing red lights.\nMy brother Locke, in Bruce v. McIntyre 3, observed that\n\u2026 persons driving upon the highway at night are, I think, entitled to proceed on the assumption that the drivers of other vehicles will comply with the provisions of the Highway Act and that any vehicle, either parked or temporarily stopped on the highway, will exhibit a red light at the rear.\nThis was said with respect to the Ontario statute, which calls for red lights on the rear of standing vehicles. In that case the light shown was amber and the court considered that the background, including the moon then shining, made it more difficult to see the light actually burning than would otherwise have been the case.\nStavos, unlike the drivers of any other vehicles who approached from the south and passed the standing truck that night, was meeting the driving lights of southbound traffic. While he testified that the lights of those vehicles did not interfere with his vision, that does not eliminate the consideration that the flares would not be as readily picked out as they would have been had there been no other lights in the background. This was also the view of Beaubien J.A., as I have already pointed out. In fact, while Stavos did not see the flares, he did see the white lights of the southbound traffic, although it was farther away.\nIn my view, it is impossible for the respondents to \"prove\" (the statutory word) that had they had the three red lights on the back of the truck lit, these would not have been seen by Stavos at the statutory distance of at least five hundred feet, an ample distance within which he could have, if necessary, stopped his vehicle or at least passed to the left of the standing vehicle. Had the lighting equipment been in fact disabled, the situation would no doubt have been different. There would then have been no contravention of the statute as to lights to which s. 82 would have applied.\nIn my opinion, the same result obtains with respect to the failure of the respondents to move the standing vehicle prior to the accident. The breakdown occurred within nine miles of the City of Winnipeg and within fourteen miles of the respondent company's garage there. In order to put the truck in condition to be moved, it was necessary to do only what Sopko and Smith had already done shortly before at St. Jean. All that were needed were a few bolts and nuts which Ramsay, the Superintendent of the respondent company's operations, testified were obtainable at the company's garage in Winnipeg.\nThis witness also said that most of their drivers had been with the company for a long time and understood that he was to be called in case of an emergency. Smith, who had been with the company approximately twenty-five years, had had these instructions and knew Ramsay's telephone number and also knew how to get the company's mechanic. Instead of making any attempt to follow these instructions and get in touch with Ramsay or the mechanic by telephone from St. Norbert or any place else, neither Sopko nor Smith did anything although they had over three hours between the breakdown and the accident.\nAccepting, as I do, the impracticability of moving the standing truck off the concrete on to the soft shoulder without replacing the wheels, nevertheless, leaving the stalled vehicle on the highway beyond a reasonable time was a contravention of the statute, even although flares had been put out. It is significant- that while s. 67 uses the words \"a reasonable time\", s. 18(1) uses the words \"cannot immediately be removed.\" In requiring the removal of a stalled vehicle within a reasonable time for its removal, the statute recognizes that its presence on a highway is a hazard to other traffic, including even the unwary to whom its protection is also extended. The hazard which such an obstacle presents, even when lighted, has been proved over and over by the numerous cases which have reached the courts arising out of such collisions. I think it is impossible, therefore, for the respondents to \"prove\" that this further contravention of the statute did not contribute to the accident.\nMr. Fillmore relies upon certain decisions in other cases on facts having more or less resemblance to those here in question. Some of them should be referred to. In Marsden Kooler Transport v. Pollock 4, my brother Estey has distinguished the facts of Jones v. Shafer 5, from those in the case then before the court. In both cases, flares had been placed on the highway to the north and south of the stalled truck. In the Jones case the flares were removed by a person unknown, and the learned trial judge found that the truck could not have been moved by the means at hand and the necessary equipment to move it could not have been obtained at least until the next morning. Moreover, after the flares had been removed and before the accident, the police had turned on the lights on the truck.\nIn Marsden's case, the flares had not been placed as required by the relevant statute and they had gone out. Although the truck driver had communicated with another of the appellant's drivers, who came out with his truck, no effort had been made to move the stalled vehicle, the trial judge finding that that could have been done had the two tractors been used for the purpose. Moreover, the truck driver left the trailer, went to Edmonton and, on finding the appellant company's warehouse closed, went home to bed, making no other effort to get in touch with his employer until the next morning. Nor did he notify the police or anyone else of the presence of the trailer on the highway.\nIt may also be remarked that in neither of the above cases was any statutory provision similar to s. 82 of the statute here in question invoked.\nIn McKee and Taylor v. Malenfant 6, the learned trial judge found that had the respondent been keeping a proper lookout, he would have observed two vehicles preceding him travelling in the same direction, pass the standing truck. It was also found that after he did see the standing truck in fact, he had plenty of opportunity to avoid hitting it. In this court the case was disposed of by the majority upon this second ground.\nThe decision of the Judicial Committee in Marvin Sigurdson v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company 7, is a reaffirmation of the decision in Admiralty Commissioners v. S. S. Volute 8, and points out that the language of Viscount Birkenhead, at p. 144, is to be preferred to attempts to classify acts in relation to one another with reference to time or with regard to the knowledge of one party at a particular moment of the negligence of the other party and his appreciation of the resulting danger, and by such tests to create categories in some of which one party is solely liable and others in which both parties are liable. Their Lordships said at p. 299:\nTime and knowledge may often be decisive factors, but it is for the jury or other tribunal of fact to decide whether in any particular case the existence of one of these factors results or does not result in the ascertainment of that clear line to which Viscount Birkenhead referred\u2014moreover, their Lordships do not read him as intending to lay down that the existence of \"subsequent\" negligence will alone enable that clear line to be found.\nTheir Lordships disposed of the criticism with respect to the facts of the case there in question on the ground that the jury were entitled to come to the conclusion, \"taking a broad view of the case as a whole\", that the negligence of the motorman was in the circumstances the sole cause of the accident irrespective of the precise moment at which he became aware of the danger. After referring to the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act and other similar enactments, their Lordships stated, at p. 304:\n\u2026 it may well be that in practice this legislation may have tended to encourage the application of those broad principles of common sense in the apportionment of blame unless the dividing line is clearly visible. Whether or not it emerges with clarity or is so blurred as to be barely distinguishable from the surrounding mass is a -question of fact in each case for the tribunal charged with the duty of determining such questions.\nIn the case at bar, I do not think a clear line can be drawn in the apportionment of blame as contributing causes of the accident between the failure on the part of Stavos to keep a proper lookout and the contravention of the statute by the respondents in the respects mentioned. The effect of the breach of duty on the part of both appellants and respondents continued up to the moment of impact and both are, in my opinion, equally responsible. Reference may usefully be made to the decision of the House of Lords in Stapley v. Gypsum Mines Limited 9, and particularly to the judgment of Lord Reid at p. 486. The judgments of the members of the Court of Appeal in Williams v. Sykes and Harrison Limited 10, afford an illustration of the application in other circumstances, of course, of the principle which, in my judgment, is to be applied in the case at bar. Miller, the deceased, was fifty-six years of age and in normal health except that he was, as found by the learned trial judge, \"hard of hearing\". The learned trial judge found upon the evidence that it was to be inferred he was reasonably happy. Basing himself upon the decisions of the House of Lords in Benham v. Gambling 11, and of this court in Bechthold v. Osbaldeston 12, he assessed the damages under the Trustee Act at $2,500, taking into consideration the depreciation in the value of money.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Adamson J.A., with the concurrence of Coyne and Montague JJ.A., after pointing out that \"each case must be decided on its own facts\", went on to say:\nWhere, however, there is no substantial difference in the quality, usefulness, or the happiness of the lives which are lost, to allow $7,500 for the loss of one life (as was done in the Bechtold case, supra), and only $2,500 as was done in this case is not equitable.\nThe right to damages under this head is given by sec. 49(1) of the Trustee Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 221, \"as if such representative were the deceased in life.\" For total and permanent disablement (and that is what loss of life amounts to, at least) a person is usually allowed a very substantial sum.\nIn this view, he fixed the general damages at $5,000. The item of $440 special damages was not in question.\nIn Benham's case, Viscount Simon points out more than once that while the thing to be valued is the \"prospect of a predominantly happy life\", attention is to be directed in every case to the life of the individual in question. He also said at p. 168 :\nDamages which would be proper for a disabling injury may well be much greater than for deprivation of life.\nThis is counter to the basis upon which the judgment below proceeds, as set out above. It should be said that while s. 49(1) of the Trustee Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 221, is not ipsissima verba with 24 & 25 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 1 (Imperial), the effect for present purposes is the same.\nI agree, therefore, with Beaubien J.A., that the judgment at trial, proceeding, as it did, upon proper principles, ought not to have been disturbed. The appeal should therefore be allowed the order of the Court of Appeal of the 17th of January, 1955, be set aside, and the judgment at trial be amended by striking out para. 1 thereof and amending para. 2 by providing for judgment against the respondents Royal Transportation Limited and Joseph Sopko as well as the appellants. The appellants should have their costs in the Court of Appeal against the respondents Royal Transportation and Sopko, the latter to have their costs of the cross-appeal of the respondent Bryce to that court. The appellants should have one-half of their costs in this court against the respondents Royal Transportation Limited and Sopko and one-half against the respondent Bryce. There should be no costs in this court as between the respondents Royal Transportation Limited and Sopko and the respondent Bryce.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aikins, MacAuly & Company.\nSolicitors for the respondent (plaintiff): McMurray, Walsh & Company.\nSolicitors for the respondent (defendant): Fillmore, Riley & Fillmore.\n1 [1955] 14 W.W.R. 258; 2 D.L.R. 251.\n2 [1955] 14 W.W.R. 258; 2 D.L.R. 251.\n3 [1955] S.C.R. 251 at 261.\n4 [1953] 1 S.C.R. 66 at 70.\n5 [1948] S.C.R. 166.\n6 [1954] S.C.R. 651.\n7 [1953] A.C. 291.\n8 [1922] 1 A.C. 129.\n9 [1953] 2 A.E. 478.\n10 [1955] 3 A.E. 225.\n11 [1941] A.C. 157.\n12 [1953] 2 S.C.R. 177.\n",

The trial judge acquitted him on the charges of theft and receiving and convicted him of retaining. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered an acquittal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe presumption of recent possession does not apply to the offence of retaining. Guilty knowledge must be acquired subsequent to the original obtaining of possession. In the present case, there was no evidence that the respondent had acquired, after the goods had come into his possession, knowledge that they had been stolen.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], quashing the respondent\u2019s conviction on a charge of retaining and ordering his acquittal.\nC.P. Hope, Q.C. for the appellant.\nA. Cooper for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014A majority of the Members of the Court which heard this appeal are of the view that the offence of retaining stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen is a separate and distinct offence from that of receiving. In Clay v. The King[2], I adopted as correct the statement of Roach J.A., when that matter was before the Court of Appeal, that on a charge of retaining goods which had been stolen knowing them to have been stolen, the presumption in the case of recent possession arose if at the time of receiving the accused knew that the goods had been stolen; that that presumption of knowledge continued down through the period in relation to which the accused was charged with retaining. In the Clay case that was also the view of Chief Justice Rinfret, Taschereau J. and Fauteux J. A careful examination of the reasons of Estey J. leads me to the conclusion that he considered that guilty knowledge must be acquired subsequent to the original obtaining of possession.\nThere was, therefore, no majority as to the basis for the application of the presumption. In view of the fact that four of the Members of the Court hearing this appeal held and hold the view indicated above, it should now be laid down that the presumption does not apply at all to the offence of retaining.\nAs to this particular case, there is a right of appeal as ground number two, upon which leave to appeal was granted, is a question of law, i.e., as to whether there was any evidence of subsequently acquired knowledge on the part of the respondent that the goods in his possession were stolen goods. In my view there was no evidence upon which the Magistrate could find that Suchard acquired, after the goods had come into his possession, knowledge that they had been stolen, and the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The first ground upon which leave to appeal was granted is whether:\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in law in failing properly to apply the principle enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Clay v. The King.\nHolding that receiving and retaining constitute two distinct criminal offences, Members of this Court divided in the Clay case[3], as to the feature of the distinction between the two.\nOn the view of a majority, the time at which the knowledge, that the property is stolen property, is acquired differentiates one offence from the other. If this guilty knowledge is coincident with the initial possession of the stolen property, the offence is receiving; if only subsequent thereto, it is retaining.\nOn the view of a minority, inception of the possession, in the case of receiving, and retention of the possession, in the case of retaining, manifest the only distinction between the two offences. It matters not since when, in retaining, or how long after, in receiving, the guilty knowledge co-exists with the possession, provided it does so at the time of reception with respect to the latter offence, or at any time with respect to the former.\nSince and by this decision, the opinion of the majority has become the judgment of the Court on the matter.\nOn the basis of this now settled definition of retaining, no longer can the presumption of recent possession be effective to support a conviction of retaining. For, in its very nature, the presumption, resulting from the mere circumstance of recent possession of stolen goods, is that the initial possession was gained with the knowledge that the goods were stolen. The fact thus presumed\u2014i.e. a guilty knowledge coincidental with initial possession\u2014negatives the existence of an honest initial possession which is part of the essence of retaining and, hence, necessarily precludes a conviction for the latter offence. Furthermore, as under the definition of retaining, an honest initial possession is postulated, the presumption is also ineffective\u2014as was held, in the Clay case, by those who expressed the view that the doctrine of recent possession was applicable to the offence of retaining as they then conceived it\u2014to change it into a dishonest one.\nIn brief, and once the fact of recent possession of stolen goods is established, the fact that they were gained with the knowledge that they were stolen is immediately presumed; and while a conviction for theft or receiving may then be supported by this presumption, a conviction of retaining cannot. In the latter case, other evidence must be adduced and be, on the whole, more consistent with a guilty knowledge subsequent to the inception of the possession than, as presumed to be, in view of the fact of recent possession, coincident thereto.\nThe first ground of appeal is then well taken.\nThe second ground, upon which leave to appeal was granted, was whether:\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in finding that there was no evidence of subsequent acquired knowledge on the part of the respondent that the goods in his possession were stolen goods. That question implies, as it should, that the distinction, between the offence of receiving and the offence of retaining, made by the majority in the Clay case, is the proper one.\nIn the present case, and as against the respondent, there was evidence of recent possession and, hence, of dishonest initial possession; there was also evidence of conduct indicating that, since some time, he had a guilty knowledge that the rings were stolen property.\nThe conviction, however, was for retaining. On a careful consideration, it cannot be said that the whole of the evidence is more consistent with a guilty knowledge subsequent to initial possession than, as flowing from the presumption, coincident thereto.\nOn this second ground, I am in respectful agreement with the unanimous view of the Court of Appeal and would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The respondent was charged, together with Joyce Hickey, Arthur Scott and John Jones, on three counts, (1) theft of certain rings, (2) receiving, and (3) retaining the same rings. The charges were tried in Magistrate\u2019s Court and were dismissed against Scott and Hickey, no evidence being offered as against the latter. The respondent and Jones were convicted of retaining and found hot guilty of theft and receiving. On appeal by the respondent to the Court of Appeal[4], the conviction was quashed and a verdict of acquittal directed to be entered. The appeal to this court is by leave pursuant to the provisions of s. 1025 (2) of the Criminal Code.\nThe rings in question were proved to have been stolen from a retail store in Hamilton on the afternoon of Friday, August 6, 1954. On the evening of that day, the respondent, together with Jones, was in Windsor, where they met Hickey and one Reid, with whom she was living in Windsor. The four were together at times over the ensuing week-end.\nOn Monday, August 9, the four met by arrangement in a hotel at 2 p.m. Hickey testified that on this occasion Jones asked her if she had any idea where \u201cthey\u201d could sell \u201csome rings they brought up from Toronto\u201d. On Hickey stating that she might know some people she could introduce them to, \u201cthey\u201d asked Reid if \u201cthey\u201d could borrow the car and take her with them. The three then went to a club where Hickey introduced Jones and the respondent to some people who weren\u2019t interested. They then met Scott, who was told by Hickey that the two men were interested in selling rings and he was asked if he knew anyone who might want them. In the upshot, following a telephone call made by Scott, the four drove to a parking lot, where Jones handed the rings to Scott for the purpose of showing them presumably to the person to whom he had spoken. Ultimately, he returned and said that he was to telephone at six p.m.\nThe party got back into the car and started back for the hotel, Scott giving the rings back to Jones. During this drive, Scott was in the back seat, Jones drove the car with Hickey beside him, and Suchard was on the right-hand side of the front seat. During this drive they were intercepted by the police. When this occurred Jones handed the rings to Hickey, instructing her to hide them. She slipped them inside her blouse and later produced them to the police. When the car was stopped the respondent was asked to get out, and upon being searched, two ring boxes were found in his pocket. The rings themselves were identified by the Hamilton retailer, who also deposed that the boxes were of the type containing the rings at the time of the theft but it was not possible to identify them absolutely as the ribbon bearing the name of the retailer had been torn out in each case.\nOn the occasion when the theft occurred, a man had entered the store and handed the jeweller a bracelet type watch, asking him to tighten the clips. The jeweller had to go to his work bench at the back of the store for the necessary tools and he was followed there by the owner of the watch. Just as the jeweller got into the workshop, two more men entered the store. The jeweller tightened the clips as quickly as he could and handed the watch back to the owner, having to push him out of the way in order to get back into the store to attend to the other two. Immediately upon the three leaving the store, the jeweller noticed that two clocks had been taken from a shelf. He therefore checked his stock in a safe which had been open. This took some four or five hours. As a result of this checking, the rings were found to be missing and the police were notified. At the time of Jones\u2019 arrest, he was wearing a wrist-watch and bracelet of the type worn by the first man who had entered the store. On this evidence the magistrate disposed of the charges as above mentioned. In his view, the evidence established joint possession of the rings on the part of Jones and the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded upon the view that there was no evidence pointing to guilty knowledge having been acquired by the respondent after he had received the goods. The court considered that while it has been established by the judgment of this court in Clay v. The King[5], that where the only evidence of guilty knowledge, including the inference arising from the fact of recent possession of stolen goods relates to the inception of the possession, an accused person cannot be convicted on a charge of retaining but only of receiving, the court considered that all of the evidence in the case at bar pointed only to knowledge at the time of receiving. The conviction was accordingly set aside.\nIn Clay v. The King, ubi cit, it was held by Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ., that the offences of receiving and retaining are separate and distinct and mutually exclusive, the difference between the two being that (p. 190) \u201cin the case of the offence of retaining, there is an interval of time, however short, between the actual receipt of the goods and receipt of knowledge of their stolen character, during which interval the possession is either an honest possession or the character of this interval is not in question.\u201d\nEstey J. was of the same opinion. At p. 208 he said:\nReceiving and retaining, as already stated,\u2026 are separate and distinct offences and an accused, even when the evidence of guilty knowledge can be found only in the presumption, can only be found guilty of either theft or receiving, but not both. Upon the same basis an accused cannot be found guilty of receiving and retaining. If an accused party receives the guilty knowledge coincident with possession of the stolen property, he is guilty of the offence of receiving and not of retaining. If, however, he receives the property and subsequently acquires knowledge that the property was stolen, and thereafter continues to retain same, he is guilty of the offence of retaining.\nWith regard to the doctrine of recent possession, it was held by Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ. that it did not apply to the offence of retaining. The judgment. of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ., contra, was founded on the view that the offence of retaining was to be defined as being in possession of goods having acquired knowledge of their stolen character at any time during the possession, including the time of the actual receipt of the goods.\nWhile at one point in his reasons Estey J. said, at p. 208, that \u201cthe presumption of recent possession applies to all three of these offences\u201d, the learned judge, in dealing with the facts before the court, said, at p. 209:\nThe explanation here given related to the initial reception of the stolen property and was disbelieved by the learned trial judge . . . There was no evidence that justified the conclusion that he received the goods without knowledge of their having been stolen and subsequently acquired such knowledge and thereafter continued to retain the same.\nIf the earlier statement of the learned judge that the presumption of recent possession really applied to the offence of retaining, then the explanation of possession given by the accused having related only to the initial reception, the presumption still applied to the offence of retaining, as to which no explanation had been given. Estey J. found, however, that there \u201cwas no evidence that justified the conclusion that he received the goods without knowledge of their having been stolen and subsequently acquired such knowledge and thereafter continued to retain same,\u201d a finding which he could not have made if the presumption applied to the charge of retaining.\nThat this is the true view of the ground upon which the learned judge proceeded is confirmed by the last sentence of his reasons at p. 210:\nThe evidence does not support a conviction of retaining, as that offence is constituted under s. 399.\nThis is in accord with the actual judgment of the court in the case of Clay as it set aside the conviction on the charge of retaining.\nIn the case at bar, therefore, the appellant, having been acquitted of the offences of theft and receiving, the only question is whether there was any evidence upon which the magistrate was justified in finding knowledge subsequently acquired. In the opinion of the court appealed from, all of the evidence was consistent only with guilty knowledge at the inception of possession.\nWhere the evidence indicating knowledge other than that afforded by the presumption is not sufficient to show knowledge at all, the Crown is confined to the presumption which relates only to the charge of receiving. In reaching the conclusion that there is knowledge where there is evidence apart from the presumption, the tribunal is not bound to act upon the presumption. The time when such knowledge came to the accused may be uncertain, and then it is a matter for the first tribunal to decide the greater probability of its having been acquired when receiving the property or later. There may be doubt of the former, and in that case the tribunal may find that it was subsequent, and convict on the count of retaining. If it is once shown that knowledge has co-existed with possession, then obviously that coincidence must have arisen either at the moment of receiving the goods or thereafter; it is necessarily the one or the other; and its attribution to one period automatically concludes the charge based on the other.\nThe presumption is merely an inference of fact which has become crystallized into a rule of law. The doctrine arose out of the practical necessities of the enforcement of the law against theft and the allied offence of receiving and other offences which are incident or connected. It is a device available to the Crown, and by means of it, the burden of furnishing an explanation for the possession is cast upon the accused.\nThis being the nature of the presumption, it is obviously not open to the accused in any case to demand its application formally to one or other count against him; Reg. v. Langmead[6], per Blackburn J. The prosecution may or may not rely upon it. All that is open to the accused is to meet it with an explanation or resist its application, not require it to be applied for his own purposes.\nIn Clay\u2019s case, the evidence, apart from the presumption, from which a conclusion of knowledge could have been drawn was of such facts as necessarily involved knowledge, if at all, at the time of receiving the goods. Accordingly, the acquittal upon the charge of receiving necessarily entailed a finding that those facts did not give rise to a conclusion of knowledge. In that event they could not thereafter be made use of for the purposes of a conviction for retaining.\nIn the case at bar I am not prepared to differ from the view of the Court of Appeal as to the import of the evidence.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment to be delivered in this matter by my brother Kellock and I agree with his statement as to the matter decided by the judgment of this Court in Clay v. The King[7].\nThe learned Chief Justice of Ontario, in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, has found that there was no evidence adduced at the hearing pointing to guilty knowledge being acquired by the respondent after the time of receiving. With this I respectfully agree and would accordingly dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.C. Bowman.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.M.

The appellant, a wholesaler, distributed magazines, periodicals and books to retailers of the same on the basis that the latter were entitled to full credit for the return of unsold goods within a specified time. On its books, it treated the deliveries as outright sales. For income tax purposes, it set up a \"reserve\" for loss on returns which represented the profit element in the sale value of goods delivered during the year which it estimated would be returned to it during the three months following the end of its fiscal year. The Minister disallowed the deduction of this \"reserve\" as prohibited under s. 6(1)(d) of the Income War Tax Act. It was allowed by the Income Tax Appeal Board and this decision was reversed by the Exchequer Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. dissenting): That the appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kellock J.: The deliveries made by the appellant were not \"on consignment\" nor were they on the basis of \"sale or return\". The property passed to the retailers upon delivery. But since there was a right of return, the sales were therefore subject to a condition subsequent with the result that the property would re-vest in the appellant. Accordingly, the appellant was not entitled to set up any reserve of profits, but should be entitled to deduct the estimated sales value itself, subject, when the actual figure is ascertained, to adjustment when the returns are actually made.\nPer Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The transactions were not outright sales or deliveries \"on consignment\" but were deliveries on a \"sale or return basis\". The property in the goods did not pass to the retailers nor were they liable for the amounts covering the deliveries other than for the goods sold or not returned within the agreed period. The claim for deduction has been established although the true nature of the transactions was not shown by the appellant's books. In computing the appellant's income, there should be excluded from the total of the sales any amount in respect of goods delivered and in the hands of retailers at the end of the fiscal year, for the purchase price of which the retailers were not then liable and, from the total of purchases, any amounts as the purchase price of such goods and the amounts set up in the accounts of the appellant for the year as a reserve for loss on returns should be deleted.\nPer Kerwin C.J. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Cameron J.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Cameron J. 1, reversing the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board.\nMannie Brown for the appellant.\nJ. Singer, Q.C. and J. D. C. Boland for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting):\u2014These are two appeals from judgments of the Exchequer Court. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Cameron in disposing of these matters, both appeals should be dismissed with costs. Kellock J.:\u2014In these appeals the appellant claims to deduct, for the purpose of computing its taxable income for the fiscal years ending January 31, 1945 and 1946, respectively, a \"reserve\" for loss on returns representing the profit element in the sale price, as distinct from the sale price itself, of periodicals in the hands of dealers on the above dates unsold and expected to be returned to the appellant. In its profit and loss accounts for each of the years in question, the appellant has arrived at gross profit by taking the amount of the sale price of all periodicals delivered to dealers during the fiscal year, less the amount of the \"reserve\" above referred to, and deducting therefrom its own cost. It is the contention of the Minister that the deduction of this reserve is prohibited by the terms of s. 6(1) (d) of The Income Tax Act.\nThe appellant has throughout rested its claim for the deduction of this reserve exclusively upon the footing that all of its deliveries to dealers were \"on consignment\". This was specifically pleaded below in connection with the 1946 assessment. There were no pleadings with respect to the year 1945. In his opening to the Income Tax Appeal Board, counsel for the appellant stated that \"it is made clear to each dealer before he commences business with the wholesaler that he obtains his merchandise on consignment and subject to the right of the Sinnott News to repossess the magazines whenever it pleases.\" This is again the position exclusively taken in the appellant's factum in this court.\nI find myself in agreement with the learned trial judge that, in fact, the conduct of the appellant's business was not in accord with the position thus taken by the appellant. The only thing that was in accord was that the statements which accompanied shipments of magazines to dealers bore the words \"on consignment\", although even these words were missing in the case of repeat orders.\nThereafter, however, the appellant treated the deliveries as actual sales. The deliveries were made three times a week and on the following Wednesday of each week, a statement of account was sent to each dealer particularizing the deliveries of the preceding week and notifying the dealers that such amounts were \"now due\". Again, all deliveries were immediately charged in the books of the appellant to each dealer and included in the appellant's accounts receivable. Moreover, when magazines were returned, a credit note was issued by the appellant to the dealers. Apart from the undoubted right on the part of the dealers to return the magazines, with which I shall subsequently deal, there was really nothing in the method of carrying on the appellant's business which supports the position they now take, apart from the use of the word \"consignment\" on the invoices to which I have referred. I am accordingly of opinion that there was ample evidence for the finding of the learned trial judge and that the appellant cannot succeed on this ground.\nWhile the learned trial judge in the course of his judgment states that it was understood between the appellant and its dealers that the goods were delivered on the basis of \"fully on sale or return\", this statement is amplified in the following sentence of his judgment, which states that \"the retailer is notified by the respondent as to the date by which unsold goods are to be returned, and upon their return by that date full credit is given to the retailer for the amount he has paid or been charged.\" It would be inconsistent with the conclusion to which the learned judge ultimately came that the goods were sold by the appellant to its dealers on delivery that he should be taken in his reference to the understanding that the goods were \"delivered on the basis of fully on sale or return\" to be making a finding that the parties were dealing on the basis of \"sale or return\" as that phrase is understood in law. The learned judge appears rather, in using this language, to have had in mind the evidence given by the witness Sinnott before the Income Tax Appeal Board namely:\nWe sell everything to the retailer on the sale or return. Our invoices that we deliver with the goods are marked \"on consignment\".\nThis witness drew no distinction between deliveries on consignment and deliveries \"on the sale or return\". It is in this sense he was understood by the learned trial judge, who, on this footing, puts the issue as follows:\n\u2026 the sole question to be determined is whether or not there was a sale of the goods by the company to the retailers.\nThis is followed almost immediately by the statement that:\nNow, the only suggestion that the goods were delivered \"on consignment\" is the use of those words on the delivery slips. It was not argued on behalf of the appellant that the deliveries here in question were on \"sale or return\". His contention, as already mentioned, was that all deliveries were on consignment.\nI would, in any event, be of opinion that the same considerations which negative a consignment basis, equally negative \"sale or return\". S. 19 of The Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O., 1950, c 345, rule 4, which deals with the passing of the property in the case of goods delivered on sale or return, is prefaced by the words \"unless a different intention appears.\" For the reasons already given, I think it clearly appears that the property passed to the dealers upon delivery of the magazines.\nThis, however, does not end the matter, as the parties were at one that there was a right on the part of the dealers to return the magazines at any time. The witness Parke, called on behalf of the Minister, testified:\nQ. In any event, you exercise the right to return anything and everything you desire?\nA. That is right.\nThe witness made it clear that this right was exercisable at any time and the evidence on behalf of the appellant is to the same effect. This being so, while the transactions between the appellant and its dealers were sales and not deliveries on consignment, they were nevertheless sales subject to a condition subsequent, the result being that, in the case of magazines actually returned, the property re-vested in the appellant; Head v. Tattersall 2, per Cleasby B.; May v. Conn 3; Benjamin, 8th ed. 415. The situation would be otherwise where there is a sale but the vendor has bound himself to repurchase in certain events, such as was considered to be the situation in The Vesta 4.\nAccordingly, the appellant is not entitled to set up, as it has done, any reserve of profits. The reserve sought to be set up is made up of the profit element in the sale value of goods delivered to dealers during each of the years in question which the appellant estimated would be returned to it during the three months following. This estimate, to quote the appellant's factum, \"was practical, reasonably accurate, and arrived at on the basis of the actual experience of the company with each magazine for a reasonable time prior to the end of the year.\"\nAs deposed to by the witness Sinnott, at the end of the three month period, the appellant would \"know exactly\" the value of goods actually returned. Accordingly, instead of deducting the above mentioned reserve from the sales figure in respect of each of the years in question, the appellant should be entitled, in its income tax returns, to deduct the estimated sales value itself, subject, however, when the actual figure is ascertained at the end of the three months' period, to adjustment in the year in which such returns are actually made.\nAlthough the appellant fails with respect to the basis upon which it contested this litigation, the practical result is the same. I would therefore allow the appeals with costs here and below.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nLocke J.:\u2014This appeal concerns the appellant's liability for income and excess profits taxes in respect of its fiscal years terminating on January 31, 1945 and 1946. The facts which affect the question are the same in each of these years and the matter may be conveniently dealt with by considering the relevant evidence as to the former only.\nThe appellant distributes magazines and other periodicals to some 2,500 retail dealers in Toronto and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario. It receives its supplies of these publications either from the publishers or from the distributors representing them, accounting for them under agreements a typical specimen of which is in evidence, being an agreement between the Curtis Publishing Company and the appellant dated August 1, 1942. Under that agreement, deliveries of the publications of that company are made to the appellant on consignment for the purpose of enabling their distribution to retailers, the price received from these dealers, less specified deductions, being remitted to the publisher and the cover pages of unsold copies returned. The status of the appellant under this and other similar agreements with publishers or wholesale distributors appears to be that of a mercantile agent to which the Factors Act (c. 125, R.S.O. 1950) would apply.\nThe arrangements made between the appellant and the retailers to whom it delivers the publications for sale have been found by the learned trial judge to constitute deliveries on sale or return and, accordingly, Rule 4 of s. 19 of the Sale of Goods Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 345) applies.\nS. 19, Rule 4, of the Sale of Goods Act of Ontario was taken verbatim from Rule 4 of s. 18 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (Imp.). The expression delivery \"on sale or return\" had a well known meaning under the law merchant prior to being incorporated in that statute. That meaning was stated by Sir George Jessel M.R. in Ex parte Wingfield 5, as follows:\u2014\nLet us consider, then, what is the position of a man who has goods sent to him on sale or return. He receives the goods from the true owner with an option of becoming the owner, which can be exercised in one of three ways\u2014by buying the goods at the price named by the vendor; by selling the goods to some one else, which is taken to be a declaration of his option; or by keeping them so long that it would be unreasonable that he should return them.\nThis definition was adopted by the Court of Appeal four years after the passing of the statute in Kirkham v. Attenborough 6.\nFor the fiscal year ending January 31, 1944 and for at least some years previously, the appellant, in preparing its annual balance sheet and profit and loss account for income tax purposes, included as accounts receivable the amounts which would become owing by the retail dealers in respect of publications delivered to them on sale or return in the same manner as would have been done had the goods been sold outright. In preparing the profit and loss account, the price payable, if they were sold or retained, for the goods in the hands of the dealers on these terms was included in the total of the sales. In this manner, the company was assessed to income tax for amounts which included the profit upon goods delivered on sale or return, in respect of which the dealers might or might not exercise their right to purchase or which they might otherwise elect not to return. Up to and including January 31, 1944, the appellant claimed as a business expense for the year following the termination of its fiscal year the amounts refunded by it for publications delivered during the previous year and, during the war years when paper supplies were short and the numbers of the various publications consequently limited, the returns from retail dealers in respect of which it was necessary to give credits were comparatively small in number and the appellant was apparently content to be taxed on this footing.\nDuring the fiscal year ending January 31, 1945, there were larger supplies of available paper, with the result that most of the publishers increased considerably the number of their publications printed and more ample supplies were available for the retail dealers. Apparently as a result of this, much greater numbers of publications were returned by the retailers for which they became entitled to credit, these returns running as high as 30 to 35% of the goods delivered. In spite of the fact that the practice of delivering the publications on sale or return had continued throughout the year, the appellant continued to show the amounts which might become payable by the retailers if they elected to purchase the publications or retain them beyond the time limited for their return as if they were sales outright. At the end of this fiscal year, the balance sheet showed accounts receivable of $64,256.83, representing the amounts which would become payable by the retailers if all merchandise then in their hands on sale or return was retained. Similarly, in the profit and loss account the gross figure for sales included this merchandise and the net profit was, computed as if all of the deliveries had been sales. Since this would, as it had in previous years, result in the company being taxed upon an amount for income which would, of necessity, be excessive if any such proportion of the publications so delivered were returned, the accountants for the company set up a reserve for loss on returns of $11,574.69. This was the taxpayer's estimate of the credits which, in the ordinary course of business, it would be necessary to give to the retailers for publications returned after January 31, 1945, which had been in their hands on sale or return on that date. S. 6(1)(d) of the Income War Tax Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97 as amended) provided that, in computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, no deduction shall be allowed for amounts credited as a reserve, except such an amount for bad debts as the Minister may allow and except as otherwise provided in the Act. The Minister disallowed the amount so set up as a reserve and assessed the appellant as if the deliveries included in the accounts receivable for the year in question had all been sales.\nNo question of credibility arises in considering the evidence of the witnesses, there being no conflict on any material point. It is true that the witness Sinnott, the President of the appellant company, said that they \"sold\" on consignment, meaning presumably that the goods were delivered on consignment, but his description of the arrangements and that of the accountant Willcock and of the witness Parke show clearly that this was inaccurate and that the deliveries were on sale or return, as found by the learned trial judge.\nUnder the verbal agreements made between the appellant and the various retailers, the publications were delivered thrice weekly. With each delivery an account, which showed the amount which would be payable if all the goods then and theretofore delivered were retained by the dealer, accompanied the goods. The retailer was required to pay a stipulated price for each of the publications sold by him or retained beyond dates specified from time to time by the appellant. The amounts payable, which would rarely be the amount of the balance shown on the account, were to be paid either weekly or, in the case of some large dealers such as the United Cigar Stores, monthly. For publications returned within the required times, credit was given in the running account kept by the appellant and payments made since the delivery of the last account were shown as credits. The retailer might return at any time publications which, for any reason, he did not wish to retain further other than those in respect of which he had become liable and, on its part, the appellant might require the return of any of them at its option.\nKeeping the accounts in this manner, it is true, did not show the true nature of the transactions since the property in the goods did not pass to the retailer, nor was he liable for the amounts shown except to the extent that he had sold the goods or failed to return them within the agreed period, or otherwise exercised what Jessel M.R. in Wingfield's case referred to as his option to become the owner of them Keeping an inventory of the goods remaining in the dealers' hands from time to time which were the property of the appellant and charging the dealer only with the price of those in respect of which the property had passed to him and for which he had become liable would, no doubt, have been a more accurate way of recording the transactions. But as to this, the appellant contends that the cost of maintaining a staff sufficient to keep such a running inventory on its behalf would be prohibitive and impractical.\nWhile the learned trial, judge found as a fact that the deliveries made to the retailers were on sale or return, he concluded that they were thereafter treated by the parties as outright sales and that, accordingly, the amounts which would become payable by the dealers if the goods in their hands were all sold or retained should be treated as accounts payable.\nAt the hearing it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the publications in the hands of the dealers were delivered on consignment and the learned trial judge rejected this contention, properly in my opinion. There is a clear distinction to be made between goods held on consignment which a mercantile agent may sell on behalf of his principal qua agent, to which the provisions of the Factors Act apply, and deliveries made on sale or return, to which the Sale of Goods Act applies. In the latter case, the person in possession of the goods exercising his option to purchase them sells them qua principal.\nI am unable, with respect, to agree with the finding that in the present matter these transactions became outright sales. In coming to this conclusion, the learned trial judge emphasized the fact that in the case of the United Cigar Stores, the accounts of which concern with the appellant were paid monthly, they admittedly paid the amount shown by the appellant's accounts for publications delivered to its stores, less the amounts credited for publications returned during the month in question. When the transaction is examined, however, it does not .support the conclusion. The United Cigar Stores, operate a great many business, places in Toronto and the vicinity which are supplied by the appellant. As publications are delivered to the individual stores, accounts are delivered showing the amount payable up to the date of the delivery if all the publications then and theretofore delivered were sold or retained. The witness Parke, the secretary-treasurer of the company, said that weekly statements of the publications delivered to the various stores were sent to his office and that, at the end of the month, a further statement, which was a recapitulation of the accounts of all of the stores showing the amounts which would be payable upon the above basis and giving credit for returns made during the period, was sent. The amount so shown was paid by the company on the 20th of the following month and, no doubt, would include payment for some publications on hand at the end of the previous month for which the company was not liable on the sale or return basis. Since no running inventory was kept of the publications in the individual stores, either by the appellant or by United Cigar Stores, the exact amount payable at the time of the delivery of the monthly statement was not ascertainable. There was no business risk to the company, however, in paying on this basis since, in the interval between the end of the month and the 20th of the month following, large quantities of publications would be sold, in the company's stores for which it was liable to make payment.\nThe learned trial judge referred in particular to an account marked Exhibit B delivered by the appellant to United Cigar Store No. 31 on March. 15, 1952, which included a charge for goods delivered on the day previous which, he considered, indicated that the transactions were treated as sales and not as if the goods were held on consignment. This, however, overlooks the evidence as to the reason why these running accounts were delivered with the merchandise, and also the evidence of the witness Parke who described the manner in which the accounts of that company with the appellant were handled. Exhibit B was on a printed form which contained a statement that the \"last amount in this column is now due.\" But this was inaccurate and was disregarded not only by the United Cigar Stores but all other dealers in settling for goods for which they had become liable. It may also be pointed out that the real question was not whether the transactions were outright sales or sales of goods held on consignment, but rather as to whether they were outright sales or sales of goods held on sale or return.\nOther circumstances considered by the learned judge to be relevant in determining the true nature of the transaction were that no running inventory was kept by the appellant of the goods held by the dealers, that the accounts were carried as accounts receivable and treated as such in the annual balance sheet, and the further fact that the appellant carried no insurance on the goods in the hands of the retailers. The reason that such inventories were not kept by the appellant was explained. The manner in which the amounts which would have been payable by the dealers at the end of the fiscal year, had they then elected to purchase all of the goods in their possession or otherwise had become liable for them, were included in the accounts receivable, is as above stated. The fact that no insurance was carried by the appellant on these stocks is, in my opinion, altogether insufficient to justify a finding that the deliveries made on sale or return had been, by the conduct of the parties, transformed into something completely different.\nThe accuracy of the conclusion reached at the trial may be tested, in my opinion, by considering whether, in view of the uncontradicted evidence as to the nature of the agreements made by the appellant with the retailers, the appellant could have brought actions against them on January 31, 1945, to recover the balances shown in their respective accounts in its books before they had elected to exercise or reject their option to purchase the merchandise or to return it within the time limited. Such an action would inevitably fail, in my opinion.\nThe argument that the goods were delivered on consignment failed. From an income tax standpoint, I think the position of a person holding goods on sale or return who has not exercised his option to purchase or otherwise become liable to the owner would be the same as if they were held on consignment. In the case of the bankruptcy of the dealer, the property would not pass to the trustee in either case. (Ex parte Wingfield above, referred to: In Re Ford 7: Williams on Bankruptcy, 16th Ed. 316).\nWhile I think the manner in which the appellant conducted its business and carried its accounts and designated the amount estimated as that which would, in the ordinary course of business, be refunded to the dealers for goods returned out of the stocks in their hands as a reserve for loss on returns, really invited the assessment made by the Minister, this should not affect the proper determination of this matter. When the true nature of these transactions is determined, in my opinion, the claim of the appellant on this appeal is established.\nI would allow both appeals and refer the matter back to the Minister with a direction that, in computing the income of the appellant for its fiscal years ending January 31, 1945 and January 31, 1946, there shall be excluded from the total of the sales any amount in respect of periodicals, books or other publications theretofore delivered and in the hands of retail dealers on the said dates respectively, for the purchase price of which such dealers were not then liable to the appellant and, from the total of purchases, any amounts as the purchase price of such goods and the amounts set up in the accounts of the appellant for the said years as a reserve for loss on returns shall be deleted. I would allow the appellant its costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Mannie Brown.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A. A.

Armstrong, [1956] S.C.R. 446\nDate: 1956-03-28\nThe Minister of National Revenue Appellant;\nand\nJohn James Armstron Respondent.\n1956: February 1; 1956: March 28.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Kellock, Locke and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Income\u2014Alimony\u2014Maintenance of child\u2014Monthly payments ordered by decree\u2014Whether lump sum paid by arrangement between parties in full settlement deductible\u2014Income Tax Act, 1948, s. 11(1)(j).\nUnder a divorce decree, the respondent was ordered to pay to his wife $100 a month for the maintenance of their daughter. Subsequently, the wife accepted a lump sum of $4,000 in full settlement of all future payments. The Minister disallowed the deduction of this lump sum from the respondent's income. Both the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court held the amount to be deductible.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nSince the $4,000 was not an amount paid \"pursuant\" to the divorce decree but was paid by arrangement between the respondent and his wife, it was not deductible under s. 11(1)(j) of The Income Tax Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada,.Potter J. 1, affirming the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board.\nD. W. Mundell, Q.C. and J. D. C. Boland for the appellant.\nJ. W. Swackhamer for the respondent.\nThe judgment of. Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court have found that the sum of $4,000 was properly deductible by the respondent from his income tax for the taxation year 1950, within the provisions of section 11(1)(j) of The Income Tax Act. I am unable to agree as, in my opinion, the sum was not \"an amount paid by the taxpayer in the year pursuant to a decree, order or judgment of a competent tribunal in an action or proceeding for divorce or judicial separation or pursuant to a written separation agreement as alimony or other allowance payable on a periodic basis \u2026\". Nor if one refers to the French version was it \"un montant pay\u00e9 par le contribuable pendant l'ann\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un d\u00e9cret, ordonnance ou jugement rendu par un tribunal comp\u00e9tent dans une action ou instance en divorce ou en s\u00e9paration judiciaire, ou en conformit\u00e9 d'une convention \u00e9crite de s\u00e9paration, \u00e0 titre de pension alimentaire ou autre allocation payable p\u00e9riodiquement \u2026\". The test is whether it was paid in pursuance of a decree, order or judgment and not whether it was paid by reason of a legal obligation imposed or undertaken. There was no obligation on the part of the respondent to pay, under the decree, a lump sum in lieu of the monthly sums directed thereby to be paid.\nThe respondent urges that: there is an ambiguity in the section. In my view there is not, and in that connection it is useful to refer to the statement of Viscount Simonds in Kirkness v. John Hudson & Co. Ltd. 2:\nThat means that each one of us has the task of deciding what the relevant words mean. In coming to that decision he will necessarily give weight to the opinion of others, but if at the end of the day he forms his own clear judgment and does not think that the words are \"fairly and equally open to divers meanings\" he is not entitled to say that there is an ambiguity. For him at least there is no ambiguity and on that basis he must decide the case.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgments below set aside, with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court, and the assessment of the Minister, as amended by his notification of April 29, 1952, restored.\nKellock J.:\u2014In this case the sum of $4,000 was paid by the respondent \"in full settlement\" of all payments due or to become due under a decree nisi which obligated him to pay to his former wife the sum of $100 a month for maintenance of the infant child of the parties until the latter should attain the age of sixteen years. In consideration of this payment the respondent was released by the wife \"from any further liability\" under the said judgment.\nS. 11, s-s. (1)(j) of The Income Tax Act permits deduction in the computation of taxable income of\nan amount paid by the taxpayer \u2026 pursuant to a decree, order or judgment of a competent tribunal in an action or proceeding for divorce or judicial separation \u2026 as alimony or other allowance payable on a periodic basis for the maintenance of the recipient thereof children of the marriage In my opinion, the payment here in question is not within the statute. It was not an amount payable \"pursuant to\" or \"conform\u00e9ment \u00e0\" (to refer to the French text) the decree but rather an amount paid to obtain a release from the liability thereby imposed.\nIf, for example, the respondent had agreed with his wife that he should purchase for her a house in return for a release of all further liability under the decree; the purchase price could not, by any stretch of language, be brought within the section. The same principle must equally apply to a lump sum paid directly to the wife to purchase the release. Such an outlay made in commutation of the periodic sums payable under the decree is in the nature of a capital payment to which the statute does not extend.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal must be allowed and the judgment below set aside with costs throughout.\nLocke J.:\u2014By the decree nisi made on September 21, 1948 in the action for divorce brought by the appellant's wife Jean Isobel Armstrong, the latter was granted the sole custody and control of the child born of the marriage on October 12, 1939, and the appellant was ordered to pay to the plaintiff in the action the sum of $100 a month for the maintenance of the child until she should attain the age of sixteen years or \"until this court doth otherwise order.\" No order was made for the wife's maintenance.\nThe decree, by its terms, became absolute six months from its date, unless sufficient cause should be shown to the court to the contrary, and the marriage was dissolved at the expiration of that period.\nOn June 30, 1950, when the child born of the marriage was less than eleven years old, the appellant made an arrangement with his wife whereby, in consideration of a sum of $4,000, she purported to release him of any further liability under the judgment.\nThe question as to whether this purported release relieved the appellant of the obligation imposed by the decree to maintain the child, or which might thereafter be imposed upon him under the provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act (c. 226, R.S.O. 1950), was not argued before us and I mention the matter only to say that I express no opinion as to its legal effect as between the appellant and the child.\nThe appellant claims to be entitled to deduct the amount so paid from his income for the year 1950 under the terms of s. 11(1)(j) of The Income Tax Act, which permits the deduction of an amount paid by the taxpayer \"pursuant to a decree, order or judgment of a competent tribunal in an action or proceeding for divorce \u2026 payable on a periodic basis for the maintenance of \u2026 children of the marriage.\"\nThe liability of the appellant to make these monthly payments until the child attained the age of sixteen years was not absolute under the terms of the decree but remained subject to the further order of the court. Had the child died before attaining that age, no doubt, on his application, the court would have ordered the suspension of the payments. Equally, it may be said, in view of changed circumstances, the court might have increased or diminished the amount of the payments. The jurisdiction of the court under the Act to make orders respecting the custody, maintenance and education of children continues during the whole period of their infancy, that is, until they attain the age of twenty-one years (Thomasset v. Thomasset 3: Eversley on Domestic Relations, 6th Ed. p. 134).\nIt was for the purpose of obtaining what purported to be a release of the appellant's liability to maintain his infant child to the extent that it was imposed by the decree nisi that the $4,000 was paid. It cannot, in my opinion, be properly said that this lump sum was paid, in the words of the section, pursuant to the divorce decree. It was, it is true, paid in consequence of the liability imposed by the decree for the maintenance of the infant, but that does not fall within the terms of the section.\nIt is only payments made for the purposes and in the manner specified in s. 11(1) (j) which may be deducted in computing the income of the taxpayer. There was no means of determining on June 30, 1950, the amount which the appellant would be required to pay under the terms of the decree up to the date of the child's sixteenth birthday, for the reasons above stated. The amount might have been much less or much more than $4,000. The appellant was prepared to pay that amount to compound his liability, for the reasons explained by him in his evidence, and the mother was prepared to accept it. The amount was paid under the terms of the agreement made between the parties and not pursuant to the decree of the court.\nWith the greatest respect for the opinion of the late Mr. Justice Potter in this matter, I am unable to agree with his conclusion and would allow this appeal with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. A. McGrory.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\n1 [1954] Ex. C.R. 529.\n2 [1955] A.C.696 at .712.\n3 [1894] P. 295.\n",

Under legislation then in force, the City was exempt from taxation by the Township in respect of these lands, but in 1952, the exemption was removed by an amendment to the Assessment Act. Thereupon, the City applied to the Municipal Board for annexation of these lands under s. 20 of the Municipal Act. While the decision of the Board on this application was pending, the Metropolitan Corporation was created. The Corporation became vested with the water plant and liable to the payment of local taxes. The Municipal Board ordered the annexation and this order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. dissenting): That the appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted to the Board for further consideration. Per Rand, Kellock and Cartwright JJ.: The Municipal Board failed to deal with the circumstances and conditions existing at the time of its adjudication as it disregarded completely the new situation which was created when both the municipal function of water supply and the physical assets were transferred to the Metropolitan Corporation. This was a serious error in law.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. (dissenting): It cannot be said that the Board proceeded on a wrong principle of law. There is no warrant for the assumption that the Board did not consider and deal with the application on the footing that it should be determined upon the facts as they existed at the time of the making of the order.\nThe power of the Board given by s. 20 of the Municipal Act and preserved by s. 214(2) of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, is not affected by ss. 117(1), 221(1) and 225(1) of the latter Act or by any of the provisions of the Public Utilities Act or the Power Commission Act. These provisions have not the effect of unalterably fixing the boundaries of the Township of Scarborough as of January 1, 1954.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming an order for annexation made by the Ontario Municipal Board.\nH.E. Manning, Q.C. for the appellant.\nF.A.A. Campbell, Q.C. and W.R. Callow for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The Corporation of the Township of Scarborough applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing its appeal from the Ontario Municipal Board and the following order was thereupon made:\u2014\nAssuming the appellant requires leave to bring to this Court for consideration the order of the Court of Appeal, the Court is unanimously of opinion that leave should be and it is hereby granted. The costs will be in the cause.\nMr. Manning\u2019s main argument was that the Board had proceeded upon a wrong principle of law,\u2014referring especially to the following words in the Board\u2019s reasons for allowing the application to it by the Corporation of the City of Toronto for the annexation to the City of certain lands in the Township:\u2014\nWhere, as in the present case, all the lands in question are owned and used for public purposes by the applicant municipality and the property is located immediately adjacent to one of its boundaries, annexation should not be refused unless there are exceptional circumstances. He pointed out that by virtue of the combined operation of s. 37 of The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953, and a by-law of The Metropolitan Council the lands in question are vested in the Metropolitan Corporation. This, of course, was well-known to the Board, as appears from a reading of all of its reasons. In my opinion, the extract quoted, and all others mentioned by Mr. Manning, when read in their context, and in view of all else that was said, means that the Board was taking into consideration the fact that before The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953, came into force the lands had been owned by the City. It is also clear to me from a reading of the entire reasons that the Board was considering the circumstances as they existed at the time it gave its decision and not as of the time when the application by the City was first made.\nThis being so, I am unable to give effect to any of Mr. Manning\u2019s other arguments dealing with ss. 117 (1), 221 (1) and 225 (1) of The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953, or with any of the provisions of The Public Utilities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 320, or of The Power Commission Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 281. None of these provisions affects the proper construction of s-s. (2) of s. 214 of The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953:\u2014\n214. (2) Nothing in this Act alters or affects the powers of the Municipal Board under, and the application of, section 20 of The Municipal Act.\nSection 20 of The Municipal Act referred to, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, empowers the Board by order, on such terms as it may deem expedient, to\n(c) annex the whole or any part or parts of any other municipality or municipalities to the municipality.\nThis power of the Board, preserved by s-s. (2) of s. 214 of The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953, is not restricted by s-s. (1) of s. 221:\u2014\n221. (1) Except as provided in this Act, the Municipal Board, upon the application of any area municipality, The Corporation of the County of York of the Metropolitan Corporation, may exercise any of the powers conferred on it by clauses (a) and (d) of subsection 9 of section 20 of The Municipal Act.\nInstead of restricting the powers of the Board, this enactment widens and extends them. Sections 117 (1) and 225 (1) of The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953, read as follows:\u2014\n117. (1) On and after the 1st day of January, 1954,\n(a) the present high school district in the Township of Scarborough is enlarged to include the whole of the Township of Scarborough;\n(b) the continuation school district of School Section No. 14 of the Township of Scarborough is dissolved;\n(c) the whole of the Township of Scarborough is created a township. school area;\n(d) Union School Section No. 9 and 17 of the Townships of Markham and Scarborough and Union School Section No. 11 and 4 of the Townships of Scarborough and Pickering are dissolved, subject to the adjustment by arbitration of all rights and claims pursuant to section 32 of The Public Schools Act.\n* * *\n225. (1) Notwithstanding anything in The Power Commission Act or in The Public Utilities Act or in any other special or general Act, the whole of the Township of Scarborough, the whole of the Township of North York and the whole of the Township of Etobicoke shall each be deemed to be an area established under subsection 1 of section 66 of The Power Commission Act, and The Public Utilities Commission of the Township of Scarborough, The Hydro-Electric Commission of the Township of North York and The Hydro-Electric Commission of the Township of Etobicoke shall each be deemed to have been established for the whole of the said respective areas and the members duly elected.\nBy s. 227 it is provided that s. 225 comes into force on January 1, 1954.\nIn view of the express terms of s-s. (2) of s. 214, the argument cannot prevail that these have the effect of unalterably fixing the boundaries of the Township as of January 1, 1954. The provisions of s-s. (2) of s. 214 must be given their plain and ordinary meaning and effect.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRAND J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal will be more clearly appreciated if a brief statement of the facts be given.\nIn 1927 the City of Toronto expropriated a parcel of land approximately 19 acres in extent lying in the southwest corner of the Municipality of Scarborough, including certain water lots running into Lake Ontario. At this point the westerly boundary of Scarborough coincides with the easterly boundary of the City. By reason of statutory provisions, the land as owned by the City was exempt from taxation by the Municipality. Later a large waterworks plant was built at a substantial cost to furnish the City with a water supply, and the plant was likewise tax exempt.\nIn April, 1952, legislation was passed which removed the exemption. Thereupon under s. 20 of The Municipal Act an application was made on August 7 to the Municipal Board for an order annexing the land to the City. Two other applications were at that time pending before the Board, one by the City and the other by the Town of Mimico, each looking to an amalgamation of a number of adjacent municipalities into a larger unit. S. 20(1) reads:\n20. (1) Upon the application of any municipality authorized by by-law of the council thereof, or upon the application of the Minister of Municipal Affairs authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, or in respect of clause d upon the application of at least 25 male inhabitants, being British subjects of the full age of 21 years, the Municipal Board may by order on such terms as it may deem expedient,\n(a) amalgamate the municipality with any other municipality or municipalities;\n(b) annex the whole or any part or parts of the municipality to any other municipality or municipalities;\n(c) annex the whole or any part or parts of any other municipality or municipalities to the municipality; or\n(d) annex the whole or any part or parts of any unorganized township or townships to the municipality.\nand any such order may amalgamate or annex a greater or smaller area or areas than the area or areas specified in the application, whether or not the municipality, municipalities, unorganized township or unorganized townships in which the area or areas is or are located is or are specified in the application.\nOn the application here in question, a hearing was held on October 20 before two members of the Board, but in June, 1953 it was intimated that they were unable to agree and that there would be a rehearing.\nIn the meantime the prior applications of the City and of Mimico had on January 20, 1953 been dismissed. This was followed on February 25 by the introduction into the legislature of a bill for the creation of a comprehensive metropolitan district which became law on April 2 as The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953. By this enactment a metropolitan municipal corporation was set up in which, among other things, were vested certain municipal utilities including their assets, powers and duties. Among them was that of the water supply for the metropolitan area; and as of January 1, 1954, the water plant in question became the property of the Corporation. No compensation was payable to the City, but the Corporation assumed liability for all outstanding obligations related to the property.\nAs a further result, from and after that date the Corporation, as owner of all waterworks within the metropolitan area and charged, with the duty of administering that municipal service, became liable to pay to the Municipality within which each such plant or property was situated sums of money equivalent to local taxes appropriate to it. This meant that those moneys referable to the land and works in Scarborough would, in the then existing situation, be payable by the Corporation to that municipality.\nA rehearing of the application of August 7, 1952 took place on September 4, 1953. Judgment was reserved until June 22, 1954 when the Board handed down its decision by which it ordered the area of the land and works to be annexed to the City. That the Board, as of that date, had jurisdiction, on proper grounds, to make such an order under s. 20 does not admit of any doubt. But Mr. Manning\u2019s contention is that in coming to its conclusion the Board considered the matter from an improper point of view and disregarded material circumstances which were highly pertinent.\nThe reasons of the Board were set out in detail and from them it appears that, for the purpose of adjudication, it founded itself on the situation existing on August 7, 1952. That this is so is seen from the following excerpt of the language used:\nWhere, as in the present case, all the lands in question are owned and used for public purposes by the applicant municipality and the property is located immediately adjacent to one of its boundaries, annexation should not be refused unless there are exceptional circumstances.\nOther passages in the reasons confirm this interpretation. It is said:\nUnder such circumstances the Board is quite satisfied that, had the present application been made at any time prior to the enactment of the 1952 legislation previously referred to, annexation would have been ordered almost as a matter of course and it is unlikely that the township would have raised any objection. The legislation of 1952 was that which restored in effect the liability of the property to taxation. Then the following:\nIn the opinion of the Board, quite apart from any question of liability for annual payments in lieu of taxation, any municipality which has acquired or built a valuable municipally\u2011owned asset outside its boundaries pursuant to special or general legislation has a prima facie right to expect a favourable reception of a subsequent annexation application for the purpose of bringing the property in question within its own boundaries if there is no physical obstacle to such a change.\nI am unable to agree that these clear and precise indications of the perspective in which the Board examined the matter are qualified by the general statement that\nin the opinion of the Board, the reasonable and natural desire of any municipality to adjust its boundaries so as to include not only the homes of its workers and the commercial and industrial areas where they obtain employment, but also the schools, public buildings, public works and parks which the municipality has supplied to serve them, should be given effect to by suitable boundary adjustments wherever reasonably possible, notwithstanding the incidental transfer of the benefits arising from the new and somewhat unexpected revenues made available by the legislation referred to.\nThe reference to legislation seems obviously to be to that in effect restoring taxability, and the passage clinches the meaning of what has been previously quoted.\nThe Board thus disregarded completely the new situation of January 1, 1954 in which both the municipal function of water supply and the physical plant and other assets associated with it had become transferred to a new municipal body, the Corporation. That these factors might very easily have led the Board to a different decision on the application is indisputable. The significance of the circumstance that the funds required for the purchase of land and the construction of plant had been furnished by a municipality was discussed by the Board in its reasons accompanying the dismissal in January, 1953 of the earlier applications made by the City and Mimico, and its possible effect upon a decision of the Board given in the light of the new situation is put beyond controversy in the following passage:\nTurning to the larger question of a general adjustment of assets and liabilities with respect to the assets to be taken over by the Metropolitan Council in the foregoing proposals, it is the considered opinion of the board, as previously stated in the specific proposals, that these assets should be taken over and operated for the benefit of the entire area without adjustment except for the assumption of outstanding indebtedness. In the board\u2019s opinion, the true nature of these assets is often misunderstood. Although they have been built and financed by the various individual municipalities and their local boards, they are not in a legal sense the property of the residents or ratepayers for the time being resident within the municipality where the assets are located. They are, in every sense of the word, public property and are held in trust for the use and benefit of the present and future residents of the area within the jurisdiction of the local authority. But that area has no fixed and predetermined limits and it may be indefinitely enlarged or included with other areas for the purposes of local government at the will of the legislature. The municipal government is, after all, a government and not a commercial corporation which can wind up its affairs, sell its assets and distribute the proceeds among its shareholders. For this reason it seems to the board that so long as the residents of the particular area are not deprived of the beneficial use of the assets built or maintained for them by their local government, the management and operation of the asset by a new type of local government which will be, in effect, a new trustee, deprives them of no rights whatever, and entitles them to no individual or collective compensation.\nThat the Board as an administrative body, in such a case as the present, must deal with the circumstances and conditions as, at the time of its adjudication, they may be, is axiomatic: there is no question of determining rights as of the time of commencement of proceedings: there are no rights or obligations except those arising from the order made. The analogy of the enforcement of common law rights is wholly inappropriate.\nWhat faced the Board after January 1, 1954 was then extremely simple. The City had ceased to be the owner of the property in Scarborough; it was no longer concerned with liability for the obligations of the water system; the complete control of the water supply throughout the metropolitan area had become the duty of the Corporation to be exercised and operated in such a manner whether as an entirety or in local units as the Corporation might decide. The property lay within the area of Scarborough; as between the City and Scarborough, the only substantial interest involved was the benefit of the tax equivalent payments for which the Corporation had become liable: would they be paid to Scarborough or to the City? This benefit the latter sought through an extension of its boundaries. In these circumstances, to make what was in substance an adjudication nunc pro tunc and to disregard the radical change of conditions that had since the prior time been brought about was a serious error in law; and the error was accentuated by drawing from those previous but then non-existent circumstances a presumption, conceivably appropriate in past or other circumstances, to which the subsequent and transformed situation could furnish no answer. But it was on such a basis that the Board acted.\nAs Mr. Manning succeeds on this ground, it is neither necessary nor desirable to consider any of the other points raised by him.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remit the matter to the Board for further consideration. In accordance with s. 98(3) of the Ontario Municipal Board Act, the judgment will certify the opinion of the Court to be that in acting in the light only of the situation as it existed on August 7, 1952 the Board erred in law: and that on the reconsideration of the application it should take into account circumstances and conditions then existing as well as any other circumstances, pertinent to the issue raised. The appellant is entitled to its costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal pursuant to leave granted by this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the present appellant\u2019s appeal from an order of the Ontario Municipal Board dated June 22, 1954. The appeal from that order to the Court of Appeal was taken pursuant to leave granted under the provisions of S. 98 of the Ontario Municipal Board Act (c. 262 R.S.O. 1950).\nThe appeal to the Court of Appeal permitted by that section is limited to questions of law including that of jurisdiction and s-s. 3 provides that that Court may draw all such inferences as are not inconsistent with the facts, expressly found by the Board and are necessary in determining the question of jurisdiction or law, as the case may be.\nThe facts necessary to be considered in determining this appeal are stated in the decision of the Board and in the reasons for the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario.\nThe application for the order annexing the property in question to the City of Toronto was authorized by a by-law-passed by the City Council on June 24, 1952, and the first hearing of the application which was concluded on October 20, 1952 proved abortive, owing to the failure of the two members of the Board, by whom the matter was heard, to agree. That application was renewed on September 4, 1953 and judgment was reserved and it was during the time that the matter was under consideration by the Chairman and the two other members by whom it had been heard that the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act (c. 73, S.O. 1953) came into force.\nThe main objection by the appellant to the order made is that the Board allegedly erred in law in determining that the application should be disposed of by considering matters as they stood as of the date the application was first heard, rather than as of the date the order was made and without regard to the changes authorized and brought about under the 1953 legislation.\nThe only support that I am able to find in this record for that contention is a passage from the reasons for judgment delivered by the Board which reads:\u2014\nWhere, as in the present case, all the lands in question are owned and used for public purposes by the applicant municipality and the property is located immediately adjacent to one of its boundaries, annexation should not be refused unless there are exceptional circumstances.\nStanding by itself, this might appear to indicate that the Board had completely overlooked the fact that theretofore, by the steps authorized by the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, the title of the property in question had vested in the Metropolitan Corporation thereby constituted.\nThe passage quoted appeared, however, as the concluding sentence of a paragraph dealing solely with an argument advanced on behalf of the Township that the amendment made in 1952 (c. 3) to the Assessment Act (c. 24, R.S.O. 1950), which in effect removed the exemption theretofore enjoyed by municipalities in respect to public utility properties owned by them and not located within their own boundaries, should by implication be construed as having prohibited subsequent annexations of such properties. As to this, the Board, rejecting the argument, said in part:\u2014\nOn the contrary, it seems to the Board that nothing in the 1952 legislation can be found which restricts the discretionary power of the Board to order an annexation whenever it appears to the Board that the objectives of the applicant municipality and its reasons for seeking an adjudgment of its boundaries are sound and are supported by the evidence adduced.\nThe passage first quoted referred only to the contention that, from the date the amendment of 1952 became effective, there could be no annexation by a municipality of property of the nature referred to in the amendment under s. 20 (now s. 14(2)) of the Municipal Act (c. 243, R.S.O. 1950). As of that date the respondent had owned the property in question and the Board was speaking of its rights at that time and thereafter which, in its opinion, had not been affected by that legislation. While it would have been conducive to clarity if the Board had said simply that the power to order such an annexation was unaffected by the 1952 amendment to the Assessment Act, that this is what was intended appears to me to be made clear by what followed when the effect of the 1953 legislation was considered independently.\nTo treat that portion of the reasons as relating to the situation created by the subsequent legislation would be to assume that the members of the Municipal Board had ignored the fact that the effect of steps taken authorized by that legislation had been to vest title to the water works property in the Metropolitan Board. I see no warrant for any such assumption. That the Board considered and dealt with the application on the footing that it should be determined upon the facts as they existed as at the time of the making of the order appears to me to be clear from the following passage in their reasons, which includes and supplements that portion quoted by the learned Chief Justice in his judgment and which should, I think, be read together with it:\u2014\nIt is clear, therefore, that the real basis of the township\u2019s objection to the present application is the loss of the very substantial annual revenues which it hopes to receive at the expense of either the city or the Metropolitan Corporation as a result of the 1952 legislation if the present application is dismissed and the property remains within the township. It was argued that the Board, as an administrative tribunal, would be justified in considering the relative impact of the loss of this annual revenue upon the economy of the township as compared with that of the city. It was pointed out that the amount, although large, was only a fraction of one percent of the total tax revenue of the city while it amounted to about four percent of that of the township. Although this argument is persuasive, the Board, after full consideration, prefers to base its decision upon principles which are capable of general application in similar cases. In the opinion of the Board, the reasonable and natural desire of any municipality to adjust its boundaries so as to include not only the homes of its workers and the commercial and industrial areas where they obtain employment, but also the schools, public buildings, public works and parks which the municipality has supplied to serve them, should be given effect to by suitable boundary adjustments wherever reasonably possible, notwithstanding the incidental transfer of the benefits arising from the new and somewhat unexpected revenues made available by the legislation referred to. For the above reasons the application will be granted and an order will be issued providing for the annexation to the City of Toronto of the lands in the Township of Scarborough occupied by the R.C. Harris Water Purification and Pumping Plant, more particularly described in By-law 18664 of the city and in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to this order.\nIt was further urged that the powers of the Board under s. 20 of the Municipal Act, expressly reserved to it by s. 214(2) of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, might not be invoked to alter the boundaries of the appellant as they existed as of the date that Act came into force. This is based upon the fact that by s. 117(a) and (c) of the Act it is provided that, on and after the 1st day of January 1954, the present high school district in the Township of Scarborough is enlarged to include the whole of the township and the whole of the township is created a township school area, and further, that by s. 225(1) it is provided, inter alia, that the whole of the township shall be deemed an area established under s-s. 1 of s. 66 of the Power Commission Act. From this, it is argued that the Legislature has thus indicated that the boundaries of the township as of the date mentioned were to remain fixed as they then were. It is quite impossible to reconcile this argument with the express provisions of s. 214(2). Construed, as it must be, as a whole, the powers of the Board extend in this respect, in my opinion, to the respondent township in the same manner as they do to the other municipalities referred to in, and affected by, the legislation.\nThe contention that in some manner s. 214(2) is restricted by the terms of s-s. 1 of s. 221 should also, in my opinion, be rejected. The latter subsection appears to me to be intended to extend the powers of the Board under s. 20 of the Municipal Act rather than to restrict them.\nIn my opinion, the jurisdiction of the Board to make the order is undoubted and I respectfully agree with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that it has not been shown that there has been any error in law on its part in dealing with the matter. This being so, the question as to whether the powers given to it by s. 20 of the Municipal Act and by the Ontario Municipal Board Act (c. 262, R.S.O. 1950) should be exercised in the circumstances as they existed in June of 1954 was one for the Board and for the Board alone.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Manning, Mortimer & Mundell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.G. Angus.\n[1] [1955] O.R. 281.\n",

A large brick house, a barn and a garage had been erected thereon in 1910. The appellant, an experienced gardener, had used the property for raising produce and fruit, and had cleared up and improved it as well as the buildings. Much of the evidence on behalf of the appellant was directed to showing the replacement value of the house and the value of the fruit trees and other improvements on the property rather than estimating the value of the property as a whole. The trial judge found that the fair value of the property to the appellant was $18,250, to which he added ten per cent for compulsory taking and $2,500 for disturbance.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): That the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Locke and Abbott JJ.: The trial judge properly applied the principle stated and applied in Woods Manufacturing Co. v. The King [1951] S.C.R. 504. No material fact was overlooked or misapprehended by him and no ground has been shown for any interference with his judgment.\nPer Rand and Cartwright J.J. (dissenting): Applying the rule stated in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King [1949] S.C.R. 712 and referred to in Woods Manufacturing Co. v. The King (supra) and which the trial judge does not appear to have followed, it is impossible to say that a prudent man in the position of the appellant would not have paid a sum substantially larger than that fixed by the trial judge rather than be ejected from his property.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Archibald J., in an expropriation action.\nS. Ryan Q.C. for the appellant.\nK. E. Eaton and P. M. Troop for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment delivered in the Exchequer Court determining the amount of the compensation to be paid to the appellant for certain lands expropriated for the use of the Crown on February 7, 1952.\nThe lands taken were 14.5 acres in extent situate within the limits of the Town of Cobourg. The appellant had acquired the property by bequest in the year 1942. In the year 1910 there had been erected on it a large brick house, a barn and a garage by the then owner, a medical doctor.\nThe appellant is an experienced market gardener and decided to use the property for raising produce and fruit. Between the years 1942 and 1948 he cleared up the property, removing a considerable number of fruit trees which were no longer of value and planting others and preparing the land for the raising of small fruit and garden produce. In addition, he spent some $1,700 for improvements on the house, $600 on the barn and $750 on the garage. He took his first crop off the property in 1948 and, between that time and the date of the expropriation, he actively carried on the business of a market gardener. Of the crops produced, a comparatively small portion was sold by him in Cobourg, much the greater part being sold on the market at Peterborough, some 38 miles distant. The result of these operations for the year 1951, which the appellant described as a good year, was a profit of slightly less than $500 after deducting operating expenses, including an allowance for the time he estimated he had spent in the operations during the year at $1 an hour, and that of his wife who assisted in the work calculated at the same rate.\nIt was shown that, when the will of the testator by whom the land was bequeathed to the appellant was probated, the property, which had been valued by the executors at $2,400 for purposes of succession duty, was valued at $4,000 by the succession duty authorities. Lands in the neighbourhood had, however, substantially increased in value since the year 1942, in common with other agricultural lands in the province. Under the provisions of s. 33 of the Assessment Act (c. 24, R.S.O. 1950) lands are required, subject to its provisions, to be assessed at their actual value and, in assessing lands having buildings thereon, the value of the buildings shall be the amount by which the value of the land is increased by them. As of the date of the expropriation, this property was assessed by the Town of Cobourg at $3,320, being $800 for the land and the balance for the buildings. The evidence showed, however, that the assessed values in the town had not kept pace with the increase in the value of lands and, while the figures above stated afford some evidence as to values several years ago, it is quite clear that they are very much below the value of this land to the appellant as of the date of the expropriation.\nEvidence of experienced land valuators was given both on behalf of the appellant and of the Crown. Much of the evidence tendered on behalf of the appellant unfortunately was directed to showing the replacement value of the house which, while no doubt suitable at the time of construction for the use of a medical doctor, was much larger than was required upon the property when used as a market garden, and the value of the fruit trees and other improvements on the property rather than estimating the value of the property as a whole. Two of the witnesses called by the appellant expressed their opinion as to the amount which might have been obtained for the property on the market as of the date of the expropriation. The witness Lister, an experienced land valuator, was of the opinion that $25,000 could have been obtained, and the witness Parnell $27,000. The witness J. R. Cooper, called by the Crown and who is a real estate broker in Cobourg, considered that, prior to the announcement of the establishment of the Ordnance Depot for which the property was taken by the Crown, the property could have been sold for $12,000 on the market and, after the announcement had been made, for $15,000. The witness W. H. Bosley, a valuator of very long experience, was of the opinion that between $15,000 and $16,000 could have been obtained on the market. Market value is a factor to be considered in determining the value of the land to the owner, though it is not, of course, decisive.\nThe trial judge, the late Mr. Justice Archibald, in a carefully considered judgment, found that the fair value of the property to the owner as of the date of the expropriation was $18,250, to which he added ten per cent for compulsory taking and an allowance for disturbance of $2,500, making the total compensation $22,575. The learned judge, in arriving at his conclusion, properly applied, in my opinion, the principle stated and applied in the judgment of this Court in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King 1. I have examined the evidence with care and I do not find that the learned judge has either overlooked or misapprehended any material fact and I think no ground has been shown for any interference with his judgment (V\u00e9zina v. The Queen 2; The King v. Elgin Realty Company 3).\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe dissenting judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the late Mr. Justice Archibald pronounced on the 21st of May, 1953, fixing the compensation to which the appellant is entitled for his lands at $22,575 together with interest from May 1, 1953. the date on which he gave up possession. The lands were expropriated on the 7th of February, 1952 and it is as of that date that the compensation was fixed.\nThe facts, as found by the learned trial judge or established by uncontradicted evidence, may be summarized as follows. The land expropriated is on the east side of D'Arcy street in the town of Cobourg approximately one half mile north of the main public highway from Cobourg to Toronto, and comprises 14.5 acres on which are located a large house, a barn and a garage. The appellant is a native of Switzerland. At the date of the trial, in March 1953, he was 44 years old. He is married and has two children. Before coming to Canada he had been engaged in market gardening and, after coming to this country, spent some time farming in western Canada, In 1935 he came to Cobourg and resided at the expropriated property, then owned by Miss Jones who devised it to him in 1942. He served with the Armed Forces of Canada from 1943 to 1946. On his discharge from the army he returned to Cobourg and engaged in the business of a market gardener on the property. At that time there were on the property a large number of fruit trees of which all but 60 had outlived their usefulness. With the exception of these 60 trees he cut down all the fruit trees and cleared up the land, taking out the roots and prepared the land for cultivation of a variety of vegetables, berries, small fruits and other crops. He also planted a number of young fruit trees.\nAt the date of expropriation the appellant had repaired the barn and garage, making them suitable for his business as a market gardener and had improved the condition of the soil. The witnesses are unanimous in saying that the appellant is a good market gardener and in the short time he was on the property, he had brought it to a high state of cultivation. The land is particularly well suited for market gardening purposes. It is level, the soil is rich and easily worked and is free from weeds and pests and is not subject to erosion. Prior to the date of expropriation, the highest and best use to which the property could be put was that of a market garden. The appellant is an industrious and capable man and worked the land carefully and to excellent advantage.\nThe house on the expropriated property is large, of solid brick construction, with ten rooms, high quality trim, well maintained and in good repair, but the learned trial judge was of opinion that \"it is not at all suitable for a man operating a small market gardening business.\" The house was built in 1910. At the date of the trial it still had a remaining useful life of about 60 years. Its reconstruction cost was estimated at about $27,000.\nIt is clear from all the evidence that the appellant planned to continue to reside on the property and work it as a market garden and that it was yielding him and his family a modest but comfortable living.\nIt appears from his reasons for judgment that the learned trial judge, after careful consideration of the evidence of all the witnesses, arrived at the opinion that the market value of the land and buildings at the date of expropriation was $18,250. To this he added an allowance of 10% for compulsory taking, $1,825, and an allowance of $2,500 for disturbance.\nWhile the learned trial judge referred to the recent decisions of this Court dealing with the principles applicable to a case of this sort it does not appear to me that he has followed the rule stated by Rand J. in Diggon-Hibben Limited v. The King 4, as to which Rinfret C.J. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court in Woods Manufacturing Company Limited v. The King 5, said at page 508:\u2014\nThe proper manner of the application of the principle so clearly stated cannot, in our opinion, be more accurately stated than in the judgment of Rand J. in the last-mentioned case at p. 715:\n\"\u2026 the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\"\nIn applying the principle so stated to the facts of the present case it must be borne in mind that the appellant was anxious to Continue to make a living for himself and his family as a market gardener, the occupation that he had followed for some years and in which he was highly skilled, and that he wished to continue to live in the vicinity of Cobourg. It cannot be said that these desires were not those of a prudent man. The test to be applied then is, what would the appellant in these circumstances reasonably pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\nIt seems to me that the answer to this question is that he would pay such amount as he would have to pay to obtain a comparable property in the same locality and in addition thereto such amount as would cover the loss which he would inevitably suffer during the period necessary to bring the new property into a state of productivity equal to that of the old.\nBetween the date of the expropriation and the date of the trial the appellant purchased the Johnson property on Ontario Street at the price of $25,000. On the uncontradicted evidence he did this after a search which took up some months during which he was not able to find any other suitable property in the locality. The evidence establishes that the new property is not as suitable for the appellant's purposes as was his former property. The house is older and smaller and had, at one time, settled and sagged badly although the effects of this had, at some unstated time prior to the purchase, been remedied by inserting a steel beam and some additional posts. The house on the new property has six rooms, two bathrooms and an air-conditioning unit. The barn and garage are not so convenient for the appellant's purposes as were those on the old property. The only advantage, for the purposes of the appellant, which the new property was suggested to have over the old is that the roadway on Ontario Street is better surfaced than the one on D'Arcy Street. The area of the new property is 11 acres, 2 of which are not suitable for planting.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the appellant could have obtained a suitable property in the vicinity of Cobourg for less money and all the witnesses who were asked about the matter made it clear that in their opinion the old property was more suitable for the appellant's purposes than the new. On the uncontradicted evidence it would require a period of 3 years to bring the new property into a state of productivity comparable to that of the old.\nWith these circumstances in mind it is, I think, impossible to say that a prudent man in the position of the appellant would not have paid a sum substantially larger than that fixed by the learned trial judge rather than be ejected from his old property.\nIn my view the learned trial judge erred in the following respects: (i) in accepting and acting upon the evidence that the house on the old land was \"a misfit\"; this would have been right enough if all that had to be considered was the market value in the sense of what the appellant could hope to realize if he offered the property for sale; but I do not think it can properly be said that the house was a misfit for the purposes of the appellant who wished to continue to live on the property with his family; (ii) in directing his mind mainly, if not exclusively, to ascertaining the market value of the property and failing to apply the principle stated in the passage quoted above from the Woods Manufacturing Company case; (iii) in failing to appreciate the extent of the loss by disturbance; in this connection it should be mentioned that his reasons would indicate that the learned trial judge was under some misunderstanding when he says \"counsel for the defendant estimates the loss in dollars suffered by the defendant due to disturbance at $1,920;\" it is conceded that no such estimate was made by counsel in the course of the trial or in argument.\nThat the figure reached by the learned trial judge is inadequate seems to me to be demonstrated by the following considerations. As a result of the expropriation the appellant has been forced to move from a property in excellent condition to another smaller in size and less suitable for a market garden for which he has had to pay $25,000. There is no evidence that he has acted imprudently or without adequate search in acquiring the new property or that he could have made any better bargain. It will require three years to bring the new property into a state of productivity comparable to that of the old; and yet the total award to the appellant is $2,425 less than the bare purchase price of the new property. Such a result cannot in my opinion be reconciled with the evidence of Rand J. in Diggon-Hibben Limited v. The King (supra) at page 715:\u2014\nA compensation statute should not be approached with the attitude that Parliament intended an individual to be victimized in loss because of the accident that his land rather than his neighbour's should be required for public purposes; \u2026\nAfter a careful consideration of all the evidence it is my view that the appeal should be allowed and for the amount awarded by the learned trial judge there should be substituted the sum of $30,000 with interest from the first of May, 1953. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Stuart Ryan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. P.

Quoi qu'il en soit, le 8 avril 1949, un acte de vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9, c\u00e9dant \u00e0 Racine l'immeuble en question, pour le prix de $6,027.56, dont $4,500 comptant, soit le montant de la dette due par Boulianne \u00e0 Equipement Moderne Lt\u00e9e, et la balance devant \u00eatre pay\u00e9e \u00e0 un cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire.\nIl appert que le m\u00eame jour, un transfert de ch\u00e8ques eut lieu dans le bureau de Mtre Simard, avocat. Un ch\u00e8que au montant de $4,500 sign\u00e9 par Paul Racine, \u00e0 l'ordre de l'intim\u00e9e, fut endoss\u00e9 par elle, non encaiss\u00e9, et fut remis \u00e0 Paul Racine. Mtre Simard \u00e9mit lui-m\u00eame un ch\u00e8que de $4,500, toujours \u00e0 l'ordre de Paul Racine, que ce dernier a endoss\u00e9 mais n'a pas encaiss\u00e9 et a remis \u00e0 Mtre Simard. Toujours le m\u00eame jour, soit le 8 avril 1949, l'appelant Racine, suppos\u00e9 acqu\u00e9reur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e, s'engagea par \u00e9crit \u00e0 donner \u00e0 Boulianne la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de racheter l'immeuble, qui cependant \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de son \u00e9pouse. Il fut stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte que si l'appelant vendait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un prix plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que $6,000, l'exc\u00e9dent dans le prix de la vente sera vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie Northern Electric de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 l'acquit de la compagnie Henri Boulianne Lt\u00e9e, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Henri Boulianne personnellement.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le hors de tout doute que l'intim\u00e9e n'a su que le 8 avril 1949 que son mari \u00e9tait endett\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis Equipement Moderne Lt\u00e9e, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 compris par elle et convenu qu'il ne s'agissait que d'une garantie qui devait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant, que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 serait r\u00e9troc\u00e9d\u00e9e quand Boulianne aurait pay\u00e9 sa dette tel que promis, et que le transport de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne constituait nullement un paiement de la dette de Boulianne \u00e0 Equipement Moderne Lt\u00e9e.\nIl est certain qu'une femme peut l\u00e9galement payer la dette de son mari, mais l'article 1301 C.C. lui d\u00e9fend de s'obliger pour ou avec lui. (Vide Larocque v. Equitable Life Assurance 2; Kelly v. C.P.R. 3).\nIl est aussi \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire qu'il ne faut pas seulement examiner la forme des actes qu'on a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 une transaction, mais qu'il est permis d'examiner la v\u00e9ritable nature du contrat intervenu. L'article 1301 C.C. comporte une nullit\u00e9 d'ordre public, que rien ne peut couvrir, et quand la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le une dissimulation ou une obligation autre que celle qui appara\u00eet \u00e0 l'acte, et qu'il s'agit d'une violation de l'article 1301, celui-ci trouve son application dans toute sa rigueur.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, il n'y a pas eu de paiement au sens de la loi. Si v\u00e9ritablement l'on avait entendu faire un paiement, il \u00e9tait facile de consentir purement et simplement une dation de l'immeuble. Mais, ce n'est pas ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, et la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e n'a que garanti avec espoir de retour de l'immeuble, la dette de son mari. Ceci constitue une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 et la loi frappe un acte semblable d\u00e9 nullit\u00e9 absolue. C'est donc avec raison que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc de la Reine ont maintenu l'action de la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e qui a voulu faire prononcer la nullit\u00e9 des contrats, et qui a demand\u00e9 la revendication de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas le droit de c\u00e9der ainsi en garantie.\nJe ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire dans le pr\u00e9sent jugement de d\u00e9terminer les droits de l'appelant de r\u00e9clamer de l'intim\u00e9e ou de son \u00e9poux les paiements qu'il aurait pu faire au cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Kellock J.:\u2014This case involves a pure question of fact. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal held that the transaction, while in the form of a sale from the respondent to the appellant, was, in fact, a transaction of guarantee under which the respondent conveyed the property to the appellant as security for her husband's debt, to be re-conveyed upon payment of that debt, which it was expected would be within two or three months. What was thus attempted to be done was prohibited by the terms of 1301 C.C. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : Ivan Sabourin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Jean Paul Gravel.\n1 Q.R.

McCrindle, [1956] S.C.R. 473\nDate: 1956-03-28\nCanadian Pacific Railway Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nVera McCrindle (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1956: February 15, 16; 1956: March 28.\nPresent: Taschereau, Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FORM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNegligence\u2014Whether licensee or trespasser\u2014Seaman lost way while returning to ship in dense fog.\nThe respondent's husband, a seaman returning after shore leave to his ship moored at the appellant's pier, lost his way in the dense fog in the area and drove in the wrong direction off the end of a pier and was drowned. The jury found for the respondent and that the deceased had been guilty of contributory negligence. The Court of Appeal, considering the deceased a licensee, affirmed the verdict.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThere was no evidence upon which it was open to the jury to find that the deceased was a licensee in the locality where he met his death. His licence extended only to such reasonable area of the appellant's property as was necessary for him to reach his ship. Being outside that area, he was therefore a trespasser and no evidence can be found of any breach of duty toward him on the part of the appellant. Appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1] affirming the judgment at trial.\nH. A. V. Green, Q. C. and H. M. Pickart for the appellant.\nH. Ray for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Kellock, Locke and Fauteux J J. was delivered by:\u2014\nKellock J.:\u2014The material facts out of which this appeal has arisen are as follows. The deceased was a member of the crew of H.M.C.S. Sioux, which was moored on the easterly side of the appellant's Pier \"A\" in Vancouver Harbour, gratuitous permission having been given to the Canadian Naval authorities to so moor the ship.\nOn October 11, 1952, the deceased had left his ship about 3 p.m. and spent the following hours until about midnight in the city, from which he was driven back to the harbour area by one Stewart in the latter's car. Access to the ship from the city was gained by proceeding over a viaduct running westerly from the northern end of Granville Street, and then turning to the north out on to the pier at the westerly end of the ramp of the viaduct.\nWhen Stewart and the deceased returned there was a fog, described by all the witnesses as very dense, one of them stating that he could not see his feet even with a flashlight. Instead of turning off the ramp immediately to his right on to Pier \"A\", Stewart missed the turn and drove westerly along a hard top road on the appellant's property which bordered to the south a number of docks. After proceeding some 1,500 feet, Stewart realized he was lost and turned around and began to retrace his journey. While proceeding westerly, he had crossed a number of railway tracks, in order to do so having to turn slightly to the north and again to the south. On the return journey, after retracing the road for about 500 feet, he missed the first turn in the fog and instead of turning slightly to the south, drove some 300 feet out on to a pier where the car went over the end of the pier into the water.\nAt the point where the railway tracks crossed the road the hard top was replaced by planking which followed the railway tracks to the north and south. On his return journey, Stewart had, as already mentioned, not only failed to turn to his right but followed the planking and the tracks, straddling one of the rails as he did so.\nThe trial took place before Whittaker J. and a jury, the latter returning a verdict in favour of the respondent but finding the deceased guilty of contributory negligence. Judgment was entered accordingly and was upheld in the Court of Appeal, which considered the deceased a licensee. The court considered it was immaterial under the circumstances whether the jury's verdict should be regarded \"as defining by implication the area covered by the licence or as extending the duty owed by the occupier to the licensee beyond the actual area covered by the licence\", and that the ferry dock constituted a danger of which the deceased was entitled to have warning.\nIn my opinion there was no evidence upon which it was open to the jury to find that the deceased was a licensee in the locality where he met his death. No doubt the licence extended to such reasonable area of the appellant's property as was necessary for the deceased to reach his ship from the end of the city street. It is quite irrelevant, in my opinion, that other persons having business from time to time with the appellant might be invitees in using the road leading along the docks farther to the west. So far as the deceased was concerned, he was, in my opinion, a trespasser once he got beyond any point over which he was reasonably entitled to pass in going to or from his ship.\nIn my opinion, the principle of the decision in Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Procter [2] applies. In that case, Viscount Cave L.C., at p. 261, referred to Hardcastle v. South Yorkshire Railway Co.[3], in which a man had wandered from a highway and had fallen into a reservoir on land at some little distance from the highway, the court holding the owner of the land not liable. Pollock C.B., said, at p. 74:\n\u2026but when the excavation is made at some distance from the way, and the person falling into it would be a trespasser upon the defendant's land before he reached it, the case seems to us to be different. We do not see where the liability is to stop. A man getting off a road on a dark night and losing his way may wander to any extent, and if the question be for the jury no one could tell whether he was liable for the consequences of his act upon his own land or not. After citing this judgment, Viscount Cave continued at p. 262:\nIt is true that these observations had reference to a public way, but the reasoning appears to me to apply equally to a way which a person is invited or permitted to use.\nIn Procter's case, the deceased had been working on a ship in a floating dock lying to the east of a piece of ground which separated that dock from another floating dock on its westerly side. On leaving the ship on which he was working, the deceased had proceeded southerly over this piece of ground and over a bridge at the southern end, called the Duke Street Bridge. The piece of ground was traversed from north to south by two double lines of rails leading to and over the bridge, the site of the railway being used as a public highway. The deceased apparently lost his life while endeavouring to proceed south but had wandered to the west and fallen into the water. An action brought by his widow under the Fatal Accidents Act failed.\nIn the course of his judgment, Lord Sumner, with whom Lord Carson agreed, said, at p. 272:\nA free range over the whole estate is not given to every invited workman.The respondent, recognizing this, suggested two forms of limitation\u2026 the second, that the limit varied according as the day was clear or foggy\u2026 As to the second, it amounts to this, that a man, who can see where he is going, enjoys the rights of an invitee within modest boundaries; but a man, who cannot carries them with him as far as the limits of his actual error. Both suggestions are ingenious, but they are suggestions ad hoc. There is no decision to support them.\nLord Sumner continued at p. 273:\nHe was actually going where he had no business to go at the time of the accident, though his mistake was alike innocent and accidental. How can a workman extend the Board's liabilities, indicated by this term \"invitation,\" by making a mistake of his own and getting lost in a fog? What legal reason can there be for the Board's \"inviting\" him to go somewhere in a fog, where he does not want to go at all and would certainly not be invited to go in clear weather, and where, moreover, the Board has no interest or desire to invite him at any time? There is none: the suggestion is a mere impulse of compassion.\nIn my opinion, this is the law and applies in the case at bar. Reference may also be made to Caseley v. Bristol Corporation[4].\nThe deceased, in the case at bar, being a trespasser in the place where he met his death, I can find no evidence of any breach of duty toward him on the part of the railway company. The appeal should therefore be allowed, the judgments below set aside and judgment entered for the appellant with costs if demanded.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Kellock and I agree with his conclusion that there was no evidence on which the jury could find that the late Kenneth McCrindle was other than a trespasser at the place where he met his death. This being so, the action cannot succeed although the mistake made by Stewart and the deceased was, in the words of Lord Sumner quoted by my brother Kellock, \"alike innocent and accidental.\"\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Kellock.\nAppeal allowed, with costs if demanded.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

The trial judge dismissed the action and this judgment was reversed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe medical evidence to the effect that the deceased was in a state of extreme mental senility was sufficient to raise a prima facie presumption of mental incapacity and to cast upon those supporting the donation and the will the burden of displacing it by convincing proof that the deceased at the time was able to give the valid consent required by Art. 986 C.C. The presumption has not been displaced by the appellant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec [1], reversing, Rinfret J.A. dissenting, the judgment at trial.\nL. Dussault, Q.C. and G. Filion for the appellant.\nE. Leithman for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRAND J.:\u2014In this appeal the validity of a donation inter vivos and of a will is challenged on the ground of mental incompetency. The donatrice and testatrix, born in 1888, then living in Farnham, Quebec, had in 1907 obtained a judicial separation from her husband and from then until 1928 had supported herself and only child by her earnings. In that year she inherited premises in Montreal which contained ten apartments, and there with her son made her home until his death in 1939. Shortly thereafter she asked her brother, the respondent, in Farnham, to move to Montreal for companionship and to assist her in managing her property, which he was unable to do until 1943. In the meantime, in 1940, she had made a will in which he was made universal legatee of which he learned soon after settling in Montreal in one of the apartments.\nHis sister was then suffering from arteriosclerosis, rheumatism, high blood pressure and nephritis which in 1945 was in an advanced and progressive stage. From 1943 until October, 1947 the brother and his wife gave her their friendly services in general oversight of the property and in attentions to her personal needs and conditions.\nThese good relations continued until September, 1947, when near the end of that month a \"chicane\" took place between the sisters-in-law which ended in each declaring that she would not again enter the door of the other. But this threat did not affect the daily attendance by the respondent and his wife on the deceased which continued as before at least until the events took place which give rise to this litigation; nor, as will appear, did it prevent the sister from visiting in the apartment of the brother thereafter.\nOn October 25 the deceased, with notary Gaudet, the appellant Bousquet, age 35, and his wife, attended the office of notary Poirier in Montreal where, in the presence of all five, instructions for a deed of donation of the property were given. That Bousquet was the spokesman appears from the cross-examination of the notary:\nLes instructions m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es quand madame Bail, monsieur et madame Bousquet, monsieur Gaudet \u00e9taient \u00e0 mon bureau. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 tout ensemble.\nQui a donn\u00e9 les instructions?\u2026\nOn m'a donn\u00e9 le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nQui?\nMonsieur Bousquet, cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9.\nC'est monsieur Bousquet le dernier qui vous a donn\u00e9 le plan de votre document, les conditions que vous avez incorpor\u00e9es dans l'acte?\nOui, avec toute l'approbation de madame Bail, elle a dit la m\u00eame chose elle-m\u00eame.\nThe \"general scheme\" was a simple gift reserving the usufruct for life with obligations on Bousquet which can be summarized by saying that he would see to the maintenance of the property for which he would furnish the labour, and to the personal requirements of the donor, for all of which, except the labour, she would bear the cost. There was a r\u00e9solutoire condition in case the donee predeceased her. At her request he was to take up living in her apartment without rent but otherwise occupying a lodging would be at the usual rent. According to Mme. Bousquet it was arranged that her family would move to one of the apartments in 1949, two years later, \"pour rester \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'elle\". The notary appreciated nothing of the serious physical condition of the deceased; he says he saw no change from her appearance seven years before which would seem to rule out any reliance on his powers of observation; and her \"approval\", however indicated, could not have been more than mere assent to questions put that called for \"yes\" or \"no\"; there is no suggestion that she played any greater part in the discussion. The document was drawn up and executed at her home on October 30. On the 30th of December, Bousquet and his wife, along with the deceased, again attended at the office of Poirier where the latter is said to have instructed him to draw a new will giving all of her property to Bousquet, which was executed in the presence of another notary. What property, if any, she possessed in addition to the apartment house, does not appear. According to the witnessing notary, while he was present she said nothing. Poirier produced in court a memorandum made by himself and annexed to the will of 1940 to the effect that on September 30 the deceased had revoked the will of 1940, and the later one includes an express revocation of all previous testamentary instruments.\nAbout April 20, 1948 while spending the afternoon at the Bousquet's she suffered a paralytic seizure which culminated in her death on June 16. From the making of the donation until June 2 she lived alone in her apartment as before but on that day she was taken to the Bousquet home where she died.\nMedical evidence was given by physicians who had attended her in 1945, 1946 and 1947 and they agree that she was then in the grip of the deterioration mentioned. Dr. Tremblay, aged 56, to whom she was taken by Mme. Saint\u2014Michel, wife of the respondent, found her in 1945 to be a very sick person, suffering from a chronic and progressive disorder which had produced a \"ramollissement c\u00e9r\u00e9bral\", a \"grand d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre, une grande d\u00e9ficience\" of mind,\nBien, elle souffrait (in 1945), c'\u00e9tait une grande malade, elle avait peine \u00e0 se conduire, c'est-\u00e0-dire elle ne pouvait pas venir au bureau seule, elle \u00e9tait toujours accompagn\u00e9e.\n***\nM\u00eame au point de vue mental, je crois qu'elle \u00e9tait encore dans un degr\u00e9 plus avanc\u00e9, une diminution des facult\u00e9s, une grande diminution.\n***\nC'\u00e9tait la m\u00e9moire qui faisait d\u00e9faut et toutes ses id\u00e9es c'\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t lent, \u2026\n***\nDans ses id\u00e9es il n'y avait pas de collaboration et en la questionnant, les r\u00e9ponses qu'elle nous donnait, c'\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t vague.\nPar les r\u00e9ponses qu'elle vous donnait, pouvez-vous dire si elle comprenait les questions que vous lui posiez?\nOui, elle comprenait, mais il y avait une diminution, je pourrais dire une diminution de 50% peut-\u00eatre avec une personne normale. He saw her again around Christmas, 1947:\nJe l'ai vue une fois, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 voir son fr\u00e8re et elle \u00e9tait l\u00e0, un soir. M. Saint-Michel faisait une crise d'asthme et elle \u00e9tait dans la cuisine \u00e0 causer, et elle n'a pas sembl\u00e9 me reconna\u00eetre. Je l'ai trouv\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tat tr\u00e8s pitoyable.\n***\nOui, bien pitoyable. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 comment elle allait et je pense qu'elle ne m'a pas r\u00e9pondu et je pense qu'elle n'a pas sembl\u00e9 me reconna\u00eetre du tout.\n***\nElle ne disait pas grand'chose. C'\u00e9tait moi qui \u00e9tais oblig\u00e9 de la questionner pour savoir de quoi elle se plaignait, de quoi elle souffrait. Elle \u00e9tait pas mal perdue.\n***\nJe suis certain qu'elle ne faisait pas ce que je lui disais parce qu'elle avait l'air d'oublier bien vite ce qu'on pouvait lui dire. Elle se rappelait pratiquement de pas grand'chose.\nIn 1946 Dr. Forbes, age 69, called by Mrs. Saint-Michel, attended her on three occasions at intervals of from seven to ten days. He found her suffering as already described, and asked whether in his opinion that condition had existed for some time said,\nI think so because her behaviour plainly indicated an intellectual deficiency which I attributed to a chronic trouble\u2026 softening of the brain.\nTo this he adds,\nWas there any doubt in your mind, when you saw her the first time, that she was suffering from what you call \"softening of the brain\"?\nI had no doubt at all. My first impression was: she appeared dull and stupid like\u2014inattentive to the questions I was putting to her.\nCould you, from her answers, gather whether she understood the questions you were putting to her?\nShe appeared indifferent and this struck me especially\u2014I mean in the condition she was and suffering from what she did.\n***\nWell, my foregone conclusion was that I could not expect any cooperation from her.\n***\nShe was indifferent and inattentive to the interest I was taking in her case. (Resulting from her mental condition.)\nWhat would you expect in time, in so far as the softening of the brain is concerned?\nThat progressively she would get worse and that she would end most likely\u2014eventually\u2014by having a stroke.\nBut she could have better periods if she were taken care of, and followed a diet?\nWell, I was not under that impression. It was a foregone conclusion in my mind, that there would never be any improvement. It was impossible due to the damaged condition of the brain at that time, and due to the arteriopathic condition of the brain. His prognosis was given remarkable confirmation by the event.\nThen Dr. Senecal, 45 years of age, called in to see her in July, 1947 for some skin trouble, who found her mentally feeble, summed up his impression as follows:\nLors de votre examen, naturellement, vous avez pos\u00e9 des questions, vous avez remarqu\u00e9 des faits; dans quelle condition mentale, d'apr\u00e8s vous, se trouvait la patiente?\nBien, \u00e9videmment, elle m'a fait l'impression d'\u00eatre affaiblie au point de vue mental, comme elle l'\u00e9tait d'ailleurs au point de vue physique.\nSur quoi vous basez-vous pour dire qu'elle \u00e9tait mentalement affaiblie? C'est une impression, son comportement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nLe fait qu'on la conduisait par la main et aux questions demand\u00e9es elle r\u00e9pondait plut\u00f4t vaguement. \"Depuis combien de temps cela dure?\" \"Je ne sais pas\". \"Une semaine?\" \"Peut-\u00eatre.\" Ce ne sont pas des choses concluantes, mais tout de m\u00eame\u2026.\nThe appellants called Dr. Girard, 79 years of age, who had attended her for the first time on April 20, 1948, when the seizure occurred. The paralysis had affected her tongue and she had difficulty in speaking:\nElle r\u00eapondait difficilement un petit peu, elle avait une temp\u00e9rature assez \u00e9lev\u00e9e, pression art\u00e9rielle de 180, les jonctives un petit peu hyper-trophi\u00e9es, les conjunctives un petit peu tum\u00e9fi\u00e9es, la figure un peu rouge. Elle ne disait pas grand chose. J'ai pris son poulx qui \u00e9tait passablement rapide. Je n'ai pas marqu\u00e9 la vitesse, sa pression \u00e9tait de 180 sur 75, la pression art\u00e9rielle.\n***\nVoyant qu'elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 parler, je lui ai pos\u00e9 le moins de questions possibles.\nMalgr\u00e9 tout, est-ce qu'elle a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 vos questions?\nTr\u00e9s bien, autant par des signes que par la voix.\nEst-ce qu'elle semblait avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre vos questions?\nNon, parce qu'elle souriait, elle me r\u00e9pondait; quand elle ne r\u00e9pondait pas de la voix elle r\u00e9pondait par des signes.\nOn April 30 at her home:\nEst-ce qu'elle vous a reconnu comme \u00e9tant le m\u00e9decin qui l'avait soign\u00e9e il y avait dix jours?\nJe ne peux pas affirmer, cela a paru comme si elle me reconnaissait parce qu'avant d'engager une certaine conversation, elle m'a r\u00e9pondu tr\u00e8s bien, elle \u00e9tait beaucoup am\u00e9lior\u00e9e.\nSubsequent visits were made:\nOn May 9:\nQu'est-ce que vous avez constat\u00e9, cette fois-l\u00e0, chez madame Bail? II y avait encore un peu de paralysie, cependant il y avait un peu d'am\u00e9lioration. La paralysie existait surtout dans sa langue.\n***\nEst-ce qu'elle vous a r\u00e9pondu facilement ou difficilement? Assez difficilement. May 20 and June 2:\n\u2026on voyait que la paralysie se faisait progressivement, mais bien lentement; sa circulation \u00e9tait m\u00e9chante; l'expression \u00e9tait diminu\u00e9e, sa figure \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e.\n***\nQu'est-ce que vous avez constat\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-la?\nLa paralysie \u00e9tait presque compl\u00e8te du c\u00f4t\u00e9. droit.\nAu point de vue intellectuel?\nElle n'avait pas connaissance.\nLe deux (2) juin?\nOui, monsieur.\nL'avez-vous revue avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s?\nOui, le quatre juin, les sept, neuf, onze juin.\nAs to blood pressure and senility:\nGrosse hypertension?\nOui, monsieur.\nPouvez-vous nous dire si, d'apr\u00e8s vous, cette hypertension existait depuis longtemps?\nC'est difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre parce qu'on voit des cas qui vont avoir une pression normale et il ya arriver certaines circonstances et que le lendemain ils vont faire une pression tr\u00e8s haute.\nQuant \u00e0 madame Bail, vous ne pouvez pas dire si elle avait cette hypertension depuis deux ou trois ans avant?\nJe ne crois pas, cela aurait pu exister depuis quelques mois.\nMais pas deux ou trois ans?\nJe ne crois pas.\n***\nComment d\u00e9crivez-vous la s\u00e9nilit\u00e9?\nC'est un ramollissement du cerveau.\n***\nN'avez-vous pas ajout\u00e9 \"grosse hypertension cardiaque et r\u00e9nale\"?\nOui, cela c'est bien cela.\nIn view of the unchallenged facts of her condition from 1945 through to the stroke on April 20, the opinions expressed by Dr. Girard furnish us with no assistance.\nIn addition to this testimony, that of neighbours and acquaintances of both the deceased and the Bousquet's was presented of small items of behaviour which presented the usual conflict. What seems to be placed beyond doubt was the decay of memory and the childishness of mind into which she had sunk. Quite apart from the testimony of her brother and sister-in-law, it is evident that, emotionally as well as mentally enfeebled, she talked and acted like a child, and presented a mind of the most limited scope of understanding. Mme. Sylvestre who occupied an apartment on the third floor says:\nOn lui racontait des choses et cinq minutes apr\u00e9s elle disait le contraire. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas toujours la m\u00eame chose qu'elle racontait. Elle pleurait beaucoup, dans cet \u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0, elle a beaucoup pleur\u00e9, surtout les derniers temps, elle pleurait beaucoup, en septembre, (1947) quand je suis revenue.\n***\nLes Saint-Michel s'\u00e9taient achet\u00e9 un propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et elle avait peur de rester toute seule?\nOui, elle avait peur qu'ils partent sans lui dire.\nThe witness Dub\u00e9:\nNormale, comment, physiquement ou mentalement?\nPhysiquement oui, et mentalement, oui, parce qu'elle disait des choses, vous savez, qui n'\u00e9taient pas \u2026C'\u00e9tait un discours qui n'\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait \u2026C'\u00e9tait comme un enfant dirais-je.\nShe had difficulty in appreciating simple distinctions as, for example, between a 1\u00a2 piece and a 10\u00a2 piece, and common matters told in the plainest language which, after much repetition, she would seem to understand, would be obliterated from memory minutes afterwards. In September and October, 1947 she is said to have proposed to several persons, bare acquaintances, \"se donner\" along with her property. M. Sylvestre consulted notary Poirier whether he should take over the property and on the advice given him he declined, but he adds significantly:\nEn premier, je ne la prenais pas au s\u00e9rieux, ensuite de cela, je m'en suis fait un scrupule.\n***\nJe trouvais que ca n'avait pas de bon sens qu'elle enl\u00e9ve cela \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re pour me donner cela \u00e0 moi, qui \u00e9tais un \u00e9tranger.\nC'\u00e9tait une femme qui me paraissait malade et elle n'avait pas de discours, une journ\u00e9e elle nous disait noir et cinq minutes apr\u00e8s elledisait blanc. On ne pouvait pas parler avec elle.\n***\nElle agissait comme une personne qui ne se rend pas absolument compte de ce qu'elle faisait.\n***\nC'est-\u00e0-dire elle ne donnait pas de recu, elle pr\u00e9sentait le carnet de recus et ils \u00e9taient tous pr\u00e9par\u00e9s, et elle nous disait de choisir le recu \u00e0 notre nom.\n***\nEst-ce qu'elle pouvait se rendre compte que le montant d'argent qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb lui \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 exactement?\nNon, parce qu'elle me demandait: \"Est-ce que j'ai le montant, est-ce que j'ai du change \u00e0 vous remettre?\"\nLater on Mme. Sylvestre spoke to Bousquet:\nJ'ai dit \u00e0 M. Bousquet: \"Vous prenez une, grosse chance, parce que \u2026\". II a dit: \"Cela ne fait rien, je prends la chance\"\nII prenait la chance de quoi, madame?\nC'est tout ce qu'il m'a r\u00e9pondu. Mme. Lachance;\nElle agissait comme une personne qui retourne en enfance, d'apr\u00e9s moi.\n***\nEst-ce que madame Bail vous a parl\u00e9 au sujet de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e8?\nBien, elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 voulu se donner \u00e0 nous autres.\nQuand cela, madame?\nCa fait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e9s trois ou quatre ans, c'est les premiers \u00e0 qui elle en a parl\u00e9.\nTrois ou quatre ans avant sa mort?\nOui.\n***\nQu'est-ce que vous voulez dire quand vous dites qu'elle ne r\u00e9pondait pas normalement? Quand vous lui avez parl\u00e9? Pouvez-vous donner des examples?\nElle ne comprenait pas. Cela prenait une heure avant de lui faire comprendre.\n***\nEst-ce que cela vous a pris une heure pour la convaincre que la pi\u00e8ce d'un sou \u00e9tait un sou et non pas un dix sous?\nCela a pris une dizaine de minutes, pas plus.\n***\nC'a pris du temps, il fallait lui expliquer et c'\u00e9tait long quand on lui expliquait quelque chose.\nInformation reached her brother that she was intending to give her property to the Bousquet's and he seems to have asked for remuneration for what had been done for her by a return of the rent paid and a gratuitous lease for a future period. There is in evidence a document dated October 29, 1947, bearing her signature, almost undecipherable, by which she agreed to reimburse him and to permit him to hold his apartment without charge for two years from that date. Notwithstanding this document, in November, on alleged instruction from her, Bousquet had a saisie-gagerie issued against the goods of the brother, which, when the document was produced to the attorneys, was at once abandoned. Assuming that she had assented to Bousquet's action, the necessary inference is that she had completely forgotten the document, but it furnishes no evidence that she was capable of appreciating what she was doing in signing it: it would evidence rather her yielding to whatever was indicated or pressed upon her by others. It is of some interest also that the proceedings alleged a lease under seal dated October 20, 1947 for a term of two years at the rent of $19 a month. No such instrument was produced at the trial. The claim was for a resiliation of the lease and for the further sum of $57 covering an additional three months' rent. Admittedly Bousquet was the inter- mediary representing the deceased and if there was such an instrument, taken with the other document of October 29, it supplies whatever further evidence of confusion on her part might be asked for.\nThe medical testimony mentioned and that of the other witnesses was either heard or read by Dr. Fontaine, 58 years of age, a graduate of the University of Paris in medical jurisprudence and psychiatry, the medico-legal expert of the provincial government, and his opinion, was unqualified that the deceased was in a state of extreme mental senility, \"l'affaiblissement intellectuel\",. manifesting a regress into infancy. After reviewing the medical testimony he says:\nDe ce t\u00e9moignage, il r\u00e9sulte que Madame Bail souffrait de d\u00e9ficience mentale qui se traduisait par de la lenteur dans les id\u00e9es, par des troubles de m\u00e9moire, une diminution de la compr\u00e9hension, de l'inattention, une attitude h\u00e9b\u00eat\u00e9e et une indiff\u00e9rence et une insouciance qui se manifestent par un certain \u00e9tat de malpropret\u00e9, constat\u00e9 par le docteur Forbes; et ces troubles, tels que relat\u00e9s par le m\u00e9decin, sont confirm\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins de la demande:\n\"Elle racontait des choses et cinq minutes apr\u00e8s nous disait le contraire.\"\n\"Elle pleurait sans savoir pourquoi et comprenait toujours \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9,\" nous dit Madame Sylvestre.\n\"II n'y avait pas beaucoup moyen de se faire comprendre de Madame Bail; elle agissait comme une personne qui retourne en enfance\"\u2014nous dit Madame Lachance.\n\"Elle r\u00e9p\u00e9te toujours la m\u00eame chose, disait quelque chose et deux minutes apr\u00e8s le redisait et ce n'\u00e9tait plus la m\u00eame chose\"\u2014nous dit sa belle-sceur, Madame Saint-Michel.\n***\nIls s'amusent avec les enfants, se chicanent avec eux, les boudent; c'est ce qu'on appelle le retour \u00e1 l'enfance.\nSpeaking of the evidence of Dr. Girard he comments:\nLe docteur Girard nous a dit que lorsqu'il vit la patiente Madame Bail pour la premi\u00e8re fois, elle \u00e8tait paralys\u00e8e de la langue et qu'elle avait toutes les difficult\u00e8es du monde \u00e1 entendre et \u00e1 parler. Et il a conclu que Madame Bail \u00e8tait parfaitement lucide parce que\u2014nous dit-il\u2014\"Elle m'a souri et semblait me reconna\u00edtre.\"\nEt aux questions qu'il lui posait, elle r\u00e9pondait surtout par des gestes plut\u00f3t qu'au moyen de la parole.\nJ'ai trouv\u00e8 tranges ces conclusions: parce que si Madame Bail ne peuvait pas s'exprimer, si elle ne parlait pas, comment a-t-il pu faire pour se rendre compte qu'elle \u00e8tait saine d'esprit?\nC'est par interrogatoire et par les r\u00e8ponses au questions que I'on pose aux malades qu'on peut se rendre compte surtout de l'\u00e8tat mental du patient.\nOn these facts the trial judge found against the respondent, but on appeal this was reversed by a court of five members, Rinfret J.A. dissenting. Among the persons declared by the Civil Code to be incapable of contracting are those who \"by reason of weakness of understanding are unable to give a valid consent\" : Art. 986. The evidence both of fact and of opinion given by Drs. Tremblay, Forbes and Senecal, supported by the opinion of Dr. Fontaine, was sufficient to raise a prima facie presumption of that degree of mental weakness or unsoundness and to cast upon those supporting the instrument of donation the burden of displacing it by convincing proof that the deceased at the time was able to give such a consent: Russell v. Lefrancois[2] ; Phelan v. Murphy [3]. This would mean that she was of an understanding adequate to the act done, that she was able to grasp its character and effect in the setting of her circumstances, that she appreciated the value of the property, about $20,000, her own physical condition, her future, that she was disposing of her property to a virtual stranger whom she would not have as a neighbour for at least two years, and that the donation was irrevocable: that she had, in short, the intellectual capacity in some degree to view these matters in their entirety in the perspective of her present and possible future life and her family relationships.\nSo formulated and in the circumstances of the particular case, the test of competency in making the agreement is substantially the same as that of the will. Testamentary capacity was before this Court in Leger v. Poirier [4], in which the leading cases were examined. What they indicated was that it was not sufficient that a testator be able to answer familiar and usual questions, but to use the language of Sir John Nicholl quoted at p. 162,\nhe ought to have a disposing memory so as to be able to make a disposition of his estate with understanding and reason.\nAnd as it was put in the majority judgment of this Court,\na mind capable of comprehending, of its own initiative and volition, the essential elements of will-making, property, objects, just claims to consideration, revocation of existing dispositions, and the like.\n***\nThere must have been a power to hold the essential field of the mind in some degree of appreciation as a whole.\nThis follows Banks v. Goodfellow[5], in which Cockburn C.J., giving an authoritative pronouncement on the general subject, reviews the treatment accorded it by the foremost commentators in the Civil Law and that of France, and remarks upon the absence in both of the formulation of any specific juridical test of unsoundness.\nAttributing to her a vague seeking for some symbol of protection or security, evidenced by the adventitious, hasty and indifferent commitment of herself and property to an unknown young man, a childishly irrational act since she continued to live alone, as she had from 1939, until struck down, and considering, along with the other evidence before us, the inconsequent attitude towards her brother, although their relations remained much as before, the presumption has not, in my opinion, been displaced; I find myself quite unable to say that she was capable of giving an intelligent consent to the deed or that she possessed a \"disposing mind and memory\".\nIn this Court the appeal is against the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, and unless we are satisfied that that judgment is wrong, it should not be disturbed. While the question at issue is not free from difficulty, I am far from being satisfied that the court below was wrong, and I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nABBOTT J.:\u2014I am in substantial agreement with the reasons given by Mr. Justice McDougall in the Court, below. In my opinion the medical evidence was sufficient to raise a prima facie presumption of mental incapacity. On the principle enunciated in Russell v. Lefrancois [6], the burden of establishing capacity to have made the donation and the will was therefore shifted to the propounding party and in my view the appellants failed to discharge that burden. I am unable to say that the Court below was wrong in reaching the conclusion which it did and I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Monette, Filion & Lachapelle.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cohen & Leithman.\n[1] Q.R.

The Crown's case was that while he did not in fact have sexual intercourse with the woman he had aided others to do so. The Crown sought a conviction under s. 69(1) of the Code as an \"aider and abettor\". By a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered an acquittal on the ground that the indictment failed to allege the facts in support of the Crown's case.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): That the appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.\nPer Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: Since an aider and abettor may be indicted as principal simpliciter, it follows that an indictment so charging an aider, being valid in law, must therefore be construed not as exclusively charging the accused as having in fact actually committed the offence, but as having in the eyes of the law committed it. It also follows, since the reason for such construction being that all participants are by law principals, that the same construction obtains whether the indictment charges them jointly or each of them alone of the offence in the ordinary form, as if they had actually committed it, or whether the offence is stated \"in popular language\" or \"in words of the enactment describing the offence\" as authorized by s-s. 2 and 3 of s. 852 of the Criminal Code.\nWhile it was open to the respondent, before or during the trial, to move for the different reliefs he might then have considered desirable for his defence, he, admittedly being at all times fully informed of the case against him, elected not to do so; he cannot now complain in appeal of matters which, subject to their merits, could have been corrected at trial.\nPer Rand J.: The charge as laid included the offence in law attributable to the respondent through his act of aiding and abetting. The evidence of assistance only was, after verdict, sufficient to convict (Rex v. Folkes and Ludds 168 E.R. 1301 followed).\nPer Kellock J.: The indictment complied with s. 852(3) of the Code and was a valid and appropriate indictment.\nPer Locke J.: When a person has abetted another to commit the offence of rape, it is a literal compliance with the requirements of s. 852(3) of the Code to charge him of the offence as a principal. Per Cartwright J. (dissenting): The wording of the charge not only failed to inform the respondent of the case against him but was actually misleading. The charge should have contained at least a statement that someone had raped the complainant and that the respondent had done an act for the purpose of aiding him to do so. The rape with which he was charged was not one committed by someone else but by himself personally and there was no evidence of any such rape. Where the criminality of an act depends on the existence or non-existence of a particular relationship between the individual personally committing the act and another person, it is essential that the charge should specify whether the accused did the alleged act personally or merely aided another to commit it.\nFurthermore, since there was evidence by the complainant of two separate rapes, the charge was bad either for uncertainty or for charging two separate crimes in one count.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside, Robertson and Bird JJ.A. dissenting, the respondent's conviction on a charge of rape.\nLee A. Kelley, Q.C. and J.J. Urie for the appellant.\nT. P. O'Grady for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The material facts giving rise to this case are related by the complainant; they may be summarized as follows: At 9 o'clock p.m., on the 23rd day of May, 1954, the respondent, Kie Singh, Pew Singh and Jumbo Singh invited the complainant to board the automobile in which they were and eventually abducted her to a secluded place where each of the three Singhs raped her; respondent himself had no carnal knowledge of the girl but, by use of force, assisted in subduing her; immediately after the occurrence, the latter was driven back to a short distance from her home and upon entering her residence, complained to her mother of the assault and the police were notified.\nThe accused was arrested and upon evidence of these facts related by the complainant at the preliminary inquiry, was committed for trial and tried upon an indictment charging him in the very words of the enactment describing the offence of rape (s. 298), to wit:\u2014\nThat at or near Newton, in the Municipality of Surrey, in the County and Province aforesaid, on the 23rd day of May in the year of Our Lord 1954, he, the said Kenneth Harder, a man, did have carnal knowledge of (Christian name and surname mentioned in the indictment are here omitted), a woman, who was not his wife, without her consent, against the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against the peace of Our Lady the Queen, her Crown and dignity.\nThe issue at trial was whether, during the whole of the transaction, rape had been committed by a person or persons other than the accused and whether the accused aided in its commission. The latter, assisted by counsel, did not testify and was found guilty by the jury.\nThis conviction was appealed and quashed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nThe point upon which the appeal turned is centred upon the indictment and, as indicated by Davey, J.A., had never been raised at trial. The majority (O'Halloran, Smith and Davey, JJ.A.), relying primarily on the decision of this Court in Brodie v. The King [2], expressed the view that the indictment, containing no averment that Harder had assisted Jumbo Singh or any one else to have carnal knowledge of the girl, must on a proper construction, be held to charge respondent as having himself physically raped the complainant; and there being admittedly no evidence to support the indictment as thus construed, the Court maintained the appeal and directed an acquittal to be entered. Robertson and Bird JJ.A. dissenting, held:\u2014\nThat the indictment charging the accused as principal was sufficient notwithstanding that it did not aver that the accused aided and abetted Kie Singh to assault the woman criminally.\nWith deference, I cannot agree with the views held by the majority. Admitting that the construction they placed upon the indictment is justified, on the restrictive basis upon which it was made i.e. the literal wording of the document, it cannot be supported, on the entirely different legal basis upon which indictments can be framed and must therefore be construed, according to law. And while it was open to the accused, before or at any stage during the trial, to move for the different reliefs he might then have considered desirable for his defence, he, admittedly being from the moment of his committal for trial to the end of the trial fully informed of the case against him, elected not to do so; he cannot now complain in appeal of matters which, subject to their merits, could have been corrected at trial, had he then chosen to so move. The indictment. An indictment cannot properly be construed without regard to the substantive and procedural provisions of the criminal law related to its substance and its form. As stated by Willes J., with the concurrence of all the Judges who advised the House of Lords, and with the approval of the latter, in the case of Mulcahey v. The Queen [3]:\n\u2026an indictment only states the legal character of the offence and does not profess to furnish the details and particulars. These are supplied by the depositions, and the practice of informing the prisoner or his counsel of any additional evidence not in the depositions, which it may be intended to produce at the trial. To make the indictment more particular would only encourage formal objections upon the ground of variance, which have of late been justly discouraged by the Legislature.\nThis statement was acted upon by Sir William Ritchie C.J. and Strong J. in Downie v. The Queen [4].\nAt common law, the actor or actual perpetrator of the fact and those who are, actually or constructively, present at the commission of the offence and aid and abet its commission, are distinguished as being respectively principal in the first degree and principals in the second degree; yet, in all felonies in which the punishment of the principal in the first degree and of the principals in the second degree is the same, the indictment may charge all who are present and abet the fact as principals in the first degree. (Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 33rd ed., p. 1499). In Hawkins's Pleas of the Crown, Vol. II, p. 316, s. 64, it is stated:\u2014\nThat where several are present and one only actually does it, an indictment may in the same manner as in appeal, either lay it generally as done by them all or specially as done only by the one and abetted by the rest.\nThe reason for the rule is evident. It is stated as follows in East's Pleas of the Crown, Vol. I, at page 350:\u2014\nFor in these cases all the parties are principals, and the blow of one is, in law, the blow of all. For which reason an indictment that A. gave the mortal blow and B., C. and D. were present and abetting, is sustained by evidence, that B. gave the blow and A., C. and D. were present and abetting, Upon the like indictment, evidence that E., though not named therein, gave the blow, and that A., B., C. and D. were present and abetting, would be sufficient; or even that a person unknown gave the blow. In The Queen v. James [5], the indictment charged the accused with the larceny of a letter; the question raised in that case was whether he was a joint thief with the postman whom he had induced to intercept and hand him over the letter, or whether he was an accessory before the fact to the larceny committed by the servant of the Post Office. Lord Coleridge, C.J., with the concurrence of Pollock, B., Hawkins, Grantham and Charles, JJ., stated at page 440:\u2014\nI can entertain no doubt in this case. Either the prisoner was a joint thief with the postman from whom he obtained the letter, or he was an accessory before the fact, in which case, by 24 & 25 Vict. c. 94, s. 1, he was liable to be convicted in all respects as if he were a principal felon. In either case, therefore, he was rightly convicted.\nSection 1 of c. 94, therein referred to, reads:\u2014\n1. Whosoever shall become an Accessory before the Fact to any Felony, whether the same be a Felony at Common Law or by virtue of any Act passed or to be passed, may be indicted, tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if he were a principal Felon.\nThis Imperial statute, later adopted into Canadian law (R.S.C. 1886, c. 145) practically brought to an end the distinctions between accessories before the fact and principals in the second degree.\nBy the enactment of section 61, the predecessor to section 69, these distinctions in the substantive law entirely disappeared from our criminal laws when codified in 1892. With them, of course, also disappeared, because being made no longer necessary, the relevant adjective rules related to the framing of the indictment of such persons who, not actually committing the offence charged, were then made, by statute, principals and equally party to, guilty of and punishable for the offence as if actually committed by them. It is unthinkable that, getting rid of the difficulties arising out of these prior distinctions, Parliament would, in the same breath, have created new ones by refusing to the Crown the right to indict\u2014which right it had before, under common and statutory law\u2014as principal simpliciter, either a principal in the second degree or an accessory before the fact, and this, under the regime of this new law holding each and all particeps criminis as being nothing less than principals. Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau, in his Criminal Code, deals with the matter and, indicating how an abettor may be indicted, says at page 29:\u2014\nFor instance: A. abetted in the commission of a theft by B. The indictment may charge A. and B. jointly or A. and B. alone as guilty of the offence in the ordinary form, as if they had actually stolen by one and the same act.\nIn R\u00e9millard v. The King [6], is evidenced the practice more generally followed since this change of the law. The facts in that case were that, on the counsel of his father, a son killed another person. Father and son were separately indicted; the indictment against the father, as appears in the file of this case in this Court, was for murder simpliciter, there being no averment, either of the fact that he counselled the commission of the crime or of the fact that another person was involved therein. The son was found guilty of manslaughter but the father, guilty of murder. The conviction of the latter was upheld by this Court.\nRelying on the decision of this Court in R\u00e9millard v. The King (supra), Chief Justice Robertson, in Rex v. Halmo [7], dealing with the same matter though arising in a different way, expressed the following views, at p. 118:\u2014\nAppellant was charged in express terms with an offence against s. 285(6), and if he did aid, abet, counsel or procure Mayville to drive his motor-car in the manner in which it was in fact driven, he was guilty of a breach of that subsection, and s. 69, beyond question, warrants his prosecution for an offence under s. 285(6); Remillard v. The King (1921), 59 D.L.R. 340, 35 Can. C.C. 227, 62 S.C.R. 21. It was unnecessary to allege in the charge that appellant \"did aid, abet, counsel or procure Wilfred Mayville,\" for by force of s. 69 it would have been sufficient, and perhaps, better pleading, to charge him simply with the offence that Mayville in fact committed. The insertion of the unnecessary words did not, in my opinion, invalidate the charge, nor prevent its being a good and sufficient charge under s. 285(6). Appellant was assisted rather than injured by the more specific statement of his relation to the offence with which he was charged.\nIn this state of the law, an aider and abettor may be indicted as principal simpliciter. It follows that such an indictment, valid in law, must therefore be construed, not\u2014as was done in the Court below\u2014as exclusively charging an accused as having in fact actually committed the offence charged, but as having in the eyes of the law committed it. And, the reason for the construction being that all particeps criminis are by law principals, it also follows that the same construction obtains whether, as stated in Taschereau's Criminal Code, the indictment charges them jointly or each of them alone of the offence in the ordinary form, as if they had actually committed it, or whether the offence is stated \"in popular language\" or \"in the words of the enactment describing the offence\" as Parliament authorized it to be done at the option of the prosecution, under sub-sections 2 and 3, respectively, of s. 852.\nIt is said that charging a man with rape or to have had carnal knowledge of a woman when he only aided another to do the act is repugnant and, therefore, misleading. This is so if the indictment is literally construed but not so if legally construed. Countenance must be given to the law as laid down and not to arguments prompted by logic without regard to what the law is. In Simcovitch et al. v. The King [8], the argument was that, neither of the appellants falling within the description of the classes of persons to whom indictable offences of which they were charged are imputed by statute, they could not physically for that reason commit, and therefore be convicted of, such offences. This argument was not accepted to defeat the law as interpreted by the Court.\nThe Brodie case (supra), relied on by the majority in the Court below, has, with respect, no application in the matter. The question in the case was whether the indictment did specify the offence. The point raised in the present appeal is an entirely different one and one which was not in issue in the Brodie case. While, in the latter, this Court dealt with sections 852, 853 and 855, it clearly did so exclusively in relation to the matters under consideration in that case, carefully adding, indeed, at the end of the judgment:\u2014\nWe do not want to part with this appeal, however, without saying that our decision is strictly limited to the points in issue.\nAnd contrary to what is the situation here, the Court treated the indictment as being invalid on its face, quashed it as well as the conviction, and added that the Crown was at liberty to prefer a fresh indictment if so advised. The course of conduct at trial. As already indicated, respondent was admittedly fully aware of the case for the prosecution and of the position taken by the latter on the indictment. This knowledge he gained respectively from the depositions at the preliminary inquiry and from the opening address of the Crown to the jury at the very end of which the prosecutor said:\u2014\nNow, in that regard, I think I should at this point advise you that the Crown will not attempt to prove that this accused actually had sexual intercourse with the complainant (name being now omitted). The Crown, however, will bring evidence to show that he in concert with another man, held the accused, the girl, while others had sexual intercourse with her.\nTHE COURT: You said the accused.\nMR. FRASER: Oh, I beg your pardon, held the complainant, while others had sexual intercourse with her.\nThus openly and at the very beginning of the trial the Crown, on the one hand, stated its intention to treat\u2014as it was entitled to on the facts of the case and on the indictment as preferred (see The King v. Michaud [9]; Regina v. Giddins and two others. [10])\u2014the whole conduct of the accused during the event as being, so far as the accused was concerned, one entire transaction, rather than to deal separately with his participation in each of the rapes committed in separate counts, a process much less favourable to the accused than the one adopted. With all this information and with this statement of the Crown, the accused, on the other hand, was content to undergo trial on the indictment as laid. No attempts were made by the defence either before, or at any stage of, the trial to have this substantially valid indictment quashed for matters of form, particularized, amended or divided. From this course of conduct in which both the Crown and the defence joined, the trial Judge was entitled to conclude that the accused had neither doubts as to what the case was nor embarrassment with respect to his defence to the charge as laid. In this situation, the defence was precluded, after the verdict, from complaining as to the indictment and the Crown was foreclosed from thereafter laying an indictment charging the accused with respect to any of the rapes actually committed during the events forming the basis of the charge. In brief, the indictment was valid, the evidence of the complainant was accepted by the jury; and no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred in the case.\nThe appeal should be maintained and the conviction restored.\nRAND J.:\u2014The question raised in this appeal is that of the language in which the offence of rape is to be stated against an accused. S. 69 of the former Code declared that accessories before the fact and principals in the second degree, as these were known at common law, were parties to and guilty of an offence as if principals in the first degree. By s. 852(1) a count was sufficient if it contained in substance a statement that the accused \"has committed some indictable offence therein specified\"; s-s. (2) permitted the statement to be made in popular language, and s-s. (3) that \"it may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an indictable offence\". This latter general provision might, obviously, require to be accommodated to the special nature of the offence when accessories before the fact or principals in the second degree were charged. For example, a husband who aids the ravishment of his wife by a third person is guilty of the crime of rape upon her; but could the charge follow the description of the offence as given by s. 298 of the Code which requires a statement that the woman is not his wife? In such a case it is necessary to include an allegation of the actual ravishment by another and a further allegation of the participation by way of assistance of the husband. The same conflict exists in the case of a woman charged with rape: it would be an absurdity to state the charge in the language of the Code, yet she is declared to be a party to the offence and may be found guilty of it.\nThe permitted description in the language of the statute is not, then, absolute. In the case before us I would, in the absence of direct authority, have been disposed to agree with the Court of Appeal that, owing to the nature of the crime and the connotation of the language by which it is directly described, the charge states only the personal act of ravishment by the accused and excludes the offence in law attributable to him through his act of aiding and abetting. In Regina v. Crisham [11] the count set forth the actual facts of aiding and abetting a rape by another and it was argued that the accused should have been indicted as principal at common law, with the count stating that the accused \"as well as M'Donough\" had ravished the prosecutor, which so far supports the view I take of the matter.\nBut I am precluded from following it by Rex v. Folkes and Ludds [12]. There the indictment in the first count charged Folkes with having feloniously ravished the named woman and in the second that Ludds was there and then present, aiding and abetting him. The third and fourth counts were similar except that Ludds was charged as principal and Folkes as aider. The fifth and sixth, and the seventh and eighth counts, in each couplet, charged a person unknown to have been principal with Folkes and Ludds aiders. Ludds was acquitted on an alibi and a general verdict of guilty found against Folkes. The statute, 9 Geo. IV, c. 31 made no provision against aiders and abettors in rape and the question was whether, upon the indictment, the verdict could be sustained against Folkes. As the statute dealt with accessories before and after the fact to felonies and for aiders in cases of misdemeanour, it seems to have been accepted or it was at least assumed that the fourth, sixth and eighth counts did not state an offence against Folkes. There was evidence both of the personal ravishment by him and his aiding and abetting the ravishment by others. At a meeting of all the judges except four, the conviction was upheld on the first count. What this means is that on that count there could be a conviction upon the finding by the jury based either on the evidence going to the ravishment or that going to his secondary role as abettor. From this it follows that if there had been no other than the first count the evidence of assistance only would, after verdict, have been sufficient. That is the case before us.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The indictment upon which the respondent was tried and convicted contained the following charge:\nTHAT at or near Newton, in the Municipality of Surrey, in the County and Province aforesaid, on the twenty-third day of May, in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-four, he the said KENNETH HARDER, a man, did have carnal knowledge of Vera Borushko, a woman who was not his wife, without her consent, against the form of the Statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen her Crown and Dignity.\nThis conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal, Robertson and Bird JJ.A., dissenting. The appeal comes to this court under s. 1023 of the Criminal Code upon the following dissent:\nThat the indictment charging the accused as a principal was sufficient notwithstanding that it did not aver that the accused aided and abetted Kie Singh to assault the woman criminally.\nIt is provided by s. 852(1) of the Criminal Code that every count of an indictment shall contain, and shall be sufficient if it contains in substance, a statement that the accused has committed \"some indictable offence therein specified\". By s-s. (2) it is provided that such statement may be made in popular language without any technical averments or any allegations of matter not essential to be proved, while s-s. (3) provides that\nSuch statement may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence \u2026\nThe particular offence here in question is described by s. 298 as follows:\n298. Rape is the act of a man having carnal knowledge of a woman who is not his wife without her consent, \u2026\nBy s. 299, it is provided that \"every one\" who commits rape is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to suffer death or to imprisonment for life, and to be whipped.\nIt is further provided by s. 69 that\n69. Everyone is a party to and guilty of an offence who\n(a) actually commits it;\n(b) does or omits an act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;\n(c) abets any person in commission of the offence; or\n(d) counsels or procures any person to commit the offence.\nThe view which commended itself to the majority below is sufficiently expressed in the language of Davey J., who, after referring to s. 69(1), clauses (b) and (c), said:\nThe accessory is guilty of the offence committed by the principal, in this case carnal knowledge had unlawfully by Kie Singh. But that was not the crime charged against the appellant. It was his own unlawful carnal knowledge that was alleged. In my respectful view, the error into which the learned judges constituting the majority have fallen is in reading the charge as though it had been framed \"in popular language\" as permitted by s-s. (2) of s. 852, substituting for the words \"did have carnal knowledge of Vera Borushko\" in the indictment, the words \"did have sexual intercourse\" with the named woman without her consent. The indictment was not, however, so framed but employs \"the words of the enactment describing the offence\" in accordance with s-s. (3) of s. 852. Accordingly, the indictment complying, as it does, with the statute, the only question is as to whether in a case such as the present, where the respondent did not himself have sexual intercourse with the woman but aided and abetted Kie Singh to do so, the indictment is a valid indictment.\nAt the time of the enactment of the Code in 1892, it had already been provided by R.S.C., 1886, c. 145, s. 2, that an aider or abettor\nmay be indicted and convicted of a substantive felony, whether the principal felon has or has not been convicted.\nand might be punished in the same manner as an accessory before the fact, who, by s. 1 of the statute, might be indicted, tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if he were a principal.\nSir Henri Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau, in his work on the Criminal Code, at p. 28, says in relation to s. 61 (now s. 69) that the section was so framed by the Imperial Commissioners as to put an end to the nice distinctions between accessories before the fact and principals in the second degree \"already practically superseded by chapter 145 Revised Statutes\". The learned author goes on to state that all are now principals in any offence, and punishable as the actual perpetrator of the offence, as it always has been in treason and misdemeanour. He continues:\nThe prosecutor may, at his option, prefer an indictment against the accessories before the fact, and aiders and abettors as principal offenders, whether the party who actually committed the offence is indicted with them or not; R. v. Tracey, 6 Mod. 30. For instance: A. abetted in the commission of a theft by B. The indictment may charge A. and B. jointly or A. or B. alone as guilty of the offence, in the ordinary form, as if they had actually stolen by one and the same act\u2026.\nIn every case where there may be a doubt whether a person be a principal or accessory before the fact, it may be advisable to prefer the indictment against him as a principal, as such an indictment will be sufficient whether it turn out on the evidence that such person was a principal or accessory before the fact, as well as where it is clear that he was either the one or the other but it is uncertain which he was.\nIn Russell on Crime, Tenth Edition, p. 811, the learned author says:\nThe indictment against aiders and abettors may lay the fact to have been done by all, or may charge it as having been done by one and abetted by the rest. Thus where, upon an appeal against several persons for ravishing the appellant's wife, an objection was taken that only one should have been charged as ravishing and the others as accessories, or that there should have been several appeals as the ravishing of one would not be the ravishing of the others, it was answered that if two come to ravish and one by comport of the other does the act, both are principals, and the case proceeded; R. v. Vide, Fitz. Corone, pl. 86.\nIn Archbold's Criminal Pleading, 33rd Ed., p. 1089, the following appears:\n1938. Indictment\nStatement of Offence\nRape\nParticulars of Offence\nA B, on the\nday of\n,in the county of\nhad carnal knowledge of J.N, without her consent.\nThe offence is a felony at common law, but the punishment is statutory. An indictment is good which charges that A committed a rape, and that B was present aiding and abetting him in the commission of the felony; for the party aiding may be charged either as, as he was in law, a principal in the first degree or, as he was in fact, a principal in the second degree; R. v. Crisham, C. & Mar. 187.\nIn the case cited, the indictment stated that\none Peter M'Donough upon one Bridget Lamb did make an assault, and her the said Bridget Lamb violently, feloniously, and against her will did ravish, etc.; and went on to state that the prisoner was present, and feloniously aided and assisted the said Peter M'Donough in the commission of the said felony, contrary to the statute, etc.\nAfter a verdict of guilty on a motion in arrest of judgment it was argued for the prisoner that there being no statutory provisions applicable to persons aiding and abetting in cases of this nature, the indictment was wrongly framed, that he should have been indicted as at common law and the indictment\nshould have charged him as a principal, and stated that he, as well as M'Donough, ravished the prosecutor. It was pointed out that the statute of 9 Geo. 4, c. 31, which declares that every person convicted of the crime of rape should suffer death, made no specific provision as to aiders and abettors, to which Maule J., said:\nThen your objection is, that the offence which has been committed is not stated in the indictment.\nPayne:\nMy objection is, that the person is not charged, as he ought to have been, as a principal.\nMaule J.:\nThere does not appear to me to be any ground for the objection. It has been already decided that, in a case of this description, the party may be charged according to the fact, or indicted as a principal in the first degree.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the English authorities are in accord with the construction which appears to me to be the proper construction of the Code itself.\nFor present purposes I see no difference in principle between the crime of rape and the crime of driving dangerously contrary to s. 285, s-s. (6) of the Criminal Code, where the accused did not personally drive, the actual driving having been done by another. This was the situation in Rex. v. Halmo [13].\nIn that case the accused was charged with aiding and abetting one Mayville to drive contrary to the statute and it was contended (conversely to the contention in the case at bar) that he\nshould have been charged directly with reckless or dangerous driving, even if his part in it was only to aid, abet, counsel or procure another\u2026\nRobertson C.J.O., in refusing to give effect to the objection, said, at p. 101:\nIt was unnecessary to allege in the charge that appellant \"did aid, abet, counsel or procure Wilfrid Mayville\", for by force of sec. 69 it would have been sufficient, and perhaps, better pleading, to charge him simply with the offence that Mayville in fact committed.\nIn my opinion this is a correct statement of the law. Whether an indictment framed as in the case at bar would be appropriate in a case where a husband has assisted another in ravishing the wife of the former need not, in my opinion, be considered. There is nothing inappropriate in the indictment in the case at bar. In my opinion also, as the present charge was fully authorized by the Code, the decision of this court in Brodie v. The King [14], where it was considered that the indictment there in question was unauthorized, has no application.\nNo argument was advanced by the respondent based in any way upon evidence given as to the latter having assisted any other or others than Kie Singh in ravishing the woman named in the indictment. I decline, therefore, to consider whether the conviction was open to objection on such a ground, without any argument as to the applicability of such decisions as Reg. v. Giddins [15] and The King v. Michaud [16], as well as our jurisdiction under s. 1014 of the Code.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014In my opinion, the law in England and in Canada, as of the time at which the Criminal Code came into force on July 1, 1893, is correctly stated in the 31st Edition of Archbold's Criminal Pleading and Practice at p. 1499, where it is said that in all felonies in which the punishment of principals in the first degree and of principals in the second degree is the same, the indictment may charge all who are present and abet the fact as principals in the first degree, provided the offence permits of a participation. The decision in Mackalley's Case [17], the reference in Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, Vol. 2, p. 316, s. 64, and the decision of Blackburn L.J. in Reg. v. Ram [18], appear to me to support the author's statement.\nThe question to be determined in this appeal is whether this was changed by the provisions of s. 611 of the Code (55-56 Vict., c. 29) which appeared as s. 852 of the Code prior to its repeal and reenactment in 1955.\nIt is to be noted that in Brodie's Case [19],, the concluding paragraph of the reasons of the Court delivered by Rinfret J. (as he then was) made it clear that the decision was \"strictly limited to the point's in issue\" in that matter and that, on the face of it, the indictment considered was defective in that it charged that the accused were parties to \"a seditious conspiracy in conspiring together\", without saying what they conspired to do. The head note correctly states the only point decided in these terms: \"Although conspiracy to commit a crime, being in itself an indictable offence, may be charged alone in an indictment and independently of the crime conspired to be committed, it is nevertheless necessary that a count charging conspiracy alone, without the setting out of any overt act, should describe it in such a way as to contain in substance the fundamental ingredients of the particular agreement which is charged.\" Once it is appreciated that this was the point for decision, it appears to me to be clear that the reasons delivered do not touch the present matter.\nWith great respect, the judgments of the majority in the Court of Appeal appear to me to overlook the fact that s-ss. (2) and (3) of s. 852 are to be considered separately since they state alternative methods in which an indictment may be phrased. It appears to me to be error to graft on to the provisions of s-s. 3 the concluding words of s-s. 2. Once this is appreciated, I think that the proper conclusion in the present matter is made clear. The indictment against Harder was in the language of s. 298. The offence there described might, indeed, be committed in more than one manner, by virtue of the provisions of s. 69 of the Code. Ignorance of this, if he was indeed ignorant, would not assist the accused. The fact would be immediately made known to him, in any event, when, as in the present matter, he retained counsel. In my opinion, when a person has abetted another to commit the offence of rape, it is a literal compliance with the requirements of s-s. 3 to charge him of the offence as a principal, just as it was prior to the first enactment of the Criminal Code. If, as I think it must be conceded, the three Indians and Harder had been charged together in one indictment of the offence of rape, as was done in the case of Ram, the indictment could not have been impeached by Harder, I am unable, with respect for differing opinions, to appreciate why he may do so when he is charged alone.\nThe question is not whether, in fact, the form of the indictment misled the accused as to the offence with which he was charged, since there was a preliminary hearing and a statement made by Crown counsel at the commencement of the trial in the Assizes as to the nature of the case of the Crown which precluded the possibility of his being misled. I merely mention the matter to say that it cannot be suggested that, in this respect, the accused did not have a fair trial. The question as to whether the indictment was misleading in this sense is quite aside from the point, which is limited to the question as to whether the indictment complied in strictness with the requirements of s. 852(3), read in conjunction with s. 855 (f).\nAs to the point that the indictment should be held bad for uncertainty since it did not specify whether it was the rape committed by Kie Singh or that by Jumbo Singh with which he was charged, no such objection was raised at the trial nor presumably argued before the Court of Appeal since no mention is made of it in any of the judgments delivered. Nor was the matter mentioned in the factum of the respondent or in the argument in this Court. If the point had been argued in the Court of Appeal or in this Court, it would have been necessary to consider the application of s. 1014(2). In the circumstances, I express no opinion upon the point.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting) :\u2014The respondent was tried before Wilson J. and a jury and, on December 5, 1954, was convicted on the following charge:\u2014\nTHAT at or near Newton, in the Municipality of Surrey, in the County and Province aforesaid, on the twenty-third day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-four, he the said KENNETH HARDER, a man, did have carnal knowledge of Vera Borushko, a woman who was not his wife, without her consent, against the form of the Statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen her Crown and Dignity.\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia by the judgment of the majority (O'Halloran, Sidney Smith and Davey JJ.A.) allowed the respondent's appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a verdict of acquittal to be entered. The Attorney General now appeals to this Court on the question of law on which Robertson and Bird JJ.A. dissented which is stated in the following words in the formal judgment of the Court:\u2014\nThat the indictment charging the accused as a principal was sufficient notwithstanding that it did not aver that the accused aided and abetted Kie Singh to assault the woman criminally. We were informed by counsel that the appeal was argued in the Court of Appeal without a transcription of the evidence, the record before that Court consisting of the formal charge against the respondent, quoted above, and the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury. The complete record of the proceedings at the trial was however placed before us.\nIn opening the case to the jury counsel for the Crown said in part:\u2014\nHis Lordship will direct you insofar as the law is concerned, but I think his Lordship might forgive me at this time if I point out to you that it is necessary for the Crown to prove, firstly, that this offence took place within the Municipality of Surrey, or in any event within the jurisdiction of this court; secondly, that this man who stands before you in the prisoner's dock is not the husband of the complainant Vera Borushko; and, thirdly, that the circumstances under which this offence is alleged to have taken place constitute in law the offence of rape.\nNow, in that regard, I think I should at this point advise you that the Crown will not attempt to prove that this accused actually had sexual intercourse with the complainant Vera Borushko. The Crown, however, will bring evidence to show that he in concert with another man, held the complainant, the girl, while others had sexual intercourse with her \u2026In that regard, his Lordship will instruct you on the law applicable to those particular circumstances.\nIt is not necessary to refer to the evidence in any detail. It is sufficient to say that the complainant deposed that the respondent did not himself have sexual intercourse with her or make any attempt to do so but that on the day stated in the charge he, Jumbo Singh and Puga Singh held her by force while Kie Singh had intercourse with her without her consent and that shortly thereafter the respondent, Kie Singh and Puga Singh held her by force while Jumbo Singh had intercourse with her without her consent.\nIt is obvious that if the facts were as testified by the complainant each of the four named men could on proper charges have been found guilty of the rape which was committed personally by Kie Singh and also of the rape committed personally by Jumbo Singh. The question before us is whether on this evidence the respondent could lawfully be convicted on the charge as laid.\nI do not find it necessary to review the numerous authorities cited to us in which ss. 852 and 853 and the related sections of the Criminal Code have been discussed as it is my opinion that the majority of the Court of Appeal were right in holding that the charge in the case at bar did not fulfil the minimum requirements of those sections as to what a count in an indictment must contain.\nIn speaking of s. 852 and of the manner in which an offence must be specified in a count, Rinfret J., as he then was, giving the unanimous judgment of the Court in Brodie v. The King [20], said:\nThe statement must contain the allegations of matter \"essential to be proved,\" and must be in \"words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged.\" Those are the very words of the section; and they were put there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one of its main objects being that the accused may have a fair trial and consequently that the indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable precision the act or acts with which he is charged, in order that he may be advised of the particular offence alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.\nIn Rex v. Bainbridge [21], the judgments stress the necessity that the indictment \"shall in itself reasonably identify not only the nature of the crime charged, but the act or transaction forming the basis of the crime named\" and assign as the two main reasons for this requirement, (i) that the accused may properly prepare for his trial and (ii) that he shall be able to plead autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, as the case may be, if he is again charged. The Bainbridge case was approved by this Court in Brodie v. The King (supra).\nIn my opinion the wording of the charge in the case at bar not only failed to inform the accused of the case which the Crown proposed to prove against him but was actually misleading. As it was put by Sidney Smith J.A., \"no accused man on reading its language charging him with having carnal knowledge of a woman could possibly know that it did not mean that at all\u2014that what it meant to charge against him was assisting another man so that such other man could have such carnal knowledge.\"\nIt may be mentioned in passing, as was pointed out by counsel for the respondent, that if the charge was intended to be directed to the fact that the accused had assisted another to rape the complainant the allegation that the accused was a man was irrelevant (see R. v. Ram and Ram [22]) as was also the allegation that the complainant was not his wife (see Rex v. Audley [23]). The bare minimum of information which the charge should have contained to enable the accused to know what he had to meet was a statement that Kie Singh (or Jumbo Singh) had raped the complainant and that the accused had done an act for the purpose of aiding him to do so. The language actually used to describe the offence imports personal commission by the appellant of the physical act of intercourse and it is impossible to read it as referring to a rape committed by some other individual with the assistance of the appellant. Adopting the words of Davey J.A., \"because it charged an offence consisting of a single, specific and personal act of intercourse by the appellant on the woman, it excluded by such specification an act of intercourse had by another person which would also have constituted the crime of rape by the appellant if he had assisted in it within the meaning of Sec. 69.\"\nThe rapes of which the complainant's evidence, if believed, shewed the respondent to be guilty were (a) that committed by Kie Singh, and (b) that committed by Jumbo Singh. The rape with which he was charged was neither of these; it was one committed by himself personally and there was no evidence of any such rape.\nIt is suggested that the reasoning set out above fails to give effect to the provision in s. 852 (3) of the Criminal Code that \"such statement may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an indictable offence\"; but the answer to this suggestion is that the offence of which the evidence of the complainant indicated that the appellant was guilty is one created not by sections 298 and 299 simpliciter but by the combined effect of those sections and s. 69 (1) (b)\u2014\"Everyone is a party to and guilty of an offence who \u2026does an act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence.\" The words of s. 298 used alone, as they were in the charge in the case at bar, are inapt to describe the offence disclosed in the evidence.\nHowever it may be in other cases, I am of opinion that where, as for example in incest or rape, the criminality of an act depends on the existence or non-existence of a particular relationship between the individual personally committing the act and another person it is essential that the charge should specify whether the accused did the alleged act personally (in which case it is necessary to prove whether such relationship existed between the accused and the person with or upon whom the offence was committed) or merely aided another to commit it (in which case it is necessary to prove whether such relationship existed between the person aided and the person with or upon whom the offence was committed).\nWe were referred to no reported case and I have found none, in which the charge against an accused who had not personally ravished a woman but had assisted another to do so did not contain a statement that one other than the accused had done the act and the accused had assisted in it\nI am unable to regard the case of R. v. Folkes and Ludds [24], referred to by my brother Rand as requiring a decision contrary to that of the majority of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. The report, which is very brief, shews that in the first count Folkes was charged with having personally ravished the complainant and that there was ample evidence that he had done so. The report does not contain any statement of the reasons given by the Judges but simply states their conclusion that the conviction was good on the first count. It may well be that the Judges treated the general verdict of guilty against Folkes as a verdict of guilty against him on each count. As was said by Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathem [25]:\n\u2026a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.\nWhile what I have said above is, in my opinion, sufficient to dispose of the appeal I wish to deal with another point which, for the obvious reason that the evidence was not before them, was not referred to in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. In charging the jury the learned trial judge put the case to them as if the charge were that the accused had assisted Kie Singh to rape the complainant. In fact, as is set out above, the complainant had deposed to the commission of two separate crimes of both of which, on her evidence, the accused was guilty (i) the rape by Kie Singh and (ii) the rape by Jumbo Singh. If it was intended to charge him with one only of these crimes, then it is not possible to say with which of the two he was charged and the charge is bad for uncertainty. If it was intended to charge him with both of these crimes then the charge is bad, for these two separate and distinct crimes could not both be charged in one count, although they might have been charged in separate counts in the same indictment. If it was intended to charge the accused not with both but only with one or the other of these two crimes the charge is bad, for it is an elementary principle that two separate and distinct offences must not be charged in the alternative in one count as the accused cannot then know with certainty with what he is charged or of what he is convicted or acquitted, as the case may be, and may be prevented on a future occasion from pleading autrefois convict or autrefois acquit.\nIt is impossible to regard the two rapes above referred to as other than separate and distinct offences. If the accused had been charged with the rape committed by Kie Singh in words making it clear that what was alleged against him was that he had assisted Kie Singh who personally committed the offence and been convicted on such charge, it could not be suggested that if he was thereafter charged in proper words with the rape committed by Jumbo Singh he could successfully plead autrefois convict.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the disposition of the appeal made by the majority in the Court of Appeal was right and I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed; conviction restored.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], quashing an appeal by an informant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario in a stated case.\nW.C.Bowman, Q.C. for the appellant.\nJ. Sedgwick, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The respondent company was, in February 1954, convicted by a magistrate of an offence under the Public Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 304; and this conviction, having been questioned on a stated case, was quashed by Stewart J. in chambers. Thereupon, the informant obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario which followed its recent decisions in Regina ex rel. Morrison v. Canadian Acme Screw and Gear Limited[2], and Regina ex rel. Irwin v. Duesling[3], and dismissed the appeal1 Hence the appeal to this Court, leave being granted under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, on the following question of law:\u2014\nDid the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by an informant from the judgment of a Justice of the Supreme Court hearing an appeal by way of stated case in a summary conviction matter?\nThe prosecution was taken under the provisions of the Ontario Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 379, s. 3(1) of which enacts:\u2014\nExcept where inconsistent with this Act, Part XV and sections 1028, 1029, 1035A, 1054, 1055, 1121, 1124, 1125, 1131 and 1142 of the Criminal Code (Canada) as amended or re-enacted from time to time, shall apply mutatis mutandis to every case to which this Act applies as if the provisions thereof were enacted in and formed part of this Act.\nUnder Part XV of the Criminal Code, a decision rendered in first instance may be questioned by means of a trial de novo (s. 749 to s. 761), as was the situation in the cases above referred to, or by means of a stated case (s. 761 to s. 769A), as in the present instance; and the decision rendered, upon either one of such modes of appeal may itself be brought for revision under section 769A(1) providing:\u2014\n(1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal, as defined in s. 1012 against any decision of the Court under the provisions of s. 752 or s. 765 with leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge thereof, may be taken on any ground which involves a question of law alone. (1948, ch. 39, s. 34).\n(2) The provisions of sections 1012 to 1021, inclusive, shall mutatis mutandis insofar as the same are applicable, apply to an appeal under this section. (1948, ch. 39, s. 34).\n(3) The decision of the Court of Appeal shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as if it had been made by a Justice at the hearing. (1948, ch. 39, s. 34)\nNo one disputes that a right of appeal, particularly against an acquittal, must be given in clear, express and unambiguous language. The only issue, in the premises, is whether, contrary to what was decided in the Court below, the provisions of s. 769A meet with this requirement.\nSub-section (1). As is the case under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, and as was also the case in the much more general terms of the enactment considered, in the House of Lords, in Cox v. Hakes[4], the formula, here adopted by Parliament to give a right to appeal against any of the decisions of the nature therein specified, says nothing in terms as to whom this new right is given. Such general language is not apt, per se, to justify the inference of any limitation such as the one contended for by respondent. On the contrary and evidently because no limitation was intended, nothing was said. Nothing more needed to be said to vest the \u201cprosecutor or complainant as well as the defendant\u201d with this new right of appeal when, under the then state of the law, they were equally entitled by s. 749 or s. 761 to seek, in an appeal against the judgment of a magistrate, a decision under s. 752 or s. 765, henceforth made appealable under sub-section (1) of section 769A. The appeal is clearly against the decision, whatever it may be and whoever in the case may have cause to complain.\nSub-section (2). To give effect to, but not to affect, this new right of appeal, comprehensively stated in1, Parliament adopted by reference the procedure already established under sections 1012 to 1021 inclusive, \u201cmutatis mutandis insofar as applicable\u201d. The latter expressions are not in any way related to the right of appeal fully stated in[5], but only to the method by which such right may be perfected. They imply an obligation to make, to such of the provisions of sections 1012 to 1021 inclusive as may be apt to effectuate the true purpose of the section, such changes\u2014material as they may be\u2014not inconsistent with the provisions of the section. It appears that in considering this particular sub-section, the Court below formed the view that section 769A, read together with s. 1013(4), does not provide for an appeal by the informant against an acquittal. Section 1013(4) gives to the Attorney-General\u2014and not to \u201cthe prosecutor or complainant\u201d, whose status as party to the case has long been lost at that stage of the procedure by indictment\u2014a right to appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence. With deference, I cannot agree with these views. In reaching them, no sufficient account appears to have been taken of the fact that the right of appeal under s. 769A is fully stated under sub\u2011section (1) and unqualified by sub-section (2); and, in the result, proper and full effect was not given to the expressions \u201cmutatis mutandis and insofar as applicable\u201d. Properly and fully implemented, these expressions are as apt to justify, in s. 1013(4), a substitution of the words \u201cthe prosecutor or complainant\u201d to the words \u201cthe Attorney-General\u201d as they are recognized to be, for the substitution of the word \u201coffence\u201d simpliciter to the words \u201cindictable offence\u201d appearing in the same provision. As stated, in part, by Roach J.A. when granting leave to appeal in Regina ex rel. Morrison v. Canadian Acme Screw and Gear Limited5:\n\u2026where the parties to the appeal\u2026 are the complainant and the accused, the complainant, as well as the accused, has a further right of appeal, by leave, to the Court of Appeal, and subs. 2 of s. 769A has not the effect of preserving that right of the accused and destroying the otherwise equal right of the complainant.\nSub-section (3). The sub-section states the effect of the decision rendered in an appeal under s. 769A and provides for the method of its enforcement. Its language has no bearing upon the construction of sub-section (1) wherein the right of appeal is comprehensively established. For this reason, the decision in Cox v. Hakes (supra), while of assistance insofar as general principles are concerned, has no application here. The only question of law upon which leave was granted to this Court must be affirmatively answered. The appeal should be allowed and the case returned for consideration to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by:-\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The respondent was convicted of operating a public commercial vehicle without a licence contrary to the Public Commercial Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 304, s. 2(1). This conviction was made in summary proceedings under the provisions of the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 379. Section 3, s-s. (1) of this statute provides that, except where inconsistent with the statute, Part XV and certain named sections of the Criminal Code shall apply mutatis mutandis. S-s. (2) provides that where a case is stated under Part XV of the Criminal Code, it shall be heard and determined by a judge of the Supreme Court in chambers.\nStewart J., who heard the appeal by way of stated case, allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction. The appellant, having obtained leave, launched an appeal to the Court of Appeal[6] under s. 769A of the Criminal Code enacted by 1948, c. 39, s. 34, Canada. That court, however, quashed the appeal upon the ground that the section did not give any right of appeal to a private prosecutor such as the appellant.\nIn this decision the court followed its earlier decisions in Regina ex rel. Morrison v. Canadian Acme Screw and Gear, Limited[7] and Regina ex rel. Irwin v. Duesling[8], the latter having been based upon the former. The present appeal is in reality, therefore, an appeal from the decision in Morrison\u2019s case. Before considering that decision, it will be convenient to consider the relevant provisions of Part XV of the Criminal Code before the new Code of 1955.\nUpon its conviction two remedies by way of appeal were open to the respondent, one under s. 749 to the County Court Judge, and the other, which was in fact followed, by way of stated case to a judge of the Supreme Court under s. 761. The right of appeal given by s. 749 is expressly conferred upon\nany person who thinks himself aggrieved by any such conviction or order or dismissal, the prosecutor or complainant, as well as the defendant.\nAgain, in the case of s. 761, \u201cany person aggrieved, the prosecutor or complainant as well as the defendant\u201d may appeal.\nIn the case of an appeal under s. 749, it is provided by s. 754 that the judge \u201cmay confirm, reverse or modify the decision of such justice, or may make such other conviction or order in the matter as the court thinks just.\u201d In the case of an appeal by way of stated case under s. 761, it is provided by s. 765 that the court appealed to \u201cshall hear and determine the question or questions of law arising thereon, and shall thereupon affirm, reverse or modify the conviction, order or determination in respect of which the case has been stated.\u201d The section also provided that any order so made \u201cshall be final and conclusive upon all parties.\u201d\nBy sections 31 and 32 of the amending statute of 1948, s-s. (1) of s. 752 and s-s. (1) of s. 765 were amended to bring them into accord with the new s. 769A, which was enacted by s. 34, s-s. (1) reading as follows:\n769A. (1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal, as defined in section one thousand and twelve, against any decision of the court under the provisions of section seven hundred and fifty-two or section seven hundred and sixty-five with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof may be taken on any ground which involves a question of law alone.\nAs the right of appeal thus given is against any decision made under s. 752 or s. 765, such right is plainly conferred upon the person who was unsuccessful below, whether he was a person convicted or the complainant.\nIn Morrison\u2019s case, Schroeder J.A., who delivered the judgment on behalf of the court, would appear to have based his decision upon what he considered to be the effect of s-s. (2) of s. 769A, which reads as follows:\n(2) The provisions of sections one thousand and twelve to one thousand and twenty\u2011one, inclusive, shall mutatis mutandis in so far as the same are applicable, apply to an appeal under this section.\nAfter pointing out that, historically, appeals in criminal cases had long been confined to convicted persons and to the well settled principle of statutory construction that in order to establish any other right of appeal it is necessary to find clear and unambiguous language to that effect, the learned judge considered that, as s. 1013 (1) is expressly limited to an appeal by a convicted person and that the only right of appeal against an acquittal given by s-s. (4) is limited to a provincial Attorney-General, the learned judge concluded that he must construe s. 769A as providing no appeal in favour of a private prosecutor.\nThe view of the learned judge sufficiently appears from the following extract from his judgment, where, at p. 521, he deals with the contrary view:\nTo give effect to this contention would be to ignore the fact that s. 1013 is incorporated by reference into s. 769A, and although other sections so incorporated are procedural, s. 1013 is clearly substantive in character. It provides who shall have a right of appeal in the case of an indictable offence, and by incorporating it into s. 769A it provides who shall have the right of appeal by leave conferred by s. 769A. The last mentioned section does not.\nWhile no doubt the provisions of s. 1013 are mutatis mutandis incorporated into s. 769A, such incorporation is to be, however, only \u201cin so far as the same are applicable\u201d and it cannot be said that any provisions of ss. 1012 to 1021 can be considered \u201capplicable\u201d if to apply them would contradict the right of appeal expressly given by s-s. (1).\nIn my opinion, therefore, the Court of Appeal is clothed with jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the character of that here in question. This accords with the view expressed by Roach J. on the application for leave to appeal in Morrison\u2019s case[9].\nI would allow the appeal and remit the matter to the Court of Appeal for a decision upon the merits.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The respondent was convicted by a magistrate at Chatham, Ont. of a charge of operating a public commercial vehicle without a licence, contrary to the provisions of the Public Commercial Vehicles Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 304, s. 2(1)).\nThe Summary Convictions Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 379) provides by s. 3 that, except where inconsistent with that Act, Part XV of the Criminal Code, as amended or reenacted from time to time, shall apply mutatis mutandis to every case to which the Act applies as if the provisions thereof were enacted in and formed part of it.\nUpon the application of the respondent, the magistrate, after reciting the terms of the conviction, stated the following question for the opinion of a judge of the Supreme Court:\u2014\nOn the facts as stated, was I right in holding that the defendant was not, as a matter of law, exempted from the provisions of The Public Commercial Vehicles Act by reason of the fact that it, being a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian Breweries Ltd., carried goods only for other wholly owned subsidiaries of Canadian Breweries Ltd.?\nThe stated case was heard by Stewart J. who answered the question propounded in the negative and quashed the conviction, acquitted the respondent of the charge and directed that the fine imposed be remitted.\nFrom this decision the present appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, relying upon the provisions of s. 769A of the Criminal Code. I refer throughout to the sections of the Code in force prior to April 1, 1955. That appeal was quashed by a judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by the Chief Justice of Ontario on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.\nBy special leave of this court, the present appeal was brought to determine the following question:\u2014\nDid the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by an informant from the judgment of a Justice of the Supreme Court hearing an appeal by way of stated case in a summary conviction matter?\nIn Reg. ex rel Morrison v. Canadian Acme Screw and Gear Ltd.[10], the Court of Appeal of Ontario quashed an appeal taken to that court from the judgment of a county court judge on an appeal from a magistrate under Part XV of the Code which resulted in the acquittal of the accused. That decision was followed by the same court in Reg. ex rel Irwin v. Duesling[11]. While the appeal in the present matter was taken from a judgment of a judge of the Supreme Court upon a stated case, the learned Chief Justice of Ontario was of the opinion that there was no distinction in the principles to be applied. The Criminal Code provides alternative means whereby a conviction such as this under the Summary Convictions Act may be questioned. S. 749 provides in the Province of Ontario for an appeal to the County Court from a conviction or an order dismissing an information or complaint by:\u2014\nany person who thinks himself aggrieved by any such conviction or order or dismissal, the prosecutor or complainant as well as the defendant.\nS. 761 under which the case was stated in the present matter provides that:\u2014\nany person aggrieved, the prosecutor or complainant as well as the defendant who desires to question a conviction, order, determination or other proceeding of a justice under this Part on the ground that it is erroneous in point of law\nmay apply to such justice to state a case, setting forth the facts and the grounds on which the proceeding is questioned.\nS. 769A, so far as it need be considered, reads:\u2014\n(1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal, as defined in section one thousand and twelve, against any decision of the court under the provisions of section seven hundred and fifty-two or section seven hundred and sixty-five with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof may be taken on any ground which involves a question of law alone.\n(2) The provisions of sections one thousand and twelve to one thousand and twenty\u2011one, inclusive, shall mutatis mutandis in so far as the same are applicable, apply to an appeal under this section.\nThis section, enacted in 1948 (c. 39, s. 34), replaced s. 752A, enacted in 1947, which permitted a further appeal in appeals arising under ss. 749 et seq. but did not deal with decisions upon stated cases.\nUnlike s. 749, which permits in terms an appeal either from a conviction or an order dismissing an information, and s. 761, which permits either the prosecutor or complainant as well as the defendant who desire to question a conviction, order, determination or other proceeding under Part XV, to apply to the Justice to state a case, s. 769A merely says that an appeal to the Court of Appeal against any decision of the court may be taken.\nIt is an elementary principle of the law that an acquittal by a court of competent jurisdiction, acting within its jurisdiction, cannot as a rule be questioned and brought before any other court. In Benson v. Northern Ireland Road Transport Board[12], Lord Simon said that very clear statutory language by way of exception to the general rule would be required to establish a right of appeal from a decision dismissing a criminal charge. The question to be determined is whether s. 769A fulfils these requirements.\nWhen the Criminal Code was first enacted in 1892, it provided certain exceptions to the general rule above referred to. Ss. 879 and 900 of the Code, as then enacted, permitted the propriety of an acquittal to be questioned, either by an appeal or by a stated case. With amendments which do not affect the present consideration, these sections were enacted as ss. 749 and 761 in the revisions of the statutes of 1906 and 1927. No further appeal lay until the amendments of 1947 and 1948 above referred to.\nIt is not my opinion that the decisions in Benson\u2019s Case or in Cox v. Hakes[13], referred to by Lord Simon, are decisive of the question. If the point was, as in Benson\u2019s Case, whether an appeal lay under a section worded as is the first subsection of s. 759A from a court of first instance such as a magistrate\u2019s court, I think that, on the authority of that case, there could be no appeal from an acquittal. The situation here, however, seems to me to be essentially different. Parliament has, in clear and unmistakable terms, provided for an appeal from an acquittal by s. 749 and for what is in essence an appeal by the provisions of s. 761. The common law rule is abrogated by these sections. The decision of the court whether proceedings are taken under s. 749 or s. 761 may be, inter alia, either to affirm a conviction or to acquit the accused. The appeal provided by s-s. 1 of s. 769A is against any decision of the court: that this includes a decision acquitting the accused appears to me to be perfectly clear. This is, in my view, statutory language which complies with the requirements stated by Lord Simon. It is not the language of s-s. 1 which establishes the exception to the general rule that a man shall not be vexed twice for the same wrong: the exceptions to that rule were already provided for in ss. 749 and 761.\nAs to s-s. 2 of s. 769A, counsel for the Crown contends that this neither adds to or limits the meaning to be assigned to s-s. 1. In Reg. ex rel. Irwin v. Duesling[14], Pickup C.J.O., referring to this subsection, said that he did not consider that s-s. 4 of s. 1013 could be said to be applicable to a summary conviction proceeding at the instance of a private prosecutor. With this I respectfully agree. None of the other sections of the Code referred to in s-s. 2 can affect the matter to be decided here.\nI would allow this appeal.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.P.

The application of the appellant to set aside the judgment was dismissed by a judge of the County Court and by a majority in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe signing of judgments by the Clerk on liquidated demands authorized by Order 13 rule 3. of the rules of the Supreme Court, which provides that in default of appearance \"the plaintiff may enter final judgment\" for the amount claimed, has been for at least since 1915 the procedure of the County Court. With these judgments the judge has nothing to do. That practice has been followed throughout the province and it cannot be seriously questioned.\nS. 25 of the County Courts Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 45, implies that the Clerk, although interested in the action, can sign judgment for the amount claimed on a liquidated demand. There is in the statute a deliberate abstention from affecting liquidated demands with the restriction imposed in the case of unliquidated damages. Whatever objection there may be in principle to permitting a solicitor to do such a ministerial act as clerk in his own cause must be taken to have been overridden by other considerations. Furthermore, the views of the provincial courts which should be treated with the utmost respect on such a question was well founded in the case at bar: being compatible with a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language given in the light of the principle involved.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division1, affirming, Hughes J.A. dissenting, the dismissal by the County Court of an application to set aside a default judgment.\nI. Mackin for the appellant.\nJ. F. H. Teed, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal arises out of an application to set aside a judgment entered m the County Court of Saint John, New Brunswick, in default of appearance and defence in an action brought on a liquidated demand. Two grounds are raised: that the clerk of a county court in New Brunswick has no authority to enter a default judgment, and that in the particular case he was disqualified as being solicitor for the plaintiff.\nThe judgments in the County Court and the Appeal Division present the legislative history of the County courts. Prior to 1867 their jurisdiction was, in a measure, exercised by the Inferior Courts of Common Pleas held by the justices of the peace of each county in general sessions; but, in anticipation of the Confederation Act, these courts were, by c. 10 of the statutes of that year, abolished and the present organization established. The act provided for a court in each county to be presided over by a judge having the qualification of barrister of the Supreme Court of not less than seven years' standing, who should hold office during good behaviour. Although each county had its court, the same person might be judge of one or more of them. For each court a clerk was provided who must be an attorney of the Supreme Court and would hold office during pleasure. The sittings were to be held at or near the county court house in the shiretown, at which place, also, the clerk was to maintain an office. There was no residence requirement of the judge. In 1867 the clerical officer of the Supreme Court was the Clerk of the Pleas, an office that goes back into the early-days of the Common Law courts. In Tidd's Practice and Chitty's Archbold's Practice there is an account of the internal practice of those courts down to the present time, which shows the evolution of ministerial functions, in some cases originally performed by or under the direction of the judges but now by officers of the court. In the light of the practice in the Supreme Court of 1867 and the enactment by c. 10, s. 18, that\nEvery Act of Assembly relating to \u2026 practice, proceedings and evidence or any other matter or thing whatever connected with the administration of justice in the Supreme Court shall apply to each County Court when not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.\nlanguage in substance continued down to s. 62 of the present Act, the assumption that the office work of the county court should in general be carried on by its officers correspondingly to that in the Supreme Court was inevitable and warranted; and it has been in the presence of this uniform understanding and practice that the county court legislation has been confirmed ever since.\nThis originating statute, with various modifications, appears now as c. 45, R.S.N.B. 1952. From the beginning it was obvious that the work of the clerk would require only part of his time and the statute recognizes his right to practice in his own as well as in any other court. In the former he is, ordinarily, the prosecutor in criminal matters, although he may defend, and he may act for either party in civil matters.\nCertain of his duties are mentioned: he is to provide a seal and necessary books for the records of the court; to sign and seal all writs; to file all writs and papers; to enter in the books of record all causes, rules and orders, and a minute of every judgment rendered in the court, a copy of the latter certified by him being admissible as evidence in all courts of the province. He is to tax costs, but when solicitor or party, the bill is to be taxed by the judge. By s. 25, if not interested in the action, he may make orders perfecting the service of a writ of summons, and may \"assess damages in all personal actions of debt, covenant or assumpsit where there is judgment by default\", and make and sign in such cases the assessment docket. Default judgments in the Inferior Courts of Common Pleas were to be entered at the next succeeding terms and the court was to \"assess the damages as has been heretofore accustomed\" : 35 Geo. III, c. 2, s. 6. Judgments given in all causes determined in a summary way were to be entered in the minutes of the court by the presiding justice. By s. 15 of the act of 1867 where the defendant failed to enter an appearance and plea within the time prescribed, the judgment could be entered against him and twenty days thereafter the judge was to assess the damages and the clerk sign final judgment for the sum assessed and costs. This provision was continued, with the time reduced to ten days, until 1915. By c. 25 of the statutes of that year, s. 41 of c. 116, C.S.N.B. 1903 was amended to the following form:\n41. In all actions in the said Court, the statement of claim, conforming in substance to that in use in the Supreme Court in like cases, shall be inserted in, or endorsed upon, the writ, and a copy thereof with a copy of the particulars of the plaintiff's demand in cases where, by the practice of the Supreme Court, the defendant would be entitled thereto, shall be served on him, and he shall, within ten days thereafter enter an appearance in the said action and file a statement of defence conforming in substance to that in use in the Supreme Court in like cases, and give a copy thereof to the plaintiff or his solicitor. The rules of pleading of the Supreme Court shall apply to County Courts, but there shall be no summons or order for directions in any action. Demurrer is hereby abolished and the rules for proceedings in lieu of demurrer shall apply. Each party shall be entitled to ten days for each step in pleading, but the Judge may enlarge the time.\nThis language omits the following words contained in c. 116,\nand in case the defendant shall fail to enter his appearance and plead within the time aforesaid, then judgment by default may be entered against him in the said cause, and in ten days thereafter the Judge may assess the damages and the Clerk sign final judgment for the sum assessed and costs to be taxed.\nThe Judicature Act with its rules had been adopted in 1909 following closely the law and practice in England, and its application to the county courts is seen in the new nomenclature of pleading. By the same act, s. 78 R.S. 1903 was amended to read:\n78. All laws of this Province relating to the examination or depositions of witnesses before trial, to proceedings in replevin, to actions by or against executors or administrators, to evidence, to the service of processes, to tenders, to judgments, to interest on judgments, to set off and to counter claims, and for the amendment of the law, in any way as to practice, proceedings, or evidence, or any other matter or thing whatever connected with the administration of justice in the Supreme Court, when applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter, shall apply to each County Court; and the mode of proceeding in all cases not herein provided for shall be according to the present practice of the Supreme Court. The decisions of the Supreme Court shall be binding on the County Courts.\nThe duties and authority of a clerk are to be determined, then, in the light of this legislation, the inherent relation of the office to the inside work of the court, and the special conditions and exigencies of the administration of justice in the province. I think it incontestable that, whatever may have been the law prior to 1915, the signing of judgments on liquidated demands authorized by Order 13 rule 3 of the rules of the Supreme Court, which provides that in default of appearance \"the plaintiff may enter final judgment\" for the amount claimed, is and has since that time been the procedure of the County Court. These judgments are entered by the clerk of the court and with them the judge has nothing to do. This is the practice that has been followed for at least 40 years throughout the province and it cannot, in my opinion, be seriously questioned.\nBut when the clerk is solicitor for the plaintiff, what is the position? The answer is I think given by the implication of s. 25 of the present statute already in part quoted : the clerk, if not interested in the action, is authorized to \"assess damages\" and make and sign the assessment docket. That can only mean, unliquidated damages; there is no assessment on a liquidated demand: the right given the plaintiff in that case is to sign judgment for the amount claimed. If \"assessment\" included a direction of the amount in all cases, the controversy would disappear, but its restriction to unliquidated damages has been assumed by the courts below as well as by counsel on both sides. Dealing as it does with default judgments, those for liquidated demands, probably the greater in number, could not have been overlooked. Yet they are omitted and the restriction confined to unliquidated claims. I can only take this to be a deliberate abstention from affecting them by the qualification mentioned. Were it not so, other language must have been used. The matter of the interested solicitor as clerk is expressly evidenced as being before the mind of the draftsman from the original to the present statute, and the situations dealt with imply that the disabilities of the clerk as solicitor which are declared were intended to be exclusive. Whatever objection there may be in principle to permitting a solicitor to do a ministerial act as clerk in his own cause must be taken to have been overridden by other considerations.\nThat the act is ministerial is I think equally clear. Summarizing the practice in the Supreme Court, the solicitor presents to the clerk of the court two copies of the form of judgment made out as prescribed, accompanied by the writ and affidavit of service. The clerk files one copy properly stamped and returns the other, marked, to the solicitor. No judgment or discretion of any sort is called for. In the assessment of damages judicial power is exercised and the contrast in character between that and the filing and entering of what the rule declares the plaintiff entitled to is patent.\nOn such a question the utmost respect should be paid to the views of the provincial courts; they know the local conditions and how the actual practice has worked out; and only when it is clear that those views are incompatible with any reasonable interpretation of the statutory language given in the light of the principle involved, should they be rejected. So far from that, they appear to me to be well founded and should be maintained.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Ian P. Mackin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Teed & Teed.\n1 [1955] 4 D.L.R. 636.\n",

It is not disputed that the driver was negligent. The respondent R. was an employee of the company and authorized to drive the truck, to keep it at his house overnight and there was no objection to his using it for purposes of his own in the evenings. On the night of the accident, at the conclusion of a party held at R.\u2019s home, R. permitted O., another employee, to use the truck to drive home. O. gave O\u2019D. a lift to O.\u2019s house, where they parted company. O. went into his house, leaving the truck outside with the keys either on the seat or above the sun-visor. He gave no permission to O\u2019D. to take the truck and had no intimation that he would do so. R. at no time gave O\u2019D. any permission to drive the truck.\nIn the course of the trial, the fact of insurance was voluntarily disclosed by a witness for the respondent company. The trial judge discharged the jury and gave judgment against O\u2019D. and dismissed the action as against the other respondents. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but granted special leave to appeal to this Court for a decision as to whether in the circumstances it had been proper exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion to try the issues without a jury against the will of the appellant.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nNot only was the decision of the trial judge on the question of liability right, but it would have been impossible for any properly instructed jury acting reasonably to have come to a different conclusion.\nThe right to trial by jury is a substantive right of great importance of which a party ought not to be deprived except for cogent reasons. But a new trial should not be directed by reason of a trial judge deciding to discharge the jury and complete the trial himself, even if the appeal court were satisfied that the trial judge was wrong in law, if the court were also satisfied that any jury acting reasonably must inevitably have reached the same result as did the trial judge.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at trial.\nH.G. Steen, Q.C. for the appellant.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C. and K.H. MacDiarmid for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from a judgment of that Court dismissing an appeal from a judgment of His Honour Judge Forsyth, who had awarded the appellant judgment for $656.73 against the defendant O\u2019Dwyer and dismissed the action as against the other respondents. O\u2019Dwyer did not defend the action and did not appeal from the judgment given against him.\nThere is little, if any, conflict in the evidence and the relevant facts may be briefly stated. About 9 p.m. on November 30, 1951, the appellant\u2019s automobile was parked on a street in Toronto when a truck, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe truck\u201d, driven by the defendant O\u2019Dwyer ran into it. It is not disputed that the damages suffered by the appellant amounted to $656.73 or that they were caused by the negligence of O\u2019Dwyer. The issue at the trial was as to the liability of the other defendants. While it was questioned in the pleadings, it was admitted at the trial that the truck was owned by the respondent, Colonial Homes Limited, which was apparently a subsidiary of Lin-Wood Manufacturing Limited; the two companies were under the same management and the witness Lindal was president of both.\nThe respondent Rendall was employed by Lin-Wood; one of his duties was to drive the truck to carry employees of that company from the end of the street-car line to the company\u2019s plant in the morning and to take them back to the street-car line in the afternoon. The appeal was argued on the basis that, in respect of the truck, Rendall was the chauffeur of Colonial Homes Limited within the meaning of s. 50(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.\nThe defendant Oben was employed by Colonial Homes Limited as a salesman. He owned an automobile which he drove from time to time on the company\u2019s business. The defendant O\u2019Dwyer was also employed by Lin-Wood as a nailer; there is no suggestion that he was ever employed as a chauffeur by either company and in fact he had no licence to drive a motor vehicle.\nThe arrangement between Rendall and his employer was that the former should keep the truck at his house over night. On the view of the evidence most favourable to the appellant, no objection was raised to Rendall using the truck for purposes of his own in the evenings, but he had no express authority to loan it to anyone, and he had been warned, as had all other drivers employed by Colonial or Lin-Wood, never to allow anyone but a chauffeur to drive a company vehicle.\nOn the night of the accident the respondent Oben went to Rendall\u2019s home where there was a small social gathering at which those present were drinking beer. The guests included the defendant O\u2019Dwyer. Oben, who had driven to Rendall\u2019s house in his own car, agreed to lend his car for the night to Jack Guest, one of those present; and Rendall, in turn, agreed to loan the truck to Oben for the purpose of driving home, on the understanding that it would be brought back to Kendall\u2019s house early the following morning.\nWhen Oben decided to leave Rendall\u2019s house he offered to give O\u2019Dwyer a lift and drove him to Oben\u2019s house. On arrival at Oben\u2019s house, O\u2019Dwyer said, \u201cI better take a bus home\u201d; he then said good-night and Oben last saw him \u201csaying good-bye and walking away from the truck.\u201d Oben went into his house leaving the truck outside with the keys either on the seat or above the sun-visor. He gave no permission to O\u2019Dwyer to take the truck and had no intimation that he would do so. Rendall at no time gave O\u2019Dwyer any permission to drive the truck.\nThe plaintiff had served a jury notice and the trial of the action commenced before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury. In the course of the examination in chief of Lindal by counsel for the defendants the following appears:\u2014\nQ. And what were his (Rendall\u2019s) instructions as far as loaning the truck was concerned?\nA. He could not loan it, and he was very definitely instructed on that, because of our insurance situation. He could not loan the truck unless he loaned it to another chauffeur, with permission to do so, and he was impressed with that fact, and he was aware of the fact that it had to be another chauffeur.\n* * *\nQ. And what if any instructions were given, by yourself, or to your knowledge were given to Mr. Rendall about the use of the truck after he had delivered the passengers, and picked them up at the end of the car line, if any? A. The instructions were that the car was to go into the garage and stay there over night. And I admit I was aware that he probably took it out, and maybe took it along to the grocery store or something, but I did not worry too much about that, if it was not used for anything that the insurance did not cover.\nIt will be observed that the words which I have italicized in the above answers would indicate to the jury that insurance was carried on the truck. At the conclusion of the evidence the court adjourned for an intermission at 11.35 a.m. and there was a discussion in the judge\u2019s room between him and counsel. On the court resuming the record reads as follows:\u2014\nCOURT RESUMED at 12.05 p.m.\nTHE COURT: Gentlemen of the Jury, during recess I have determined, with the consent of Counsel to take this matter away from you.\nMR. HOLLAND: I would not consent to that, Your Honour.\nTHE COURT: You still think I should proceed, with the Jury?\nMR. MACDAIRMID: I do not think there is any doubt about it.\nTHE COURT: Gentlemen of the Jury, there was some discussion with Counsel on this matter, and there has been some reference to matters in this case that should not have been made to you. Also I think the case is one which should not be left to the Jury to determine. I think it is entirely a matter of law, and a matter which should not be left in your hands. I am therefore taking it away from you, and I will handle the case by myself, and you can go now. You have nothing further to do with the case. You are dismissed till to-morrow morning. (The Jury retires.)\nTHE COURT: Do you wish to proceed now with argument?\nMR. HOLLAND: I understand that my friend is admitting that the truck in question was owned by Colonial Homes Limited, and I ask that my friend acknowledge that for the purposes of the record.\nMR. MACDAIRMID: It is true, Your Honour.\nMR. HOLLAND: Presents argument.\nMR. MACDAIRMID: Presents argument.\nMR. HOLLAND: Presents argument in reply.\nThe learned judge gave judgment at the conclusion of the argument in the manner mentioned in the opening paragraph of these reasons. In the course of his reasons the learned judge says:\u2014\nThere is considerable dispute as to the chain of responsibility in this matter. In fact that is the only question in dispute. Any questions to be decided involve matters of fact and law. Moreover there was some reference to insurance, which might have prejudiced the jury. I therefore took the case from the jury.\nThe question of responsibility in this matter is not so easy to determine. However, I think the facts were that when Oben and O\u2019Dwyer left Rendall\u2019s house, the truck was being driven by Oben, with the consent of Rendall. I think when the truck left Oben\u2019s house the truck was being driven by O\u2019Dwyer, without the consent of Oben. O\u2019Dwyer was intoxicated at the time, and he had no driver\u2019s license, and I do not think that he had any permission to drive the truck at the time of the accident. I think the defendants Colonial Homes Limited, Rendall and Oben, have satisfied the Court that O\u2019Dwyer was driving the truck without their knowledge or consent.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the main grounds of appeal being, (i) that the trial judge should have held that the defendants had failed to satisfy the onus cast upon them by s. 50(1) of the Highway Traffic Act; and (ii) that the learned trial judge erred in law in taking the case from the jury. The appeal was dismissed, the unanimous judgment of the Court being delivered by Laidlaw J.A. at the conclusion of the argument.\nIn giving the reasons of the Court for granting special leave to appeal Pickup C.J.O. says in part:\u2014\nAmong the questions which counsel for the plaintiff desires to be submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada is the question as to whether in the facts of this case, where one of the defendants voluntarily disclosed the fact that he was insured, it was a proper exercise of the judicial discretion vested in the trial Judge to proceed to try the issues involved without a jury against the will of the plaintiff. This Court is of the opinion that this question is one that ought to be submitted to the Supreme Court for decision and leave to appeal is therefore granted.\nIn the view that I take of the whole case it becomes unnecessary to decide the question whether the learned trial judge erred in dispensing with the jury and whether, if he did so err, the circumstances are such as to warrant interference by an appellate court. The reason for this is that, in my opinion, not only is the decision of the learned trial judge on the question of liability right, but it would have been impossible for any properly instructed jury acting reasonably to have come to a different conclusion.\nCounsel for the appellant argues that under s. 50(1) of the Highway Traffic Act the onus of proving that at the moment of the collision the truck was in the possession of someone other than the owner or its chauffeur, was upon the respondent Colonial Homes Limited, that the jury would have been free to disbelieve all the evidence in the record, although uncontradicted, bearing on that question and to find that this onus had not been satisfied and could therefore have held that O\u2019Dwyer, at the time of the accident, had possession of the truck with the consent of the respondent Colonial Homes Limited. It appears to me that such a finding would be contrary to all the direct evidence particularly that of Lindal, Rendall and Oben none of which was shaken on cross-examination; and that it would be inconsistent with all the circumstances disclosed in the evidence.\nAs an alternative, counsel for the appellant submits that the jury might have found that at the moment of the accident the truck was in the possession of Rendall, the chauffeur of the owner. The evidence makes it clear, however, not only that Rendall had not consented to O\u2019Dwyer driving the truck but that he had no knowledge or reason to suppose that O\u2019Dwyer would do so. A finding that the truck was at the moment of the collision in the possession of anyone other than O\u2019Dwyer would be in direct conflict with the judgment of this Court in Marsh v. Kulchar[1].\nThis Court has more than once affirmed that the right to trial by jury is a substantive right of great importance of which a party ought not to be deprived except for cogent reasons; but I cannot think that a new trial should be directed by reason of a trial judge deciding to discharge the jury and complete the trial himself, even if the appellate court was satisfied that the course followed by the trial judge was wrong in law, if the court were also satisfied that any jury acting reasonably must inevitably have reached the same result as did the trial judge.\nSince, in my view, if the jury had found for the appellant the Court of Appeal must have set aside their verdict it is unnecessary to express an opinion as to whether the learned trial judge was right in discharging the jury.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hughes, Agar, Amys, Steen & Bassel.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Timmins & MacDiarmid.\n[1] [1952] 1 S.C.R. 330.\n",

A petition for a receiving order against the company was filed on Nov. 17, 1948, but the proceedings on it were suspended while the litigation which was started some two weeks later was proceeded with. The actions were allowed and the insurance companies paid $360,000 to the trustees who had been authorized to continue the litigation, the petition for a receiving order having been proceeded with and a receiving order made on Aug. 14, 1951. The inspectors of the bankrupt authorized the continuation of the services of P. at their first meeting in Sept. 1951.\nThe bill of $22,300 for counsel fees submitted by P. was allowed by the taxing officer, but the judge in bankruptcy taxed it at $8,000 of which $1,875 was declared to be payable by preference as a debt of the estate. The Court of Appeal held that P. was entitled to the full amount claimed and to be paid by preference.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSince under s. 41(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy is deemed to have commenced on Nov. 17, 1948, the time of the filing of the petition, the services were rendered to the estate of the bankrupt. P. was a person \"whose services have been authorized by the trustee in writing\" as provided by s. 155(4) of the Act. A trustee may in the exercise of his discretion adopt and pay for services rendered to a bankrupt after the filing of a petition when such services have clearly resulted, as in this case, in a benefit to the bankrupt's estate commensurate with the services rendered. In acting upon the inspectors' resolution of Sept. 1951, the trustees adopted the services already performed by P., and that was eminently fair. P. was therefore entitled to be collocated and paid by preference his proper charges.\nThe taxing officer, the judge in bankruptcy and each member of the Court of Appeal are free to exercise their own discretion in fixing an amount fair and reasonable to the party whose bill is being taxed and to the client. The amount allowed by the judge in bankruptcy was too low, and it cannot be said that the Court of Appeal erred in fixing the value of the services at $22,300. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the decision of the judge in bankruptcy.\nB. Bernstein, Q.C. and J. Shapiro for the appellants.\nJ. Perrault for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal arises out of a claim for legal fees for services rendered by the late Antonio Perrault, Q.C. These services, which covered a period from November, 1948, to February, 1953, were rendered in connection with thirty actions taken against various insurance companies, to recover moneys payable under fire insurance policies, as indemnity for the loss of property owned by Laurentian Colonies and Hotels Limited, now in bankruptcy.\nThe facts are fully set out in the judgments in the Courts below and I shall refer to them very briefly.\nA petition for a receiving order against the hotel Company was filed on November 17, 1948. The actions against the various insurance companies were taken some two weeks later on December 4, 1948, and with the approval of the petitioning creditor, proceedings on the petition in bankruptcy were suspended while the litigation was proceeded with, it being the view of all concerned apparently, that the claims could be prosecuted more effectively by the hotel company than by a trustee in bankruptcy.\nThe actions, all of which were contested, were joined for hearing, and judgments were ultimately rendered on February 16, 1951, condemning the insurance companies concerned to pay to the hotel company amounts totalling $313,292.71 with interest. The insurance companies inscribed in appeal against these judgments, and while the appeals were pending but before they had been heard, the petition for receiving order was proceeded with and a receiving order made on August 14, 1951. In due course the appellants as trustees of the bankrupt were authorized to continue the litigation.\nIt was conceded at the hearing before this Court that at the first meeting of inspectors of the bankrupt company, which took place on September 21, 1951, Mr. Ernest Lafontaine was retained as attorney of record and Mr. Antonio Perrault, Q.C., as counsel \"to continue the suits on behalf of the trustees.\"\nJudgment was rendered by the Court of Appeal on December 22 1952, confirming the judgments in the trial court, and the insurance companies eventually paid to the trustees a total of some $360,000.\nBoth Mr. Lafontaine and the late Mr. Perrault submitted bills for their legal services to the trustees, the bill of the late Mr. Perrault for counsel fees being in the amount of $22,300 after giving credit for a payment of $500. It is his bill that is at issue in the present appeal.\nIt is unnecessary to discuss what occurred following the initiation of proceedings to tax this bill other than to state that the allowance of the bill by the taxing officer cannot be dignified by the name of taxation. From that determination the appellants as trustees appealed to the Court. The appeal was heard by Chief Justice Scott, sitting as Judge in Bankruptcy, and in the result he taxed the bill at $8,000, of which he held the claimant was entitled to be paid $1,875 by preference. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, this judgment was reversed, the respondent held entitled to the full amount claimed and to be paid by preference.\nAs Mr. Justice McDougall, who wrote the principal judgment in the Court of Appeal, has pointed out, the real issues on the appeal are limited to two, namely, (1) the amount of the respondent's account and (2) whether it is to be treated in whole or in part as part of the costs of administration and thus payable in priority as provided by s. 95 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe services rendered by the late Mr. Perrault unquestionably benefited the estate of the bankrupt company. Virtually the only assets of that company were its claims against the insurance companies and these were only recoverable as a result of court action. Legal services were necessary and enured to the benefit of the company and its creditors. Under the terms of s. 41, subs. 4, of the Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy is deemed to have commenced on November 18, 1948, the time of the filing of the petition. As Mr. Justice McDougall has pointed out, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held in The King v. Louis Minden 1, that the bankruptcy begins at the time of the presentation of the petition for all purposes. This indeed would seem to be clear from the terms of the subsection itself. I think it can be said, therefore, that the services in question were rendered to the estate of the bankrupt.\nThe respondents are clearly entitled to be paid by preference for services rendered subsequent to September 21, 1951, date of the resolution of the inspectors, which I have referred to. Whether the claim for services prior to that date should be collocated and paid by preference, depends upon the effect to be given to the said resolution and to the relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Act. These sections are s. 155(4) and (6) and read as follows:\u2014\n155(4) No costs shall be paid out of the estate of the bankrupt, excepting the costs of persons whose services have been authorized by the trustee in writing and such costs as have been awarded against the trustee or the estate of the bankrupt by the court.\n* * *\n(6) Legal costs shall be payable according to the following priorities:\n(a) commissions on collections, which shall be a first charge on any sums collected;\n(b) when duly authorized by the court or approved by the creditors or the inspectors, costs incurred by the trustee after the bankruptcy and prior to the first meeting of creditors;\n(c) the costs on an assignment or costs incurred by a petitioning creditor up <to the issue of a receiving order;\n(d) costs awarded against the trustee or the estate of the bankrupt;\n(e) costs for legal services otherwise rendered to the trustee or the estate.\nThe late Mr. Perrault was clearly a person \"whose services have been authorized by the trustee in writing\" as provided by s. 155(4) and there remains for consideration the effect to be given to the resolution of September 21, 1951, which reads as follows:\u2014\nMr. Lafontaine, Solicitor, who handled the insurance claim before the Court explained to the meeting, the facts of the case and, after hearing the explanations of Mr. Lafontaine, it was moved by Mr. Parsons, seconded by Mr. Wilkinson and unanimously carried that the trustees continue the proceedings against the 30 insurance companies which have been condemned by Mr. Justice Collins to pay this sum of $313,292.71 to the bankrupt company with interest and costs and that Mr. Ernest Lafontaine be retained by the estate to continue the suits on behalf of the trustees and he is hereby authorized to retain the services of Mr. Antonio Perrault, K.C. as counsel. A trustee in bankruptcy may in the exercise of his discretion adopt and pay for services rendered to a bankrupt after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy when such services have clearly resulted in a benefit or profit to the bankrupt's estate commensurate with the service rendered. See in re Simonson ex parte Ball 2 and in re Geen ex parte Parker 3.\nThere can be no question but that the legal services rendered by Mr. Perrault benefited the estate. In my opinion, in acting upon the resolution of September 21, 1951, the trustees adopted the services which Mr. Perrault had already performed, and it was eminently fair that they should do so.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the late Mr. Perrault was entitled to be collocated and paid by preference his proper charges for all the services rendered by him to the estate of the bankrupt company.\nAs to amount, the Court below has held that he was entitled to be paid the full amount of his bill, namely, $22,300. The detailed account which he submitted for taxation was supported by the affidavit of the late Mr. Perrault, in accordance with s. 10 of the Bar Act, on which he was not cross-examined, and the appellants offered no expert testimony in connection with this account. A lengthy hearing did take place on the contestation of the Lafontaine account, and a good deal of expert evidence was adduced as to the character of the litigation and the value of legal services rendered by Mr. Lafontaine.\nWith respect, I am unable to agree with the view which appears to have been held in the Court below that this evidence should not have been considered at all in the present case, since evidence as to the character of the litigation was clearly relevant, but in my opinion it could be of little help in assessing the value of Mr. Perrault's services.\nThe late Mr. Perrault, a former batonnier general of the Quebec bar, had been for many years a leader in his profession and his learning and experience, more particularly in the field of commercial law were no doubt well known to the Courts below and indeed recognized by the appellants at the hearing before this Court. The litigation in which he acted as senior counsel was important, the amount involved was large and the result successful. A careful reading of the reasons of Mr. Justice McDougall convinces me that the Court below did not proceed upon the mere fact that Mr. Perrault had pledged his oath as to the value of his services. That by itself is not conclusive since the taxing officer, the judge in bankruptcy and each member of the Court of Appeal is free to exercise his own discretion under all the relevant circumstances in fixing an amount fair and reasonable to the party whose bill is being taxed and to the client. The amount allowed by the judge in bankruptcy, however, in my opinion was too low and I cannot say that the Court of Appeal has erred in fixing the value of the services in question at $22,800.\nIn the result, in my opinion, the respondents are entitled to be collocated and paid by preference in the distribution of the assets of the bankrupt estate, the sum of $22,300, and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: B.

Village Developments Ltd., [1956] S.C.R. 539\nDate: 1956-04-24\nThe Board of Education for The Township of North York (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nVillage Developments Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1956: January 31; 1956: February 1; 1956: April 24.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nExpropriation\u2014Determination of value\u2014Land suitable for subdivision\u2014Uncertainty of statutory approval\u2014Other uncertainties.\nLand comprising 10.4 acres and forming part of a larger tract purchased by the respondent in 1952, were expropriated by the appellant. A plan for subdivision by the former owner submitted in 1951 was not approved by the Minister of Planning and Development. A new plan submitted by the respondent in 1953 was approved by the Planning Board upon certain conditions. In the interval, negotiations were carried on between the parties for the purchase of the required lands for a school site. The appellant offered $100,000 in Feb. 1954 upon certain conditions and while this amount was acceptable to the respondent, one of the conditions was not and the negotiations collapsed. The expropriation was made on March 22, 1954. A new subdivision plan was approved by the Minister on May 13, 1954.\nProceeding upon the basis that the respondent was entitled to receive the amount he would have realized if the property had been sold in building lots, the trial judge made an award of $129,708. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Abbott J. dissenting): That the appeal should be allowed and the compensation reduced to $110,000.\nPer Taschereau and Cartwright JJ.: The land should be valued on the basis that the most advantageous use to which it could be put was subdivision and sale, but the trial judge appears to have erroneously calculated as a mere matter of arithmetic the total probable net realization from the sale of the land in this manner and to have awarded this sum instead of the present value of the anticipation that in the not far distant, but still not in the immediate, future such sum would be realized.\nPer Rand J.: The arbitrator failed to give effect to the fact that while what was in prospect for the owner here was a land subdivision development, the subdivision had not yet been approved and was subject to the contingencies that might affect approval or might be annexed as conditions. It was therefore facing that uncertainty in realization of the possibilities of its land that the owner must have estimated its value, a value which in the circumstances would not seem to differ from market value with the same object in view. The amount allowed by the arbitrator disregarded in toto all the eventualities foreseeable or only vaguely foreshadowable by which a prudent person, looking forward immediately before the expropriation, would be influenced.\nPer Locke J.: There was error in the principle applied by the trial judge. He appears to have assumed in making the award that the respondent was entitled as of right to register the plan prepared and to sell the lots shown upon it as building lots. There was no basis for any such assumption. It was wrong to ignore the statutory requirement of approval to any subdivision plan under the Planning Act and to fix the compensation as if the owner were entitled to proceed to an immediate sale of the land as building lots.\nPer Abbott J. (dissenting): There is no reason to assume that an appropriate subdivision plan would not have been approved since it is clear that the land was admirably suited for that purpose. The value of the land to the respondent at the time of the taking was the amount for which it could be disposed of for residential purposes, making allowance for any expenses which might have been incurred, carrying charges and such risk as might be involved pending sale. The trial judge followed the proper principles and the appellant has failed to show that the unanimous judgment of the court below on a question which is essentially one of fact, was wrong. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at trial.\nJ.T. Weir, Q.C. and S. Webb for the appellant.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C. and E.A. Goodman, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brothers Rand and Locke that this appeal should be allowed and that the compensation awarded to the respondent should be reduced to $110,000.\nIn my view the learned Judge of the County Court erred in principle in that in determining the present value of the future advantages possessed by the expropriated land he acted on the assumption that the respondent was entitled as of right to proceed to the immediate sale of such land as building lots, and gave no effect to the circumstance that it could not lawfully sell the land in this way until a plan had been approved pursuant to the statutory provisions set out in the reasons of my brother Locke. There was no certainty that a plan would be approved in the immediate future. It is also my opinion that the learned Judge failed to give any effect to the uncertainties mentioned in the reasons of my brother Rand.\nI do not question the view of the learned Judge that the most advantageous use to which the land could be put was subdivision and sale and that it should be valued on that basis; but, with respect, he appears to me to have calculated as a mere matter of arithmetic the total probable net realization from the sale of the land in this manner and to have awarded this sum instead of the present value of the anticipation that in the not far distant, but still not in the immediate, future such sum would be realized.\nI would allow the appeal and reduce the amount of compensation to $110,000. I would dispose of the costs as proposed by my brother Locke. RAND J.:\u2014The general principle for estimating compensation for land taken enunciated by the Judicial Committee in Cedar Rapids v. Lacoste[1], is thus stated by Lord Dunedin at p. 576:\n(1) The value to be paid for is the value to the owner as it existed at the date of the taking, not the value to the taker.\n(2) The value to the owner consists in all advantages which the land possesses, present or future, but it is the present value alone of such advantages that falls to be determined.\nWhat was in prospect for the owner here was a land sub-division development. But the sub\u2011division had not yet been approved and was subject to the contingencies that might affect approval or might be annexed as conditions. It was therefore facing that uncertainty in realization of the possibilities of its land that the owner must have estimated its value, a value which in the circumstances would not seem to differ from market value with the same object in view. But that was not the perspective in which the matter was approached by the arbitrator.\nThe land taken was part of a larger parcel bought by the respondent in 1952. A plan of the entirety had been prepared by the former owner and submitted for approval in 1951, but because of certain difficulties in the way of furnishing water and other facilities as well as possible school plans, the application was refused. In February, 1953, a new plan showing a large lot of the original block as reserved for school purposes, but otherwise divided into lots as in the previous plan, was submitted for and given provisional approval by the Minister, subject, however, to the consent of local authorities. The provisional approval remained in abeyance until the following year. In the spring of 1954 the Board had settled upon acquisition of what, had been set aside on the plan with the addition of a few lots and a roadway adjoining it, and in February negotiations took place between the parties looking to the compensation. This was agreed upon at $100,000 and the only reason why the transaction was not then concluded was the insistence by the Board on retaining $10,000 as security for the installation by the respondent of the several services, in which the respondent declined to acquiesce. On March 22 the Board filed the expropriation plan and within two months the final approval of the sub-division for the remaining land was given.\nWhen the case came on before the arbitrator the respondent submitted its case on the basis of the plan of lots as proposed in 1951. It gave evidence of certain sales made prior to approval; it was not disputed that there was a live market for lots generally in that section of the Township; and the average price of $3,300 was not seriously contested before us. On this material the gross selling price became a matter of mere mathematical calculation; from this were deducted the estimated expenses of installing the services and an amount equal to 10% of the gross price for incidental costs; the balance remaining was the amount allowed, $129,708. It is reasonable to take this as the foreseeable maximum.\nThat this mode of computation was, formally at least, a departure from the principle of Cedar Rapids was not challenged; but Mr. Robinette argued, and before the Court of Appeal successfully, that the elements of risk which lay between the time of the expropriation and the final approval of the plan by the Minister and thereafter, were so attenuated that they could be disregarded and, without violating the principle, the estimation could properly be made on the footing that the land at the moment of expropriation had become a sub-division on the market. The question is whether or not the contention is sound, and I am unable to agree that it is. To countenance that basis, not as an evidentiary circumstance but, as the arbitrator used it, as an absolute formula, would introduce such a corroding qualification of the principle as would expose it in every case to a contest over the number of such risks and the strength of their probability. The evidence in my opinion should have been rejected; but whether that is so or not, the basis cannot be applied as it was.\nIt is easy, of course, to be wise after the event; but when the question is put as it should be put, which is, what would a prudent business man in the position of the respondent be willing to accept in the light of all of the future possibilities as they appear immediately before the expropriation as the fair amount to compensate him for his loss, the determining considerations appear in a somewhat different and more uncertain aspect. We know what in fact the respondent did agree to, $100,000. Mr. Robinette properly submits that in assenting to that amount the respondent had in mind the avoidance of the risks of the estimation by the arbitrator as well as the trouble and expense of the arbitration. The amount agreed to by the parties would, of course, work both ways. But conceding a reasonable amount for that risk, it will represent what, in the opinion of the respondent, would have been reasonable compensation. That amount is, of course, uncertain as all of these estimates are, but I should say that 10% added to the amount agreed to can fairly be said to cover the item.\nOn the other hand, the amount of $129,708 disregards in toto all of the eventualities foreseeable or only vaguely foreshadowable by which a prudent person, looking forward immediately before the expropriation, would be influenced. We are all too familiar with this sense of vague mistrust to have any doubt about the wisdom of caution in such judgments. We have only to recall the confidence, particularly among the sanguine financial leaders in 1929, in the assumption of the permanence of values then reached, to appreciate the fallibilities of such opinions. What confuses the issue here is the introduction of post facto actualities which were hidden from the minds of men on March 22, 1954.\nFrom the amount allowed by the arbitrator there would of necessity be deducted a percentage to represent those uncertainties which are somewhat broader than those of an arbitration. Taking it at 15% of the maximum computation, the result would leave approximately the same as by the other method, that is, $110,000.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and reduce the amount of compensation from the amount awarded to that sum. The costs of the arbitration will remain as directed, but the appellant will have its costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed the appeal of the present appellant from an award made by His Honour Judge Forsyth as compensation for certain lands expropriated by the appellant under the provisions of the School Sites Act (c. 348, R.S.O. 1950). The lands taken, 10.4 acres in extent, formed part of a larger tract of 18.4 acres purchased by the respondent from one Harry Mendel in September, 1952. In July 1951 Mendel had had prepared a plan of a subdivision of the property, dividing the portions not required for streets into 94 lots designed for use as residential property. In September of that year, this plan was submitted to the Department of Planning and Development for approval, as required by s. 26 of the Planning Act (c. 277, R.S.O. 1950). The Minister had referred this plan to the Planning Board of the Township for its consideration. That board decided that it should not recommend the approval of the plan for two principal reasons, namely, the Township\u2019s inability to supply the property with water and because of the school problem in the area. These recommendations were forwarded to the Minister on May 13, 1952 and the plan was not approved.\nThe respondent is engaged in the business of dealing in subdivisions and in general construction work. After purchasing the tract, on its instructions the town planning consultant who had prepared the plan for Mendel prepared a new plan showing what was substantially the east half of the property as a high school site, the balance being divided into building lots and streets upon which the lots fronted. In March of 1953 this plan was submitted to the Planning Board and on April 30, 1953, the Board decided that it would recommend its approval upon certain conditions. The principal of these was that the respondent should enter into an agreement with the council of the Township regarding the installation of services such as the supply of water and for the disposal of sewage, payment of taxes and other related matters. For reasons which are not explained in the evidence, the agreement, the making of which was made a condition precedent to obtaining the recommendation of the Planning Board for the plan, was not settled until March 24, 1954. While so dated, a by-law authorising its execution by the Township was not passed until May 10, 1954.\nIn the interval, negotiations had been carried on for the purchase of the required lands, the appellant by an offer in writing dated February 26, 1954, offering the sum of $100,000 upon conditions stated in a schedule to the offer. One of these specified that the appellant should have the right to retain $10,000 of the purchase price to insure completion by the respondent of certain specified works by May 1, 1955. While the amount offered was acceptable to the respondent, the condition mentioned was not and the negotiations collapsed.\nOn March 22, 1954, the appellant passed a resolution expropriating the lands in question, describing them by metes and bounds. The area taken included 9 building lots shown on the prepared plan along the west side of the school site, which the respondent had theretofore assumed to sell, and an area shown as Block A lying along the south border of the part there designated as a high school site. The resolution did not in terms require immediate possession of the lands taken and on May 17, 1954, a second resolution was adopted that immediate possession be required and taken. The respondent, apparently following the settlement of the terms of its agreement with the Township dated March 25, 1954, had a new plan prepared giving effect to the changes agreed to, and this was approved by the Planning Board and thereafter by the Minister on May 13, 1954, and registered.\nThe learned judge, in determining the amount of the compensation, proceeded upon the basis that the owner was entitled to receive the amount he would have realized from the expropriated property if it had been sold in building lots, as contemplated by the proposed plan rejected by the Minister in 1952, less the amount it would have been necessary to expend upon the property for the provision of the services called for by the agreement of March 25, 1954, and a further deduction for the carrying charges, for interest, legal fees, taxes, selling commissions and other related expenditures. Estimating that there would have been realized from the sale of the lots, less these deductions, an amount of $129,708, he allowed the owner this amount, with interest from March 22, 1954. He further found that the property was excellently situated for subdivision purposes and that that was the most advantageous purpose to which the land could be put and that the lots could have readily been sold after the registration of the plan. While these findings are clearly supported by the evidence, I think, with respect, there was error in the principle applied in determining the question to be decided.\nIt appears to have been assumed in making the award that the respondent was entitled as of right to register the plan prepared in 1951 and to sell the lots shown upon it as building lots. With respect, there is no basis for any such assumption. The Legislature of Ontario has by the Planning Act made provision whereby the council of a municipality (an expression defined to include a township) may define and name a planning area and, when defined, the council may appoint a Planning Board which, by virtue of s. 4, is declared to be a body corporate. The Board so constituted is by s. 8 charged with the duty of investigating and surveying the physical, social and economic conditions in relation to the development of the planning area and, inter alia, after holding public meetings for the purpose of obtaining the participation and co-operation of the inhabitants of the area in determining the solution of problems or matters affecting the development of it, recommend a plan to the council: if approved, the plan is submitted to the Minister for approval. Other provisions of the statute provide that where land is to be subdivided for the purpose of being sold in lots by reference to a registered plan of subdivision, the person desiring to register the plan shall forward it to the Minister for approval. It was under this provision that the plans to which I have referred were submitted to the Minister of Planning and Development. S-s. 4 of s. 26 provides that, in considering a draft plan of subdivision, regard shall be had, inter alia, to the health, safety, convenience and welfare of the future inhabitants. S. 27 declares that every person who subdivides and offers for sale or agrees to sell land by a description in accordance with an unregistered plan of subdivision shall be guilty of an offence and, on summary conviction, liable to a specified penalty.\nThe Legislature has further, by the Board of Education Act c. 38, R.S.O. (1950), the Department of Education Act (c. 94), the Public Schools Act (c. 316) and the High Schools Act (c. 165) made provision for the establishment, maintenance and control of public and high schools in the province and provided for the establishment of municipal Boards of Education. One of the duties imposed upon such Boards is to provide adequate accommodation, according to the regulations, for all pupils.\nAs far back as 1951, the Planning Board of the Township of North York had, as above pointed out, considered the necessity of providing, by any plan to be recommended to the Minister, for further schools in the area. In addition to the subdivision proposed by Mendel, two other subdivisions lying to the north and west of the area in question had been approved and plans registered. By March of 1953 it is clear that the Board, in the discharge of its statutory duties, had determined to recommend that the area in question should not be approved for subdivision but, to the extent then indicated to the respondent, set aside as a high school site. While the record contains no evidence upon the point, it is proper, in my opinion, to assume that the appellant Board in the discharge of its functions had decided that, in the interests of the community as a whole, a high school should be established on the site indicated on the second plan. As the earlier plan prepared indicates, there was a public school lying immediately to the north and west of the limits of the proposed subdivision.\nThe risk that the Planning Board of the Township, and the Minister of Planning Development on its recommendation, would decline to approve a plan of subdivision of the property in question into building lots, was one to which the area of 18.4 acres purchased by the respondent in 1952 was subject, in common with all other vacant lands in the Township. Before the passing of the expropriation resolution on March 24, 1954, it had been made clear to the respondent that the plan of subdivision as originally proposed in 1952 would not be recommended by the Planning Board to the Minister or approved by him, and it was in consequence of this that the second plan setting aside the area as a high school site was prepared. It cannot, therefore, be said that, as of the date of the expropriation and by reason of it, the respondent was deprived of its right to sell the property as building lots. There was no such market then available or in prospect since the land could not be sold in lots without the approval and registration of the plan. It was not the action of the appellant which deprived the respondent of such a market but the inability of the latter to obtain the recommendation of the Planning Board and the approval of the Minister of the plan of subdivision. It is not, of course, suggested that either that Board or the Minister acted otherwise than in the manner they considered to be in the public interest in discharging their statutory duties.\nThe owner of property subject to zoning restrictions is not, if the land be expropriated, entitled to compensation on the basis of its value to him if used for some purpose forbidden by the regulations. The contrary of this proposition was asserted and rejected as long ago as 1870 in Stebbing v. The Metropolitan Board of Works[2]. The owner of property suitable for use as licensed premises situate in a place where Part 2 of the Canada Temperance Act (c. 30, R.S.C. 1952) is in force cannot, if it be compulsorily taken, assert a value based on the profits which he would derive from the sale of liquor.\nThe fact that there was but one available purchaser for the property does not, of course, affect the right of the respondent to be compensated to the full extent of the value of the property to him as of the date of the expropriation, in accordance with the principle so often stated in this Court and restated in Woods v. Manufacturing Co. v. The King[3].\nThe evidence directed to establishing this, while considerable in extent, is not, in my opinion, entirely satisfactory. For the owner it was directed to showing what sum of money could have been realized had he been able to get the original plan, or something closely approximating it, registered, whereas it had become apparent to the respondent early in 1953 that this was impossible. Various valuations of the property as acreage was given on behalf of the appellant, these varying from $63,500 to $74,400. These valuations were, however, based on what the property would realize on the market and did not attempt to assess its value to the owner. In addition, evidence was given of a number of sales of land as acreage in the vicinity in the years 1951, 1952 and 1953, for prices varying from $2,700 to $4,725 per acre. The evidence, however, established that the land had materially appreciated in value between the year 1952 and the time of expropriation. There is, however, concrete evidence as to an amount which the present respondent apparently considered to be the value to it immediately, preceding the expropriation and that this amount of $100,000 was an amount which the appellant was prepared to pay, subject to conditions which need no longer be considered.\nI have come to the conclusion that the proper course to be followed is to settle the amount of remuneration in this Court rather than to refer the matter back.\nWhile it is to be presumed that the respondent offered to accept this amount at a time when it was fully informed as to its legal rights, it should be borne in mind that, being aware that the property was subject to expropriation at a price to be fixed by arbitration, it might well, in order to escape the delays, costs and uncertainty of arbitration and perhaps thereafter litigation, accept less than the full value of the property to it. In the circumstances, I think it proper to add ten per cent to the above mentioned figure for the compulsory taking. I would accordingly allow this appeal and fix the amount of the compensation at $110,000, with interest at the legal rate from March 22, 1954.\nI would allow the appellant its costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal. I would not interfere with the order made as to the costs of the hearing before His Honour Judge Forsyth.\nAbbott J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed an appeal of the appellant from an award made by His Honour Judge Forsyth fixing the compensation for certain lands belonging to respondent and expropriated by the appellant for school purposes.\nThe property expropriated formed part of a larger tract of land acquired by the respondent in 1952 for the purpose of subdivision and sale as residential building lots, a purpose for which, it is clear from the record, the property was admirably suited. Approval of a subdivision plan by the appropriate public authorities was withheld for some time, apparently because of a shortage in the water supply and of possible requirements for school purposes. In the spring of 1954 the water situation appears to have been improved and appellant had also by that time taken a definite decision to acquire a part of respondent\u2019s property for school purposes. Discussions took place between appellant and respondent with a view to the former acquiring the property without the necessity of expropriation proceedings but these proved abortive for reasons which I do not find it necessary to discuss.\nNotice of expropriation was given by appellant on March 22, 1954, and a short time later a plan of subdivision for the remainder of the respondent\u2019s property was approved.\nApproval of a subdivision plan, by various public authorities, is required to protect the public interest, not to arbitrarily prevent the economic development of real property by its owner, and had the appellant decided to acquire some other property for school purposes, there is no reason to assume that an appropriate subdivision plan would not have been approved for the property expropriated, since, as I have said, it is clear from the record that it was admirably suited for that purpose.\nThe general principle to be followed in establishing compensation for compulsory taking of land, has been long since settled and consistently followed in the decisions of this Court, one of the most recent of which is Woods Manufacturing Company v. The King[4]. The value to be paid is the value to the holder, not to the taker, and consists in all the advantages which the land possesses, present and future, although it is the present value alone that falls to be determined.\nAs Rand J. said in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King[5]: \u201cA compensation statute should not be approached with the attitude that Parliament intended an individual to be victimized in loss because of the accident that his land rather than his neighbours\u2019 should be required for public purposes:\u201d and in my opinion the value of the land to respondent at the time of taking was the amount for which it could be disposed of for residential purposes, appropriate allowance being made for (i) any expenses which might have to be incurred, (ii) carrying charges and (iii) such risk as might be involved pending sale. In arriving at such value, on the principles laid down in Irving Oil Company Limited v. The King[6], I am also of opinion that the usual ten per cent allowance for compulsory taking could properly have been included in the circumstances of this case.\nIt was established in evidence that fully serviced building lots, having a 50 ft. frontage, in the general area of the property expropriated, were selling, at the time of the expropriation, for from $3,200 to $3,700 each. In arriving at a valuation of the property expropriated, the arbitrator used as a basis of his estimate a figure of $3,300 per serviced lot. From a total potential value thus arrived at, he deducted an amount of $42,000 to cover the estimated cost of services which would not be required since the property was sold en bloc, and a sum of $14,412 (being ten per cent of the estimated value) as an allowance for carrying charges, interest, legal fees, commissions and the like. In his award, the arbitrator made no specific reference to having made any allowance for risk pending development and sale, and he made no allowance for compulsory taking.\nExcept to the extent the arbitrator may have failed to allow for risk involved pending sale, I do not think that in arriving at the value which he did, he failed to follow proper principles. The evidence would indicate that at the time of the expropriation, the risk of loss pending sale was slight and in my opinion, in terms of money, could not in any event have exceeded a sum equivalent to ten per cent for compulsory taking.\nThe appellant has failed to satisfy me that the unanimous judgment of the Court below, which confirmed the finding of the arbitrator on a question which is essentially one of fact, is wrong. In my opinion, therefore, it should not be disturbed.\nAt the hearing before this Court it was realized for the first time that in fixing the compensation at $129,708, an error had been made in the method of applying the 10% allowance for carrying charges, which had escaped the attention of all concerned. It was conceded that on a proper application of the 10% deduction the amount awarded should have been $125,508. The judgment below should be modified accordingly but otherwise the appeal should be dismissed; this should not affect the question of costs, and the respondent should have its costs of the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Armstrong, Kemp, Young & Burrows.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Goodman & Goodman.\n[1] [1914] A.C. 569.\n[2] (1870) L.R. 6 Q.B. 37\n[3] [1951] S.C.R. 504.\n[4] [1951] S.C.R. 504.\n[5] [1949] S.C.R. 712 at 715.\n[6] [1946] S.C.R. 551.\n",

Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nAeronautics\u2014Crash of airplane\u2014Death of passenger and pilot\u2014Whether action lies against estate of tortfeasor\u2014Limitation period\u2014Families Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 116\u2014Administration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 6\u2014Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 1.\nThe pilot of a plane and his passenger were both killed when the plane crashed. It was not known which of the two died first or if they both died at the same moment. The appellant, a dependant of the passenger, sued under the Families Compensation Act (R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 116) the administratrix of the estate of the pilot pursuant to s. 71 of the Administration Act (R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 6). The action was brought after the six months after the death of the pilot (the period limited by s. 71 of the Administration Act) but within the twelve months from the death of the passenger (the period limited by s. 5 of the Compensation Act).\nThe trial judge held that the appellant had a cause of action against the administratrix and that the action was not statute-barred. This judgment was reversed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): That the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: The definition of \"person\" in s. 3 of the Families Compensation Act as \"the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued\" does not apply to the personal representative of the deceased tortfeasor notwithstanding s. 24 of the Interpretation Act.\nPer Rand J.: If the pilot's death had occurred first, then by force of s. 71(3) of the Administration Act, there accrued at that moment to the then living passenger a right of action against the legal representative of the deceased pilot and that representative would, upon the death of the passenger, become liable to the beneficiaries of the passenger under s. 4 of the Compensation Act. On the other hand, if the pilot survived the passenger it would be against him that the passenger, at the moment of his death, had the right of action and it would also be against the pilot only that the right. of the beneficiary would lie: on the death of the pilot the right would, under the well-established rule of the common law, come to an end and there is nothing in s. 71 which affects that result. The governing point of time in each case is that of the passenger's death. If both had died at the same moment there is no presumption of law either as to survival of the one or other or as to death of both at the same moment. As the pilot may have survived the passenger, the presumption of either of the other two possibilities is excluded and with it the possibility of finding that the person liable was the legal representative of the pilot.\nPer Kellock J.: The new right of action, created by the Families Compensation Act, abates upon the death of the tortfeasor where the latter survives the victim and there is nothing in the Act which prevents that result or allows a person suing under that statute to invoke the provisions of the Administration Act although the victim himself might have done so. The law does not permit the context of s. 3 of the Families Compensation Act to apply so as to permit action to be taken against the personal representative of the tortfeasor.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): In applying s. 3 of the Families Compensation Act, the question is who the person wronged could have sued in respect of his injuries had he lived. Against such person, whether the wrongdoer or his personal representative, the action lies at the suit of the personal representative of the one who was wrong on behalf of the dependents, or by the dependents on their own behalf. Consequently, the passenger, if alive, might by virtue of s. 71(3) of the Administration Act have sued the pilot if he were alive and, if dead, his personal representative and accordingly this action lies. The fact that there is no evidence to prove when in relation to the death of the passenger the death of the pilot occurred does not.\nS-s. 6 of s. 71 of the Administration Act excludes the limitation of six months of s-s. 3, and accordingly the action was not barred (B.C. Electric v. Gentile [1914] A.C. 1034 referred to).\nPer Cartwright J. (dissenting): The word \"person\" in s. 3 of the Families Compensation Act is to be extended by virtue of s. 24(31) of the Interpretation Act to read \"the heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives of such person\". It follows that the limitation of six months imposed by s. 71(3) of the Administration Act has no application to the present action.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , reversing, Robertson J.A. dissenting, the judgment at trial.\nW. S. L. Young for the appellant.\nC. W. Tysoe, Q.C. and Mrs. W. A. Tysoe for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The plaintiff in these proceedings is James Burns Cairney, an infant, sueing by Jeanette Cairney, his mother and next friend, and by special leave of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia he appeals from a judgment of that Court dismissing his action. It was originally brought against Queen Charlotte Airlines Ltd. and Roberta Burrells MacQueen, Administratrix of the estate of Douglas Duncan MacQueen. According to the Statement of Claim the Plaintiff's father, Henry Michael Cairney, was being carried as a passenger for compensation on October 17, 1951, in an aircraft owned by the Company and piloted by its employee, Douglas Duncan MacQueen, on a flight in the Province of British Columbia, when the aircraft crashed, as a result of which all aboard including the pilot were killed. It is alleged that the crash was caused and occasioned by the negligence of MacQueen and the Company. The Provincial Workmen's Compensation Board determined that the right to bring the action against the Company was taken away by Part I of The Workmen's Compensation Act and the action as against it was therefore forever stayed.\nAfter the Statement of Defence of the Administratrix had been delivered a case was stated on behalf of her and the plaintiff which, after pointing out that the Writ of Summons had been issued on May 2, 1952, that is, after the expiration of six months from the death of Douglas Duncan MacQueen, although within twelve months after his death, posed the question for the opinion of the Court as to whether the action was maintainable against the Administratrix. Wilson J. before whom the matter came in the first instance decided that the period of limitation applicable was the twelve months mentioned in The Families' Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 116, and not the six months mentioned in The Administration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 6. Upon the argument of an appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia it appeared that a wider point of law was involved and at the Court's suggestion and by consent of counsel for both parties the appeal was adjourned so that a supplemental special case might be submitted to Wilson J. This was done, the question for the opinion of the Court being\n\u2026whether, apart altogether from the fact that this action was not brought until after the expiration of six months from the death of Douglas Duncan MacQueen, this action is maintainable against the Defendant Roberta Burrells MacQueen, Administratix of the Estate of Douglas Duncan MacQueen, deceased, it having been brought by the Plaintiff in his individual capacity and against the personal representative of the alleged tortfeasor.\nWilson J. considering himself bound by a previous decision of Fisher J. in Bowcott v. Westwood[2] , answered the question in the affirmative and ordered the action to proceed to trial against the Administratrix. The appeals from the two Orders of Wilson J. then came on for argument before the Court of Appeal at the same time and by a majority that Court allowed the appeals and dismissed the action.\nSection 3 of The Families' Compensation Act reads:\u2014\n3. Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default, and the act, neglect, or default is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to an indictable offence.\nThis Act is based on Lord Campbell's Act, 9-10 Victoria, c. 93, which was in force in British Columbia in the early days (English Law Act, c. 69, C.S.B.C. 1888). Section 5 of Lord Campbell's Act provided that \"the word 'person' shall apply to bodies politic and corporate\", so that there was no difficulty in sueing a corporation, and in the case of Vose v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[3] , referred to by Robertson JA., the point was not mentioned. There was no provision that \"person\" should include an executor or administrator. Section (1) which contains the recital, together with the other provisions of the Act, seem to make it clear that, while giving an action on behalf of the dependents of the person wronged, no action was given against the personal representatives of an individual wrongdoer in case of the latter's death. It is true that s. 24 of The Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 1, enacts:\u2014\n(31). \"Person\" includes any corporation, partnership, or party, and the heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives of such person, to whom the context can apply according to law.\nbut by the opening sentence of the section this is so \"unless the context otherwise requires\". Bearing in mind the history of The Families' Compensation Act and its prototype, the context is such, in my opinion, that the definition cannot apply.\nIt is under The Families' Compensation Act that the present action is brought and the plaintiff is the infant son of Henry Michael Cairney. The action is, therefore, not one covered by s-s. (2) of s. 71 of The Administration Act since it deals only with actions by an executor or administrator and because \"the damages recovered in the action shall form part of the personal estate of the deceased\", which is never the case in actions under Lord Campbell's Act and similar enactments such as The Families' Compensation Act. On this ground alone the plaintiff is unable to secure any assistance from the provisions of The Administration Act.\nThe decision in Bowcott v. Westwood was that of a single judge and Counsel agreed that it stands alone. Under those circumstances I am unable to agree that it can be brought within the authorities of which Barras v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling and Fishing Company, Limited[4] and MacMillan v. Brownlee[5] , are examples. It cannot be said that one decision of a single judge is a clear judicial interpretation and certainly there is no course of judicial decision.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, but, in accordance with the written consent filed on behalf of both parties, not only is the dismissal to be without costs, but the judgments below should be varied so as to provide that there shall be no costs of the action or any of the proceedings, including the applications to the judge of first instance and the appeals to the Court of Appeal.\nRAND J.:\u2014This is an action for compensation brought under The Families' Compensation Act of British Columbia arising from the death of a passenger in a plane crash which took the lives of all persons aboard. The respondent is the administratrix of the estate of the pilot whose negligence is alleged to have been responsible for the accident. There is admittedly no evidence available to enable a finding that as between the passenger and pilot the one survived the other or that both died at the same moment. In the view I take of the law, the narrow question is this: who was the person who would have been liable to the passenger if death had not ensued within the meaning of s. 3 of that Act, the material portion of which reads:\nWhenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act\u2026 and the act\u2026 is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, \u2026\nIf the pilot's death had occurred first, then by force of s. 71(3) of the Administration Act, R.S.B.C. (1936) c. 5 there accrued at that moment to the then living passenger a right of action against the legal representative of the deceased pilot and that representative would, upon the death of the passenger, become liable to the beneficiaries under s. 4 of the Compensation Act. On the other hand, if the pilot survived the passenger, it would be against him that the passenger, at the moment of his death, had the right of action and it would also be against the pilot only that the right of the beneficiary would lie: on the death of the pilot the right would, under the well established rule of the common law, come to an end and there is nothing in s. 71 which affects that result. The governing point of time in each case is that of the passenger's death: I cannot agree that the words \"if death had not ensued\" can be interpreted to extend indefinitely the time within which the person liable is determinable. This was the view taken by the Judicial Committee in B.C. Electric Railway v. Gentile[6] in which Lord Dunedin used this language:\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that the punctum temporis. at which the test is to be taken is at the moment of death, with the idea fictionally that death has not taken place. At that moment, however, the test is absolute. If, therefore, the deceased could not, had he survived at that moment, maintained, i.e. successfully maintained, his action, then the action under the Act does not arise.\nIf the two had died at the same moment, since for the purpose of s. 3 the person wronged is momentarily conceived to be alive, I should be inclined to hold that at that moment the wrongdoer then being dead s. 71(3) came into effect and the right given by s. 3 to beneficiaries would be against the legal representative of the wrongdoer. But it has long since been laid down by the House of Lords as the law of England that in the case of such a casualty there is no presumption of law either as to survival of the one or other or as to death of both at the same moment: Wing v. Anfranc[7] . As the pilot may have survived the passenger,\nthe presumption of either of the other two possibilities is excluded and with it the possibility of finding that the person liable was the legal representative of the pilot.\nIn Wing the wills of husband and wife, lost at sea together, were involved and the condition of the will of each was that the other should survive. The result of the decision was to distribute the estates of both as if they had died at the same moment and that seems to have led some American authorities, in such cases, to adopt the presumption that the deaths were simultaneous: Cyc. of L. & P. v. 13, a,309 p. (b). What brought about the result in Wing was the prima facie presumption that the next of kin are entitled to the personal property of a deceased, and as neither side could show that the condition of the will under which he claimed was fulfilled both were out of court and that presumption carried. But there is no analogous resort available to the circumstances here. This may seem to be unfortunate, but where, as here, the language of the statute is, as I read it, clear no other result is open.\nRobertson J.A. in the Court of Appeal took the word \"person\" in s. 3, by force of the Interpretation Act, to include executors and administrators, but I am unable to agree that such a modification in the law as would follow from that view could have been contemplated. Moreover, as my brother Locke points out, that inclusion is to be ascribed only to the representatives of the person \"to whom the context can apply according to law\", a qualification which is fatal here.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal on the terms mentioned in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014In determining the question as to whether or not this action is properly constituted, it would be necessary to conclude that the action would be so constituted irrespective of whether the deceased passenger, Henry Michael Cairney, survived or predeceased the pilot, Douglas Duncan MacQueen, as it is admitted that it is not possible to determine that fact. The question thus raised depends upon the proper construction of the Families' Compensation Act, which statute creates the cause of action here asserted, a cause of action which is an entirely new right and quite distinct from any right of action vested either in the deceased passenger himself, had he survived, or his personal representative.\nS. 3 of the statute provides that in the case of the death of a person caused by wrongful act, neglect or default which would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured (that is, the person whose death was thus wrongfully caused) to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then \"the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued\" to such an action is to be liable to the action for which the statute provides in favour of the class of persons therein limited.\nWhere the tortfeasor predeceases the victim of the wrong, the latter, \"the party injured\", could not, at common law, maintain any action against the personal representative of the tortfeasor. By reason, however, of s. 71, s-s. (3) of the Administration of Estates Act, the victim became enabled to sue the executor or administrator of the tortfeasor and there would in such case be a \"person who would have been liable if death (i.e., the death of the victim) had not ensued.\"\nWhere, however, the tortfeasor survives the latter, the victim, at the moment of his death (on the fictional assumption required by the statute that his death did not ensue) would, at common law, be entitled to maintain action against the tortfeasor. Accordingly, as this is the condition which the statute lays down, a member of the class under the Compensation Act would, by virtue of that Act, also be entitled to sue the tortfeasor.\nThe important consideration for present purposes at this point, however, is that, while the right of action of the victim himself against the tortfeasor would not, because of the express provisions of s-s. (3) of s. 71 of the Administration of Estates Act, be affected by the death of the latter, the right of action under the Compensation Act is not preserved in such case. As pointed out by Lord Dunedin in B.C. Electric Railway v. Gentile[8] , employing the language of Coleridge J. in Blake v. Midland Railway[9] :\n\u2026\"it will be evident that this Act does not transfer this right of action\" (of the deceased) \"to his representative, but gives to the representative a totally new right of action, on different principles.\" It is well settled that this new right of action abates on the death of the tortfeasor and there is nothing in the Compensation Act which prevents that result or allows a person suing under that statute to invoke the provisions of the Administration Act although the victim himself might have done so. In speaking of the conditions precedent to action under the Compensation Act, Lord Dunedin stated at p. 1041:\nThe second is that the default is such \"as would if death had not ensued have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof.\"\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that the punctum temporis at which the test is to be taken is at the moment of death, with the idea fictionally that death has not taken place. At that moment, however, the test is absolute.\nIn Haley v. Brown[10] , Smith J.A.; says at p. 10 that\nsec. 3 of the Compensation Act makes any one liable whom the injured person could have sued if alive.\nOn this footing the learned judge, as did Davey J.A., held that a plaintiff under the Compensation Act could sue the personal representatives of the tortfeasor, who died after surviving the victim. In my opinion, the Compensation Act permits action \"against the person who would have been liable if death (i.e., the victim's death) had not ensued,\" that is, in the circumstances under consideration, the tortfeasor himself. The statute does not authorize an action against anyone else.\nAccordingly, as in the present case it cannot be shown that MacQueen did not survive Cairney, the action is not properly constituted.\nIt has, however, been contended that the provisions of s. 24 of the Interpretation Act are pertinent in a case such as the present. That section reads as follows:\nIn every Act of the legislature, unless the context otherwise requires:\u2014\n(31) \"Person\" includes any corporation, partnership, or party, and the heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives of such person, to whom the context can apply according to law.\nAs, however, as already pointed out, an action under legislation of the character of the Families' Compensation Act abates upon the death of the tortfeasor where the latter survives the victim, the law does not permit the context of s. 3 to apply so as to permit action to be taken against the personal representative of the tortfeasor. It would require, in my opinion, an express provision to extend the right of action under the Families' Compensation Act to such a situation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed but in accordance with the consent filed; the order as to costs should be that proposed by the Chief Justice.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia from a judgment of that court which allowed the appeal of the respondent MacQueen from two orders made by Wilson J. pronounced on March 24 and May 17, 1954, and directed the dismissal of the action. Robertson J. A. dissented and would have dismissed the appeal.\nThe plaintiff is an infant, the son of Henry Michael Cairney, deceased, and brought the action by Jeanette Cairney, his mother, as next friend. The claim advanced is for damages in respect of the death of Cairney in an accident which occurred on October 17, 1951, when an aeroplane, the property of the defendant, Queen Charlotte Air Lines Ltd., and piloted by Douglas Duncan MacQueen, the husband of the respondent MacQueen, crashed. Both Cairney and MacQueen and all other persons aboard the plane were killed. The right of action asserted was for damages occasioned by the negligence of the defendant company and of MacQueen under the provisions of The Families' Compensation Act (c. 116, R.S.B.C. 1948) and was brought on behalf of the infant plaintiff only.\nBoth of the named defendants defended the action. Upon the application of the defendant company under the provisions of The Workmen's Compensation Act (c. 312, R.S.B.C. 1948), the Workmen's Compensation Board determined that the right of action asserted against the company was taken away by Part 1 of that Act and the action proceeded against the respondent MacQueen alone, as administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband.\nThe matter came before Wilson J. upon a special case for the opinion of the court under the provisions of Marginal Rule 389 of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The special case, as first stated for the opinion of the court, recited the fact of the death of both Cairney and MacQueen in the accident on October 17, 1951, the issue of the writ in the action on May 2, 1952, the nature of the cause of action asserted, that letters of administration of the estate of MacQueen had been issued to his widow on November 20, 1951, and continued:\u2014\nThe question for the opinion of the Court is whether this action having been brought after the expiration of six months from the death of the said Douglas Duncan MacQueen this action is maintainable against the defendant Roberta Burrells MacQueen, administratrix of the estate of Douglas Duncan MacQueen, deceased.\nIf the Court shall be of opinion in the negative of the said question, then judgment shall be entered for both defendants with their costs of defence.\nIf the Court shall be of opinion in the affirmative of the said question, then this action shall proceed to trial against the Defendant Roberta Burrells MacQueen, Administratrix of the estate of Douglas Duncan MacQueen, deceased.\nBy an order of Wilson J. dated March 24, 1954, the question submitted was answered in the affirmative and it was ordered that the action proceed against the defendant MacQueen.\nThe special case dated February 26, 1954 was thereafter, by agreement between the parties, supplemented by propounding a further question, namely:\u2014\nThe question for the opinion of the Court is whether, apart altogether from the fact that this action was not brought until after the expiration of six months from the death of Douglas Duncan MacQueen, this action is maintainable against the Defendant Roberta Burrells MacQueen, Administratrix of the Estate of Douglas Duncan MacQueen, deceased, it having been brought by the Plaintiff in his individual capacity and against the personal representative of the alleged tortfeasor.\nThe supplementary special case said further that if the Court should be of the opinion in the negative of the said question, judgment should be entered for both defendants with costs but, if in the affirmative and if the Court should also be of opinion in the affirmative of the first question propounded, the action should proceed to trial against the defendant administratrix.\nOn May 17, 1954, Wilson J. ordered that the question submitted be answered in the affirmative and directed that the action proceed to trial.\nThe formal order of the Court of Appeal allowing the appeal of the present respondent directed that the action be dismissed with costs.\nS. 3 of The Families' Compensation Act reads:\u2014\nWhenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful actneglect, or default, and the act, neglect, or default is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued sha'll be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused unde such circumstances as amount in law to an indictable offence.\nS. 4 declares that every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death has been caused and shall be brought in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased, but that if there be none such or no such action having been brought within six months after the death of the deceased person, then the action may be brought in the name of the person or persons for whose benefit the action would have been if brought in the name of such executor or adminisrator. Any such action must under the terms of s. 5 be brought within twelve months after the death.\nThe Act is, with an exception later referred to, for all practical purposes the same as Lord Campbell's Act (9-10 Vict. c. 93 Imp.) and came into force in British Columbia prior to 1871. The history of the statute in British Columbia is to be found in the reasons for judgment delivered in this matter by Mr. Justice Robertson.\nThe rule of the common law expressed in the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona as it applied to liability for tort, was that if injury were done either to the person or property of another for which damages only could be recovered in satisfaction, the action died with the person to whom or by whom the wrong was done (Wheatley v. Lane[11] ; Broom, 10th Ed. 611).\nThe statute provided an exception to that rule. As pointed out in Seward v. Vera Cruz[12] , it gave a new cause of action not to the person representing in point of estate the deceased man, who would naturally represent him as to all his own rights of action which would survive, but to his wife and children. As the Earle of Selborne L.C. there said, death is essentially the cause of action. This view was adopted by the Judicial Committtee in British Columbia Electric v. Gentile[13] . In 1934, s. 71 of The Administration Act (c. 5, R.S.B.C. 1924) was repealed and reenacted in terms which, together with amendments made later, raise the question to be determined on this appeal. S. 71(2) provides that the executor or administrator of any deceased person may maintain an action for all torts or injuries to the person or property of the deceased, in the same manner and with the same remedies as the deceased would, if living, be entitled to, with certain specified exceptions. These exceptions in the amendment of 1934 did not include damages for loss of expectation of life but, by an amendment (c. 2 of the Statutes of 1941-42), this was added and, in addition, a further exception, \"if death results from such injuries, to damages for the death.\" Since the rights of the personal representatives were only those which the deceased would have had if living, the last mentioned exception would appear to have been superfluous. It may perhaps have been added, together with the further words added to the subsection \"provided that nothing herein contained shall be in derogation of any rights conferred by The Families' Compensation Act\", to make it clear beyond question, that claims asserted by reason of the death could be made only under the last mentioned statute.\nS-s. 3, so far as it need be considered, reads:\u2014\nIn the case of any tort or injury to person or property, if the person who committed the wrong dies, the person wronged or, in the case of his death, his executor or administrator, may bring and maintain an action against the executor or administrator of the deceased person who committed the wrong, and the damages and costs recovered in the action shall be payable out of the estate of the deceased in like order of administration as the simple contract debts of the deceased.\nA further provision of the subsection is that, with an exception which is irrelevant here, no action shall be brought under its provisions after the expiration of six months from the death of the deceased person who committed the wrong.\nS-s. 4 provides that, in the case of the death of the person wronged or the person who committed the wrong during the pendency of an action concerning the matter, it may be continued in the name of or against the personal representative and, if both parties die, between their respective personal representatives. S-s. 6 declares, inter alia, that nothing in the section shall prejudice or affect any right of action under the provisions of The Families' Compensation Act.\nThe question as to whether this section applies to, or affects, claims which may be asserted under The Families' Compensation Act is one as to which there has not been unanimity in the courts of British Columbia. In Bowcott v. Westwood[14] , Fisher J., (as he then was), decided that the rights conferred by s. 71 extend the rights conferred on the dependents of deceased persons by The Families' Compensation Act and that, accordingly, so much of the amendment as relates to causes of action against the estates of deceased persons should apply to causes of action under the former Act. Being of this opinion, he held that an action by the administratrix of a deceased person lay against the executrix of a person by whose negligence it was said the death had been caused.\nWhen the present matter was considered by Wilson J., that learned judge considered that he should follow the decision of Fisher J., leaving to the Court of Appeal the responsibility of overruling it, if it was wrong. It should be said that no question as to the application of the limitation section of The Administration Act arose in Bowcott's case.\nIn the Court of Appeal the Chief Justice of British Columbia, after pointing out that, as the matter came before the court, it was not known whether Cairney and MacQueen had died together at the moment of impact or if one survived the other, considered that, in view of the lack of evidence of survivorship, The Administration Act could not be invoked either in relation to its limitation provisions or to interpret the status of the plaintiff suing under The Families' Compensation Act. As to a contention advanced on behalf of the present appellant that the word \"person\", where it appears for the second time in s. 3 of The Families' Compensation Act, should be construed as including the personal representative of the deceased tortfeasor, that learned Chief Justice said that, in his view, if the Legislature had intended to abrogate the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona in this type of action, it would have plainly said so. Sidney Smith J. A. decided that, as The Families' Compensation Act did not give any right of action against the personal representatives and since an action based upon the provisions of The Administration Act must be brought within six months after the death of the tortfeasor, the claim could not succeed, the action not having been brought within that time.\nRobertson J. A. who dissented, came to his conclusion on different grounds.\nS. 3 of The Families' Compensation Act, as above pointed out, says that the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action. The word \"person\" is not defined in the Act. The Interpretation Act (R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 1) declares that each provision thereof shall extend and apply to the Revised Statutes and to all Statutes of the Legislature, except in so far as any provision thereof is inconsistent with the intention and object of any Act or the interpretation that the provision would give to any word, expression or clause is inconsistent with the context. S. 23(31) provides that in every Act of the Legislature, unless the context otherwise requires, the word \"person\"\nincludes any corporation, partnership or party and the heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives of such person to whom the context can apply according to law.\nThat learned judge considered that the effect of this was to abrogate entirely the actio personalis rule in the cases mentioned in s. 3 and that, accordingly, the action could be maintained under the provisions of that Act and that it had been brought in time. Being of this opinion, he did not consider it necessary to consider the point as to the application of s. 71 of The Administration Act.\nIt is pointed out by Robertson J. A. that Lord Campbell's Act was in force in British Columbia up to the year 1897. In the revision of the statutes of that year, most of the provisions of that Act were reenacted in c. 58 and the Imperial Statute repealed to the extent that it was so incorporated in the Revised Statutes or was repugnant thereto by virtue of s-s. 2 of s. 6 of An Act respecting the Revised Statutes of British Columbia passed on May 8, 1897. The Interpretation Act of British Columbia did not apply to the Imperial Statute. As enacted c. 55 did not include s. 5 of c. 93 which, inter alia, declared that the word \"person\" should apply to bodies politic and corporate. Robertson J. A. was of the opinion that the reason for the omission of this part of s. 5 was that, from the date of its enactment, the Act of the Legislature would be construed in accordance with the provisions of The Interpretation Act, and thus that to assign by its terms any extended meaning to the word \"person\" was unnecessary.\nIn Haley v. Brown[15] , the application of s. 71 of The Administration Act to actions brought under The Families' Compensation Act was further considered by a court consisting of Robertson, Sidney Smith and Davey JJ. A.\nThe action was brought by the executrix of Haley's estate against the executor of Brown's estate, the cause of action being damages in respect of his death. In this case there was evidence that Haley and Brown had been killed in the same accident but that the latter had survived Haley by a few minutes. No question of limitation arose in the matter. At the trial, Wood J. followed the decision of Fisher J. in Bowcott v. Westwood and awarded damages and this judgment was upheld by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nRobertson J. A. adhered to the view that he had expressed in Cairney's case and added, as a further reason for holding that the action lay against Brown's executor, that after the decision in Bowcott's case s. 71 of The Administration Act had been reenacted without change in the Revised Statutes of 1948. Since it was to be assumed that the Legislature knew the existing state of the law and the interpretation given to the statute by Fisher J., he considered that the statute should be construed in accordance with the meaning that he had there assigned to it.\nSidney Smith and Davey JJ. A. were both of the opinion that s-s. 3 of s. 71 might properly be invoked to support the claim against the personal representative.\nThe decisive question in the matter is, in my opinion, as it is stated by Sidney Smith J. A. in Haley's case at pp. 10 and 11 of the report. In applying s. 3 of The Families' Compensation Act, the question is who the person wronged could have sued in respect of his injuries had he lived. Against such person, whether the wrongdoer or his personal representative, the action lies at the suit of the personal representative of the one who was wronged on behalf of the dependents, or, in the circumstances mentioned, by the dependents on their own behalf. In the present case, Cairney, if alive, might by virtue of s-s. 3 of s. 71 of The Administration Act have sued MacQueen if he were alive and, if dead, his personal representative, and accordingly this action lies.\nIt is the law as it was at the date of the fatal accident and not as it was at the date of the enactment of The Families' Compensation Act that is to be considered (Littley v. Brooks[16] Robin v. Union Steamship Co.[17] ). Since the question is as to whom Cairney, if living, might at the date of the issue of the writ have sued, the fact that there is no evidence to prove when in relation to the death of Cairney the death of MacQueen occurred does not, in my opinion, affect the matter.\nSince this is decisive of this aspect of the matter, I refrain from expressing any opinion upon the grounds relied upon by Robertson J. A. for his conclusion in this and in Haley's case.\nThere remains the question of the limitation imposed by s-s. 3(b) of s. 1 providing that:\u2014\nNo action shall be brought under the provisions of this subsection after the expiration of six months from the death of the deceased person who committed the wrong.\nMore than six months elapsed between the death of MacQueen and the issue of the writ.\nIn the Court of Appeal neither the Chief Justice or Robertson J. A. expressed any opinion on the point, they having reached their conclusions as to the proper disposition of the matter on other grounds. Sidney Smith J. A. was, however, of the opinion that the six months limitation applied and, accordingly, the action failed.\nS-s. 6 of s. 71 reads:\u2014\nThis section shall be subject to the provisions of s. 12 of The Workmen's Compensation Act and nothing in this section shall prejudice or affect any right of action under the provisions of s. 80 of that Act or the provisions of the Families' Compensation Act. The reference was to s. 80 pf The Workmen's Compensation Act, c. 278 R.S.B.C. 1924, which is now s. 82 of c. 370 R.S.B.C. 1948 and deals with the liability of employers to their workmen in industries not within the scope of Part 1 of the Act, for injuries caused by defective plant or premises or the negligence of other servants of the employer.\nWilson J. was of the opinion that s-s. 6 excluded the limitation provision in s-s. 3 and that, accordingly, the action which was brought within one year from the death of Cairney was not barred. With this conclusion I respectfully agree.\nIt is, in my opinion, inaccurate to say that this action is brought under the provisions of s. 71 of The Administration Act and, indeed, no such action could be brought under those provisions. The action is under The Families' Compensation Act and the only resort to The Administration Act is to ascertain who was the person who would have been liable, if Cairney had not died, for damages in respect to his injuries. The cause of action, as has been pointed out, is not in respect of those injuries but arises solely by reason of his death. In my opinion, while the language of the statute to be construed differs, the principle applied by the Judicial Committee in Gentile's case applies here.\nI also consider that, if it could be invoked, s-s. 6 of s. 71 precludes the application of the limitation provision to this action. I think it cannot be said that a statutory provision which declares that no action shall be brought after the expiration of a period of six months does not affect the right of action under The Families' Compensation Act which, by the terms of that Act, may be brought within a more extended period.\nFor these reasons, I would allow this appeal and restore the order of Wilson J. We were informed at the hearing that, irrespective of the results of this appeal, the parties did not wish us to make any order as to costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting): The relevant facts, the history of the legislation and the course of this litigation are set out in the reasons of my brother Locke.\nIn approaching the question before us, it is, I think, helpful to consider what the position of the parties would have been at common law and the manner in which their rights have been altered by statute. In the view which I take of the whole case, it is immaterial whether the passenger, Cairney, died before or after the pilot, MacQueen, or whether they died simultaneously.\nAt common law it is clear that the appellant would have had no remedy for two reasons, first, the rule stated by Lord Ellenborough in Baker v. Bolten[18] and affirmed by the House of Lords in Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Amerika[19] , that in a civil court the death of a human being cannot be complained of as an injury, and, second, that any right of action arising ex delicto came to an end with the death of the tortfeasor under the maxim, actio personalis moritur cum persona. The question is whether the relevant statutory provisions in force in British Columbia at the date of the passenger's death have removed both of these obstacles from the appellant's path.\nIt is conceded that the first obstacle was removed by Lord Campbell's Act; but, as originally enacted by the Imperial Parliament in 9 and 10 Victoria c. 93, that statute gave the appellant no assistance in regard to the second as the word \"person\" while extended to include bodies politic and corporate was not extended to include the personal representatives of the wrongdoer.\nSection 3 of the Families' Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948 c. 116, which was in force at the date of the passenger's death and has been in its present form for many years, reads as follows:\u2014\n3. Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default, and the act, neglect, or default is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to an indictable offence.\nThe interpretation section of this Act (s. 2) contains no definition of the word \"person\", although, as has already been pointed out, that word was declared in Lord Campbell's Act to apply to bodies corporate. I agree with the view of Robertson J. A. that the reason for this omission was that the legislature regarded the matter as covered by the definition of the word \"person\" in the Interpretation Act. Any other view would bring about the result that in British Columbia a corporation would not be liable to an action under the Families' Compensation Act. Such a result would be inconsistent with the decision in British Electric Railway Company Limited v. Gentile[20] and, so far as I am aware, has never been suggested.\nThe relevant provisions of the Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C., c. 1, appear to me to be the following:\u2014\n2 (1) This Act, and each provision thereof, shall extend and apply to these Revised Statutes, and to every Act passed after these Revised Statutes take effect, and to all Statutes of the Legislature, except in so far as any provision thereof is inconsistent with the intention and object of any Act, or the interpretation that the provision would give to any word, expression, or clause is inconsistent with the context, and except in so far as any provision thereof is in any Act declared not applicable thereto.\n***\n24. In every Act of the Legislature, unless the context otherwise requires:\u2014\n***\n(31) \"Person\" includes any corporation, partnership, or party, and the heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives of such person, to whom the context can apply according to law:\nThe question is whether the word \"person\" in the fifth line of s. 3 of The Families' Compensation Act is to be extended by s. 24 (31) of the Interpretation Act to read \"person and the heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives of such person\". I agree with Robertson J. A. that it should be so extended. I can find nothing in the result brought about by so reading it which is inconsistent with the intention and object of the Families' Compensation Act or would give to the word \"person\" an interpretation inconsistent with the context, to use the words of s. 2, nor does it appear that the context otherwise requires, to use the opening words of s. 24. I am unable to accept the view that the concluding words of clause 31 of s. 24, \"to whom the context can apply according to law\" prevent the application of the clause. As to this Robertson J. A. says:\u2014\nThen as to the objection based upon the expression \"according to law\", I am of the opinion that in passing the Provincial Act the legislature was changing the law, and in so doing was making use of its own Interpretation Act as to the meaning of words used in the Provincial Act so as to shorten the terms of that Act. The learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, in rejecting the argument that clause 31 of s. 24 of the Interpretation Act applies, says:\u2014\nAssuming that the Families' Compensation Act permits this action to be maintainable, it is my view that the phraseology defining \"person\" as the \"person who would have been liable if death had not ensued\" must be construed in this context as excluding the personal representative of the deceased tortfeasor. It seems to me if the legislation intended to abrogate the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona in this type of action it would have plainly said so. The indirect method of abrogating such a common law principle by engrafting an artificial meaning onto the Section by the Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, Ch. 1, is one, with deference, I am unable to accept.\nWith the greatest respect, the last quoted passage appears to me to give insufficient weight to the fact that the passing of the Administration Act Amendment Act, 1934, Statutes of British Columbia, 1934, c. 2 s. 2, brought about, except in cases of defamation, the virtual abolition in British Columbia, of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona. Applying the words of the Families' Compensation Act and of the Interpretation Act to the circumstances of the accident of October 17, 1591, it appears to me that the extended interpretation of the word \"person\" should be adopted, that so doing, far from effecting an abrupt change in the law, brings the Act into harmony with the general law, avoids the creation of anomalies which the Legislature can hardly be supposed to have intended and gives effect to the Families' Compensation Act according to its true intent and meaning. An example of an anomaly which would result from rejecting the view of Robertson J. A. is as follows: Suppose A by one act of negligence causes (i) the death of B who leaves a widow and child, (ii) the destruction of B's motor car, and (iii) personal injuries to C, and that A survives B but dies before action taken; the causes of action under (ii) and (iii) could be pursued against A's personal representatives while that under (i) would perish with him.\nI have not overlooked the difficulty that this reasoning, as to the effect of the Administration Act Amendment Act of 1934 on the construction of the Families' Compensation Act, is subject to the objection that, although there has been no change in the relevant wording of the Families' Compensation Act or the Interpretation Act, it envisages the possibility of those acts being construed after 1934 in a manner different from that in which they would have been construed before that date; but this difficulty is, I think, apparent rather than real. The question being whether the extended meaning attributed to the word \"person\" can apply according to law to the personal representatives of such person after his decease I find no inconsistency in deciding that they can so apply after the abolition of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona as part of the general law of British Columbia even if (a matter which I find it unnecessary to decide) they could not have so applied while that maxim formed part of such general law.\nOnce it has been decided that on its proper construction s. 3 of the Families' Compensation Act gives a right of action not only against \"the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued\" but also against the administrator of such person, it follows that the limitation of six months imposed by s. 71 (3) (b) of the Administration Act has no application to the action before us. The rights of the parties fall to be determined under the Families' Compensation Act, construed as above, and the only relevance of the Administration Act is the assistance which, by reason of the change which is brought about in the general law by the virtual abolition of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona, it affords in the task of construing s. 3 of the Families' Compensation Act.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal, restore the order of Wilson J. and direct, in accordance with the consent of the parties, that there should be no order as to costs in this Court or in the courts below.\nAppeal dismissed; no costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Laskey (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1956: March 2, 5; 1956: May 24.\nPresent: Rand, Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nNegligence\u2014Propane gas heater explosion in rented cabin\u2014Absence of pilot light\u2014Duty of cabin operator\u2014Safety of premises.\nThe respondent brought this action for damages for personal injuries resulting from an explosion which occurred while he was attempting to light a propane gas heater in a cabin rented from the appellant. The cabin was rented at about 8.00 p.m., and the respondent remained in it only a few minutes after being assigned to it. He left and did not return until about 11.00 p.m., whereupon he locked the door and retired for the night. The following morning, he awoke at 6.00 a.m., closed the windows and went back to sleep. When he awoke again at 8.00 a.m., he went to the heater, struck a match to light it and there was an immediate explosion. There was no pilot installed on the heater. The trial judge gave judgment in favour of the respondent and a majority in the Appeal Division found contributory negligence.\nHeld (Locke and Abbott JJ. dissenting): That the appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nPer Rand J.: In the circumstances, it is impossible to draw the inference, as was done by the Appeal Division, that the respondent opened the valve without lighting the gas when he first got up at 6.00 a.m. The omission in duty on the part of the appellant to furnish a reasonably safe heating apparatus by failing to provide a pilot light was a failure in reasonable precaution which drew down liability. That was the initial negligence, and it has not been superseded by any proven act on the part of the respondent or other third person.\nPer Kellock J.: The Appeal Division was not justified in drawing the inference that the respondent probably opened the valve at 6.00 a.m. and did not light the heater. Consequently, since explosive gas was present in the premises, they were not reasonably fit for occupancy, and this was caused by the negligence of the appellant, as the preponderance of probability on all the evidence is to the effect that after demonstrating the heater to the respondent the previous evening he did not leave the valve completely shut off.\nAlthough a person in the position of the appellant is not bound to install the most modern equipment, nevertheless when experience had taught what was demanded for the protection of the public using his cabins, he was bound to adopt those means in order to make his accommodations reasonably safe. There was evidence upon which the finding of both courts below that the appellant failed in the duty incumbent upon him to install pilots, could be founded. Per Cartwright J.: The evidence supported the finding of the Appeal Division that the failure to install a pilot light, which was a cause of the explosion, was a breach of the appellant's duty to make the premises as safe as reasonable care and skill could make them.\nThe other cause was the unexplained escape of gas, a cause for which neither party has been proved to be responsible. The onus of proving contributory negligence rested upon the appellant, and the evidence does not warrant any interference with the finding of the trial judge that this onus was not discharged. Liability, therefore, for the damage caused rested upon the appellant.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): It was not the absence of the pilot light that was the proximate cause of the respondent's injuries but his own act in turning on the gas and failing to light it when he got up at 6.00 a.m.\nPer Abbott J. (dissenting) : The escape of gas was due to the respondent himself turning on the valve between the time it was closed at 8.00 p.m. the previous night and 6.00 a.m. the following morning when he got up for the first time. The courts below were not right in holding that the appellant failed in his duty to respondent in not having the heater equipped with a pilot light as a safety measure. An occupier is not bound to adopt the most recent inventions and devices provided he has done what is ordinarily and reasonably done to ensure safety. The appellant carried out his contractual obligation to take due care that the premises would be reasonably safe for persons using them in the customary manner and with reasonable care.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division 1, reversing, Hughes J.A. dissenting, the judgment at trial.\nN. Carter for the appellant.\nC. J. A. Hughes, Q.C. for the respondent.\nRand J.:\u2014This is an action for damages suffered by the respondent Laskey through an explosion which occurred while he was attempting to light a propane gas stove.\nWith five other persons he had reached the summer cabin property or motel of the appellant Noddin, some five or six miles to the west of Moncton, at about 8.30 on the evening of September 25, 1953. To him was assigned the westerly unit of a duplex cabin, the other unit to a Mr. and Mrs. Fraser and their daughter, and a third cabin to the remaining two ladies of the party. Some minutes after arrival Laskey and the Frasers repaired to the ladies' cabin where they had a lunch and spent the evening until about 10.30 when the four returned to their own quarters and shortly thereafter retired for the night. The Laskey cabin was entered by a door close to the partition wall between the two units. The door swung to the left and just beyond it was a small propane stove approximately 15\" in height; this was fed by a pipe running along the bottom of the division wall from the rear. About in line with the side of the stove the pipe divided by means of a T-joint, one short branch going to the stove and the other passing through the partition wall to be connected with a similar stove in the adjoining unit. The distance from the T-joint to the burner was in the vicinity of 10\". At the end was a valve or cock; at right angles to the pipe horizontally and connected with the valve was what is called an orifice leading into the entrance of the burner a few inches outside the stove. The function of the orifice was not clearly explained, but as Mitton the service manager of the company supplying the stove conceded that if a match was placed at the orifice, some degree of explosion would follow, necessarily at that point there is access from the air to the flow of gas ; and it may be that at that point air is drawn in to produce, in part at least, the mixture with gas required for combustion. In lighting the gas the lighted match should be placed inside the stove through an opening just above the end of the burner and before the valve is opened.\nThe propane, in liquid form under pressure in metal cylinders, reaches the valve as gas. It is of the same family as gasoline with the vapour of which, in its combustion characteristics, it is very similar if not identical. It is, in the words of Dr. Toole, professor of chemistry at the University of New Brunswick, a \"dangerous agency\".\nLaskey says that before going to bed he opened the window in the front wall of the cabin and that of the opposite or rear wall in the bathroom which is slightly to the right of being opposite the entrance door. At 6.00 o'clock next morning he awoke, used the toilet in the bathroom, shut both windows, returned to bed and slept until about 8.00 o'clock. Arising, he drew on his dressing gown, walked around the foot of the bed to a small table beyond the stove, picked up a match and, stooping down toward the valve, lighted it and opened the valve. Exactly where or on what the match was struck is not clear as appears from the following answers: Where did you put that match when you lit it?\nRight down where you are supposed to light one of those stoves.\nWhere are you supposed to light it?\nI assumed down where the pet cock is\u2014where the gas comes in.\nYou didn't know where to light it?\nNo I never lit one before; but that's where you usually do in a gas jet, do you not\u2014apply to the nozzle of the gas jet.\n* * *\nMr. Laskey, if you were wide awake at that time and you lit that stove, you must recall where you put the match?\nI'm telling you I put the match right down that spot where the valve was.\nDid you put it inside the stove or outside?\nI stuck it inside of course.\nBut the \"spot where the valve was\" was not exactly the opening in the side of the stove through which the match should have gone, and there is no nozzle, and it may be that he placed the lighted match at the orifice and not through the small aperture above the burner. Considering what at that moment happened the blurring of this detail in recollection is not to be wondered at.\nThe striking of the match was followed by an explosion which, in a moment, enveloped him in flames. The combustion evidently found its way to different parts of the room in streams, scorching the tops of the curtains on the two windows in the front and side wall respectively and the shower curtain in the bathroom; but, from pictures of the room taken between 11.00 and 12.00 o'clock that morning, the bed clothes and furniture do not appear to have been damaged. The bottom of the wall opposite that of the partition, made of gyprock or like material and of light construction, was blown out some eight or ten inches. The noise was heard by the Frasers who were already up and around and the husband hurriedly breaking open the door of Laskey's cabin found him a mass of burning clothes. These were extinguished and within minutes the injured man was taken to hospital.\nThe combustion of the gas depends upon a minimum degree of temperature and a mixture with air within the limits of approximately 2.4 and 8% of gas. This may be affected by extremes of air pressure or temperature. The gas is heavier than air and slow in diffusion, the direction and extent of which depend largely upon air currents.\nAlong with evidence tending to show that the stove and the piping connection were in proper condition, the case for the defence was that the gas had been turned on unlighted by the respondent when he was up at 6.00 o'clock and that the quantity of gas needed to produce such an explosion could have entered the room between two and three hours with the valve fully open.\nIn describing what had happened at 8.00 o'clock Laskey said:\nI stooped down and I reached in, struck the match and reached in and this explosion took place.\nAs you struck the match?\nYes.\n* * *\nI reached in to touch the pet cock, stuck the match in. That is the nearest recollection I have of it. I can't describe the stove definitely.\n* * *\nWas there any space of time between the lighting of the match and the explosion?\nNo.\n* * *\nNow what did you see take place as the explosion occurred?\nThere was this rush and roar and explosion and flash of flame and I was trying to beat the flames out.\n* * *\nYes, hair was burning, my shoulders burning, my hands burning.\n* * *\nHad you ever had any experience with a propane gas heater before that occasion?\nNo.\n* * *\nI went over and picked up a match, put it in this hand, reached down like that and turned the pet cock, and lit the match at the same time. That is all.\n* * *\nDid you have to turn that little valve all the way around to get the gas?\nI gave it a turn.\nHow much of a turn did you give it?\nI can't tell you.\nDid you smell any gas?\nNo.\nAnd all you recall was a sudden flash?\nAnd a noise.\nOn that contention Michaud C.J. at the trial said:\nOf course, I find that there is no evidence that Laskey did tamper with or try to light the stove, except at 8.00 o'clock in the morning when he got up, and I find that the explosion was caused by an accumulation of gas in the room before Laskey attempted to light the stove. Whatever caused the accumulation is not determined, and I cannot speculate as to how it came about. However, I am certain that had the defendant equipped his stoves with the proper safety gadgets, there would not have been an accumulation of gas in that room nor the explosion. In the Appeal Division Bridges J., with whom Richards C.J. concurred, although holding that Noddin was negligent in not warning Laskey of the danger of the gas and in not explaining the odor given it to enable detection, found that there was evidence from which the inference could be drawn that Laskey \"probably opened the valve without lighting the gas\" and that in his opinion he had done so. Hughes J. does not mention this issue but his reasons are inconsistent with that finding. In these circumstances, that question of fact must be faced by this Court.\nThat Laskey, when fully awake, knew the stove was heated by gas that had to be lighted is indisputable; his action at 8.00 o'clock puts this beyond question. The conclusion of Bridges J. necessarily implies that at 6.00 o'clock either he was so drowsy that, although in the somewhat chilly room he was able to go to the bathroom and to close the two windows by different means, both of which he correctly recalled at the trial over one year later, he was not alive to the fact that the stove burned gas that had to be lighted with a match and acted on a hazy notion of turning on heat as on an electric stove, or that having turned on the gas he forgot to light it or that he did not realize the gas for some reason had not caught fire. It means also that two hours later he had no recollection of having been or done anything at or to the stove.\nHis evidence shows that for many years he had worked as a certified drug clerk in the course of which he had used Swedish burners which are primed by spirits and burn paraffin oil; he had, in earlier years, been an active athlete; that, as the window opening indicates, he was accustomed to sleep in fresh air; and that at 72 years of age he was a fairly vigorous and mentally alert person, his answers being short and directly to the point of the questions. In these circumstances, and with Michaud C.J., I cannot draw such a violent inference as we are asked to draw. He categorically denies that he had then touched the stove and to have been sufficiently awakened and alive in the cool air to have done what he did, excludes for me what is conjectured. His evidence that he opened the valve at 8.00 o'clock, if true, is conclusive against it, and I am unable to infer that, clear enough in mind to apprehend the operation of the valve, he was not clear enough to appreciate the requirement of the match. That he would at 6.00 a.m. turn on the heat in the small room, 10' x 10' x 8', with windows closed, when he had still two hours for sleeping, is in the highest degree unlikely.\nThe further question remains whether there was a negligent omission in duty to furnish a reasonably safe heating apparatus by failing to provide a pilot light, a device that would have cost between $10 and $15. By its small continuing flame, it would have made such an explosion impossible. The use of the device in these stoves has become general; they had been installed by Noddin in 1952 in another set of cabins east of Moncton owned by him. Fourteen months after the mishap he said \"Well, they are now installing these pilots in practically all stoves, I guess, that are being sold\" and by then he had added pilots to the cabins in question.\" These facts put their desirability and practicability beyond controversy. They furnish both convenience and protection to guests. Protection is particularly needed and effective in rooms used by the travelling public, many, if not the majority, of whom have never before used a gas stove. Mrs. Fraser was so much afraid of it that the stove in her cabin remained untouched. Noddin testified that he had lighted the stoves and explained the mode of lighting to both the respondent and the Frasers and had called their attention to the pungent and distinctive odor of the gas and the necessity of not turning it on before applying the match. The gas is naturally odorless and odorization is for the purpose of arousing notice of its presence. Laskey denied that he saw Noddin light the stove or do anything at it; he says he remained in the cabin only a minute or two, long enough to get his things off and his baggage set down. The instructions and warnings also he denied. The Frasers denied that the stove was lighted and that any instruction or warnings were given; and it is significant that neither of them was cross-examined on either point. I entertain no doubt that the stove in neither cabin was lighted by the occupant during the evening and the remark of Noddin that \"they all, I think, had their stove on that particular night\" indicates irresponsibility in statement. He added that as a rule he told guests that there was no pilot light for the burner, advice which indicates recognition of the practical need of that safeguard. Mitton admitted that in all cases he would warn purchasers of lurking danger, of the distinctive odor by which the gas could be detected, and would show them how to light the burner. The gas has been used in the Moncton area for about six years and when the stoves were to be used in public places he recommended pilot lights. He stressed the danger of lighting the gas at the orifice but it is not claimed by Noddin that warning against this was given Laskey or that he was specifically shown just where the lighted match should be placed.\nThe acknowledgment by both Noddin and Mitton of the inherent and invisible dangers associated with this gas, as with gasoline vapour, is confirmation, if any is required, of the necessity to surround such a heater with every practicable security. That need is particularly indicated here. Excluding Laskey's opening the valve at 6.00 o'clock, the cause is a mystery. Assuming, as Noddin claims, that he lighted the stove or went near it with that in mind in Laskey's presence in the evening, did he then close the valve tight when shutting the stove off? or was it inadvertently left slightly open or was the closing made in such a manner as to put out the flame but still allow a small stream to run all night? Or if he had turned on but not lighted the burner and in the hurry had not fully closed it? If the machine test was absolute, why the soap and water test? He was in the cabins only briefly as all the occupants were going out immediately, and these questions point to situations of possible and puzzling accumulations of gas from which the necessity for pilot lights in large part arises. The trial judge expressed himself as finding that the plaintiff \"had failed to satisfy him\" that the propane gas heater was defective or not reasonably safe \"to the knowledge of the defendant\" or that Noddin was \"negligent in assigning\" the premises to the plaintiff. He added:\nIf the heater and pipe connections were in good order immediately after the incident, it is a fair inference that they were before the explosion in good condition, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\nBut this, apart from the limitation to \"the knowledge of the defendant\", does not touch the possibilities suggested, as to the realities of any of which Noddin might have been quite unaware and quite honest in his testimony. The rule governing acts of omission of this sort was laid down by Lord Dunedin in Morton v. William Dixon, Ltd. 2 thus:\n\"Where the negligence of the employer consists of what I may call a fault of omission, I think it is absolutely necessary that the proof of that fault of omission should be one of two kinds, either\u2014to show that the thing which he did not do was a thing which was commonly done by other persons in like circumstances, or\u2014to show that it was a thing which was so obviously wanted that it would be folly in anyone to neglect to provide it\".\nwhich was paraphrased by Lord Normand in Paris v. Stepney Borough Council 3 in these words:\nIf there is proof that a precaution is usually observed by other persons, a reasonable and prudent man will follow the usual practice in the like circumstances. Failing such proof the test is whether the precaution is one which the reasonable and prudent man would think so obvious that it was folly to omit it.\nThis, in substance, was approved in Morris v. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company4.\nBoth the trial court and the Appeal Division have held that the omission was a failure in reasonable precaution which drew down liability and with that I agree. The case is thus similar to Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited v. Collins et al. 5. Here there was negligence on the part of the gas company in installing a safety valve with an emission direct into the shop instead of into the open air. The company had contended that the cause of the accident had been a tampering with the machine by other workmen; but on the evidence the Judicial Committee held the true cause of the escape of the gas to be left in doubt. All that could be said was that the escape had taken place at the safety valve which, in turn, could have been caused through at least two possible conditions. In the language of Lord Dunedin the Committee held that\nThe gas company have failed to show that the proximate cause of the accident was the act of a subsequent conscious volition and that, there being initial negligence found against them, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.\nIn this case it is assumed that the gas escaped through the pipe leading to the burner and that the explosion would have been prevented by a pilot light; and the purpose of the latter is to meet generally the danger of escape. That being the initial negligence, it has not been superseded by any proven act on the part of the respondent or other third person.\nIt was on the assumption that Laskey had carelessly opened the valve that he was charged in Appeal with 30% of responsibility; but, rejecting that, the consequences to which the omission led must be charged against Noddin alone.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal, allow the cross-appeal and restore the judgment at trial with costs both in the Appeal Division and in this Court.\nKellock J.:\u2014As the learned trial judge found that the escape of gas into the room occupied by the respondent was not due to any defect in the stove or its connections (a. situation which was at least tacitly accepted at the trial by the respondent), and as it is not suggested by either party that the stove was interfered with by any third person, the issue was accurately stated by the learned judge as follows:\nWho did open the gas jet and leave it open without producing a flame?\nAfter stating that the respondent had \"failed to satisfy\" him that the appellant had negligently left the valve open or been guilty of any positive act of negligence causing the escape of the gas, he went on to find that\nOf course, I find that there is no evidence that Laskey did tamper with or try to light the stove, except at 8.00 o'clock in the morning when he got up, and I find that the explosion was caused by an accumulation of gas in the room before Laskey attempted to light the stove.\nThe learned judge then said:\nWhatever caused the explosion is not determined, and I cannot speculate as to how it came about.\nThe learned judge considered that there was a duty on the part of the appellant toward persons such as the respondent to have the premises \"absolutely safe\" and that he had failed in that duty by reason of the fact that the stove was not equipped with a pilot light. In the result, judgment-was given against the appellant for the full amount of the respondent's damages.\nAs a pilot light would have furnished no protection except in the case of gas escaping through the burner itself (it would merely have brought about an explosion if gas were elsewhere escaping into the room once an explosive mixture came in contact with its flame), the judgment pronounced involves a finding that the escape of gas was due to the valve having been left open but that this was not imputable to either party. The judgment is therefore contradictory.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal concurred in the view that the appellant had been guilty of negligence in failing to have the stove equipped with a pilot light. Upon the footing that there was no defect in the stove or its fittings and that the appellant had not left the valve open the previous evening, they, however, drew the inference that the respondent \"probably\" had opened the valve when he got up at 6.00 a.m. but did not light the stove. They were also of opinion that the appellant had failed to explain to the respondent the operation of the heater as well as the danger of propane gas and its odour. In this court, however, it was admitted by counsel for the respondent that the appellant had, as he testified, instructed the respondent the previous evening both how to operate and to light the stove. It was also admitted that the respondent knew how to do this although he had never actually lit such a stove before. This, however, leaves the finding that the appellant failed to warn the respondent with respect to the odour of the gas and the significance of the presence of such odour. The Court of Appeal considered that the learned trial judge had been of the same opinion.\nThe vital question in the appeal is, therefore, as to whether or not the court below was justified in drawing any inference against the respondent. In determining this issue, the appellant takes the position that this court is in as good a position as was the trial judge.\nWith respect to the inference drawn below against the respondent, I confess to having been attracted by it but further consideration has caused me to change my mind for the reasons which follow. It is first to be observed that no such allegation was put forward in the statement of defence. While the statement of claim specifically pleads that \"the defendant negligently left open the valve in the propane gas heater and allowed the gas to escape into the cabin\", the appellant merely denies that the respondent's injury was occasioned \"by any act or negligence\" on the part of the appellant. The sole allegation of negligence made against the respondent is that he did not exercise sufficient care \"in turning on\" the valve on the propane gas heater. This allegation, in its context, can relate only to the allegation in the statement of claim that the explosion had occurred when the respondent had \"turned on a valve in a propane gas heater kept for the purpose of heating the cabin assigned to the Plaintiff, and forthwith struck a match.\" This, of course, was at 8.00 a.m. Had it been intended to allege that the respondent had turned on the valve at an earlier hour but failed to light the burner, there is no question but that such conduct would, as it should, have been expressly alleged.\nNot until the appellant was in the witness-box was this theory put forward, and then only in answer to a question in cross-examination. At that stage the respondent was deprived of all opportunity of dealing with such an allegation by adducing evidence with regard to it. As will appear, such an allegation could only be effectively dealt with by evidence, including expert evidence. It is noteworthy that at this stage of the trial the only remaining witness was the appellant's expert. He, however, was not examined with regard to this matter, as I shall point out.\nAs to his conduct on getting up at 6.00 a.m., the respondent testified in chief:\nQ. Now were you up in the night?\nA. Not until I got\u2014I imagine somewhere around 6.00 o'clock.\nQ. You got up at that time?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And what did you do?\nA. I went to the toilet and I closed the windows.\nQ. Both windows?\nA. Both windows.\nQ. Yes. Touch the stove at that time?\nA. No, didn't look at it. Went back to bed.\nIn cross-examination:\nQ. You told us this morning you got up around 6.00 o'clock in the morning?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you smell anything in the cabin at that time?\nA. No.\nQ. And did you have any cigarettes?\nA. Some in my pocket, or some on the table.\nQ. Did you smoke any?\nA. No.\nQ. Are you sure?\nA. Positive, because I had no occasion to. I simply went to the toilet and went back to bed, closed the windows\u2014went right back to bed.\nQ. Why did you get up, was it you had to go to the bathroom?\nA. Yes. Q. Is that what caused you to get up?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And it was then you discovered that you might be chilly, and you closed the windows; is that it?\nA. I closed the windows, yes.\nQ. But it wasn't the cold\u2014\nA. It wasn't so cold I had to close them, no.\nQ. But you did get up and close the windows. Did you go near the stove?\nA. Not then, no.\nQ. When you got up at 6.00 o'clock in the morning?\nA. No.\nThe learned trial judge appears, from the way in which he expressed himself on the point as already quoted, to have had no doubt whatever with respect to the acceptance of this evidence.\nIn the inquiry as to whether upon all the evidence an inference sufficiently strong arises to displace the denial of the respondent thus accepted by the tribunal of fact, it is to be observed in the first place that the appellant did not produce evidence as to whether, after the explosion, the valve was wholly or partly open, nor did he give any explanation of the absence of such evidence although he testified that he had arrived at the cabin about 8.30 a.m., which would be within a half hour of the explosion. At that time he found a Mr. Sullivan outside the cabin. The two entered and, according to the appellant, found the stove turned off. Sullivan was not called nor did the appellant give any evidence as to any attempt made to ascertain if anyone had previously entered the cabin or interfered with the valve. The respondent was unable to say what was the position of the valve at the time he attempted to light the stove at 8.00 a.m., nor how much of a turn he had given it. In view of his experience of that morning, this is not surprising.\nIn the second place there is a consideration which, in my view, renders the theory upon which the court below proceeded extremely unlikely. The appellant's witness, Mitton, whose qualification to give opinion evidence was based solely on his being the \"service manager\" of the company which had supplied the appellant with cylinders of the propane gas in question, testified as follows:\nQ. And isn't it true that persons have been suffocated in bedrooms in the presence of propane gas?\nA. For the lack of oxygen, yes. Q. If the air in the room were displaced to a sufficient extent by propane gas, suffocation might result?\nA. Mmmm.\nQ. And I take from what you say that the odor of propane gas would not be sufficiently pungent to bring about the awakening of a sleeping person in a room such as that?\nA. Go over that one again please.\n(Reporter read the question aloud)\nWITNESS: No. The odor in the gas is definitely not an alarm clock \u2014wouldn't wake him up.\nNo other evidence was adduced on this aspect. In my opinion, before any such inference as has been drawn by the court below could properly be drawn, there should have been further evidence. As already pointed out, the respondent had no opportunity of adducing it and in the present state of the record I find it difficult to believe that the respondent would not, sleeping in the room for two hours with the windows closed and the jet open, have felt some effects of the gas, if he were not asphyxiated. It was for the appellant to adduce evidence to remove this difficulty. Any inference which, in my opinion, is to be drawn as the case was left, supports the evidence of the respondent that he did not touch the stove until 8.00 o'clock.\nThat being so, there appears to be no answer to the action in the circumstances. Unquestionably, explosive gas was present. The premises were, therefore, not reasonably fit for occupancy, which is the test rather than any absolute duty as was the view of the learned trial judge. Moreover, the last person to handle the valve was the appellant the previous evening when he introduced the respondent into the premises. The question arises, therefore, as to whether there was any negligence on his part.\nIn reaching the conclusion that the appellant had left the valve completely closed, the learned judge would appear to have proceeded upon the inference which he considered was to be drawn from the evidence and he relied heavily upon his view of certain evidence given by Mitton. His reasoning sufficiently appears from the following:\nMitton testified that in order to fill with gas that cabin occupied by the plaintiff, the jet must have been open 2 to 3 hours. The plaintiff says that his sense of smell is and was good. Mitton says that if the gas jet had been left open at 8.00 o'clock in the evening by the defendant, Laskey would have sensed the odor of gas when he came in at 11.00 o'clock, even if the room was not completely filled with gas. Mitton further states that had gas been escaping from the jet from between the hours of 8.00 and 11.00, when Laskey came back, the spark caused by the turning on the electric switch would likely have lighted the gas if it had been present.\nMitton testified that all gas sold commercially by his company and supplied to the defendant's cabins contained a mixture which developed a strong odor of rotten vegetables and was purposely added to the liquid gas in order to enable people to detect it when present in the air and not burning. On the other hand, had Laskey turned on the gas at 6.00 o'clock in the morning, if the odor of escaped gas had not suffocated him during the two hours that he went back to sleep, he most certainly would have sensed the presence of gas when he got up at 8.00 o'clock.\nLaskey, although he claims that his sense of smell was good, says that he never smelled any abnormal odor at any time while he was in the cabin.\nAccording to Mitton, there is no possibility that sufficient gas would have escaped within the few seconds that elapsed between the time that Laskey turned on the gas, lighted the match and put it into the orifice of the stove, to cause an explosion with such force that would cause the damage that was occasioned.\nThere is no indication that when Laskey and Noddin entered the cabin for the first time at 8.00 o'clock in the evening on September 25 that either smelted or sensed any gas escaping or being in the cabin.\nThe Plaintiff has failed to satisfy me by evidence that the propane gas heater in the cabin was defective or was not reasonably safe, to the knowledge of the defendant, at the time that he assigned the cabin to the plaintiff, and that the defendant was negligent in assigning such premises to the plaintiff. If the heater and the pipe connections were in good order immediately after the incident, it is a fair inference that they were before the explosion in good condition, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.\nThe plaintiff has also failed to satisfy me that the defendant negligently left open the valve in the propane gas heater and thus allowed the gas to escape into the cabin. The defendant is positive that he closed the valve when he turned the heat off. The plaintiff did not sense any gas odor in the cabin at any time after the defendant had left, nor was there any explosion when he turned on the light switch, nor at any time during the night until 8.00 o'clock in the morning.\nI fail to find any positive act of negligence on the part of the defendant Noddin which would have caused the gas to escape and the consequent explosion and damage to the plaintiff. Neither can I find that the defendant was negligent in not detecting any defect that there might have been in the gas stove fixtures or the stove itself. There is no evidence that there were any.\nThere is, in a number of respects, in my opinion, misconception on the part of the learned judge of Mitton's evidence. In the first place, the witness did not at all deal with \"that cabin occupied by the plaintiff\" under the conditions existing daring the night in question. He did not know its size, and knowledge of its exact size was, on his own evidence, a prerequisite to the formation of any opinion as to the amount of gas which would gather during any given period. Nor did the witness know, nor was any evidence given, as to the conditions prevailing during the night in question, nor as to the tightness of the windows and door, nor as to the materials or method of construction of the cabin. The following evidence given by the witness in chief is illustrative and clearly indicates that he had not taken any measurements:\nQ. How much gas would there have to be in the room to create \"a serious explosion?\nA. In a room, let me see, 8 by 10\u2014say a room with 1,200 cubic feet, you would have to have\u2014let's see\u2014if you take a room 1,200 cubic feet\u2014 take somewhere around Si hours to get enough for an explosive mixture.\nQ. That is, any explosive mixture?\nA. Yes. To get an explosive mixture to cause serious damage, yes. How did you word that again?\nQ. What quantity of gas would be required to cause a minor explosion? And you might tell us from there the various amounts and the seriousness of the explosion that could occur?\nA. Naturally, the more gas let out in a room, the larger your explosion is going to be because your gas-air ratio\u2014that is, the mixture of air required with the gas is 24 to 1. So it all depends on the size of your room and how much gas is being let in that room governs the time that it would take to get an explosive mixture.\nThe appellant gave evidence as to the size of the cabin as follows:\nA. Could be 10 by 12.\nQ. 8 feet in height?\nA. 8 feet in height, yes. I imagine 10 by 10 would be handier probably.\nNotwithstanding his lack of knowledge of measurements and other essential facts, Mitton further testified in chief as follows:\nQ. Now Mr. Mitton, in a room the size of that cabin with the burner or the valve turned on, how long would it take for sufficient gas to escape which would cause an explosion?\nA. That is if the valve was wide open?\nQ. Wide open first.\nA. In a cabin that size, would take anywhere from 2\u00bd to 3 hours. 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd hours.\nQ. To obtain an explosion?\nA. Mmmm.\nQ. And if the valve was only turned partly opened, then I presume it would take a considerably longer period of time?\nA. Right.\nShortly after, he amplified this evidence as follows:\nQ. And an explosion of this type, how long would the valve have to be opened?\nA. Well until the room was filled up with an explosive mixture. That would take anywhere from 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd hours. It all would depend on the ventilation of the cabin, how tight the cabin was, how tight around the windows, how well\u2014how tight it was around the door. Q. Now you heard Mr. Laskey state that he had arisen at 6.00 o'clock or approximately 6.00 o'clock in the morning, closed his windows in the cabin. Therefore the cabin was closed. How long would it take in a cabin that size for that explosive mixture to be created?\nA. If the valve was wide opened, it would take from 2\u00bd to 3 hours to get an explosive mixture. That would have to be figured out on the exact size of the cabin and the leakage around the doors and windows to put the exact time on it.\nQ. And if there was leakage around the doors and the windows, then it would take longer?\nA. That's right. It would take longer.\nQ. And the 2\u00bd hour period approximately that you were referring to would be under ideal conditions?\nA. Mmmm.\nQ. That is no leaks?\nA. No air movement at all.\nThe learned trial judge was therefore completely in error in proceeding upon the footing that \"Mitton testified that in order to fill with gas that cabin occupied by the plaintiff, the jet must have been open 2 to 3 hours.\"\nThe evidence of Mitton in which he reduced the period to 2 to 3 hours rather than the 2\u00bd to 3 or 3\u00bd already given by him more than once, is contained in a later portion of his evidence in chief as follows:\nQ. And under ideal conditions, with no escape of gas in the room that size, how long would it take for sufficient gas to escape to create an explosion of that import?\nA. Roughly 2\u00bd to 3 hours \u00bd. Yes, you could pin that down in the vicinity of 2 to 3 hours.\nAs already mentioned, the actual conditions prevailing in the cabin, including the tightness or otherwise of the door and window openings, the type of walls or the weather on the night in question were not gone into. The above evidence, on its face, cannot be relied upon for the purpose for which the learned judge at trial used it.\nIt is clear, moreover, that the witness's knowledge as to the proportions of air and gas required to give an explosive mixture to which he testified above is not accurate. Dr. Toole, head of the Chemistry Department of the University of New Brunswick, testified that the limits within which propane gas and air will explode are from a low of 2.4% by volume of propane gas in a mixture the balance of which is air, to an upper limit of 7% or 8%. If there be any excess beyond this, the mixture will not explode. In an attempt to negative a finding that the appellant had left the valve open the previous evening, counsel for the latter put the following to the witness:\nQ. Now Mr. Mitton, if the\u2014this is a hypothetical question. If the gas in that particular cabin had been turned on full\u2014opened wide at 8.00 o'clock in the evening and left on until 6.00 o'clock in the morning, what quantity of gas would be in that room?\nA. There would be enough gas in that room, and you would have to go back to the doors and windows, if the room being airtight\u2014if the gas had been left on that length of time, you would not have had an explosive mixture. You would be on your high limit of explodability.\nIf, as the witness had previously said, it would have taken from 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd hours or even 2 to 3 hours to produce \"any\" explosive mixture in the room, that is 2.47% of gas, it is difficult to credit the statement that in a period of 10 hours with the valve \"opened wide\" the concentration of gas in the room would not have reached a point beyond 7 or 8%. To my mind, this evidence indicates that the witness was purporting to speak about matters in which he was not in fact skilled. Mitton testified further:\nQ. Now Mr. Mitton, if the gas had been turned on full at 8.00 o'clock in the evening and was left on, that is in an enclosed room\u2014left on until approximately 10.30 or 11.00 in the evening, and then the windows were opened, would that gas escape?\nA. A good deal of it would eventually when the room got filled up to your window level\u2014it definitely would go out. There is no doubt about that; but if that gas was left on from 8.00 o'clock until 11.00\u2014\nQ. From 8.00 o'clock until approximately 11.00 with the windows closed?\nA. If there had been any fire or spark in that room in that length of time, you would have had your explosion then, such as a light switch or cigarette being smoked; you would have your explosion then, because in that length of time you would have an explosive mixture in the room with the windows closed.\nQ. Would there be enough in there in that period of time to create an explosion of the same force as created the damage in this instance?\nA. Yes, because\u2014yes, there would be. It would cause damage of that \u2014just about the same as that.\nQ. And an electric switch turned on in that period of time around 10.30 to 11.00 o'clock would cause the same effect?\nA. Unless it was an explosive-proof switch, yes, in the cabins; and as a rule they don't use explosive-proof switches unless it is around gas premises.\nCounsel, and no doubt the witness, had in view the fact that the respondent had returned to the room between 10.00 and 11.00 p.m., put on the light, opened the windows and smoked. The above evidence may be usefully compared with evidence given by Dr. Toole:\nQ. One other thing, Doctor, in order to cause combustion with a gas such as propane in mixture, is it necessary that the gas come in contact with an open flame or something of that nature?\nA. At least part of it must be heated to a sufficiently high temperature to ignite. For each set of conditions, there is a temperature of ignition which is necessary to raise part of the mixture to in order that ignition may take place.\nQ. And I take it this is true, that the gas\u2014the mere fact that the propane gas is present in a room under any circumstances other than at the proper temperature could not produce either fire or explosion?\nA. No. That is correct.\nAgain:\nQ. \u2026 Now Doctor, you have stated that in order for there to be an explosion, this gas must be ignited by a flame.\nA. No, I didn't say it must be ignited. It must be raised to a certain temperature. In other words, the temperature of ignition. It could be done by a hot wire or by an electric spark.\nQ. That is precisely the question I wish to ask you, Doctor. In the event that an explosive mixture was within the confined space that I have already mentioned, and an electric light switch is turned on, it is possible that the spark from that switch could ignite the mixture and cause an explosion?\nA. If the switch was defective, you mean?\nQ. If the switch was defective.\nA. Oh yes.\nQ. Because ordinarily there is a slight spark in most switches at the time they're depressed or pushed in. There is a sparak. That spark within that confined area\u2014that simple little spark would be sufficient to cause an explosion?\nA. If it were\u2014if the gas surrounding it had the correct mixture.\nThus, unless the right mixture happened to be at the point of the spark or flame, there would be no explosion. He also said:\nIf you were to fill the whole room with a mixture of say 10% propane and 90% air, it would not explode.\nUnless, therefore, the proper condition had been present in the right place when the respondent returned to his room on the evening previous to the explosion, his putting on of the light or his smoking would not have produced an explosion. Again, it is to be remembered that the situation put to the witness Mitton as to the quantity of gas present at that time was on the footing that the valve was fully open, as to which there was no evidence. Mitton was also asked his opinion as to the situation which would have existed if, with the valve fully open from 8.00 to 11.00 p.m., and the windows closed, the windows were then opened and left open until 6.00 a.m. In answer he testified as follows:\nQ. Now with the windows opened\u2014or shall we say with the windows closed at 8.00 o'clock in the evening, the gas valve open, and left opened until approximately 11.00 o'clock at night, and then at 11.OO o'clock at night the windows are opened and left open until 6.00 o'clock, what would be the condition of the room at 6.00 o'clock in the morning?\nA. That is with the gas valve opened?\nQ. With the gas valve opened\u2014the windows opened.\nA. You would have had an explosive mixture below your window level, yes, below your window levels, you would have definitely had an explosive mixture. The rest would pretty well clear itself out, but propane \u2014being heavier than air, it has a tendency to hang towards the floor or the ground.\nQ. And then at 6.00 o'clock in the morning if the windows are closed and the valve is still left opened?\nA. The rest of your room fills up with gas.\nQ. And would there still be an explosive mixture at 8.00 o'clock in the morning.\nA. Definitely explosive mixture at 8.00 o'clock in the morning.\nAgain, it is incomprehensible to my mind why, if an explosive mixture would, in the opinion of the witness, be produced in the room with the valve open from 2 to 3 hours, the limits of explodability would not have been exceeded in an additional 9 hours.\nIn cross-examination Mitton was asked to deal with the situation where the valve was only partially open. He testified:\nQ. Now if that heater had been turned on at 8.00 or half-past 8.00 in the evening, closed off at half-past 10.00 with the valve only partially open, I take it it is quite possible that an explosive mixture had not been reached?\nA. It would all depend on how far open the valve was.\nAnd again:\nQ. And taking the same conditions with the burner partially opened at say 8.00 or 8.30 o'clock in the evening, the burner not being again touched until a quarter to 8.00 the following morning, and the windows\u2014 front and back opened up for a period from half-past 10.00 until 6.00 o'clock in the morning, is it quite possible that there is a certain position at which that valve could be set which would not reach an explosive mixture until it had been\u2014until the windows had been closed up for an hour and one-half?\nA. You would have to know the position of that valve before you could make any statement to that effect. Q. Yes; but of course I take it that that is possible, there is a position in which it could have been left where the explosive mixture would have been created by closing the windows say an hour and one-half to an hour three-quarters before the explosion occurred?\nA. The time limit would be lengthened, would be all.\nFor my part, I am unable to rely on the evidence of this witness as justifying the view that the cabin was free of gas before the morning when the explosion occurred. There is therefore not the same difficulty in drawing the inference that the appellant did not leave the valve completely shut off after demonstrating the stove to the respondent the previous evening as there is in accepting the respondent's evidence that he did not open it in the morning until 8.00 a.m. It is quite true that Mitton testified that the stove would have continued to burn if the valve had not been turned completely off but I cannot place the same confidence in this evidence as I would have otherwise been able to do had not his evidence on other points to which I have referred, been unsatisfactory. Moreover, no evidence was given as to whether the valve turned easily or not and it is quite possible that although the appellant may have shut it off, he had opened it partially in removing his hand. It was possible in the very act of withdrawing his hand to have opened it to some extent if the valve were not firmly seated. Undoubtedly there was gas in explosive quantity present at 8.00 a.m. Any other explanation for its presence having been negatived, the only conclusion to which I can come on the evidence is that in some such way the valve had been left open to some degree by the appellant. The preponderance of probability on all the evidence is to this effect rather than to support the appellant's theory that the valve had been opened wide at 6.00 a.m. and so left until 8.00 a.m., thus furnishing the minimum period for \"any\" explosion to take place even if one were to overlook the absence of the \"ideal\" conditions which the evidence called by the appellant stipulated.\nThe fact that the respondent at no time smelled gas is, at first blush, surprising, but that aspect of the case is not left completely without explanation. In the course of his evidence as to the situation existing in the room in his view the previous evening with the valve wide open, Mitton had testified:\nA. But you would definitely get the smell of propane there.\nQ. If you knew the smell of propane.\nA. You would definitely get a peculiar smell there then.\nQ. But of course that would mean something to one who was familiar with the smell of propane; that would be part of your premise, I assume?\nA. Possibly, yes.\nQ. But for one who did not, it wouldn't necessarily be a warning, would it?\nA. I would think the curiosity of the party smelling something like that would be investigated.\nIt may very well be that if, with a slow leak, the respondent had been smoking when he returned to his room in the evening and opened the windows as he did, he might not have noticed a smell as to which he had not been put on notice. His failure to smell the odour in the morning may be due to the fact that his olfactory sense had been dulled by reason of having slept in the fouled atmosphere. There is evidence of Mitton which has a bearing on this. He testified:\nQ. You told my learned friend that it would be impossible not to smell propane gas under the circumstances which were necessary, I take it, to bring about an explosion. Is that correct?\nA. If your sense of smell is acute.\nQ. Are you suggesting that Mr. Laskey perceived the smell of gas in that stove and went out and lit a match?\nA. It would be impossible to be in that room with a keen sense of smell and that amount of gas\u2014an explosive mixture in the room\u2014and not smell. It would be impossible, if you were awake.\nQ. Now what factors do you suggest must have been present in this case which resulted in Mr. Laskey lighting a match in the presence of an explosive mixture of propane gas?\nA. Possibility of not being too wide awake, and not investigating peculiar smells.\nIt is, moreover, the fact that the respondent struck a match at 8.00 a.m. to light the stove which he would hardly have done had he appreciated any danger. As Mitton said:\nQ. And for a person who failed to perceive the presence of gas through the odour, he might well make the mistake and strike a match within that explosive mixture.\nA. Mmmm. Certainly, anyone would.\nAs to the absence of a pilot light, it is clear that had the stove been so equipped, the explosion could not have taken place. As to whether or not there was a duty resting upon the appellant to have had the heater in the cabin so equipped, the appellant's own evidence is relevant. In cross-examination, he testified as follows:\nQ. Now you were aware, I assume, that propane gas is an inflammable and explosive substance?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And I suppose you also knew as a proprietor of overnight accommodation that all persons did not know the characteristics of propane gas?\nA. Well I suppose there would be a lot that didn't know.\nQ. There wouldn't be any question about that, would there?\nA. No. That's right.\nQ. And I assume that you felt there was some duty on your part to warn your customers of what you had in those cabins for heating?\nA. After dealing with the public, I would say yes.\n* * *\nQ. Do you tell them anything about the nature of the protection on the valve?\nA. I tell them it must be on\u2014lighted when they turn it on, and each time they turn it on, they must light the stove.\nQ. Why do you tell them that?\nA. Well some people are awful stupid. You would have to\u2014I don't know why I tell them that. I really don't know. I know the nature of propane gas, of any gas. We have handled natural gas in our home for years and years and years, and naturally we have to light it every time we put it on and so on; and I took it for granted I tell people these stoves must be lighted when they are turned on, and each time they turn them off they must light them again if they turn them on.\nQ. Why do you tell them that?\nA. I suppose it is for their protection.\nQ. Protection from what?\nA. In case it had been turned on and not lighted, which would be a simple thing for anyone to do, but they might do it.\n* * *\nQ. What is the purpose of the pilot?\nA. The purpose of the pilot, well it is a convenience to the public. They don't have to bother lighting them any more, and the stove remains lit at all times\u2014turn them on and turn them off.\nQ. Does it serve any other purpose?\nA. Well it is a\u2014yes, it is a protection.\nAlthough a person in the position of the appellant is not bound to install the most modern equipment, nevertheless when experience had taught what was demanded for the protection of the public using his cabins, the appellant was bound to adopt those means in order to make his accommodations reasonably safe. There was, therefore, in my opinion, evidence upon which the finding of both courts below that the appellant failed in a duty incumbent upon him, namely, to install pilots, could be founded. I would therefore dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal, both with costs here and in the Court of Appeal. The judgment pronounced by the learned trial judge should be restored.\nLocke J. (dissenting): The evidence given at the trial has been reviewed in other reasons to be delivered in this matter.\nThe appellant swore that when he took the respondent to the cabin he explained to him the operation of the gas stove and, at the latter's request, turned it on and lit it and then, on his direction, turned it off, the respondent saying that he was going out. The respondent, giving evidence in chief, directly contradicted this, saying that nothing was said at the time about the stove and that he had not seen the appellant light it. Cross-examined as to a statement made on his examination for discovery where he had said that the appellant could have lit the stove, he said:\u2014\nHe could have lit it and he could not have (sic). I couldn't swear to it. I couldn't say he did light it; I did not see him.\nUpon this issue, it would appear that the learned trial judge believed the evidence of the appellant that he had lighted the stove, a passage from his reasons reading:\u2014\nThe plaintiff has also failed to satisfy me that the defendant negligently left open the valve in the propane gas heater and thus allowed the gas to escape into the cabin. The defendant is positive that he closed the valve when he turned the heat off. The plaintiff did not sense any gas odour in the cabin at any time after the defendant had left, nor was there any explosion when he turned on the light switch, nor at any time during the night until 8.00 o'clock in the morning.\nI fail to find any positive act of negligence on the part of the defendant Noddin which would have caused the gas to escape and the consequent explosion and damage to the plaintiff.\nThe only time that the parties were together in the cabin was the occasion above referred to.\nThere was uncontradicted evidence given by the witness Mitton, the representative of the company which supplied the stove and attachments to the appellant, that some two hours after the explosion he tested the stove and the fittings and those in the adjoining room, including the connections leading to the pressure tank outside the building, applying what was described as the pressure test and the soap and water test, and found there were no leaks of any kind, the witness saying also that, with the valve closed, it would not be possible for any gas to escape.\nThe learned trial judge appears to have accepted this evidence without question, saying as to this:\u2014\nThe plaintiff has failed to satisfy me by evidence that the propane gas heater in the cabin was defective or was not reasonably safe, to the knowledge of the defendant, at the time that he assigned the cabin to the plaintiff, and that the defendant was negligent in assigning such premises to the plaintiff. If the heater and the pipe connections were in good order immediately after the incident, it is a fair inference that they were before the explosion in good condition, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.\nFollowing this, he added that he could not find the defendant negligent in not foreseeing what caused the explosion and the damage.\nIn view of these findings, it necessarily follows that some one turned on the gas between the time that the appellant left the cabin at about 8 o'clock in the evening and 8 o'clock the following morning when, according to the respondent, he lit a match near the burner of the stove and the explosion occurred. The cabin was locked by the respondent when he left the evening before, and again when after returning he retired about 11 o'clock, and no one suggests that any one else entered the cabin during this twelve hour interval. The respondent got up at 6 o'clock in the morning and closed the two windows in his part of the cabin and says that, at that time, he did not touch the stove. Dealing with this aspect of the matter, the learned trial judge said:\u2014\nOf course, I find that there is no evidence that Laskey did tamper with or try to light the stove, except at 8.00 o'clock in the morning when he got up, and I find that the explosion was caused by an accumulation of gas in the room before Laskey attempted to light the stove. Whatever caused the accumulation is not determined, and I cannot speculate as to how it came about.\nWith due respect, I think it was the duty of the learned judge to decide what inference was to be drawn from the facts above stated. This would not be to speculate, as suggested in the reasons given. This issue not having been decided, the appellant was none the less held liable on the footing that there was an implied warranty that the cabin would be absolutely safe for occupancy and that had there been a pilot light on the stove the accident would not have occurred. The only evidence as to the function of the pilot light was that given by the witness Mitton. A stove not equipped with such a device, which is attached to the burner, must be lighted with a match: with the device, when the gas is turned on it is ignited by the pilot light. Apart from the evidence, these devices are in such common use and have been for so long that judicial notice may properly be taken of their function and purpose. Mitton further gave evidence of a fact that appears to be obvious, that if gas were escaping in the vicinity of the light, whether at the burner or close to it, it would be ignited. No doubt also, if there was an explosive accumulation of gas in the room the source of which was elsewhere than in the burner or the connections, it would be ignited by the pilot light, as it would be, of course, by a match. These matters are self evident.\nTo say, however, that the absence of the pilot light, which would undoubtedly have kindled the gas which, upon the evidence, must have escaped through the burner, was the cause of the accident is, in my opinion, quite unwarranted. It is, indeed, to put the cart before the horse. If, as the majority of the Appellate Division concluded and as appears to me to be the only inference to be drawn from the evidence, the presence of the gas in the room resulted from the action of the respondent in turning it on when he got up at 6 o'clock, it was that act which was the proximate cause of the accident.\nUnder Order 58, Rule 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, all appeals to the Court of Appeal shall be by way of rehearing and, by Rule 4 of that Order, the Court is given power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made.\nBridges J., with whom Richards C.J. agreed, after referring to the finding at the trial that the stove and the connections were in good condition immediately before the explosion, and saying that the trial judge was apparently satisfied that the defendant, when in the cabin with the plaintiff, lit the heater and then closed the valve shutting off the gas, apparently concurring in those findings, said in part:\u2014\nthe only conclusion one can I think reach is that the valve must have been wholly or partially opened by some person between shortly after 8.00 o'clock in the evening and 6:00 a.m. the following morning. Continuing, he said that the judge had not dealt with this aspect of the case but that there was evidence from which the inference could be drawn that the plaintiff probably opened the valve without lighting the gas, and that it was his opinion that he did so. These learned judges were, however, of the opinion that, if the appellant had properly instructed the respondent in the operation of the stove, it was \"difficult to believe that he would have turned on the gas without lighting it.\" Bridges J. further considered that the appellant was negligent in not explaining the dangers of propane gas and the facts as to its odour which was designed to give warning of its presence. Upon these findings he held that both parties were to blame and the loss was apportioned.\nThere is thus a finding of the court appealed from that the presence of the inflammable mixture of gas in the room at 8 o'clock a.m. was caused by the respondent turning on the gas and, upon the respondent's own evidence, the only time that this could have occurred was when he got up to close the windows at 6 o'clock. If the respondent had said that he had turned on the gas, thinking that there was a pilot light on the stove which would have at once ignited it, the absence of the pilot light might have afforded some arguable ground for imposing liability. The respondent, however, says nothing of the kind, his evidence being a flat denial that he did turn on the gas at all. If there is any authority for the proposition that there is a duty imposed upon persons renting accommodation of this kind to others, in this day and age, to explain that gas used for illumination or cooking, if left turned on without lighting it, constitutes a danger either of asphyxiation or explosion, I am unaware of it. There was nothing to differentiate the propane gas from other gas in this respect that, if allowed unchecked to escape into the air in a room, a dangerous inflammable mixture would result.\nThe duty of the present appellant to the respondent was not that of an insurer and, as pointed out by the judgment of the majority in the Court of Appeal, was not absolute. In Cox v. Coulson 6, Swinfen Eady L.J., referring to the liability of a theatre owner to a person purchasing a ticket to see a performance, said that the defendant must be taken to have contracted to take due care that the premises should be reasonably safe for persons using them in the customary manner and with reasonable care, referring as authority to what had been said in Francis v. Cockrell 7, and in Norman v. Great West Railway Co. 8. This statement of the law was approved in Hall v. Brooklands Auto Racing Club 9, by Scrutton L.J.\nUpon the finding made in the Court of Appeal which, with respect, appears to me to be an inevitable conclusion from the evidence, it was not the absence of the pilot light that was the proximate cause of the respondent's injury but his own act in turning on the gas and failing to light it. A pilot light, no doubt, would have at once ignited the gas preventing any damage, but then leaving the window or the door open would have been equally effective for that purpose. But the failure to take any of these precautions that might be suggested was not the proximate cause of the injury and have, in my opinion, no bearing on the question of liability.\nIt has been pointed out many times in this Court that, as the appeal is from a court of appeal, the judgment should not be reversed unless we are of opinion that it is clearly wrong. Particularly is this so when the decisive finding, as in this case, is upon a question of fact. I am quite unable to say that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case is wrong: on the contrary, with respect, I think that upon the issue as to what caused the accumulation of gas in the room it was clearly right.\nI would allow this appeal and dismiss this action with costs throughout.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are sufficiently set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Rand on this branch of the matter, I am of opinion that the finding of the Appeal Division, that the failure of the appellant to install a pilot light was a breach of his duty to make the premises as safe as reasonable care and skill could make them, was supported by the evidence and should not be disturbed. This failure was a cause of the explosion. The other cause was the escape of gas. It was conceded that the evidence established that there was no leak in the piping leading from the cylinders containing the gas to the heater and that the escape must have occurred through the valve at the heater having been left wholly or partly open for a considerable period of time prior to the explosion. Three theories as to how this happened were put forward : (i) that after the appellant had lighted the heater he either failed to turn it off completely or, having turned it off, inadvertently turned it on; (ii) that between 8.00 and 11.00 o'clock in the evening preceding the accident someone unknown entered the cabin (which was then empty and, so far the respondent recollected, unlocked) and inadvertently or mischievously opened the valve; (iii) that the respondent opened the valve when he got up at 6.00 a.m.\nThe learned trial judge found that none of these theories were established. The majority in the Appeal Division were of opinion that there was evidence from which the inference could and should be drawn that the respondent opened the valve at 6.00 a.m. without lighting the gas and that this was negligence on his part contributing to the accident.\nIt is clear that the onus of proving contributory negligence on the part of the respondent rested upon the appellant, and, in my opinion, the evidence does not warrant any interference with the finding of the learned trial judge that this onus was not discharged. It must be remembered that the learned trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses, has apparently credited the explicit statement of the respondent, made during his examination in chief and repeated during his cross-examination, that he did not touch or go near the heater when he got up at 6.00 a.m. Of the three theories mentioned none may appear to be probable but, in my opinion, on all the evidence the third is at least as improbable as either of the others, and I agree with the view of the learned trial judge that the contributory negligence alleged against the respondent was not proved.\nIt therefore appears that it has been proved that the explosion by which the respondent was injured resulted from (i) the failure to install a pilot light, a cause for which the appellant is responsible, and (ii) an unexplained escape of gas, a cause for which neither party has been proved to be responsible; and it follows that liability for the damage caused rests upon the appellant.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal, allow the cross-appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout.\nAbbott J. (dissenting):\u2014This action arises out of injuries sustained by respondent following an explosion which took place in an over-night cabin, one of a group operated by the appellant, near Moncton, New Brunswick.\nThe respondent and a group of friends arrived at these overnight cabins at about 8 p.m. on September 25, 1953, and rented three cabins, one of which was occupied by the respondent, being one side of a double cabin, the other side being occupied by a Mr. and Mrs. Fraser, the two sides separated by a partition. Each of these cabins was equipped with a propane gas heater. The evidence established that the appellant personally showed the cabins to the party, and appellant testified that when he took respondent to his cabin at about eight o'clock, he turned on and lit the propane gas heater in the presence of the defendant. His evidence on this point is not contradicted by respondent. Respondent told him he did not need the heat on as he was going to visit a cabin occupied by two of his friends. Appellant testified he then turned off the gas heater.\nRespondent did leave the cabin and spent most of the evening at another cabin with other members of his party, returning to his own cabin at about 11 p.m. He stated that after he had undressed, he opened the windows, turned off the light, and went to bed. He said he slept until about 6 a.m., when he got up, went to the bathroom, closed two of the windows of the cabin, one of which was in the bathroom, the other in the front of the cabin near the door, and then went back to bed. He stated that he did not again rise until about 8 a.m. when he turned on the gas heater, lit a match, put it towards the burner, when an explosion took place which severely injured him, blew out one side of the cabin wall and scorched furniture and fittings in the cabin. The learned trial judge found that the gas heater was not defective, that the defendant did not leave the valve open when he demonstrated the apparatus at 8 p.m. and that the defendant was not negligent in assigning the premises to the plaintiff. There was ample evidence to support these findings. He also found no positive act of negligence on the part of either the appellant or the respondent which would cause the gas to escape.\nOn these findings of fact the learned trial judge gave judgment for the respondent on the ground that the appellant had not made the premises absolutely safe for occupancy by providing the propane heater with a pilot light.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Bridges J., with whom Richards C.J. concurred, appears to agree with the findings of the learned trial judge that appellant did light the stove at about 8 p.m. when in the cabin with respondent and then turned off the gas. He then went on to say:\u2014\nThere was no direct evidence that the plaintiff turned on the gas during the night or early morning but if the gas was completely turned off by the defendant at 8.00 p.m. in the evening prior to the explosion, with the heater and pipe connections in good working order, the only conclusion one can I think reach is that the valve must have been wholly or partially opened by some person between shortly after 8.00 o'clock in the evening and 6.00 a.m. the following morning. The learned trial judge did not deal with this aspect of the case. There is no evidence or suggestion of any person being in the cabin between those hours except the plaintiff. He stated that he locked the door of the cabin when he went to bed at 11.00 p.m. but did not remember if he locked it when he went to the other cabin shortly after 8.00 p.m. It is highly improbable that a person would enter the cabin for the sole purpose of opening the valve if the cabin were unlocked. There is in my opinion with all deference evidence from which the inference can be drawn that the plaintiff probably opened the valve without lighting the gas and it is my opinion that he did so.\nIn holding the appellant liable, Bridges J. agreed with the learned trial judge that there was a duty imposed upon the appellant to equip the stove with a pilot light as a safety measure but differed with his view that there was an implied warranty that the cabin must be made absolutely safe for occupancy. He considered moreover that the appellant had failed in his duty in that \"he did not explain to the plaintiff the operation of the heater and warn him of the danger from the use of propane gas \u2026\"\nWith respect, I am unable to agree with this latter finding. In my opinion the evidence established that the appellant did show the respondent how the heater operated and I cannot believe that the plaintiff, an educated man, 72 years of age, who had been a druggist for over thirty years, needed to be warned that any gas stove or heater carelessly handled could be dangerous.\nThere is uncontradicted evidence that the gas heater was a type of heater in common use, and as it was installed in the cabin operated properly, was in good condition and could not of itself have caused an explosion, and the Courts below appear to have so found.\nI am satisfied on the evidence that the escape of gas, which resulted in the explosion, must have been caused by some human intervention. It seems to me that this could only have happened in one of three ways:\u2014\n(1) that the appellant after opening the valve and lighting the stove at about 8 p.m. failed to turn it off. He states positively that he did turn it off and this is not contradicted although respondent was present at the time. The appellant did not re-enter the cabin until after the explosion had taken place the following; morning;\n(2) that some third person entered the cabin between the time appellant and respondent left it about 8 p.m. and. the time respondent returned at about 11 p.m. and at that time turned on the valve. There is no evidence to support this alternative, the cabin door appears to have been locked at all relevant times, certainly from 11 p.m. on, and I think it must be rejected and\n(3) that the respondent himself turned on the valve between the time it was closed at 8 p.m. the previous night and 6 a.m. when he says he got up for the first time. That this is what happened is the view held by Richards C.J. and Bridges J., as appears from the quotation which I have given from the latter's reasons. I share that view.\nThere remains for consideration therefore the question as to whether the Courts below were right in holding that appellant failed in his duty to respondent in not having the propane gas heater equipped with a pilot light as a safety-measure. With respect. I am of opinion that they were not. The legal principle upon which appellant's responsibility to respondent rests has been accurately and succinctly stated by my brother Rand in Brown v. B. & F. Theatres Limited 10, where he says:\u2014\nThere was a contractual relation between her and the theatre management that exercising prudence herself she might enjoy those privileges without risk of danger so far as reasonable care could make the premises safe.\nAn occupier is not bound to adopt the most recent inventions and devices provided he has done what is ordinarily and reasonably done to ensure safety. See Halsbury, 2nd Ed. Vol. 23 at p. 605, and the authorities there cited.\nAs Du Parc L.J. said in Gilmore v. London County Council 11, \"in considering what is reasonable you must not ask for perfection\" and this test was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in Bell v. Travco Hotels, Ltd. 12.\nNo doubt the installation of a pilot light on the gas heater in question would have constituted an additional safeguard against an explosion resulting from careless operation of the heater. As I have said, however, there is uncontradicted evidence in this case that the heater in question was of a type in common use, was in good condition and if operated properly could not have caused an explosion.\nIn the circumstances I am of opinion that the appellant carried out his contractual obligation \"to take due care that the premises would be reasonably safe for persons using them in the customary manner and with reasonable care.\"See Cox v. Coulson 13.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the plaintiff's action with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed; Cross-appeal allowed; both with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. F.

Eaton Co. Ltd. was not the \"producer or manufacturer\" of two \"special brand\" auto-mobile tires sold by it and manufactured exclusively for it by a rubber company, and was not therefore liable for excise or sales tax on the sale of such tires. The Exchequer Court affirmed the declaration as well as the authority of the Board to hear the reference.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Exchequer Court and the declaration of the Tariff Board set aside.\nThe Board had no jurisdiction to make the declaration, and the Board, as well as the Exchequer Court and this Court, was precluded from considering the merits of the issue. S. 57 of the Excise Tax Act, which gives the Board power to decide whether any tax is payable on an article and, if so, what rate of tax is payable, does not give the Board power to decide whether a particular person is a person upon whom a tax is imposed in respect of an article. That question is an issue between that person and the Crown. To permit third parties to intervene in such an issue would be a departure from the general system of the law.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Thorson P.[1], affirming the declaration of the Tariff Board.\nJ.

Lewis for Simpsons-Sears Ltd.\nE. Eaton for Minister of National Revenue. The judgment of Kerwin C.J., Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014For some years, certain Canadian rubber companies have been manufacturing \"special brand\" auto-mobile tires for sale to various retail corporations as well as to other rubber companies. These tires bear the names of the purchasers and the treads are molded with special markings which are not sold to others. The first mentioned companies have been regarded by the Department as the manufacturers or producers of the tires for the purposes of the Excise Tax Act (R.S.C. 1952, c. 100). The appellants, competing manufacturers of automobile tires, objected to this ruling and contended that the \"special brand\" cus\u00adtomers should be treated as the manufacturers or producers of the tires within the meaning of section 2(a) (ii) of the Excise Tax Act and subjected to sales and excise taxes on their sales. In a letter dated August 19, 1954, wherein these facts are recited, the Deputy Minister of National Revenue referred the matter to the Tariff Board for a 'declaration as to the correctness or otherwise of the Department's ruling; this reference purports to be made in accordance with sec\u00adtion 57 of the Act, the relevant subsections of which provide that:\u2014\n(1) Where any difference arises or where any doubt exists as to whether any or what rate of tax is payable on any article under this Act and there is no previous decision upon the question by any competent tribunal binding throughout Canada, the Tariff Board constituted by the Tariff Board Act may declare what amount of tax is payable thereon or that the article is exempt from 'Lax under this Act.\n(2) Before making a declaration under subsection (1) the Tariff Board shall provide for a hearing and shall publish a notice thereof in the Canada Gazette at least twenty-one days prior to the day of the hearing; and any person who, on or before that day, enters an appearance with the Secretary of the Tariff Board may be heard at the hearing.\n(3) A declaration by the Tariff Board under this section is final and conclusive, subject to appeal as provided in section 58.\n(4) \u2026..\n(5) \u2026..\nDuring the hearing of this reference, members of the Board raised the question of jurisdiction. In the views they then expressed, the difference arising in the matter is not, as contemplated in subsection (1) of section 57 \"whether any or what rate of tax is payable\" on these articles, under the Act-a question as to which, admittedly, no difference or doubt existed in the premises-, but whether the Canadian rubber companies manufacturing \"special brand\" automobile tires for sale to various retail corporations or the. retail corporations, should be regarded by the Department as the manufacturers or producers, within the meaning of the section 2(a) (ii) and should there-fore pay the tax-a question scarcely within the terms of a reference authorized under section 57. The point was argued but not determined. The Board, acting upon the suggestion of counsel for the Minister, continued the hear\u00ading, \"leaving the question of jurisdiction open to be settled elsewhere\" and, on the merits of the question referred to, approved the ruling of the Department. This decision as well as the authority of the Board to entertain the refer\u00adence, were subsequently affirmed by the Exchequer Court on an appeal by the present appellants who, continuing to assert the jurisdiction of the Board, now attack the judg\u00adment rendered on the merits of the question.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board in the matter must first be ascertained for, if there is no such jurisdiction, this Court, as well as the Board and the Exchequer Court, is precluded from entering upon a consideration of the merits of the issue. Okalta Oils Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[2].\nThe contention that the question propounded to the Board in the present case is one contemplated by the terms of section 57, is predicated on the argument of counsel for the Minister that the words \"by any persons\" must be understood to follow the word \"payable\" twice appearing in the first paragraph of the section; and the reasons upon which rests the decision of the Court below are expressed as follows:\u2014\nThat the tax is imposed on a person in respect of an article and not on the article itself, notwithstanding the wording of section 57, seems clear: vide such cases as Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr (1933) A.C. 710; Kerr v. Superintendent of Income Tax and Attorney-General for Alberta (1942) S.C.R. 435; Smith v. Vermillion Hills Rural Council (1916) 2 A.C. 569. The articles that were the subject of the reference were \"special brand\" automobile tires. As the hearing developed the specific articles before the Board were the special brand \"Bulldog\" and \"Trojan\" tires sold by Eaton's. Since there was difference or doubt whether Eaton's was the manufacturer or producer of the tires there was difference or doubt whether tax was payable on them on their sale by Eaton's. The Board could not determine such difference or doubt and decide whether tax was payable on the tires or whether they were exempt from tax on their sale by Eaton's without deciding whether Eaton's was the manufacturer or producer of them. Failure to recognize this basic fact was the fallacy in the submission of lack of jurisdiction. Since there was difference or doubt whether any tax was payable on the \"Bulldog\" and \"Trojan\" tires on their sale by Eaton's the Board had jurisdiction to resolve such doubt or difference. And since the Board could not resolve such doubt or difference without deciding whether Eaton's was the manufacturer or producer of the tires it follows, as a matter of course, that it had jurisdic\u00adtion to decide that question.\nWith deference, I fail to see how this line of reasoning is of any assistance in determining the specific jurisdiction of the Tariff Board under section 57 of the Act. Whether a particular person is a person upon whom a tax is imposed in respect of an article or whether a particular article is one in respect of which a tax is imposed upon a person are two separate questions;-indeed the whole argument at the hearing was centred exclusively upon the former, nothing being said as to the latter, as to which there was admittedly no point of difference. While these two questions, as well as a variety of others, are proper ones in an action for the recovery of taxes, it does not follow that they are all equally so in a reference to the Tariff Board under section 57 if, on a proper construction of the whole section, the question as worded in paragraph (1) \"whether any or what rate of tax is payable on any article\" means only whether any article is one in respect of which any and, if so, what rate of tax is imposed.\nThe declaration of the Board as to the question within its jurisdiction to entertain is, subject to appeal by leave on a question of law only, final and conclusive as against any of the parties to the proceedings, and perhaps as against anyone in Canada who, after publication in the Canada Gazette of a notice of as hearing, has failed to avail himself of the right to appear before and to be heard by the Board. In the result, one at least of the many issues, which ordinarily it would be for the Exchequer Court or some other competent tribunal to determine, either in an action for recovery of taxes or penal proceedings, is finally and conclusively decided by the Board. That section 57 thus affords a substantial alteration of the general system of the law and particularly of the provisions of the Act dealing with the recovery of taxes, is manifest. In like circum\u00adstances, the construction of this subsequent enactment, section 57, is subject to the rule that a Legislature is not presumed to depart from the general system of the law without expressing its intentions to do so with irresistible clearness, failing which the law remains undisturbed. (Maxwell On. Interpretation of Statutes, 9th edition, page 84). There being a presumption against the implicit alteration of the law, effect cannot be given to the suggestion of counsel for the Department to read after the word \"pay-able\" twice appearing in the first paragraph of the section, the words \"by any persons\". To do so would not only extend the scope of the question but stretch it to a point creating clear conflict between the English and the French texts of paragraph (1). Indeed if one refers, .as one may under the authorities (Composers, Authors and Publishers Association Limited v. Western Fair Association[3]), to the French version, the latter makes it abundantly clear that the real question is \"whether any particular article is one in respect of which any or what rate of tax is imposed\":\u2011\n57. (1) Lorsqu'il se produit un diff\u00e9rend ou qu'un doute existe sur la question de savoir si, aux termes de la pr\u00e9sente loi, un article est assuj\u00e9ti \u00e0 la taxe ou sur le taux applicable \u00e0 l'article et qu'aucun tribunal com\u00adp\u00e9tent n'a jusque-l\u00e0 rendu, en l'esp\u00e8ce, une d\u00e9cision visant tout le Canada, la Commission du tarif, institu\u00e9e par la Loi sur la Commission du tarif, peut d\u00e9clarer quel montant de taxe est exigible sur l'article ou d\u00e9clarer que l'article est exempt de la taxe en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\nIn the context, the word \"payable\" does not appear; and the context does not either lend itself to the inclusion of the words \"payable par quiconque\". While, on these views, it must be held that there was no jurisdiction for the Board to entertain the question propounded in the letter of the Deputy Minister, this conclusion, if the examination of the section is pursued, finds, I think, further support.\nAs is manifested by the reasons for the declaration of the Board and for the judgment of the Court below upon the merits of the question referred to the Board, the declara\u00adtion as well as the judgment rest on findings of facts as to the relationship between the T. Eaton Company Limited and the Dominion Rubber Company Limited. Under paragraph (1) of section 57, a condition precedent to the jurisdiction of the Board to entertain a reference upon the question stated in the section is that there be \"no previous decision upon the question by a competent tribunal binding throughout Canada\". The section, there-fore, contemplates that the question to be propounded to the Board is, of its nature, susceptible to be one upon which a previous decision binding throughout Canada might have been rendered. Of its nature, the question here arising can hardly give rise to a decision having such an effect.\nUnder paragraph (2), the Board is precluded from deciding the question, which under paragraph (1) is within its jurisdiction to entertain, unless a hearing be provided for and notice thereof published in the Canada Gazette, so that anyone,\u2011other than the person who applies for the declaration, the Deputy-Minister of National Revenue for Customs or Excise,\u2011may be given an opportunity to enter an appearance and be heard in the matter. Whether or not a particular article is one in respect of which a tax is imposed raises a question of general concern throughout Canada and is a matter justifying notice being given to third parties so that they may be heard if they so elect. But whether a particular person is the person liable for the payment of a tax imposed in respect of an article is an issue between that person and the Crown. To permit third parties to intervene in such an issue would be a departure from the general system of the law. The intention of Par\u00adliament to do so would have to be indicated in explicit terms, which, in my view, has not been done under the section.\nParagraph (3) provides that \"a declaration by the Tariff Board under this section is final and conclusive, subject to appeal as provided in section 58\". Prior to 15 Geo. VI, c. 28, s. 7, enacted in 1951, what is now paragraph (3) read as follows:\u2011\nA declaration by the Tariff Board, under this section, shall have the same force and effect as if it had been sanctioned by statute.\nThe question which could then be referred to the Board was exactly the same as it is to-day. If the question con\u00adtemplated by section 57 is whether a particular article is one in respect of which any .and what rate of tax is imposed, it is not difficult to understand why Parliament wanted to give to the determination of this question the same force and effect as if it had been sanctioned by statute, but there would appear to be no reason for the attribution of such an effect to the determination of tax liability of a person aris\u00ading out of the relationship existing between that person and another.\nUpon the ground that the Tariff Board had no jurisdic\u00adtion to make its declaration of December 7, 1954, I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and the Tariff Board's declaration. There should be no costs in this Court or in the Exchequer Court.\nRAND J.:\u2011I agree with the conclusion and with the reasons generally of my brother Fauteux, but I desire to state shortly my own view of s. 57 of the Excise Tax Act. S-s. (1) declares:\nWhere any difference arises or where any doubt exists as to whether any or what rate of tax is payable on any article under this Act and there is no previous decision upon .the question by any competent tribunal binding throughout Canada, the Tariff Board constituted by the Tariff Board Act may declare what amount of tax is payable thereon or that the article is exempt from tax under this Act.\nThe language \"whether any or what rate of tax is payable on any article\" raises a question that, in effect, asks for a decision in rem, a decision determining the rate as applied to the article regardless of personal liability for the tax. It is only for that reason that a general hearing is required and that the declaration is to be, by s-s. (3), \"final and con\u00adclusive\". That is the only question authorized by the sec\u00adtion to be put by the Deputy Minister to the Board.\nIt is argued that the language \"may declare what amount of tax is payable thereon\" evidences an intention to have such a question .as that submitted passed upon. The point is, no doubt, arguable, but what is to be resolved, is a doubt or difference as to the rate; the price is assumed; and once the rate is ascertained the amount of the tax mathematically follows. Even considering s-s. (1) alone, I think the jurisdiction is clearly confined to the question specified in two lines, \"any or what rate of tax\", and the use of the word \"amount\" cannot, in the context, affect it. Confirmed, how-ever, as that interpretation is by the subsequent subsec\u00adtions, I entertain no doubt of the limit of jurisdiction.\nWhat is sought here is something quite 'different: it is, who, as the \"manufacturer or producer\" of the goods, is, as between two parties, liable for the tax? The article and the rate are admitted. S. 23(2) and s. 30(1) (a) (i) provide for the payment of the excess and consumption taxes respec\u00adtively by the \"manufacturer or producer\". S. 2(1) (a) (ii) defines \"manufacturer or producer\" to include:\nany person, firm or corporation that owns, holds, claims, or uses any patent, proprietary, sales or other right to goods being manufactured, whether by them, in their name, or for or on their behalf by others, whether such person, firm or corporation sells, distributes, consigns, or otherwise disposes of the goods or not,\nThe question is, therefore, one of fact and law whether the respondent retail dealers, by reason of their partial participation in the processes that end in the ultimate product, bring themselves within that description. The interest of a taxpayer in that question is not the general interest in a definitive determination which s. 57, s-s. (1) contemplates. Each instance depends on its own par\u00adticulars; they may be changed in any case tomorrow by adding, subtracting or combining old or new items; and the declaration would be only upon the particulars then exist\u00ading of the party immediately concerned. That is here an issue between the retailer and the Crown with which ordinarily other parties have nothing directly to do. They may be interested in the language of the statute and might seek its change; they have an interest in the uniform and proper administration of the Act as of taxing law generally; but as between the taxing authorities and the \"manufac\u00adturer or producer\" that is not the interest for which the sec\u00adtion provides a general hearing. I would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judg\u00adment below and declare the Tariff Board to have had no jurisdiction to make the declaration. There will be no costs in this Court or in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed; no costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy & McCarthy.\nSolicitors for T.

But goods in bales or other large packages unusual among Indians shall not be considered as goods belonging bona fide to Indians\".\nThe appellant, an Indian within the terms of s. 2(1) (g) of the Indian Act, S. of C. 1951, c. 29, resided on an Indian reserve in the Province of Quebec adjoining an Indian reserve in the State of New York, U.S.A. In 1948, 1950 and 1951, he brought from the United States into Canada certain articles acquired by him in the U.S.A. No duties were paid in respect thereto. The articles were subsequently seized by the Crown and the appellant, under protest, paid the sum demanded. By his petition of right, he claimed the return of this money and a declaration that no duties or taxes were payable by him with respect to these goods by reason of the above part of Article III of the Jay Treaty. The claim was rejected by the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: The Jay Treaty was not a Treaty of Peace and it is clear that in Canada such rights and privileges as were here advanced of subjects of a contracting party to a treaty are enforceable by the Courts only where the treaty has been implemented or sanctioned by legislation. There is no such legislation here.\n\"S. 86(b) of the Indian Act does not apply because customs duties are not taxes upon the personal property of an Indian situated on a Reserve but are imposed upon the importation of goods into Canada.\nS. 49 of S. of C. 1949, c. 25 is a complete bar in so far as the articles imported in 1950 and 1951 are concerned.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ.: To the enactment of fiscal provisions, certainly in the case of a treaty not a peace treaty such as the Jay Treaty, the prerogative that it need not be supplement by statutory action does not extend and only by legislation can customs duties be imposed. Legislation was therefore necessary to bring within municipal law the exemption claimed here, and for over a century there has been no statutory provision in this country giving effect to it.\nThere is nothing in s. 102 of the Indian Act , R.S.C. 1927, c. 98 nor in s. 86(1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, that can assist the appellant.\nPer Kellock and Abbott JJ.: The provisions of the Indian Act constitute a code governing the rights and privileges of Indians, and except to the extent that immunity from general legislation such as the Customs Act or the Customs Tariff Act is to be found in the Indian Act, the terms of such general legislation apply to Indians equally with other citizens of Canada. No such immunity is to be found in s. 86(1) of the Indian Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Cameron J. 1, dismissing a petition of right.\nG. F. Henderson, Q.C. and A. T. Hewitt for the appellant.\nD. H. W. Henry, Q.C. and E. R. Olson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J., Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an appeal against a decision of the Exchequer Court dismissing the Petition of Right of the suppliant (an Indian resident in a reserve in Canada) and the question is whether three articles, a washing machine, a refrigerator and an oil heater, brought by him into Canada from the United States of America are subject to duties of customs and sales tax under the relevant statutes of Canada. None was paid and in fact the articles were not brought into this country at a port of entry; they were subsequently placed under customs detention or seizure and in order to obtain their release, the appellant, under protest, paid the sum demanded by the Crown. The Petition of Right claims the return of this money and a declaration that no duties or taxes were payable by the appellant with respect to the goods.\nThe date of importation of the washing machine is December, 1948; of the refrigerator April 24. 1950, and of the oil heater September 7, 1951. The relevancy of the dates is that s. 49 of The Statutes of Canada, 1949, 2nd session, c. 25, relied upon by the respondent, was assented to on September 10, 1949, and was, therefore, in effect at the time the suppliant brought into Canada the refrigerator and oil heater, but was not in force when the washing machine was imported. Furthermore s. 87 of The Indian Act, R.S.C. 1951, c. 29, also referred to on behalf of the respondent, was first enacted in the revision of The Indian Act in 1949 by s. 87 of c. 29 of the statutes of that year, which chapter was brought into force on September 4, 1951, so that even if applicable, its provisions would affect only the importation of the oil heater and I find it unnecessary to express any opinion upon the matter.\nThe appellant falls within the definition of \"Indian\" in s. 2(1) (g) of R.S.C. 1951, c. 29 and at all relevant times he resided on the St. Regis Indian Reserve in St. Regis village in the westerly part of the Province of Quebec, which adjoins an Indian reserve in the State of New York in the United States of America,\u2014the residents of both reserves belonging to the St. Regis Tribe of Indians. The articles were brought into Canada in the manner already described in order to lay the foundation for the present proceeding as a test case.\nThe first claim advanced on behalf of the appellant is that these imposts need not be paid because of the following provisions of Article III of the Treaty of Amity, Com- merce and Navigation, between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, signed on November 19, 1794, and generally known as the Jay Treaty:\u2014\nNo Duty on Entry shall ever be levied by either Party on Peltries brought by Land, or Inland Navigation into the said Territories respectively, nor shall the Indians passing or repassing with their own proper Goods and Effects of whatever nature, pay for the same any Impost or Duty whatever. But Goods in Bales or other large Packages unusual among Indians shall not be considered as Goods belonging bona fide to Indians.\nIn view of the conclusion at which I have arrived, it is unnecessary to deal with the question raised by the respondent that the articles imported by the appellant were not his \"own proper goods and effects\".\nThe Jay Treaty was not a Treaty of Peace and it is clear that in Canada such rights and privileges as are here advanced of subjects of a contracting party to a treaty are enforceable by the Courts only where the treaty has been implemented or sanctioned by legislation. This is an adaptation of the language of Lamont J., speaking for himself and Cannon J. in Arrow River & Tributaries Slide & Boom Co. Ltd. v. Pigeon Timber Co. Ltd. 2, and is justified by a continuous line of authority in England. Although it may be necessary in connection with other matters to consider in the future the judgment of the Judicial Committee in The Labour Conventions Case 3, so far as the point under discussion is concerned it is there put in the same sense by Lord Atkin. It has been held that no rights under a treaty of cession can be enforced in the Courts except in so far as they have been incorporated in municipal law: Vajesingji Joravarsingji v. Secretary of State for India 4; Hoani Te Heuheu Tukino v. Aotea District Maoria Land Board 5. The case of Sutton v. Sutton 6, relied upon by the appellant, dealt with the construction of another provision of the Jay Treaty and of the statute of 37 Geo. III, c. 97, which was passed for the purpose of carrying certain terms of the Treaty into execution. This is not a case where vested rights of property are concerned and it is unnecessary to consider the question whether the terms of the Jay Treaty were abrogated by the war of 1812. I agree with Mr. Justice Cameron that clause (b) of s. 86 of The Indian Act does not apply, because customs duties are not taxes upon the personal property of an Indian situated on a Reserve but are imposed upon the importation of goods into Canada. I also agree that, so far as the refrigerator and the oil heater are concerned, s. 49 of c. 25 of the 1949 statutes is a complete bar This is \"An Act to amend the Income Tax Act and the Income War Tax Act\". While it is true that in s. 48 there are references to residents in Newfoundland and in ss. 49 and 50 to Newfoundland, most of the sections deal with income tax throughout all of Canada. The words are clear that no one is entitled to any deduction, exemption or immunity from, or any privilege in respect of any duty or tax imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada; and the Customs Act of Canada certainly provides for a duty on all the goods brought into the country by the appellant. Counsel for the appellant points to the words \"notwithstanding any other law heretofore enacted\" and argues that the rights upon which the appellant bases his claim under the Jay Treaty do not arise under any enactment. For the reasons already given, I cannot agree that any relevant rights of the appellant within that Treaty are judiciable in the Courts of this country.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:-\nRand J.:\u2014The appellant, Louis Francis, is an Indian within the definition of that word in the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, s. 2(1)(g) and resides on the St. Regis Indian Reserve in Quebec. The latter is part of a larger settlement of the St. Regis tribe extending into the United 'States and is bounded on the south by the international boundary between the two countries. Between 1948 and 1951 Francis purchased an electrical washing machine, a second-hand oil burner or heater and an electric refrigerator in the United States; two of these were brought over or from the international boundary to his home in the reserve by Francis and the other delivered by the seller. They were not reported at the customs office for the district and some time later were seized and held until the duty amounting to $123.66 was paid. The petition of right was thereupon brought for the return of these moneys.\nThe claim is based first on that clause of art. 3 of the Jay Treaty between Great Britain and the United States of 1794 which stipulates:\nNo Duty on Entry shall ever be levied by either Party on Peltries brought by Land, or Inland Navigation into \u00abthe said Territories respectively, nor shall the Indians passing or repassing with their own proper Goods and Effects of whatever nature, pay for the same any Impost or Duty whatever. But Goods in Bales or other large Packages unusual among Indians shall not be considered as Goods belonging bona fide to Indians.\nand on the 9th article of the Treaty of Ghent, 1815, between the same states which, as regards Great Britain, reads :\nAnd His Britannic Majesty engages, on his part, to put an end, immediately after the Ratification of the present Treaty to hostilities with all the Tribes or Nations of Indians with whom he may be at War at the time of such Ratification; and forthwith to restore to such Tribes or Nations, respectively, all the Possessions, Rights and Privileges, which they may have enjoyed or been entitled to in 1811, previous to such hostilities: Provided always, that such Tribes or Nations shall agree to desist from all hostilities against His Britannic Majesty, and his Subjects, upon the Ratification of the present Treaty being notified to such Tribes or Nations, and shall so desist accordingly.\nThe contention is put as follows: art. 3 effects the enactment of substantive law not requiring statutory confirmation as being a provision in a treaty of peace, the making of which is in the exercise of the prerogative including, here, a legislative function; on the true interpretation of the treaty the article was intended to be perpetual and was not affected by the war of 1812; in any event it was restored by the 9th article of 1815.\nA second ground is that the appellant is exempted from liability for the duties of s. 102 of the Indian Act , R.S.C. 1927, c. 98 and by s. 86(1) of c. 149, R.S.C. 1952. These read:\n102. No Indian or non-treaty Indian shall be liable to be taxed for any real or personal property, unless he holds, in his individual right, real estate under a lease or in fee simple, or personal property outside of the reserve or special reserve, in which case he shall be liable to be taxed for such real or personal property at the same rate as other persons in the locality in which it is situate.\n* * * 86. (1) Notwithstanding any other Act of the Parliament of Canada or any Act of the legislature of a province, but subject to subsection (2) and to Section 82, the following property is exempt from taxation, namely,\n(a) the interest of an Indian or a band in reserve or surrendered lands, and\n(b) the personal property of an Indian or band situated on a reserve, and no Indian or band is subject to taxtion in respect of the ownership, occupation, possession or use of any property mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) or is otherwise subject to taxation in respect of any such property \u2026\nCameron J., dismissing the petition, held that art. 3 required statutory confirmation to become effective as law, of which there was none; that the article was abrogated by the war of 1812; that the exemption was negatived by s. 49 of the statutes of Canada, 1949, 2nd Session ; and that the sections of the Indian Acts quoted did not extend to customs duties. Art. 9 of the Treaty of Ghent was not, evidently, brought to his attention nor apparently the distinction in respect of the scope and power of the prerogative urged before us between a treaty of peace and other treaties.\nA peace treaty in its primary and legitimate meaning is a treaty concluding a war, \"an agreement\"\u2014in the words of Sir William Scott in the Eliza Ann and others 7\u2014\"to waive all discussion concerning the respective rights to the parties and to bury in oblivion all the original causes of the war.\" The Treaty of Paris, 1783 was of that nature; it recognized the independence of the United States, fixed boundaries, secured the property of former and continuing subjects and citizens in both countries against prosecution and against confiscation of their property, provided for the withdrawal of British troops from the lands of and border points in the United States and for other matters not germane here.\nThe question of the Indians, however, was left untouched, and during the years that followed they presented both governments with problems of reconciliation. Generally speaking, the tribes in the east between New York state and the Ohio river, and in particular those belonging to the confederation known as the Six Nations had tended to support the British, and the bitterness then aroused continued after the peace. No clear political conception had been formulated of the relationship of the Indians either to the old or the new government especially in respect of rights in the lands over which the natives had formerly roamed at will; and their protest was that the British had purported to transfer to the United States, a title which they did not possess. As a measure of mitigation, the British conceived the idea of setting apart a neutral zone between the two countries for Indian settlement, but this did not, apparently, develop to the point of definite proposal. In addition to this, charges and countercharges were made by both countries of failure to carry out the terms of the treaty in such matters as the return of slaves, the confiscation of properties, the prosecution of individuals and the withdrawal of British troops from fortified border points. These, with the events developing in Europe and the need of both for the restoration of trade, induced a common desire to remove these frictions, which eventuated in the treaty of 1794: (Jay's Treaty, A Study in Commerce and Diplomacy, Bemis, pp. 109 et.seq.)\nAssuming, then, a broader authority under the prerogative in negotiating a peace treaty, neither the causes nor the purposes of the treaty of 1794 bring it within that category.\nA treaty is primarily an executive act establishing relationships between what are recognized as two or more independent states acting in sovereign capacities; but as will be seen, its implementation may call for both legislative and judicial action. Speaking generally, provisions that give recognition to incidents of sovereignty or deal with matters in exclusively sovereign aspects, do not require legislative confirmation: for example, the recognition of independence, the establishment of boundaries and, in a treaty of peace, the transfer of sovereignty over property, are deemed executed and the treaty becomes the muniment or evidence of the political or proprietary title. Stipulations for future social or commercial relations assume a state of peace: when peace is broken by war, by reason of the impossibility of their exercise, they are deemed to be abrogated as upon a failure of the condition on which they depend. But provisions may expressly or impliedly break in upon these general considerations; the terms may contemplate continuance or suspension during a state of war. The interpretation is according to the rules that govern that of instruments generally ; from the entire circumstantial background, the nature of the matters dealt with and the objects in view, we gather the intention of the parties as expressed in the language used. When such matters touch individuals, the judicial organ must act but a result that brought about non-concurrence between the judicial and the executive branches, say as to abrogation, and apart from any question of an international adjudication, would, to say the least, be undesirable.\nExcept as to diplomatic status and certain immunities and to belligerent rights, treaty provisions affecting matters within the scope of municipal law, that is, which purport to change existing law or restrict the future action of the legislature, including, under our constitution, the participation of the Crown, and in the absence of a constitutional provision declaring the treaty itself to be law of the state, as in the United States, must be supplemented by statutory action. An instance of the joint involvement of executive, legislative and judicial organs is shown by the provisions of the treaty of 1783 respecting the holding of lands in the United States by subjects of Great Britain, including their heirs and assigns, and vice versa. These were supplemented by 37 Geo. III, c. 97 which was declared to continue so long as the treaty should do so and no longer. In Sutton v. Sutton 8, the Master of the Rolls, Sir John Leach, held that this provision was not annulled by the war of 1812, that so far the statute remained in force and that \"the heirs and assigns of every American who held lands in Great Britain at the time mentioned in the Act of 37 Geo. III are, so far as regards these lands, to be treated not as aliens but as native subjects.\"\nTo the enactment of fiscal provisions, certainly in the case of a treaty not a peace treaty, the prerogative does not extend, and only by legislation can customs duties be imposed or removed or can the condition under which goods may be brought into this country be affected. I agree, therefore, with Cameron J. in holding that legislation was necessary to bring within municipal law the exemption of the clause in question. Legislation to that effect was enacted, in Upper Canada by 41 Geo. III, c. 5, s. 6, repealed by 4 Geo. IV, c. 11; in Lower Canada by the enabling statute, 36 Geo. III, c. 7 and the ordinance of 1796 made thereunder, the former having been continued by annual renewals up to January 1, 1813 when it lapsed. No legislation is suggested to have been passed by any other province. For over a century, then, there has been no statutory provision in this country giving effect to that clause of the article.\nThe particular privilege lay within a structure of settled international relations between sovereign states and from its nature was not viewed as intended to be perpetual. Following the treaty of 1783 large scale transfers of Indians belonging to the Six Nations and more western tribes took place from the United States to lands north of Lake Erie. This was a major step which was bound to affect materially the 'circumstances instigating the clause.\nBut the Indians north of the boundary were not confined to the district between Montreal and Detroit: they inhabited also the eastern maritime provinces and the territories to the west of central Canada,; these were within the general language but there has been no suggestion that the treaty was significant to them, much less that they have ever claimed its privilege.\nIn 1794 European settlement of North America was in its early stages. In 1768 a treaty had been made with the Indians that had placed the western boundary of the advance south of the Great Lakes at the Ohio river. The lands to the north and west of those lakes were within the charter granted to the Hudson's Bay Company. The section of the international boundary from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains was not fixed until 1818 and that beyond to the Pacific ocean until 1846. Confederation succeeded in 1867 and a few years later drew within its orbit all the territory reaching to the Pacific and the far north. Government in relation to the Indians was thus greatly extended. Continuing the administration inaugurated by Sir William Johnson in 1744 and extended to Quebec in 1763, (Canada and Its Provinces, Vol. IV, p. 695 et seq.) ordinances for the welfare of the Indians and the protection of their lands were passed in Lower Canada as early as 1777 and a partial consolidation was made in 1840 by 3-4 Vict., c. 44. In Upper Canada, 5 William IV, c. 9 and 2 Vict., c. 15 provided similar safeguards. Legislation of the province of Canada, 13-14 Vict., c. 42, 14-15 Vict., c. 106 and 20 Vict., c. 26 had in view the preservation of their settlements and their gradual introduction to the customs and mode of life of western civilization. Then 31 Vict., c. 42 committed the management of their lands to the Department of the Secretary of State and by 32-33 Vict., c. 6 comprehensive provision was made for their gradual enfranchisement and the management of their affairs. These enactments were consolidated by 43 Vict., 28 and this with modifications has now become the present Indian Act.\nIndian affairs generally, therefore, have for over a century been the subject of expanding administration throughout what is now the Dominion, superseding the local enactments following the treaty designed to meet an immediate urgency. In the United States the last statutory provision dealing with duties on goods brought in by Indians was repealed in 1897. This appears from the case of United States v. Garrow 9. In that case, also, it was pointed out that under the Ghent treaty the contracting parties merely \"engaged\" themselves to restore by legislation the \"possessions, rights and priveleges\" of the Indians enjoyed in 1811 but that no such enactment had been passed. The article itself was held to have been abrogated by the war of 1812: Karnuth v. United States 10. In the last decade of the 18th century peace had been reached between the United States and the tribes living generally between Lake Champlain and the Mississippi river. There followed the slow but inevitable march of events paralleled by that in this country; and today there remain along the border only fragmentary reminders of that past. The strife had waged over the free and ancient hunting grounds and their fruits, lands which were divided between two powers, but that life in its original mode and scope has long since disappeared.\nThese considerations seem to justify the conclusion that both the Crown and Parliament of this country have treated the provisional accommodation as having been replaced by an exclusive code of new and special rights and privileges. Appreciating fully the obligation of good faith toward these wards of the state, there can be no doubt that the conditions constituting the raison d'\u00eatre of the clause were and have been considered such as would in foreseeable time disappear. That a radical change of this nature brings about a cesser of such a treaty provision appears to be supported by the authorities available: McNair, The Law of Treaties, 378-381. Assuming that art. 9 of the Treaty of Ghent extended to the exemption, it was only an \"engagement\" to restore which, by itself, could do no more than to revive the clause in its original treaty effect, and supplementary action was clearly envisaged. Whether, then, the time of its expiration has been reached or not it is not here necessary to decide; it is sufficient to say that there is no legislation now in force implementing the stipulation.\nThere remains the question of exemption under s. 102 of c. 98, (1927) and s. 86(1) of c. 149, R.S.C. 1952, the former of which was repealed as of June 20, 1951. I can find nothing in these provisions that assists the appellant. To be taxed as by s. 102 \"at the same rate as other persons in the locality\" refers obviously and only to personal or real property under local taxation; it cannot be construed to extend to customs duties imposed on importation.\nSimilarly in 86(1), property \"situated on a reserve\" is unequivocal and does not mean property entering this country or passing an international boundary. On the argument made, the exemption would be limited to situations in which that boundary bounded also the reserve and would be a special indulgence to the small fraction of Indians living on such a reserve, a consequence which itself appears to me to be a sufficient answer.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed and with costs if demanded.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKellock J.:\u2014The appellant, who is described in the petition herein as \"an Indian subject to the provisions of the Indian Act, Statutes of Canada 1951 Chapter 29\", at all material times resided at the St. Regis Indian Reserve, Cornwall Island. It is contended on his behalf that contrary to Art. 3 of the Jay Treaty of the 19th November, 1794, between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, he was improperly charged customs duty on certain articles brought into Canada on or subsequent to the 19th of October, 1951. Art. 3 of the treaty reads in part as follows:\nNo Duty on Entry shall ever be levied by either Party on Peltries brought by Land, or Inland Navigation into the said Territories respectively, nor shall the Indians passing or repassing with their own proper Goods and Effects of whatever nature, pay for the same any Impost or Duty whatever. But Goods in Bales or other large Packages unusual among Indians shall not be considered as Goods belonging bona fide to Indians.\nThe appellant contends (1) that this article became part of the municipal law in Canada without the necessity of any legislation either authorizing it or confirmatory thereof, and (2) that there is no legislation subsequently enacted which affects the right claimed.\nIn view of the conclusion to which I have come with respect to the second point, I do not find it necessary to consider the first. The appellant admits that at least since the Statute of Westminster 1931, it was competent to Parliament to legislate with respect to the right claimed.\nS. 86(1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, reads as follows:\n86(1) Notwithstanding any other Act of the Parliament of Canada or any Act of the legislature of a province, but subject to subsection (2) and to section 82, the following property is exempt from taxation, namely,\n* * *\n(b) the personal property of an Indian or band situated on a reserve, and no Indian or band is subject to taxation in respect of the ownership, occupation, possession or use of any property mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) or is otherwise subject to taxation in respect of any such property; and no succession duty, inheritance tax or estate duty is payable on the death of any Indian in respect of any such property or the succession thereto if the property passes to an Indian, nor shall any such property be taken into account in determining the duty payable under the Dominion Succession Duty Act on or in respect of other property passing to an Indian.\nBefore the property here in question could become situated on a reserve, it had become liable to customs duty at the border. There has been no attempt to impose any other tax. Section 89(1) and (2) reads as follows:\n89(1) For the purposes of sections 86 and 88, personal property that was\n(a) purchased by Her Majesty with Indian moneys or moneys appropriated by Parliament for the use and benefit of Indians or bands, or\n(b) given to Indians or to a band under a treaty or agreement between a band and Her Majesty,\nshall be deemed always to be situated on a reserve.\n(2) Every transaction purporting to pass title to any property that is by this section deemed to be situated on a reserve, or any interest in such property, is void unless the transaction is entered into with the consent of the Minister or is entered into between members of a band or between the band and a member thereof.\nIt is quite plain from this section that the actual situation of the personal property on a reserve is contemplated by s. 86 and that any argument suggesting a notional situation is not within the intendment of, that section.\nIt is, moreover, provided by s. 87 that\n87. Subject to the terms of any treaty and any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, all laws of general application from time to time in force in any province are applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act or any order, rule, regulation or by-law made thereunder, and except to the extent that such laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made by or under this Act.\nI think it is quite clear that \"treaty\" in this section does not extend to an international treaty such as the Jay Treaty but only to treaties with Indians which are mentioned throughout the statute.\nIn my opinion the provisions of the Indian Act constitute a code governing the rights and privileges of Indians, and except to the extent that immunity from general legislation such as the Customs Act or the Customs Tariff Act is to be found in the Indian Act, the terms of such general legislation apply to Indians equally with other citizens of Canada.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

The Crown claimed that \"mouton\" was a fur and therefore subject to excise tax under s. 80A of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179. This claim was allowed by the Exchequer Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nA consideration of all the evidence and of the authorities and dictionary definitions brings one to the conclusion that neither in technical terms nor in common speech nor in that of those who deal in such products would the skin of a mature merino sheep with the wool or hair attached to it be described as a fur. It does not appear to be possible to take an article or substance which is not fur and by dressing and dyeing it to produce a dressed or dyed fur. The merino sheep is a wool-bearing animal and not a fur bearing one.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Cameron J. 1, in an action to recover excise tax.\nJ. J. Spector, Q.C. and H. Plaxton for the appellant.\nW. R. Jackett, Q.C. and K. E. Eaton for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Cameron J. dated March 17, 1954 declaring that the respondent is entitled to recover $573.08 Excise Tax together with certain penalties and costs.\nThe action was brought for the purpose of determining whether the product sold by the appellant and described as \"mouton\" was subject to tax under s. 80A of the Excise Tax Act which, so far as relevant, reads as follows:\u2014\n80A 1. There shall be imposed, levied and collected, an excise tax equal to fifteen per cent of the current market value of all dressed furs, dyed furs and dressed and dyed furs,\u2014\n(i) imported into Canada, payable by the importer or transferee of such goods before they are removed from the custody of the proper customs officer; or\n(ii) dressed, dyed, or dressed and dyed in Canada, payable by the dresser or dyer at the time of delivery by him. The product in question and the methods used in preparing it for sale are described in detail in the evidence. The appellant purchases the raw skins of shearlings of the merino type usually from abattoirs but sometimes from wool pullers. A shearling is a sheep that has been shorn once. Most of the skins used by the appellant are purchased in car-load lots from the United States. After being subjected to processes which are described in detail in the reasons of the learned trial judge and being dyed the end product closely resembles certain types of fur such as beaver, nutria or seal.\nIt should be mentioned that, while the learned trial judge refers in his reasons to the skins purchased by the appellant as coming from a young lamb of the merino type, both counsel agreed that in fact the skins are those of mature sheep.\nThe main contest at the trial was as to whether \"mouton\" was fur or was a product other than fur which had been prepared to simulate fur. The learned judge found that it was a fur, that it was unnecessary to decide whether it had been dressed as it had admittedly been dyed, and that, consequently, it was subject to tax.\nThe learned judge states that he had no reason to question the honesty or sincerity of any of the witnesses and his findings do not turn on any question of credibility.\nIn the course of his reasons the learned trial judge says:\u2014\nCounsel for the defendant submits that in order to bring his client within the liability imposed by s. 80A, the Crown must establish that what it did was to dress, or dye, or dress and dye, a fur, and he argues, therefore, that the first and main question for determination is this\u2014Is a sheepskin (or the Merino type shearling which his client bought) a fur? He contends, of course, that no one would consider what he calls \"a barnyard sheepskin\" to be a fur.\nIn my view, however, that is not the question to be answered. It is rather this. Was that which the defendant delivered (''mouton\")\u2014a dyed fur or a dressed and dyed fur?\"\nWith the greatest respect, it seems to me that the form in which the learned judge states the question tends to becloud the issue. It does not appear to me to be possible to take an article or substance which is not fur and by dressing and dyeing it to produce a dressed or dyed fur. Its appearance may be changed so that no-one but an expert can say that it is not a fur but its substance remains unaltered.\nThe evidence relied upon by the respondent relates almost entirely to the end product rather than the original skin. A consideration of all the evidence and of the authorities and dictionary definitions to which we were referred, brings me to the conclusion that neither in technical terms nor in common speech nor in that of those who deal in such products would the skin of a mature merino sheep with the wool or hair attached to it be described as a fur.\nThe evidence shews that while \"persian lamb\" has long been described as a fur, it is distinguished from the pelts of other types of lamb or sheep. In the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1952) Vol. 20 at page 475, domestic sheep are grouped into six types. The Merino sheep is placed in the \"Fine-wool type\", while the only breeds placed in the \"Fur type\" are Karakul and Romanov, the former including \"persian lamb\".\nWhile the regulations to be mentioned have an object different from that of the Excise Act, it is of some assistance in deciding the meaning commonly attributed to the words \"fur\" or \"fur-bearing\" to observe that in the regulations made by P.C. .2336 (1951) fur-bearing and wool-bearing animals are contrasted with each other. Clause 1(d) reads as follows:\u2014\n(d) \"fur\" means the skin of any animal, whether fur-bearing, hair-bearing, or wool-bearing, that is not in the unhaired condition;\nNo such definition is contained in the Excise Act.\nIn my opinion the merino sheep is a wool-bearing animal and not a fur-bearing one, its skin although with the wool attached is not a fur, and it is not, and could not be, transmuted into a fur by the processes to which it is subjected.\nIt follows that I would allow the appeal and dismiss the information with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Plaxton & Company.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. R. Jackett.\n1 [1954] Ex. C.R. 247.\n",

The conviction was quashed by a majority in the Court of Appeal on the ground that there was no evidence to support it.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIn law, it is not a valid objection to a conviction for conspiracy to contend that the accused was obliged to meet the proof of the substantive offence of which, however, he was not charged. Likewise, it matters little that in the description of the substantive offence, as is the case for the offences created by s. 471, the accused has the burden of justifying certain acts which, without that justification, are deemed criminal.

Pour d\u00e9terminer cette cause, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'entrer dans le d\u00e9tail de chacun de ces points. Il suffit des consid\u00e9rations suivantes.\nAux raisons de jugement de la majorit\u00e9, on reconna\u00eet que l'intim\u00e9 a commis l'offense substantive faisant l'objet du complot dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9. C'est ainsi qu'on dit:\u2014\nLe juge (au proc\u00e8s), comme l'avocat de la Couronne d'ailleurs, s'est attard\u00e9 \u00e0 exposer, \u00e0 d\u00e9duire et \u00e0 conclure que l'appelant avait, sans autorisation ni excuse l\u00e9gitime, imprim\u00e9 le verso d'un billet de banque. Il n'y a aucun doute que rappelant l'a fait, en partie.\nEt plus loin:\u2014\nSans doute qu'elle (la Couronne) a prouv\u00e9 que l'appelant, \u00e0 la connaissance des deux Chavigny, a imprim\u00e9 le verso d'un billet de banque de dix dollars.\nOn reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement l'existence d'une entente, entre Gagnon et les fr\u00e8res Chavigny, n'ayant d'autre objet que l'acte ci-dessus imput\u00e9 \u00e0 Gagnon, m\u00eame si, par ailleurs, on pr\u00eate, en fait, \u00e0 cette entente, un motif qui, en droit, soumet-on, la rendrait non criminelle.\nJamais, dit-on, n'ont-ils (les Chavigny) admis une entente quelconque pour imprimer de la fausse monnaie. Bien au contraire, ils ont compris que l'appelant tentait de se servir de son brevet comme moyen de d\u00e9celer les faux billets de banque et\u2014ajoutent-ils\u2014on esp\u00e9rait pouvoir le c\u00e9der contre consid\u00e9ration avantageuse, l'un des Chavigny participant au profit anticip\u00e9 en donnant \u00e0 l'appelant une part substantielle d'actions d'une exploitation mini\u00e8re.\nA aucun moment, en aucune occasion, les fr\u00e8res Chavigny ont-ils admis avoir form\u00e9 une entente avec l'appelant pour l'impression de papier monnaie.\n* * *\nLe brevet que poss\u00e9dait l'appelant avait pour but de d\u00e9celer la fausse monnaie. Ce brevet n'est pas fallacieux car il est exploit\u00e9 dans certains pays europ\u00e9ens. C'est sur cette base et avec l'espoir raisonnable qu'on pouvait en attendre que les fr\u00e8res Chavigny furent convenus d'\u00e9change mat\u00e9riel r\u00e9ciproque avec l'appelant.\n* * *\nDans l'esp\u00e8ce, on ne peut h\u00e9siter un moment \u00e0 conclure que les fr\u00e8res Chavigny n'ont conclu avec l'appelant qu'une entente se rapportant \u00e0 l'exploitation de son brevet, lequel avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour but d'int\u00e9grer dans les billets de banque un dessin particulier et exclusif.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que pour l'obtention du mat\u00e9riel requis \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de leur entente, l'intim\u00e9 et les Chavigny ont eu recours \u00e0 la supercherie, \u00e0 de fausses repr\u00e9sentations et \u00e0 l'emploi de noms fictifs. A cette preuve, on ne trouve aux raisons de la majorit\u00e9, aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Pour sa part, le Juge au proc\u00e8s en a d\u00e9duit que l'intim\u00e9 et ses complices \u00e9taient conscients qu'aucune autorit\u00e9 ou excuse l\u00e9gitime ne couvrait ni leurs agissements ni l'entente y pr\u00e9sidant. Concluant qu'il y avait eu complot pour mettre en circulation de faux billets de banque, il a trouv\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 coupable de l'accusation telle que port\u00e9e, soit de complot avec d'autres personnes pour faire certains de ces actes qui conduisent \u00e0 la mise en circulation de faux billets de banque et que, pour cette raison, la loi d\u00e9fend sp\u00e9cifiquement, \u00e0 l'article 471 du Code Criminel.\nLa majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel aurait, aux vues de l'appelante, erron\u00e9ment interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l'acte d'accusation comme comportant une accusation de complot pour mettre en circulation de faux billets de banque. Certes, certains passages des raisons de jugement supportent cette pr\u00e9tention; mais il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de s'y arr\u00eater. Dans les vues de la majorit\u00e9, \"l'erreur fondamentale de jugement de premi\u00e8re instance\" r\u00e9siderait dans les faits suivants:\u2014\nDana l'esp\u00e8ce, dit-on, l'appelant fut cit\u00e9 en justice pour avoir conspir\u00e9 avec d'autres personnes dans le but d'imprimer, en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie, de faux billets de banque sans autorisation l\u00e9gale et sans excuse l\u00e9gitime. On saisit imm\u00e9diatement que si la poursuite, loin de se restreindre \u00e0 la preuve d'une entente, entre dans le champ de la preuve du d\u00e9lit m\u00eame, l'accus\u00e9 est accul\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre \u00e0 la fois de deux d\u00e9lits: le premier, susceptible de s'\u00e9tablir sans qu'il ait a offrir une d\u00e9fense (la conspiration), et l'autre qui peut \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 (le d\u00e9lit m\u00eame), s'il n'offre pas une d\u00e9fense pour le repousser, c'est-\u00e0-dire s'il ne tente la justification de son acte.\nComme le signale Kenny, dans Outlines of Criminal Law, 13e \u00e9d. page 294, il est rare que l'on puisse \u00e9tablir par des preuves directes le fait m\u00eame du complot ; car, en raison de leur nature m\u00eame, ces accords sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement conclus d'une mani\u00e8re aussi sommaire que secr\u00e8te. Aussi ne peut-on, le plus souvent, les \u00e9tablir, qu'en les d\u00e9duisant de la conduite des parties. Parfois un acte manifeste de celles-ci tend incontestablement \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation du but all\u00e9gu\u00e9, au point de faire supposer que cet acte est la cons\u00e9quence d'un accord conclu en vue dudit but. De plus, en contractant l'accord, chaque partie adopte tous ses complices en qualit\u00e9 d'agents charg\u00e9s de l'aider \u00e0 en assurer la r\u00e9alisation. Aussi en vertu des principes relatifs au principal et \u00e0 l'agent, tout acte accompli dans ce but par l'un des agents peut-il \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 comme preuve contre l'auteur principal. Cette th\u00e9orie s'applique naturellement, dit l'auteur, \u00e0 tous les d\u00e9lits dans lesquels plusieurs personnes sont mises en cause. et non aux seuls proc\u00e8s pour complot. Cette derni\u00e8re proposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement approuv\u00e9e par cette Cour dans Koufis v. His Majesty the King 2. Aussi bien, en droit, on ne peut reconna\u00eetre comme grief valide le fait que dans un proc\u00e8s pour complot, un accus\u00e9 soit dans l'obligation de faire face \u00e0 la preuve de l'offense substantive dont, cependant, il n'est pas accus\u00e9. Il importe peu \u00e9galement que dans la description de l'offense substantive, comme c'est le cas pour les offenses cr\u00e9\u00e9es par l'article 471, soit impos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 le fardeau de se justifier d'avoir commis des actes qui, sans cette justification, sont tenus comme criminels. Ceux qui s'entendent pour commettre ces actes et les commettent sont passibles d'\u00eatre poursuivis pour complot et la th\u00e9orie de la loi sur le complot, aussi bien que sur les m\u00e9thodes de preuve, demeure la m\u00eame. D'ailleurs, en l'esp\u00e8ce, il appara\u00eet clairement du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, que si le Juge a conclu \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9, ce n'est pas en raison d'une simple absence de preuve de justification, mais en raison de la pr\u00e9sence au dossier d'une preuve positive qu'aucune autorit\u00e9 ou excuse l\u00e9gitime ne couvrait les agissements de l'intim\u00e9 et de ses complices, ou l'entente y pr\u00e9sidant. \"Il n'y a aucun doute\", dit le Juge en conclusion, \"que le 3 mars 1953, lorsque la police faisait irruption \u00e0 Valcartier, elle d\u00e9couvrait un repaire de faussaires.\"\nEn pr\u00e9sence de cette preuve de supercherie, d'emploi de noms fictifs, de fausses repr\u00e9sentations, pour voiler leur participation dans l'obtention des mat\u00e9riaux requis \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de leur entente, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n'a pas ajout\u00e9 foi aux motifs par eux invoqu\u00e9s pour tenter de justifier cette entente et les actes en d\u00e9coulant. Le Juge n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9, comme on semble vouloir l'impliquer au jugement a quo, par les affirmations des Chavigny ou de l'intim\u00e9 sur le point. Qu'un t\u00e9moin soit produit par la Couronne ou par l'accus\u00e9, peu importe, son t\u00e9moignage peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9 ou rejet\u00e9, en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie; et si, particuli\u00e8rement, certaines affirmations sont contredites ou sont suspectes au regard de toute la preuve, on ne peut reprocher au Juge du proc\u00e8s de les avoir \u00e9cart\u00e9es. Au jugement de la majorit\u00e9, on reproche aussi au Juge de premi\u00e8re instance et \u00e0 la Couronne d'avoir refus\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 la facult\u00e9 de soumettre certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. On admet, cependant, qu'on \"ne conna\u00eet ni l'\u00e9tendue ni la valeur de ces preuves\". Sur le point, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pu nous \u00e9clairer et a \u00e9ventuellement abandonn\u00e9 ce grief. Enfin, s'il faut dire que c'est \u00e0 bon droit que la Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inadmissible au dossier une certaine preuve apport\u00e9e par Suzanne Perrault, il ne fait aucun doute, aux raisons de jugement du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que sans cette preuve, ses conclusions eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 les m\u00eames.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: P.

Rees, [1956] S.C.R. 640\nDate: 1956-06-11\nHer Majesty The Queen Appellant;\nand\nCharles Marmaduke Rees Respondent.\n1955: May 11[1]; 1956: May 9, 10; 1956: June 11.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.\nON APPEL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCriminal law\u2014\"Knowingly or Wilfully\" contributing to juvenile delinquency\u2014Mens rea\u2014Whether honest belief that child was not a juvenile a defence\u2014Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160.\nUnder s. 33(1) (b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act (R.S.C. 1952, c. 160), the fact that an accused does not know that the girl is a juvenile and honestly and reasonably believes that she is over the age limit, constitutes a good defence.\nThe respondent was convicted under s. 33 of \"knowingly or wilfully\" contributing to juvenile delinquency. He had had sexual intercourse with a girl under 18 years of age with her consent. The girl had told him that she was 18 although she was only a few months over 16 and therefore a juvenile under the law of British Columbia. The juvenile court judge, stating that he was bound by the decision in Regina v. Paris (105 C.C.C. 62), held that, as a matter of law, the fact that the respondent honestly believed that the girl was 18 could afford no defence to the charge and made no finding as to whether the respondent did in fact so believe. An appeal to a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was dismissed. But the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowed a further appeal and ordered that the case be remitted to the judge of the Supreme Court.\nThis Court granted leave to appeal on two questions of law: (i) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the respondent could not be convicted unless he knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that the girl was under 18; and (ii) whether it erred in law or exceeded its jurisdiction in remitting the case to the judge of the Supreme Court.\nHeld (Fauteux J. dissenting): That the appeal should be dismissed, the order referring the case back struck out, the conviction quashed and an acquittal directed.\nPer Kerwin, C.J.: The words \"knowingly or wilfully\" in s. 33(1) (b) permitted the respondent to raise the issue of mens rea. There can be no doubt as to the general rule and that where it applies it covers every element of an offence. Consequently, it applied not only to the act which it was alleged contributed to the delinquency, but also to the accused's state of mind as to the girl's age. It was open to the trial judge to register a conviction if he concluded on the evidence, either that the accused knew the girl was under the age fixed by law, or that, notwithstanding his pro forma question to her, he proceeded without a real belief in her answer that she was above the age. The trial judge found neither of these facts.\nThis Court is in a position to make the order that the Court of Appeal should have made under s. 1014(3) of the old Criminal Code.\nPer Taschereau J.: There is no valid reason why the word \"knowingly\" in s. 33 should be interpreted as relating only to the quality of the act, and not to the age of the child. Unless the contrary appears in the statute, that word applies to all the elements of the actus reus.\nIn view of s. 2 of the Act which defines the word \"child\", and in view of the conclusive evidence heard at the trial, it is impossible to reasonably hold that the girl was not apparently of the age of 18, or that the respondent did not have an honest belief that she had reached that age.\nPer Rand and Locke JJ.: The general principle of criminal law is that accompanying a prohibited act there must be an intent in respect of every element of the act, and that is ordinarily conveyed in statutory offences by the word \"knowingly\". As is seen in s. 33(1) (a) and (b), the offending act embraces the elements of something done of a certain quality and by or in relation to a \"child\". The principle would thus extend the word \"knowingly\" to the age as well as to the conduct. The language of the statute contemplates the application of the principle of mens rea.\nIt was not shown that the respondent either knew the age of the girl to be under 18 or was otherwise chargeable with that knowledge.\nPer Cartwright and Nolan JJ.: The words \"knowingly or wilfully\" govern the whole of s. 33. Therefore honest ignorance on the part of the accused of the one fact which alone renders his action criminal (in this instance the age of the girl) affords an answer to the charge. The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under the Act being the same as under s. 1014 of the Criminal Code, it had no jurisdiction to refer the matter back to the judge of the Supreme Court. Proceeding to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal ought to have given, the appeal should be dismissed as no tribunal acting reasonably could have found it to be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent knew, or was wilfully blind to, the fact that the girl was under age of 18 at the time.\nPer Fauteux J. (dissenting): The words \"knowingly or wilfully\" in the section do not relate to all the constituent elements of the offence which are (1) the doing of an act; (2) contributing to the delinquency; (3) of a child. They relate only to the first. To apply them to the other two elements would permit the accused to substitute his own opinions and have them prevail over the opinion of the court as to whether the act complained of would contribute to delinquency or as to whether the person involved was \"apparently\" over the age of 18. The accused assumes the risk that the opinion he forms from appearance as to the age of the girl will be the same as the court's opinion.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] , allowing the appeal from a conviction under the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\nL. A. Kelley, Q.C. and J.J. Urie for the appellant.\nH. A. D. Oliver for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014It should be held, in accordance with the settled course of judicial decision, that the words \"knowingly or wilfully\" in s. 33(1) (b) of The Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, permitted the respondent to raise the issue of mens rea. There can be no doubt as to the general rule and that where it applies it covers every element of an offence. In the present instance it applies not only to the act which it is alleged contributed to the delinquency, but also to the accused's state of mind as to the girl's age. It would be open to the Judge trying the accused to register a conviction if he concluded on the evidence, either that the accused knew the girl was under the age fixed by law, or that, notwithstanding his pro forma question to her, he proceeded without a real belief in her answer that she was above that age. Here the trial Judge found neither of these facts as he felt himself bound by Rex v. Paris[3] . On an appeal by the present respondent to Wood J. the latter followed his own judgment in the Paris case. I agree with the Court of Appeal[4] that that decision cannot be supported. Rex v. Prince[5] , does not apply as the statute there in question did not contain the word \"knowingly\". More to the point are Emary v. Nolloth[6] and Groom v. Grimes[7] . The Court of Appeal therefore correctly set aside the conviction.\nIt was suggested that, in view of the holding of this Court in Welch v. The King[8] , the judgment before us was a nullity, (and therefore the order of Wood J. should stand), because it not only allowed the appeal from the judgment of Wood J. but remitted the case to that learned judge. In the Welch case, however, the accused had been found guilty on his first trial and, while that conviction had been set aside by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, we held on an appeal from that Court's order affirming a subsequent conviction that the Court of Appeal on the first occasion had not directed an acquittal, or directed a new trial, or made such other order as justice requires as specified in s. 1014(3) of the old Criminal Code. Here the respondent had not been tried before and on this appeal we are in a position to make the order that the Court of Appeal should have made.\nThe respondent has served his sentence and this was a test case in which the Attorney General of British Columbia desired the opinion of this Court on the two points mentioned. Under these circumstances the Order appealed from should be varied by striking out the reference back and by quashing the conviction and directing an acquittal.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The facts in the present case have been fully exposed in the judgments of my colleagues, and it is therefore useless to deal with them once more.\nThe respondent was charged under s. 33(1) (b) of the \"Act respecting Juvenile Delinquents\". This section reads as follows:\u2014\n33. (1) Any person, whether the parent or guardian of the child or not, who, knowingly or wilfully, (b) does any act producing, promoting, or contributing to a child's being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent, is liable on summary conviction before a juvenile Court or a magistrate to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or to both fine and imprisonment.\nHe was found guilty by a judge of the Juvenile Court in and for the City of Vancouver, and sentenced to be imprisoned at Oakalla for a term of six months. The magistrate thought that he was bound by the decision of Mr. Justice Wood of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Regina v. Paris[9] , where it was held:\u2014\nIn view of the fact that juvenile court judges in Vancouver have held throughout the past 28 years that, despite the inclusion of the words \"knowingly or wilfully\" in the Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1929, ch. 46 (Dom.) and in the informations thereunder, the fact that an accused thereunder did not know that the girl in question was a juvenile, i.e., under 18 years of age, and honestly and reasonably believed that she was over 18, does not constitute a good defence, Wood, J. was of the opinion that the contrary should not be held by a single judge of the Supreme Count and, therefore, dismissed an appeal based on said ground, where the girl was in fact 16 years old but told the accused that she was 19, and looked even older.\nAppeal in the present case was brought again before Mr. Justice Wood, who still held that the section applied, and that in such circumstances, it was not a valid defence for the accused to say that he believed honestly and reasonably that the girl was over 18, while in fact she had not reached yet that age. He therefore followed his previous decision in Regina v. Paris (supra).\nThe Court of Appeal reversed that decision and held that upon the express language of the statute which uses the words \"knowingly or wilfully\", it is a valid defence for an accused to show that he acted upon the honest belief that the girl was 18 years of age. It was therefore ruled that Regina v. Paris (supra) had been wrongfully decided, and could not be considered as a correct exposition of the law.\nIt has been submitted on behalf of the appellant that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia conflicts with a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of England, in the case of Regina v. Prince[10] . In that case, the accused was charged with having unlawfully taken one Annie Phillips, an unmarried girl being under the age of sixteen, out of the possession and against the will of her father.\nSection 55 of the Offences Against the Persons Act provided that:\u2014\nWhoever shall unlawfully take any unmarried girl under the age of sixteen years of age, out of the possession and against the will of her father or mother, or any other person having the lawful care or charge of her shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.\nThe Court of Criminal Appeal held that it was no defence to an indictment under s. 55 that the defendant bona fide and reasonably believed that the girl was older than sixteen. Baron Bramwell who delivered the judgment of the Court which was assented to by Lord Chief Baron Kelly, Cleasby, B., Grove, J., Pollock, B., Amphlett, B., said at page 142:\u2014\nIn addition to these considerations one may add that the Statute does use the word \"unlawfully\" and does not use the words \"knowingly or not believing to the contrary\".\nAnd at page 144:\u2014\nThe question, therefore, is reduced to this, whether the words in 24 & 25 Vict. c. 100, s. 55, that whosoever shall unlawfully take \"any unmarried girl being under the age of sixteen, out of the possession of her father\" are to be read as if they were \"being under the age of sixteen, and he knowing she was under that age.\" No such words are contained in the statute, nor is the word \"maliciously\", \"knowingly\", or any other word used that can be said to involve a similar meaning.\nIt is clear to my mind that the Court implied that if the word \"knowingly\" had been used instead of the word \"unlawfully\", the decision of the Court would have been different.\nIt is further submitted that the word \"knowingly\" has reference only to the quality of the act charged and not to the knowledge that the juvenile was in fact a juvenile. I do not believe that this contention can be upheld. A meaning must be given to the word \"knowingly\" in the statute, and it cannot be disregarded. I see no valid reason why it should be interpreted as relating only to the quality of the act, and not to the age of the child. The law makes no such distinction, and I would invade the legislative field if I did attempt to make any.\nSince the Prince case (supra), this word \"knowingly\" has been considered by the courts, and it has been rightly held that when it is found in a statute, full effect must be given to it. Unless the contrary appears, it applies to all the elements of the actus reus. For instance, the offence of \"knowingly\" selling intoxicants to a person under age is not committed, if the vendor honestly believes the child to be over the required age. (Groom v. Grimes[11] ). In that case, the Court of Appeal of England held:\u2014\nA licence-holder cannot be convicted under sect. 2 of the Intoxicating Liquors (Sale to Children) Act, 1901, for \"knowingly selling\" intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of fourteen years, when he himself has no knowledge of the sale and when the barman who sells the liquor has no knowledge that the person to whom he sells is under the age of fourteen years, but honestly believes that he has attained that age.\nIf any additional and more recent authorities are needed, vide: (Rex v. Cohen[12] ); (Gaumont v. Henry[13] ).\nProfessor Glanville Williams in his treatise on \"Criminal Law\" sums up the jurisprudence on the matter as follows:\u2014\n(c) We now see the influence of the word \"knowingly\", used in a statute, upon the rules relating to ignorance and mistake. On principle the word \"knowingly\" has no extra effect where the crime requires intention, for intention itself presupposes knowledge of the circumstances. The word \"knowingly\" does, however, affect the position where the crime can be committed recklessly. If the word is not included in the statute, the party will be deemed to act recklessly unless he mistakes a relevant fact; simple ignorance is not enough. But if the word is inserted, simple ignorance becomes a defence, and it is only knowledge (or its equivalent wilful blindness) that convicts.\nWhere Parliament in similar offences wishes to eliminate \"knowledge\" as an essential element, it says so in unmistakable terms. For instance, s. 138(1) of the Criminal Code reads:\u2014\nEvery male person who has sexual intercourse with a female person who\n(a) is not his wife, and\n(b) is under the age of fourteen years, whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or more, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life and to be whipped.\nSuch language is not used in s. 33(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, and such a wide difference in the phraseology clearly reveals the intention of the legislator. In the first case \"knowledge\" is immaterial, but it is essential in the second.\nI have therefore reached the conclusion that the interpretation of s. 33 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, as given by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia is right. Although I would dismiss the appeal, I do not think that any useful purpose can be served in remitting the matter to the lower court, as ordered by the Court of Appeal. In view of s. 2 of the Act which defines the word \"child\", and in view of the conclusive evidence heard at the trial, I am of opinion that it is impossible to reasonably hold that the girl was not apparently of the age of eighteen, or that the respondent did not have an honest belief that she had reached that age.\nSubject to the above modification, I would dismiss the appeal and direct the acquittal of the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014This appeal involves the interpretation of certain provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1929. The respondent was convicted of having \"knowingly or wilfully\" committed an act or acts\nproducing, promoting, or contributing to Lorraine Brander, a child, being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make the said child a delinquent\u2026.\nThe girl had told the respondent that she was 18 years old although she was in fact under that age. The question is whether the principle of mens rea applies to the element of the offence as to her age.\n\"Child\" is defined by s. 2(1) (a) as\nany boy or girl apparently or actually under the age of sixteen years, or such other age as may be directed in any province pursuant to subsection (2);\nThe age, for the purposes of the prosecution here, was 18 years.\nThe culpable act is declared in s. 33: :\u2014\n(1) Any person, whether the parent or guardian of the child or not, who knowingly or wilfully\n(a) aids, causes, abets or connives at the commission by a child of a delinquency, or\n(b) does any act producing, promoting, or contributing to a child's being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent, is liable on summary conviction before a Juvenile Court or a magistrate to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or to both fine and imprisonment.\nIn the definition of \"child\", the essential words are \"apparently or actually\" under the age specified. This expression must necessarily mean \"apparently and actually\" for otherwise an offence could be committed with a person over 21 years who was \"apparently\" under 18. That is obviously not the intention of the statute.\nSo read it might be suggested that the apparency is a fact to be found by the magistrate. But to what mind should it be apparent? to the magistrate, to the accused, to the average person of his age, or of any age? Whatever it may be, other language of the statute relieves me from exploring the question further and this is found in s. 33.\nMr. Kelley, on behalf of the Attorney General of British Columbia, argues that the words \"knowingly or wilfully\" in that section qualify only part of the offence described: the act which contributes to the delinquency. This seems to omit both the appreciation of its relation to the delinquency and the age of the child. But the former is not of materiality here, and it is on the latter that the issue hinges.\nThe general principle of criminal law is that accompanying a prohibited act there must be an intent in respect of every element of the act, and that is ordinarily conveyed in statutory offences by the word \"knowingly\". As stated by Professor Glanville Williams in his Criminal Law at p.131:\u2014\nIt is a general rule of construction of the word \"knowingly\" in a statute that it applies to all the elements of the actus reus.\nAs is seen in s-s. (1) (a) and (b) of s. 33, the offending act embraces both the elements of something done of a certain quality and by or in relation to a \"child\". The principle would thus extend the word \"knowingly\" to the age as well as the conduct. Is there anything in the statute to exclude its application?\nTo this the word \"wilfully\" is significant. Whatever it may mean in other contexts, I think the intention of s. 33 is this that either the offender knows the child to be under the age fixed or that he is indifferent as to age. In this, \"wilfully\" and as well, \"knowingly\", hark back to \"apparently or actually\" and in the combined conception the mind of the accused in relation to the child's age is an essential of the offending act. Where, therefore, there is belief that the child is 18 years or over, the offence is not committed: Groom v. Grimes[14] , where it was held that the offence of \"knowingly\" selling intoxicants to a person under 14 is not committed if the barman is not chargeable with knowledge that the child is under 14.\nIt is said that this Act, being intended for the protection of young persons, places the entire risk of age upon the accused; and that was the argument in Groom (supra). But whatever the policy of Parliament, its intention must be gathered from the language it has used; and on that of the provisions of the Act before us, I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal that so far from excluding the principle of mens rea, it contemplates it.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed; but as the matter has been fully opened before us, another circumstance must be considered. The accused has already served the sentence of six months imposed upon him. I am inclined to gather from the remarks of the judge of the Juvenile Court that if he had not felt himself bound by the case of Regina v. Paris[15] , he would have dismissed the charge: but in any event it was not shown that the accused either knew the age of the young woman to be under 18 years or was otherwise chargeable with that knowledge. In this situation, the judgment of this Court should be that the order of Wood J. affirming the conviction be vacated and that judgment be entered setting aside the conviction of the Judge of the Juvenile Court and dismissing the charge.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[16] whereby the appeal of the respondent from a judgment of Wood J. was allowed and it was ordered, in the words of the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal, \"that the case be remitted to the Honourable Mr. Justice Wood in the Supreme Court of British Columbia\".\nThe respondent was convicted on November 23, 1953 before the Judge of the Juvenile Court on the charge that he:\u2014\nat the said City of Vancouver, between the 24th and 27th days of October, A.D. 1953, knowingly or wilfully, did unlawfully commit an act or acts producing, promoting or contributing to Lorraine Brander, a child, being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make the said child a juvenile delinquent, to wit, by occupying the same bed and by having sexual intercourse with the said Lorraine Brander, contrary to the form of the Statute in such case made and provided.\nThe effect of the evidence at the trial may be briefly stated. The respondent had sexual intercourse with Lorraine Brander with her consent. The uncontradicted evidence of Lorraine Brander and of the respondent is that prior to the act of intercourse she had told him that she was 18 years of age; he deposed that he would have taken her to be 18 years or older. In fact her age was 16 years and 5 months. In the province of British Columbia a boy or girl under the age of 18 years is a \"child\" within the terms of the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\nThe learned Juvenile Court Judge held that, as a matter of law, the fact that the respondent honestly believed that the girl was over the age of 18 could afford no defence to the charge and made no finding as to whether the respondent did in fact so believe.\nPursuant to s. 37(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act the respondent applied to Wood J. for special leave to appeal; that learned judge granted leave to appeal and having heard the appeal dismissed it. Special leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was granted by that court and it disposed of the appeal as set out above.\nOn October 5, 1954, this Court granted leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. This leave having been granted pursuant to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, the appeal lies only \"in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction\" (s. 41(3)). Two such questions were argued before us: (i) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the respondent could not be convicted on the charge above set out unless he knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that Lorraine Brander was under the age of 18 years; and (ii) whether the Court of Appeal erred in law or exceeded its jurisdiction in remitting the case to Wood J..\nAs to the first point, I agree with the reasons and the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, but wish to add a few observations of a general nature.\nSection 7(2) of the Criminal Code provides as follows:\u2014\n7 (2) Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nIn the case at bar we are concerned with the application of the rule of the common law summed up in the first sentence of the maxim\u2014Ignorantia facti excusat; ignorantia juris non excusat. The rule has been stated and applied in countless cases. In The Queen v. Tolson[17] , Stephen J. says at page 188:\u2014\nI think it may be laid down as a general rule that an alleged offender is deemed to have acted under that state of facts which he in good faith and on reasonable grounds believed to exist when he did the act alleged to be an offence. I am unable to suggest any real exception to this rule, nor has one ever been suggested to me.\nand adds at page 189:\u2014\nOf course, it would be competent to the legislature to define a crime in such a way as to make the existence of any state of mind immaterial. The question is solely whether it has actually done so in this case.\nThe first of the statements of Stephen J. quoted above should now be read in the light of the judgment of Lord Goddard C.J., concurred in by Lynskey and Devlin JJ. in Wilson v. Inyang[18], which, in my opinion, rightly decides that the essential question is whether the belief entertained by the accused is an honest one and that the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds for such belief is merely relevant evidence to be weighed by the tribunal of fact in determining such essential question.\nThe question then is as to the true construction of the following words of s. 33(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, read in the context of the whole Act:\u2014\nAny person \u2026who, knowingly or wilfully \u2026does any act producing, promoting, or contributing to a child's being or becoming a juvenile delinquent, is liable on summary conviction to a fine \u2026or imprisonment\u2026 In approaching this question the following rules of construction should be borne in mind. In Watts and Gaunt v.\nThe Queen[19] , Estey J. says:\u2014\nWhile an offence of which mens rea is not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation, in view of the general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed such an intention.\nIn his book on Criminal Law (1953) at pages 131 and 133, Mr. Glanville Williams says:\u2014\nIt is a general rule of construction of the word \"knowingly\" in a Statute that it applies to all the elements of the actus reus \u2026\nThe sound principle of construction is to say that the requirement of knowledge, once introduced into the offence, governs the whole, unless Parliament has expressly provided to the contrary.\nIn my opinion these passages are supported by the authorities collected by the learned author at the pages mentioned and correctly state the general rule.\nIn argument counsel for the appellant stressed the case of R. v. Prince[20] but I agree with Mr. Oliver's submission that it is implicit in the reasons of both Blackburn J. and Bramwell B. that they would have decided that case differently if the section which they were called upon to construe had contained the word \"knowingly\".\nWere the matter doubtful, it would be of assistance to consider the provisions of the Criminal Code which is a statute of the same legislature in pari materia. Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 138 of the Criminal Code and their predecessors subsections (1) and (2) of s. 301 of the former code, illustrate the type of language employed by Parliament when it is intended to provide that the belief of an accused as to a matter of fact is irrelevant.\n138 (1) Every male person who has sexual intercourse with a female person who \u2026 is under the age of fourteen years, whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or more, is guilty \u2026\n138 (2) Every male person who has sexual intercourse with a female person who\u2026 is fourteen years of age or more and is under the age of sixteen years, whether or not he believes that she is sixteen years of age or more, is guilty\u2026\nThe contrast between the wording of these sub-sections, particularly those portions which I have italicized, and that of s. 33 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act is too sharp to be disregarded. While I have already expressed my agreement with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia on this point, I wish to expressly adopt the following passage:\u2014\nIn my view of the matter we must start out with the proposition that sexual intercourse with a woman, not under the age of 18 years and with her consent, is not a crime, except under exceptional and irrelevant circumstances. It follows that if the appellant had sexual intercourse with a girl not under 18 years of age he could not be convicted of contributing to her becoming a juvenile delinquent for the simple reason she is not a child within the meaning of the Act.\nIt is the age factor alone that, in these circumstances, moves the act from a non-criminal to a criminal category.\nIt follows, it seems to me, that when a man is charged with konwingly and wilfully doing an act that is unlawful only if some factor exists which makes it unlawful (in this instance the age of the girl) he cannot be convicted unless he knows of, or is wilfully blind to, the existence of that factor, and then with that knowledge commits the act intentionally and without any justifiable excuse.\nIt would indeed be a startling result if it should be held that in a case in which Parliament has seen fit to use the word \"knowingly\" in describing an offence honest ignorance on the part of the accused of the one fact which alone renders the action criminal affords no answer to the charge.\nTurning now to the question whether the Court of Appeal erred in remitting the case to Wood J., it will be observed that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is found in s. 37(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, reading as follows:\u2014\n37 (1) A Supreme Court judge may, in his discretion, on special grounds, grant special leave to appeal from any decision of the Juvenile Court or a magistrate; in any case where such leave is granted the procedure upon appeal shall be such as is provided in the case of a conviction on indictment, and the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to appeals from conviction on indictment mutatis mutandis apply to such appeal, save that the appeal shall be to a Supreme Court judge instead of to the Court of Appeal, with a further right of appeal to the Court of Appeal by special leave of that Court.\nHaving granted leave to appeal, the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, would appear to be the same as that exercised by it in an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence, which, at the date of the hearing and determination of the appeal, was to be found in s. 1014 of the Criminal Code, the relevant words being:\u2014\n1014 (1) On the hearing of any such appeal against conviction the court of appeal shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion\n(b) that the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law;\n(3) Subject to the special provisions contained in the following sections of this Part, when the court of appeal allows an appeal against conviction it may\n(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or\n(b) direct a new trial;\nand in either case may make such other order as justice requires.\nI have already indicated my view that the Court of Appeal was right in allowing the appeal on the ground of a wrong decision of a question of law by Wood J.. The judgment of my brother Fauteux in Welch v. The King[21] , concurred in by the majority of the Court, makes it clear that, having decided to allow the appeal, it became the duty of the Court of Appeal (i) to quash the conviction, and (ii) either to direct that a judgment of acquittal be entered, or to direct a new trial. I am unable to find that there was jurisdiction to refer the matter back to Wood J. in the manner set out in the opening paragraph of these reasons. The power \"to make such other order as justice requires\" is, I think, merely supplemental to the provisions of clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (3) of s. 1014.\nIt remains to consider what order we should make. In my view our duty is to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal ought to have given. I have examined all the evidence with care and have reached the conclusion that it is in the last degree improbable that the learned Juvenile Court Judge would have convicted the respondent if he had instructed himself correctly on the law. Indeed I do not think that any tribunal acting reasonably could have found it to be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent knew, or was wilfully blind to, the fact that Lorraine Brander was under the age of 18 years at the relevant time.\nIt follows that, in my opinion, the Court of Appeal should have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a judgment of acquittal to be entered and I would direct that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be amended to so provide. FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):\u2014The respondent was charged before a Judge of the Juvenile Court in and for the city of Vancouver, under s. 33(1) (b) of the Juvenile Delinquents' Act (1929) c. 46, enacting that:\u2014\nAny person, whether a parent or guardian of a child or not, who knowingly or wilfully\n(a) \u2026\n(b) does any act producing, promoting or contributing to a child's being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent, shall be liable on summary conviction before a Juvenile Court \u2026\nUnder the Act, a \"child\" means a boy or a girl under the age of sixteen years or such other age as may be directed in any province, which, in the province of British Columbia, is eighteen. According to the evidence, the female, in relation to whom the offence was alleged to have been committed, was, at the time of its commission, sixteen and therefore a child under and for all the purposes of the Act. The accused testified that from her appearance as well as from her own declaration to him, he believed that she was over eighteen. Relying, in fact, on such evidence and submitting, in law, that mens rea with respect to the age is of the essence of the offence, counsel for the accused asked for the dismissal of the charge. The merit of this evidence did not have to be considered by the trial Judge as he felt bound by Regina v. Paris[22] , where a same contention as to the law was ruled out. The accused was convicted and his conviction was subsequently maintained by the Hon. Mr. Justice Wood of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, who had decided Regina v. Paris. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia[23] reached the view that knowledge of the age was of the essence of the offence, allowed the appeal and ordered the case to \"be remitted to Mr. Justice Wood for re-consideration upon the issue of mens rea.\" The Crown now brings the latter judgment for review.\nThe ancient maxim that in every criminal offence there must be a guilty mind cannot now, as illustrated by the cases of Rex v. Prince[24] and Rex v. Bishop[25] , apply generally to all statutes. It is necessary to look at the object and the provisions of each Act to see whether and how far knowledge is of the essence of the offence created. There can be no doubt as to the object of the Juvenile Delinquents' Act. Manifested throughout its provisions, and particularly in those of sub-section 2 of section 3, section 38 and section 33, the object is to care, aid, encourage, help and assist misdirected or misguided juveniles and, under section 33, protect them from becoming or being the victims of social or moral degradation in punishing these actions or omissions, of even their own parents or guardians, which, of their nature, are \"likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent\". With respect to the interpretation of the Act, reference must be made to section 38 thereof reading:\u2014\n38. This Act shall be liberally construed to the end that its purpose may be carried out, namely, that the care and custody and discipline of a juvenile delinquent shall approximate as nearly as may be that which should be given by its parents, and that as far as practicable every juvenile delinquent shall be treated, not as criminal, but as a misdirected and misguided child, and one needing aid, encouragement, help and assistance.\nIn addition to this specific provision, one must also refer to section 15 of the Interpretation Act R.S.C. (1952) c. 158, providing that:\u2014\n15. Every Act and every provision and enactment thereof, shall be deemed remedial, whether its immediate purport is to direct the doing of any thing that Parliament deems to be for the public good, or to prevent or punish the doing of any thing that it deems contrary to the public good; and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nUnder section 33(1) (b), the constituent elements of the offence mentioned are (i) the doing of an act; (ii) which, of its nature, does or is likely to produce, promote or contribute to the delinquency; (iii) of a child. What amounts to delinquency is defined in section 2(1) (h) and, under section 3(1), delinquency does constitute an offence. It is contended that either of the words \"knowingly or wilfully\", appearing in the opening phrase of section 33(1) (b), are related to all the constituent elements therein mentioned. Undoubtedly, they are related to the first; but the question is whether they are related to all. In my respectful view, it cannot have been the intention of Parliament to leave it to the arbitrary judgment of those very persons mentioned in the opening phrase of section 33\u2014against the action or omission of whom it was intended to protect juveniles from becoming delinquents\u2014to successfully oppose their views to those of the Court or Judge entrusted with the operation of the Act, on the point whether, of its nature, a particular act is one \"producing, promoting or contributing to a child's being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent.\" Any person, whether a parent or a guardian, giving to a child a book containing the crudest obscenities, would admittedly do an act forbidden under the section; however, should the evidence of the Crown fail to show that he had knowledge of the contents of the book, the prosecution would fail. But if knowledge is shown, his own views as to whether such book might or might not produce, promote or contribute to a child's delinquency or be likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent, would afford no defence, since the act done is precisely the one against which Parliament intended to protect juveniles. If this is so, it cannot be said therefore that the words \"knowingly or wilfully\" are related to all the constituent elements of the offence. I cannot think either that the same words are related to the age of the juveniles. Again, a child, under the definition enacted for all the purposes of the Act, means any boy or girl \"apparently or actually\" under the age mentioned. Comprehensively, the word \"actually\" does not include the concepts of uncertainty or of mistake, but the word \"apparently\" does not exclude them. The belief which a person, contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile the age of whom could not \"actually\" be determined, might then form from appearance only cannot, at his trial, prevail over the opinion which the Judge must, of necessity, form himself to assert his jurisdiction over the matter, which he only has if a child is involved. Under the Act, a juvenile cannot be, at the same time, a child for purposes of jurisdiction and not a child for other purposes; the definition of a child applies to every provision of the Act where the word is found. Evidence may show that, from appearance, the accused could have mistakenly, but reasonably, formed and did, in fact, form an honest belief that the juvenile was not a child. While such evidence could support a defence based on a mistake of fact in cases where the actual age must definitely be established, it does not follow that such a defence obtains in cases, as in the present, where appearance, involving the possibility of mistake, is sufficient. A person contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile assumes the risk that the opinion he forms from appearance as to the age be not the one taken by the trial Judge. Under the Act, knowledge of the actual age is not of the essence of the offence; appearance is sufficient, failing the best evidence as to the age. In my respectful view, Parliament did not intend that the operation of the section be dependent upon the views an accused might form from appearance. What Parliament clearly intended is the protection of children. In none of the cases to which we were referred by respondent, the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated included such a definition of \"child\" as under the Act here considered. I would maintain the appeal and restore the conviction.\nAppeal dismissed; conviction quashed; acquittal directed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H. A. Maclean.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. A. D.

The latter obtained judgment against the driver C. but was unable to collect it.\nThe respondent then brought this action for indemnity against the appellant as insurer. The action was maintained and the appeal by the insurer dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant contended that a judgment against the owner was a condition precedent to any action against the insurer and that the driver C. was not \u201cthe insured\u201d under s. 214 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183; and furthermore, that the action was barred by statutory condition 9(3) since it had not been started within one year after the cause of action arose.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer curiam: A judgment in favour of the respondent against the owner to whom the policy was issued was not a condition precedent to the bringing of this action by the respondent against the appellant.\nC., the driver of the automobile at the time of the accident, was an \u201cinsured\u201d under s. 214 of the Insurance Act.\nPer Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand and Locke JJ.: Statutory condition 9(3) did not apply to the claim of the respondent which was a substantive right given by statute and did not arise under the contract of insurance.\nPer Locke J.: Statutory condition 9(3) applied only to actions brought to enforce the insurance contract by the persons insured by it, whether named or not, and by persons claiming under them by assignment.\nBourgeois v. Prudential Assurance Co. (1945), 18 M.P.R. 334 not followed.\nPer Cartwright J. (dissenting): Statutory condition 9(3) barred the action of the respondent. The right of action conferred on the injured party in s. 214(1) of the Insurance Act is a right of action under the contract. Assuming that the condition applies only in the case of actions or proceedings under the contract, the respondent\u2019s action was under the contract of insurance issued by the appellant to the owner of the automobile.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (1), affirming the judgment at trial.\nF.J. Greenwood for the appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014We are all of opinion that for the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario[1] a judgment by the respondent against William J. Schnurr, who had applied to the appellant for an insurance policy and to whom the policy was issued by it, was not a condition precedent to the bringing of this action by the respondent against the appellant; and that Corbett, the driver of the automobile at the time of the accident, was an \u201cinsured\u201d under s. 214 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183. There is more difficulty in the remaining ground of appeal that the respondent\u2019s action was barred by statutory condition 9(3) since it was not brought until after the expiration of one year after her cause of action arose. Bearing in mind the history of The Insurance Act, I am of opinion that condition 9(3) does not apply to the claim of the respondent. That claim is a substantive right given by statute and does not arise under the contract. It was suggested that if this be so there is either no period of limitation applicable, or one of twenty years. Even if that be so, I can see no reason to bar the respondent\u2019s claim, unless the legislature has seen fit to do so.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014The first ground of appeal is that a judgment against the owner of the car, the person in whose name the policy was issued, was a condition precedent to the right of the respondent to bring action against the company under the provisions of s. 214 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183. For the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Ontario, I agree that this ground is not tenable. Mr. Greenwood emphasizes the use of the words \u201cthe insured\u201d in the section as meaning the person named in the policy; but the opening line speaks of a person having a claim against \u201can insured\u201d, and he concedes that a person in the position of the respondent driving the car with the permission of the owner would properly be referred to as \u201can insured\u201d. The subsequent references in the section to \u201cthe insured\u201d are obviously to the \u201cinsured\u201d first mentioned.\nThen it is said that the limitation condition 9(3) applies to the respondent. It reads:\u2014\nEvery action or proceeding against an insurer under a contract in respect of loss or damage to the automobile shall be commenced within one year next after the happening of the loss and not afterwards, and in respect of loss or damage to persons or property shall be commenced within one year next after the cause of action arose, and not afterwards.\nI think an analysis of s. 214 furnishes the answer to this contention. Subsections (1), (4) and (6) are as follows:\u2014\n(1) Any person having a claim against an insured, for which indemnity is provided by a motor vehicle liability policy, shall, notwithstanding that such person is not a party to the contract, be entitled, upon recovering a judgment therefor against the insured, to have the insurance money payable under the policy applied in or towards satisfaction of his judgment and of any other judgments or claims against the insured covered by the indemnity and may, on behalf of himself and all persons having such judgments or claims, maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money so applied.\n(4) It shall not be a defence to an action under this section that an instrument issued as a motor vehicle liability policy by a person engaged in the business of an insurer, and alleged by a party to the action to be such a policy, is not a motor vehicle liability policy, and this section shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the instrument.\n(6) Subject to subsection 7, where a policy provides, or if more than one policy, the policies provide for coverage in excess of the limits mentioned in section 211 or for extended coverage in pursuance of subsections 1, 2 and 4 of section 212, nothing in this section shall, with respect to such excess coverage or extended coverage, prevent any insurer from availing itself, as against a claimant, of any defence that the insurer is entitled to set up against the insured.\nSection 211 referred to in the last subsection reads:\u2014\nEvery owner\u2019s policy and driver\u2019s policy shall insure, in case of bodily injury or death, to the limit of at least $5,000 (exclusive of interest and costs) against loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or the death of any one person, and, subject to such limit, for any one person so injured or killed, of at least $10,000 (exclusive of interest and costs) against loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, or, in case of property damage, to the limit of at least $1,000 (exclusive of interest and costs) for damage to property resulting from any one accident.\nIs the action in this case brought \u201cunder the contract\u201d as the language of the condition puts it? \u201cUnder\u201d means \u201carising out of\u201d, and the phrase, that the contract furnishes the substantive title to the action. On the face of the section, that is not the case here: the statute not only gives a right to sue but it creates its substantive basis, a right against the contractual liability as an asset available, in effect, for execution purposes. Subsection (4) speaks of \u201can action under this section\u201d. The right given is a charge upon the insurance money. But the statutory provisions contemplate insurance with a limit of liability in respect of injury to one person and a limit of total liability arising out of one accident. The judgment against the insurer is that the money be applied for the benefit \u201cof all persons having such judgments or claims\u201d. The total claims in one accident, apart from successive accidents, may easily exceed the total amount of the insurance or the limits furnished by s. 211 and this fact excludes, except conceivably where there is only one claimant, an ordinary money judgment. That total and its distribution cannot be ascertained until all claims have been determined. I do not attempt to define the status of \u201cclaims\u201d there intended, the creditors holding which are to be represented in such an action; but by express words judgment for the application of the money applies to all judgments against the insured regardless of when they were recovered.\nThe liability toward the insured arising out of one accident is single and is fixed only when all the claims have been adjudicated or reduced to a liquidated sum: condition 9(2) requires either a judgment against an insured or an agreement with the written consent of the insurer as to the amount before action can be brought by the insured on the contract. In Barrett v. Indemnity Insurance Company of North America[2], it was held by the Court of Appeal that only one representative action can be brought, that is, that no action lies by one of several such creditors on his own behalf only. In many cases the proration of the total or limited insurance among the claimants might be suspended for several years pending final adjudications. In the meantime small claims might not have been appealed with the amount to be apportioned to them meanwhile undeterminable. The practical effect of Mr. Greenwood\u2019s argument would be that the representative action must be commenced by the person recovering the first judgment against the insured if security to all is to be achieved. These possibilities, in addition to the creation of the cause of action by the section, going to the several rights of the claimants, the time for bringing the representative action, and the amount to which each may ultimately become entitled in a distribution are incompatible with the conception that applies to each creditor the limitation of condition 9(3).\nWe have been referred to the case of Bourgeois v. Prudential Assurance Company Limited[3], in which Harrison J., speaking for a majority of the court, held a similar condition of limitation to apply; but in my opinion, the view expressed by Baxter C.J., dissenting, is the sounder.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs. LOCKE J.:\u2014For the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal[4], it is my opinion that Corbett was an insured within the meaning of s. 214(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183.\nIt is said for the appellant that the claim is barred by statutory condition 9(3) which provides that every action or proceeding against an insurer under a contract in respect of damage to persons or property shall be commenced within one year next after the cause of action arose. This contention was rejected in the Court of Appeal upon the short ground that the respondent\u2019s action is not of the nature referred to in the condition, but one to enforce a statutory cause of action arising under and vested in the respondent by s. 214(1).\nIn Bourgeois v. Prudential Assurance Company[5], this question was considered by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. In that case, where the section of the Insurance Act and the statutory condition were in the same terms as those in question here, Harrison J. (with whom Grimmer J. agreed) was of the opinion that the right given by the Insurance Act was \u201cto sue upon an insurance contract\u201d and that, therefore, the limitation under statutory condition 9(3) applied. It should be said that the learned judge had before dealing with this aspect of the case expressed the view, with which the other members of the court agreed, that as the policy itself had been induced by misrepresentation it was void. Baxter C.J. agreed with Harrison J. upon this issue, while expressing his dissent from the opinion that the action was barred by statute.\nUpon this aspect of the matter, I respectfully agree with the opinion of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario. I do not consider that the cause of action vested in the respondent was a right to sue upon the insurance contract issued by the appellant to Schnurr.\nIn my opinion, some assistance in interpreting the language of statutory condition 9(3) is to be obtained by considering its history and that of s. 214(1) of the Insurance Act. Statutory conditions, deemed to be part of every contract of automobile insurance in force in Ontario, were first made part of the Insurance Act of that province by the Ontario Insurance Amendment Act, 1922, c. 61, s. 14. The condition which, in so far as we are concerned with the matter, corresponded with the present condition 9(3) was condition 8(3) and read:\u2014\nNo action to recover the amount of a claim under this policy shall lie against the insurer unless the foregoing requirements are complied with and such action is brought after the amount of the loss has been ascertained either by a judgment against the insured after trial of the issue or by agreement between the parties with the written consent of the insurer and no such action shall lie in either event unless brought within one year thereafter.\nIt was in this form that the condition appeared as part of s. 175 in the revision of the statutes of 1927.\nThere was nothing in the Insurance Act of Ontario, enabling a person injured through the negligent operation of an automobile to bring an action against an insurance company insuring the owner or the driver against such liability, until the year 1932. The limitation prescribed by statutory condition 8(3), therefore, obviously applied only to actions brought upon the policy by the named insured.\nIn 1932, extensive amendments were made to the Insurance Acts of Ontario, British Columbia and some other provinces of Canada, which, in addition to recasting the statutory conditions made part of every automobile insurance policy, gave to a person insured by such a policy, though not named therein, direct resort to the insuring company to recover indemnity in respect of an accident and gave to persons injured by the negligence of an insured person the right to proceed, after recovering a judgment against the insured which could not be realized upon, directly against the company insuring the risk. This is now incorporated in s. 214(1) of the Insurance Act of Ontario.\nIn the 1932 amendment of the Ontario Act (c. 25), statutory condition 8(3) was recast and appeared as statutory condition 9(3) in the following terms:\u2014\nEvery action or proceeding against an insurer under a contract in respect of loss or damage to the automobile shall be commenced within one year next after the happening of the loss and not afterwards, and in respect of loss or damage to persons or property shall be commenced within one year next after the cause of action arose, and not afterwards. It is to be noted that the right of action of the person having the claim against an insured which was given by s. 183h(1) of the amendment to the Act of 1932 and which is reproduced in s. 214(1) is\nto have the insurance money payable under the policy applied in or towards satisfaction of his judgment and of any other judgments or claims against the insured covered by the indemnity.\nThis is to be compared with the right of action given to a person, insured by, but not named in the policy, in the 1932 amendment by s. 183a(2), reproduced as s. 207(3) in the present Act, which in terms says that such person\nfor that purpose shall be deemed to be a a party to the contract and to have given consideration therefor.\nWhile the decision of the Judicial Committee in Vandepitte v. Preferred Accident Insurance Company[6] does not affect the question of limitation, the history of that action may be of some assistance in construing the section under consideration. In British Columbia, where statutory conditions in the same terms as those adopted in Ontario in 1922 had been made part of every such insurance contract in the same year by the Automobile Insurance Policy Act (c. 35), when the Insurance Act of that province was repealed and re-enacted by c. 20 of the statutes of 1925 it contained as s. 24 a provision that where a person incurs liability for injury or damage to the person or property of another and is insured against such liability and fails to satisfy a judgment awarding damages against him, the person entitled to the damages might recover by action against the insurer the amount of the judgment up to the face value of the policy but subject to the same equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied.\nIt was upon this section that the cause of action asserted in Vandepitte\u2019s Case was based. One Berry was insured against liability in respect of the operation of his automobile by a policy in the form then currently in use in British Columbia which, by its terms, agreed to extend the indemnity to any person driving the car with his permission. Berry\u2019s daughter was, by his leave, driving the car when Vandepitte was injured and, when the latter recovered judgment against her and was unable to realize upon it, the action was brought against the insuring company. Gregory J., who tried the case, held the plaintiff entitled to recover[7] and this decision was upheld in the Court of Appeal[8]. The defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court was allowed[9] and the appeal taken to the Judicial Committee was dismissed[10].\nThe action failed on the ground that Jean Berry, the daughter of the insured named in the policy, was not insured against the liability within the meaning of s. 24, she having no enforceable right against the insuring company, there being no privity of contract between them.\nIt is a matter of common knowledge among those familiar with insurance matters of this nature at the time that the 1932 legislation was adopted in British Columbia, and it may properly be inferred in Ontario, to remedy the defect in the position of third persons driving with the owner\u2019s permission as against the insuring company which had been exposed by the judgment of this Court delivered in October 1931 and to enable persons recovering judgments for damages for negligence against insured persons, named or unnamed, to resort to the insurance moneys to the extent provided. It had been said in this Court, and it was later said in the Judicial Committee, that no person other than the named insured had any right to compel the insuring company to indemnify him, and the 1932 amendment made in the same year, both in British Columbia and Ontario, remedied this situation by the amendment which is now s-s. 3 of s. 207 of the Ontario Act. Having thus provided that the unnamed insured should be deemed to be a party to the contract for the purpose of enforcing its terms, the legislature gave to the person having the claim against the insured, whether named or not, the right not to enforce the contract as if such person were a party to it but to have the insurance money payable under it applied towards satisfaction of his judgment. In addition, the legislation, both in British Columbia and Ontario, provided that no act or default of the insured, before or after the event, in violation of the provisions of the terms of the contract or the provisions of the part of the Act containing these amendments, should prejudice the rights of the person having the claim against the insured. This, it may be noted, differed from the concluding portion of s. 24 of the British Columbia Act of 1925 which made the rights of such a person subject to the same equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied.\nThe language of the amending section, 183h(1), of the 1932 amendment defining the nature of the right given to a person obtaining a judgment against either the named or the unnamed insured was essentially different from that given to an unnamed insured: as to the latter, he might sue upon the contract as a party to it; as to the former, the right given was to resort to the money which would be payable to the insured under the policy in satisfaction of the judgment.\nIn my opinion, the change in the wording of the former statutory condition 8(3) made by the amendment of 1932 did not affect the matter. The former condition applied to an action \u201cto recover the amount of a claim under this policy\u201d: the new condition was made to apply to \u201cevery action or proceeding against an insurer under a contract\u201d of the same nature. The former condition, as I have pointed out, applied only to actions by the named insured against the insurer. In my opinion, statutory condition 9(3) applies only to actions brought to enforce the insurance contract by the persons insured by it, whether named or not, and by persons claiming under them by assignment. Had it been intended to extend its application to new causes of action such as that given by s. 183h(1), I think the legislation would have said so in terms.\nIn the Prudential Assurance Company case above referred to, Baxter C.J. dissented from the judgment of the majority of the court, his opinion being that the limitation section did not apply, for substantially the same reasons as those which have commended themselves to the Court of Appeal in the present matter. I respectfully agree with these learned judges and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal, brought by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from a judgment of that Court dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Danis J. in favour of the respondent for $1,561.71, with interest and costs. On April 4, 1949, the respondent, a pedestrian on a highway was struck and injured by an automobile owned by William J. Schnurr and driven by Louis Corbett with Schnurr\u2019s consent. The respondent brought action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against Corbett who defended the action. On November 15, 1951, Wells J. awarded the respondent $1,087.25 damages and costs which were taxed on February 21, 1952, at $474.46, making up the total of $1,561.71 mentioned above. The respondent issued execution but was unable to collect anything on account of her judgment.\nThe appellant had insured Schnurr under an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d, as defined in s. 192(g) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950 c. 183, in respect of the automobile and such policy was in force at the time the respondent was injured.\nThe policy provided in part:\u2014\nThe Insurer agrees to indemnify the Insured, his executors or administrators, and, in the same manner and to the same extent as if named herein as the Insured, every other person who with the Insured\u2019s consent uses the automobile, against the liability imposed by law upon the Insured or upon any such other person for loss or damage arising from the ownership, use or operation of the automobile within Canada\u2026and resulting from\u2026bodily injury to\u2026any person.\nThe limit of the insurer\u2019s liability was stated in the policy to be $200,000.\nOn March 3, 1953, the respondent commenced this action against the appellant pursuant to s. 214 of the Insurance Act.\nThe appeal is based on the following two grounds:\u2014\n(i) that a judgment in favour of the respondent against Schnurr, the insured named in the policy, was a condition precedent to any action by the respondent against the appellant; and that Corbett was not \u201cthe insured\u201d under s. 214 of the Insurance Act.\n(ii) that the respondent\u2019s action was in any event, barred by Statutory Condition 9(3) as such action was not begun against the appellant until 3rd March, 1953, which was more than one year after the respondent\u2019s cause of action, if any, arose.\nFor the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario I agree with his conclusion that the first of these grounds should be rejected. In rejecting the second ground, Danis J. followed the decision of LeBel J. in Harrison v. The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation Ltd.[11] (reversed on other grounds[12]). In the reasons of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar the matter was dealt with as follows[13]:\u2014\nThe second ground of appeal is that statutory condition 9(3) bars the respondent\u2019s claim in this action because the action by the respondent against the insurer was not brought within one year after the cause of action arose. I agree with counsel for the appellant that the cause of action arose, so far as the insurance of the driver was concerned, when the liability of the driver was established and that the action was not brought within one year thereafter, but, in my opinion, statutory condition 9(3) applies only to an action brought by a person insured against the insurer, being a cause of action under the policy of insurance. It does not apply to a cause of action arising under s. 214 (1), which cause of action is statutory and is not a cause of action arising under the contract.\nSection 197 of the Insurance Act provides that, subject to certain exceptions none of which is applicable in the case at bar,\n(a) the conditions set forth in this section shall be statutory conditions and deemed to be part of every contract of automobile insurance and shall be printed on every policy with the heading \u201cStatutory Conditions\u201d;\n(b) no variation or omission of a statutory condition shall be valid nor shall anything contained in any addition to a statutory condition or in the description of the subject matter of the insurance be effective in so far as it is inconsistent with, varies or avoids any such condition.\nThe statutory conditions were printed in the policy issued to Schnurr. Condition 9(3) is as follows:\u2014\n(3) Every action or proceeding against an insurer under a contract in respect of loss or damage to the automobile shall be commenced within one year next after the happening of the loss and not afterwards, and in respect of loss or damage to persons or property shall be commenced within one year next after the cause of action arose, and not afterwards.\nThe provisions of s. 214 of the Insurance Act, so far as relevant to the question under consideration, are as follows:\u2014\n214 (1) Any person having a claim against an insured, for which indemnity is provided by a motor vehicle liability policy, shall notwithstanding that such person is not a party to the contract, be entitled, upon recovering a judgment therefor against the insured, to have the insurance money payable under the policy applied in or towards satisfaction of his judgment and of any other judgments or claims against the insured covered by the indemnity and may, on behalf of himself and all persons having such judgments or claims, maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money so applied.\n(2) No creditor of the insured shall be entitled to share in the insurance money payable under any such policy in respect of any claim for which indemnity is not provided by the policy.\n(3) (i) No assignment, waiver, surrender, cancellation or discharge of the policy, or of any interest therein or of the proceeds thereof, made by the insured after the happening of the event giving rise to a claim under the policy, and\n(ii) no act or default of the insured before or after such event in violation of the provisions of this Part or of the terms of the contract, and\n(iii) no violation of the Criminal Code (Canada) or of any law or statute of any province, state or country, by the owner or driver of the automobile,\nshall prejudice the right of any person, entitled under subsection 1, to have the insurance money applied upon his judgment or claim, or be available to the insurer as a defence to such action.\n* * *\n(6) \u2026where a policy provides\u2026for coverage in excess of the limits mentioned in section 211\u2026nothing in this section shall, with respect to such excess coverage\u2026prevent any insurer from availing itself, as against a claimant, of any defence that the insurer is entitled to set up against the insured.\nSection 211, referred to in s. 214(6), reads as follows:\u2014\nEvery owner\u2019s policy and driver\u2019s policy shall insure, in case of bodily injury or death, to the limit of at least $5,000 (exclusive of interest and costs) against loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or the death of any one person, and, subject to such limit, for any one person so injured or killed, of at least $10,000 (exclusive of interest and costs) against loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, or, in case of property damage, to the limit of at least $1,000 (exclusive of interest and costs) for damage to property resulting from any one accident.\nCounsel were able to refer us to only two reported cases in which the question under consideration has come up for decision. These are the judgment of LeBel J. in Harrison v. Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation Ltd., supra, and that of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in Bourgeois et al. v. Prudential Assurance Company Limited[14].\nIn the Harrison case, LeBel J. in dealing with statutory condition 9(3) says at pages 906 and 907:\u2014\nThe limitation of action therein imposed is confined to an action brought against an insurer \u201cunder a contract in respect of loss or damage to the automobile\u2026and in respect of loss or damage to persons or property\u2026\u201d, that is to say, the limitation is with respect to an action brought against an insurer in the assertion of some contractual right. In my view, statutory condition 9(3) is of no application in a case of this kind, where the plaintiff sues in the assertion of a substantive right created by s. 205(1) [now 214(1)] of The Insurance Act: see The Continental Casualty Company v. Yorke, [1930] S.C.R. 180 at 184, [1930] 1 D.L.R. 609, and Dokuchia v.St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company (2), at p. 423.\nI am unable to find support for the view expressed in this passage in the judgment of this Court in Continental Casualty Company v. Yorke[15]. In that case the right asserted by the respondent arose under s. 85(1) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 222, reading as follows:\u2014\n85 (1) In any case in which a person insured against liability for injury or damage to persons or property of others has failed to satisfy a judgment obtained by a claimant for such injury or damage and an execution against the insured in respect thereof is returned unsatisfied, such execution creditor shall have a right of action against the insurer to recover an amount not exceeding the face amount of the policy or the amount of the judgment in the same manner and subject to the same equities as the insured would have if the said judgment had been satisfied.\nAt pages 184 and 185 Lamont J., delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court, said:\u2014\nSection 85 gives the respondent a right of action against the appellant in the same manner and subject to the same equities as the insured would have if she herself had satisfied the judgment. What is the \u201cright of action\u201d here given? In my opinion it is simply a right to sue. The statute gives the respondent a right to sue the appellant on its policy in the place and stead of the insured, which right she would not have had but for the statute. The right to sue may be exercised by the respondent in the same manner as if the insured had paid the judgment and brought the action. This, I take it, refers to procedure. It is also to be exercised subject to equities which would prevail between the appellant and the insured. This, in my opinion, means that the respondent must establish liability on the policy against the appellant to the same extent as if the action had been brought by the insured, and that whatever defences the appellant would have been entitled to raise against the insured it may raise against the respondent.\nIn Dokuchia v.St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company[16], Roach J.A., commenting on the judgment in Continental Casualty v. Yorke, said at page 423:\u2014\nIn my opinion, the effect of the present section is to give a claimant, who has recovered a judgment for damages, more than a mere \u201cright to sue\u201d. That is to say, the present statute does more than merely authorize procedure. It creates a substantive right in such judgment creditor enforceable by action against the insurer, all, of course, depending upon the claim, which becomes merged in the judgment, being one for which indemnity is provided by the policy. I do not find anything in this passage which is necessarily inconsistent with the view that, under the legislation in its present form, what is given to the injured person is \u201ca right to sue the appellant on its policy\u201d.\nIn Trans-Canada Insurance Company v. Winter[17], the insurer pleaded statutory condition 9(3) but in that case the action by the injured party against the insurance company had been commenced within less than one year from the date on which he had obtained judgment against the insured so that the statutory condition did not afford a defence. In his reasons Hughes J., who gave the judgment of the majority of the Court, seems to have assumed the applicability of condition 9(3) and discusses only the question as to when the cause of action arose; but this is not determinative of the matter as the question whether the condition applied to such an action was not raised in the factums and does not appear to have been argued.\nIn the Bourgeois case the trial judge, Richards J., and the majority of the Appeal Division, Harrison and Grimmer JJ., held, in circumstances indistinguishable from those in the case at bar, that statutory condition 9(3) in the Insurance Act of New Brunswick barred the right of action of the plaintiff. That condition and the relevant sections of the New Brunswick Act are identically worded with those of the Ontario Act which I have quoted above. Baxter C.J., while he agreed on another ground with the disposition of the appeal made by the majority, took an opposite view as to the applicability of the limitation. I find the reasons of Harrison J. on this point convincing and I agree with his conclusion. It should be mentioned that the judgment in the Bourgeois case was not referred to by LeBel J. in his reasons in the Harrison case, nor is it referred to in those of the courts below in the case at bar.\nIt is a possible view that the words in condition 9(3), \u201cunder a contract\u201d qualify the word \u201cinsurer\u201d rather than the words \u201caction or proceeding\u201d; but, assuming that the condition applies only in the case of actions or proceedings under a contract, it is my opinion that the respondent\u2019s action is under the contract of insurance issued by the appellant to Schnurr. Section 214(1) gives the respondent the right to maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money applied in satisfaction of his judgment. As is pointed out by Harrison J., unless the right so given is a right to sue under the contract the words in the subsection \u201cnotwithstanding that such person is not a party to the contract\u201d would appear to be unnecessary. Subsections (3) and (6) of s. 214 read together appear to me to make it clear that the right of action is on the contract. In so far as the injured person\u2019s claim against the insured does not exceed $5,000 most of the defences available to the insurer under the terms of the contract as against the insured are taken away as against the injured person; but, wide though the words of s-s. (3) are, they do not touch the provisions of statutory condition 9(3). It is only on the basis that the action of the injured party is under the contract that it can be necessary to provide that contractual defences set out in the policy are not to avail against him. Turning to s-s. (6) it is found that where the injured party\u2019s claim exceeds $5,000 nothing in the section shall with respect to such excess coverage prevent the insurer from availing itself of any defence that the insurer is entitled to set up against the insured. The form of wording used is significant. The Legislature does not say that the insurer shall be given the right to set up such contractual defences; it assumes the continuing existence of such right except in so far as, elsewhere in the section, it is expressly taken away. This appears to me to be consistent only with the view that the right of action conferred on the injured party in s. 214(1) is a right of action under the contract.\nWere the proper construction doubtful, I would have thought that the doubt should be resolved against the view that, while throughout the Insurance Act the Legislature has consistently prescribed periods of limitation as to actions brought against insurers which are much shorter than that applicable to actions on simple contracts, it should in this isolated case permit an action to be brought against an insurer within twenty years after the cause of action arose. For the reasons given by Harrison J. in the Bourgeois case, and for those set out above, I am of opinion that effect must be given to the second ground of appeal. I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout, if demanded.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Erichsen-Brown & Leal.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Dufresne & Dufresne.\n[1] [1955] O.R. 373.\n[2] [1935] O.W.N. 321.\n[3] (1945), 18 M.P.R. 334.\n[4] [1955] O.R. 373.\n[5] (1945), 18 M.P.R. 334.\n[6] [1933] A.C. 70.\n[7] (1929), 42 B.C.R. 255.\n[8] (1930), 43 B.C.R. 161.\n[9] [1932] S.C.R. 22.\n[10] [1933] A.C. 70.\n[11] [1947] O.R. 889 at 906.\n[12] [1948] O.R. 499.\n[13] [1955] O.R. at 379.\n[14] (1945), 18 M.P.R. 334.\n[15] [1930] S.C.R. 180.\n[16] [1947] O.R. 417.\n[17] [1935] S.C.R. 184.\n",

His service brakes worked properly. The traffic-light having changed, he proceeded and saw that the line of traffic ahead of him was at a standstill. The appellant\u2019s car was at the rear of this line of traffic. At about 150 feet away from the appellant\u2019s car, O. applied his service brakes and found that they did not work. When his car was 50 to 75 feet from that of the appellant, he applied his hand brakes. This reduced his speed from 12 m.p.h. to 6 m.p.h. but did not stop his car which struck the rear of the appellant\u2019s car. The trial judge accepted the defence of inevitable accident and dismissed the action. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal without written reasons.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe respondents have failed to prove two matters essential to the establishment of the defence of inevitable accident: (1) that the alleged failure of the service brakes could not have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care on their part and (2) that, assuming that such failure occurred without negligence on their part, O. could not, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the collision which he claimed was the effect of such failure. On the first matter, the respondents have made no attempt to prove that the sudden failure could not have been prevented by reasonable care on their part and particularly by adequate inspection. They called no witness to explain why the service brakes which were working properly immediately before and immediately after the accident and passed satisfactorily the test prescribed by the regulations, failed momentarily at the time of the accident. Furthermore, they have made no attempt to show that the defect could not reasonably have been discovered.\nAs to the second matter, they have failed to show that O. could not have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care. If the hand brakes had been in the state of efficiency prescribed by the regulations, O. could have stopped his car before the collision occurred. At the least, the unexplained failure to comply with the regulations was evidence of a breach of the common law duty to take reasonable care to have the car fit for the road.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment at trial.\nO.F. Howe, Q.C. for the appellant.\nW.G. Gray for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing, without written reasons, an appeal from a judgment of Barlow J. whereby the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed with costs and the third party proceedings were also dismissed with costs. The learned trial judge assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $2,885.50.\nIt is apparent from the reasons of the learned trial judge that he accepted the evidence of the respondent Ouellette as to the facts leading up to the collision and the appeal was argued on that basis.\nThe facts as deposed to by Ouellette were as follows. On April 13, 1954, at about 8.50 a.m. Ouellette was driving a 1952 Dodge motor vehicle owned by his employer, the respondent X\u2011Ray and Radium Industries Limited, easterly on Wellington Street in the city of Ottawa. He stopped at the intersection of Bayview Avenue for a traffic-light and his service brakes worked properly. From the time that he had left his home up to this point he had applied his service brakes five times and on each occasion they had worked properly. The traffic-light having changed he proceeded across Bayview Avenue and saw that the line of traffic ahead of him was at a standstill. The appellant\u2019s car was at the rear of this line of traffic. When Ouellette was about 150 feet away from the appellant\u2019s car he took his foot off the accelerator and applied his service brakes, at this moment he was proceeding uphill at a speed of not more than twelve miles per hour; he found that the brakes did not work; the brake pedal went down to the floor of the car without his feeling any braking action; he allowed the pedal to rise and pressed it down again, still without getting any braking action. Thinking that the service brakes had become useless, he applied his hand brakes; at the moment of this application his car was between 50 and 75 feet from that of the appellant. The application of the hand brakes reduced the speed of his car but did not stop it and it was still moving at about 6 miles per hour when it struck the rear of the appellant\u2019s vehicle.\nPolice Constable Brennan, called as a witness by the defendants, had made an investigation a few minutes after the accident. His evidence as to the service brakes is as follows:\u2014\nHIS LORDSHIP: Now witness, tell us what did you do and where did you do it?\nA. I checked the brake pedal by pressing on it, and I found that the pedal went to the floorboards.\nQ. Where did you do this?\nA. At the scene.\nQ. Right on the road there?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did you do?\nA. I drove the car to the station, and I found on driving it in that the brakes worked. They would stop the car at any time. The brakes were tested on Fairmount Avenue by the Tapely Brake Tester.\nQ. Were you there?\nA. Yes. Three successive tests were taken. The first two tests, at 20 miles an hour, registered 14 feet to stop, or 95 per cent, and the third test\u2014I don\u2019t recall what the third test was.\nMR. GRAY: Q. Can you recall on approximately how many occasions you found it necessary to use the brakes as you were driving from the scene of the accident to the police station?\nA. Possibly about three times.\nQ. And the brakes worked on those occasions?\nA. They did. Brennan testified that he is experienced in testing brakes and that brakes are considered good if they will stop a car going at 20 miles per hour in forty feet. Following the test made by Brennan, Ouellette drove the car away from the Police Station.\nOuellette testified that on the day prior to the accident he had \u201cwork done on the brakes\u201d of the motor vehicle at the garage of the third party.\nIn the Statement of Claim, the appellant, after stating that the respondents\u2019 car had run into his car while stationary on the highway, alleged that Ouellette was negligent in the following respects amongst others:\u2014\n(a) He failed to keep a proper lookout;\n(b) He failed to bring his vehicle to a stop when he saw or should have seen that the traffic ahead of him, going in the same direction, had come to a complete stop;\n(c) His brakes were not in good repair;\n(d) He failed to apply his brakes in time, or at all, to avoid an accident which he knew, or should have known, was likely to occur;\nThe defence relied on at the trial and before us was pleaded in the Statement of Defence as follows:\u2014\n(4) The Defendants allege and the fact is that at the time and place referred to in the Statement of Claim the brakes of the Defendant motor vehicle suddenly and without warning failed and it was in the circumstances impossible for the Defendant driver to avoid the collision.\n(5) The Defendants allege and the fact is that they had taken all reasonable and proper precaution in the care of the brakes on the said motor vehicle and plead that the said collision was an inevitable or an unavoidable accident.\nThere can be no doubt that, generally speaking, when a car, in broad daylight, runs into the rear of another which is stationary on the highway and which has not come to a sudden stop, the fault is in the driving of the moving car, and the driver of such car must satisfy the Court that the collision did not occur as a result of his negligence. The learned trial judge regarded this principle as applicable to the case at bar but was of the view that the unexpected failure of the service brakes placed Ouellette in a situation of emergency in which he acted without negligence and that the collision was the result of an inevitable accident. The defence of inevitable accident has been discussed in many decisions. A leading case in Ontario is McIntosh v. Bell[1], which was approved by this Court in Claxton v. Grandy[2]. At page 187 of the report of McIntosh v. Bell, Hodgins J.A. adopts the words of Lord Esher M.R. in The Schwan [3], as follows:\u2014\n\u2026In my opinion, a person relying on inevitable accident must shew that something happened over which he had no control, and the effect of which could not have been avoided by the greatest care and skill.\nIn my view, in the case at bar the respondents have failed to prove two matters both of which were essential to the establishment of the defence of inevitable accident. These matters are (i) that the alleged failure of the service brakes could not have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care on their part, and (ii) that, assuming that such failure occurred without negligence on the part of the respondents, Ouellette could not, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the collision which he claims was the effect of such failure.\nAs to the first matter, assuming that the service brakes failed suddenly, the onus resting on the respondents was to show that such failure could not have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care. In Halsbury, 2nd Edition, Volume 23, page 640, section 901, the learned author says:\u2014\nDriving with defective apparatus if the defect might reasonably have been discovered. (and other matters). are negligent acts which render a defendant liable for injuries of which they are the effective cause.\nThis passage has been approved by McCardie J. in Phillips v. Brittania Hygienic Laundry Co.[4] and by Hogg J.A. in Grise v. Rankin et al.[5], and, in my opinion, correctly states the law.\nIn the case at bar the respondents have made no attempt to prove that the sudden failure could not have been prevented by reasonable care on their part and particularly by adequate inspection. They called no witness to explain the extraordinary fact that the service brakes which were working properly immediately before and immediately after the accident and passed satisfactorily the test prescribed in the regulations failed momentarily at the time of the accident. Without going so far as to say that such a story appears to be intrinsically impossible, it is clear that its nature was such as to cast upon the defendants the burden of furnishing a clear and satisfactory explanation of so unusual an occurrence.\nFurthermore, the respondents have made no attempt to shew that the defect, whatever it was, could not reasonably have been discovered. The evidence is that the respondents\u2019 car was a 1952 Dodge. There is no evidence: (a) as to when it was purchased, or (b) whether it was purchased new or second-hand, or (c) how far it had been driven, or (d) how often, if ever, the service brakes had been inspected, or (e) how often, if ever, the hand brakes had been inspected. The only evidence touching the point at all is Ouellette\u2019s statement quoted above that there \u201cwas work done on the brakes\u201d the day before the accident. There is nothing to indicate whether the brakes referred to in this statement were the service brakes or the hand brakes although in argument it seemed to be assumed that the reference was to the service brakes. No evidence was given as to what instructions were given to the third party, or as to what work was done by him, or as to what report, if any, was made by the third party when the car was delivered, or as to whether the third party was competent to inspect or repair brakes. The onus resting on the respondents in this regard is not discharged by the bald statement that on the day before the accident there was work (unspecified) done on the brakes.\nPassing to the second matter mentioned above, i.e., that even assuming that the failure of the service brakes occurred without negligence on the part of the respondents, they have failed to show that Ouellette could not have avoided the collision by the exercise of reasonable care, it may first be observed that the relevant statutory provisions in force in Ontario are as follows. The Highway Traffic Act R.S.O. 1950, C. 167 provides:\u2014\n12 (1) Every motor vehicle other than a motorcycle, when operated upon a highway shall be equipped with brakes adequate to stop and to hold such vehicle, having two separate means of application, each of which means shall apply a brake or brakes effective on at least two wheels and each of which shall suffice to stop the vehicle within a proper distance, and each means of application shall be so constructed that the cutting in two of any one element of the operating mechanism shall not leave the motor vehicle without brakes effective on at least two wheels.\n* * *\n(4) All such brakes shall be maintained in good working order and shall conform to regulations not inconsistent with this section to be made by the Department.\nThe regulations made pursuant to the Act provide in part as follows:\u2014\n1. In making a brake test a Bear Hydraulic Brake Tester, Cowdrey Dynamic Brake Tester, James Decelerometer, Muether Stopmeter, Tapley Brake Testing Meter, or such other instrument as may be approved by the Minister, shall be used.\n* * *\n4 (1) The service brakes of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle and trailer shall be adequate to stop the vehicle or vehicles within forty feet when travelling at the rate of twenty miles an hour on a dry asphalt or concrete pavement free from loose material and having not more than one per cent grade.\n(2) The hand brakes of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle and trailer shall be adequate to stop the vehicle or vehicles within sixty feet when travelling at the rate of twenty miles per hour, on a dry asphalt or concrete pavement free from loose material and having not more than a one per cent grade and to hold the vehicle or vehicles stationary at any place on any highway.\nAccepting the evidence of Ouellette as to the speed and position of his car at the instant he actually applied the hand brakes, it is obvious that if they had been in the state of efficiency prescribed by the regulations he could have stopped his car before the collision occurred, even if the car had not been, as it was, proceeding uphill. It is unnecessary to consider whether the effect of the statute and regulations was to cast an absolute duty on the respondents to have the hand brakes in the prescribed condition, for, at the least, the unexplained failure to comply with the regulation was evidence of a breach of the common law duty to take reasonable care to have the motor vehicle fit for the road. Apart from statute there must obviously be a common law duty on anyone who drives a motor vehicle on a highway to have it equipped with brakes, and the regulations may well be taken as the expression of the Legislature\u2019s view as to what constitutes a reasonable braking system. In my opinion, on the evidence the respondents have not only failed to show that the alleged failure of the service brakes was inevitable, they have also failed to show that after such failure occurred Ouellette could not by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the collision. It follows that the appeal of the plaintiff should be allowed.\nIt remains to consider what order should be made in the third party proceedings. Following the issue of the third party notice the local Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Ottawa made an order on the defendants\u2019 application for directions providing in part as follows:\u2014\nAND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that upon the Third Party issue being entered for Trial it shall be placed on the Trial list next following the action between the Plaintiff and the Defendants and shall be tried at or after the Trial of the action between the Plaintiff and the Defendants as the Trial Judge may direct.\nAt the trial the third party was represented by counsel who took part in the trial of the issues between the plaintiff and the defendants; but it was made clear by the learned trial judge that he would first dispose of the action between the plaintiff and the defendants and, in the event of the plaintiff succeeding, he would then proceed with the trial of the third party issue.\nThe learned trial judge having dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action at the conclusion of the hearing it followed that the third party proceedings should also be dismissed and he so directed. The plaintiff having appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the defendants served a notice of appeal as against the third party. The Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal at the conclusion of the argument and, accordingly, also dismissed the defendants\u2019 appeal in the third party proceedings.\nThe plaintiff having appealed to this Court, the defendants did not appeal in the third party proceedings. At the conclusion of the argument of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal in this Court on May 7, 1956, the defendants\u2019 counsel asked that the appeal be adjourned to give him an opportunity of appealing from the dismissal of the defendants\u2019 claim against the third party. The hearing of the appeal was adjourned, accordingly, and came on again for hearing on May 23 when the argument was concluded. In the meantime the defendants had obtained an extension of time for appealing in the third party proceedings and had perfected their appeal.\nAs has already been pointed out the issue between the defendants and the third party has not yet been tried and, in my opinion, it should be ordered that the judgment of the learned trial judge and that of the Court of Appeal so far as they deal with that issue be set aside and that the third party proceedings proceed to trial in accordance with the practice of the Court.\nIn the result the appeal of the plaintiff is allowed and judgment is directed to be entered in his favour against both defendants for $2,885.50 with costs throughout including any costs incurred by the plaintiff in the third party proceedings. The judgment of the learned trial judge and that of the Court of Appeal dealing with the third party proceedings are set aside and it is ordered that the issues raised in those proceedings be tried in accordance with the practice of the Court. The costs, as between the defendants and the third party, of the former trial and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal are to be disposed of by the judge presiding at the trial of the third party proceedings. There should be no order as to the costs of the appeal to this Court insofar as it relates to the third party proceedings.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Howe, Howe & Rowe.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Borden, Elliot, Kelley, Palmer & Sankey.\n[1] [1932] O.R. 179.\n[2] [1934] 4 D.L.R. 257 at 263.\n[3] [1892] P. 419 at 429.\n[4] [1923] 1 K.B. 539 at 551 and 552.\n[5] [1951] O.W.N. 21 at 22.\n",

The driver of the oncoming car did not dim his lights until about to pass the parked truck, or reduce his speed. The driver of the Crown car, although so \u201cblinded\u201d by the lights of the oncoming car as to be unable to see the parked truck until too late, continued on without reducing his speed. In the action taken by the owner of the oncoming car, the trial judge apportioned liability at 20, 30 and 50 per cent respectively against the driver of the Crown car, the driver of the oncoming car and the driver of the parked truck.\nHeld (Rand J. dissenting in part): The appeal of the driver of the parked truck should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ.: The driver of the Crown car was clearly negligent. He could and should have seen the taillights of the parked truck, which were plainly visible from a distance of 900 feet. When a driver sees a car in his path and has plenty of opportunity to avoid it but fails to do so, or if, by his own negligence, he disables himself from becoming aware of a danger and cannot therefore avoid the accident, he is the only party to blame. There was a clear line that could be drawn between the negligence of the appellant, if any, and that of the respondent, and therefore there could be no contributory negligence.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting in part): There was no excuse for the driver of the parked truck for not placing his truck to a substantial extent off the pavement, and against that failure should be charged part of the responsibility for the accident. Such a violation of the law is not to be superseded by the contemporaneous negligence of an oncoming driver in failing at night to see the parked car. Otherwise, the regulations would be virtually nullified and their purpose defeated. APPEAL from the judgment of Potter J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, on a petition of right to recover damages resulting from a motor vehicle accident.\nM. Robb, Q.C., for the appellant.\nW. R. Jackett, Q.C., and D. S. Maxwell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Potter of the Exchequer Court of Canada 2.\nOn the 13th day of October, 1952, the suppliant, owner of a Plymouth Sedan, was driving in a southerly direction upon a public highway, known as the Scoharie Road, in Prince Edward County, Ontario. On the opposite side of the highway, which was twenty-four feet wide, a truck belonging to the appellant (third party in the case) was stationed on the road, facing north, while the driver had gone on business for a few moments to a nearby school. The engine was still running. The highway was dry, and although it was dark, visibility was good.\nThe respondent\u2019s vehicle, which had excellent headlights showing two hundred feet away, was also proceeding in a northerly direction. The driver attempted to pass the appellant\u2019s truck, but in so doing, collided with the suppliant\u2019s car coming in the opposite direction.\nThe learned trial judge found that the loss suffered by the suppliant amounted to $860, but apportioned the damages between the three parties. He came to the conclusion that 30% should be borne by the suppliant; 50% by the third party, appellant in the present case, and 20% by the respondent. The formal judgment of the Exchequer Court was therefore, that the suppliant was entitled to recover from the respondent the sum of $602 being part of the relief sought by the petition of right together with costs, and that the third party should contribute to the respondent the sum of $430 and 50% of the costs taxed as between the suppliant and the respondent, which made an amount over and above the sum of $500 necessary to give jurisdiction to this Court: Caron v. Forgues et al. 3. The third party was ordered to pay to the respondent five-sevenths of the costs of the third party proceedings.\nThe third party now appeals to this Court, but there is no appeal between the suppliant and the respondent. The, third party contends that even if his car was stationed on the highway, this statutory breach of the law does not constitute effective negligence, and was not the causa causans of the accident.\nIt is in evidence that respondent\u2019s car was driven at a speed of 30 to 35 miles an hour, and that after having passed an elevation at a distance of 900 feet from the parked car, he saw the bright headlights of suppliant\u2019s car coming in the opposite direction. He immediately dimmed his lights, and raised them and dimmed them again, and the suppliant also dimmed his own. The respondent\u2019s driver says that after, he saw ahead of him for the first time, on his right hand side of the road, a motor vehicle, which was the parked truck. He had not noticed before the tail-lights of this truck which were lit, and in order to avoid hitting it, he swerved to the left, and collided with the oncoming car.\nI think that the driver of the respondent\u2019s car was clearly negligent, and cannot escape liability. He could and should have seen the tail-lights of the truck, which according to the evidence were plainly visible from a distance of 900 feet. If he had noticed these tail-lights before, he could have stopped or reduced his speed in order to avoid the accident. But having failed to see these lights, he maintained his speed at 30 to 35 miles, and was compelled to take the wrong side of the highway, where the accident happened.\nThe learned trial judge says that the driver of respondent\u2019s car did not have time to form a judgment, because the elevation was only at a distance of 300 feet from the place of the accident, and that at a speed of 30 to 35 miles an hour, he had only five or seven seconds to make a decision. The trial judge made an obvious error. The evidence is clear that the distance was 900 feet, and this was conceded by counsel at the hearing. It is very probable that if this error had not been committed, and if the learned trial judge had thought that respondent\u2019s driver could have seen the tail-lights at a distance of 900 feet, he would have reached an entirely different conclusion.\nI do not believe that the appellant can be charged with negligence which contributed to the accident. In a case of McKee et al. v. Malenfant 4, it was held by the majority of the Court that where a clear line can be drawn between the negligence of plaintiff and defendant, it is not a case of contributory negligence at all. When a driver sees a car in his path, and has plenty of opportunity to avoid it but fails to do so, there is no contributory negligence and he must bear the full responsibility. Or if, by his own negligence, he disables himself from becoming aware of a danger and cannot therefore avoid the accident, he is the only party to blame: Sigurdson v. B.C. Electric Co. 5. The same principles were applied by this Court in Bruce v. McIntyre 6. It is because the facts were unidentical that a different conclusion was reached.\nIn the present instance, the respondent had sufficient time to prevent this accident. Through his negligence he did not see the tail-lights of the parked car, which other witnesses could see; not having exercised a proper look-out, he continued at a speed of 30 to 35 miles an hour, and he placed himself in a situation where an accident was inevitable. There is, I think, a clear line that can be drawn between the negligence of the appellant, if any, and of the respondent, and there can be no contributory negligence.\nI would allow the appeal. As the suppliant did not appeal, he will still bear 30% of his damages, but, the appellant (third party), will not as directed by the judgment of the trial judge, be called upon to contribute to the respondent the sum of $430 plus 50% of the costs taxed, between the suppliant and the respondent. The respondent will pay the costs of the appellant throughout.\nRand J. (dissenting in part):\u2014Admittedly the judge at trial misapprehended an important fact of distance going to the determination of the degree of responsibility of the respondent and as between the latter and the appellant that matter is now open. The negligence of the truck driver, the servant of the respondent, cannot be seriously disputed, but the question remains of the liability for the car left parked wholly on the pavement.\nThe law of the province, s. 43(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167, forbids a person to\npark or leave standing any vehicle whether attended or unattended upon the travelled portion of a highway outside of a city, town or village, when it is practicable to park or leave such vehicle off the travelled portion of such highway.\u2026\nIn this case it was practicable to have placed the car, in large part at least, off the paved portion and if that had been done to the extent of three feet the accident would have been avoided. Is such a violation of the law to be superseded by a contemporaneous negligence of an oncoming driver in failing at night to see the parked car? I am unable to agree that that result follows. Such a ruling would virtually nullify the regulation whenever there was negligence on the moving vehicle. It would defeat the very purpose of these detailed regulations which have as their object to rid the highways of unnecessary hazards. Together they constitute an organic body of reciprocal safety measures and in the frightening multiplication of highway tragedies if their deliberate infringement does not call down accountability the regulation might almost as well be abolished.\nIt is not a question merely of causation in the rather simplified idea of that concept as it is so frequently expressed; causation must be associated with responsibility and the latter here issues from the mode of dealing with this evil adopted by the legislature: Bruce v. MacIntyre 7. There was no excuse whatever for not placing the car to a substantial extent off the pavement and against that failure should be charged part of the responsibility for the resulting consequences.\nBut I agree that the share in that of the respondent for the collision is greater than that of the appellant. As the petitioner has not appealed from the degree found against him of 30%, the remaining 70% is to be apportioned between the parties to this appeal. That I would make 50% against the respondent and 20% against the appellant. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment below modified by reducing the proportion against the appellant of 50% to 20% and increasing the liability of the respondent from 20% to 50%. The appellant will be entitled to five-sevenths of his costs in this Court and he will pay to the respondent two-sevenths of the costs of the suppliant payable by the respondent and two-sevenths of the third party costs, in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Slaght, Robb & Hayes.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

The tractor slid into a ditch, overturned and injured him. He knew there was a hole there and had been warned by his employer to be careful. The road was a dirt road, lightly travelled, with a little natural gravel, and had been gravelled a year and one-half prior to the accident.\nHis action for damages for injuries, alleging negligence of the municipality in failing to keep the road in repair, was dismissed by the trial judge who found that the respondent might have been driving too fast and too close to the edge of the road; that, the hole was not much of a hazard and that he was the author of his own misfortune. This judgment was reversed by a majority in the Appellate Division on the ground that the municipality should have known of the condition of the road and defaulted in the performance of the duty imposed upon it by s 189 of the Municipal Districts Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 151. Held: The appeal should be allowed.\nPer curiam: The Appellate Division was wrong in holding that the municipality defaulted in its statutory duty to repair the hole. That duty can only arise if it is justified on the evidence as to the character of the road and the locality in which it is situated, and if it should have known of the hole in the road. Under the circumstances here, the failure of the municipality to repair the hole did not constitute a breach of its statutory duty. Moreover, the facts do not support the finding of the Appellate Division that the municipality should have known of the disrepair of the road.\nPer Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.: The accident was caused by the negligence of the respondent in the operation of the tractor; he did not have it under proper control.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, reversing, O\u2019Connor C.J.A. dissenting, the judgment at trial which had dismissed the action.\nH. W. Riley, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ. J. Urie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nNolan J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the majority judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reversing the judgment of McLaurin C.J.T.D. of Alberta dismissing the action of the respondent to recover damages for personal injuries suffered in an accident.\nOn May 24, 1951, at approximately 1.30 p.m., the respondent was operating a farm tractor on a road running from east to west between Rockyford and Keoma within the appellant municipality. At a point on this road about five miles west and one mile south of the village of Rockyford the respondent, who was proceeding in a westerly direction, in order to avoid driving through a depression or hole about the centre of the road, swung to his left and ran into two feet of loose sand at the extreme south edge, or shoulder, of the road. The respondent endeavoured to get the tractor back on the. road, trying to put it into reverse, but it slid into a five-foot ditch on the south side of the road and overturned, pinning the respondent underneath and causing him to sustain serious injuries. The road at the point of the accident was twenty-four feet wide and had been given a light coat of gravel about a year and a half before the accident. The depression or hole where the accident occurred was, according to the estimate of the witness Deitrich, a municipal employee, approximately four feet wide, six feet long and eight inches deep. The witness Dyer, the employer of the respondent, estimated the depression or hole to be two to three feet across. The respondent estimated it to be two to two and one-half feet wide, three to three and one-half feet long and twelve inches deep.\nAt trial the respondent stated that the accident occurred at a hole in a culvert on the road, but his evidence on that point was contradicted by the witness Deitrich, who stated that the depression was seventy to ninety feet west of the culvert. The learned Chief Justice held that the accident occurred seventy-five feet west of the culvert.\nThe respondent was employed by a farmer in the vicinity to work on the land. He had previously passed the place on the road where the accident occurred approximately twenty times and had also passed it earlier on the day of the accident.\nThe respondent knew that there was a hole in the road and had been warned by his employer, Dyer, to be careful when driving past it and he admits that on previous occasions he had been able to pass safely on the south side of the road. He felt that there was room to get past if he drove with caution.\nOn the morning of May 24, 1951, prior to the accident, the road foreman, Geeraert, was driving a municipal employee, Deitrich, in a half-ton delivery truck to his equipment and, at twenty-five miles per hour, passed over the place where the accident occurred. The depression gave the Geeraert vehicle a sort of jolt, but he retained control of it without difficulty. Deitrich says a person going over the depression, which had sloping sides, would get a bump, but could pass over it without difficulty.\nThe depression itself was the result of a frost boil, which was brought about by the freezing of sub-surface water which caused a sinking of the road. Deitrich says that eight yards of dirt were dumped into the depression when he repaired it shortly after the accident. The learned Chief Justice of the Trial Division found that the respondent might have been driving too fast and might have got too close to the edge of the road because of the hole or depression. The learned Chief Justice also found that the hole or depression was not much of a hazard and that the respondent was the author of his own misfortune.\nThe Appellate Division, in a majority judgment, allowed an appeal from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice and directed that judgment for $6,800, including special damages, be entered for the respondent, on the ground that the appellant should have known of the condition of the road and defaulted in the performance of the duty imposed upon it by s. 189 of The Municipal Districts Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 151. That section provides as follows:\u2014\n189. (1) Every council shall keep all roads, bridges, culverts and ferries, and the approaches thereto, which have been constructed or provided by the municipal district or by any person with the permission of the council, or which, if constructed or provided by the Province, have been transferred to the control of the council by written notice thereof, in a reasonable state of repair, having regard to the character of the road or other thing hereinbefore mentioned, and the locality in which it is situated, or through which it passes, and in default of the council so to keep it in repair, the municipal district shall be liable for all damages sustained by any person by reason of its default.\n(2) Default under this section shall not be imputed to a municipal district in any action without proof by the plaintiff that the municipal district knew or should have known of the disrepair of the road or other thing hereinbefore mentioned.\nSubsection (2) is not found in a similar Act in any other province.\nThe liability of the appellant municipality depends, in the first place, upon whether the road in question was kept in a reasonable state of repair, regard being had to the character of the road and the locality through which it passed.\nThe road in question is between Keoma, consisting of two houses and two elevators, and Rockyford. It is a dirt road, lightly travelled, with a little natural gravel, and had been gravelled a year and one-half prior to the accident.\nThe liability of the appellant municipality depends, in the second place, upon whether it should have known of the depression in the road. I am of the opinion, with respect, that the Appellate Division was wrong in holding that the appellant municipality defaulted in its statutory duty to repair the depression in the road where the accident occurred. In my view that duty can only arise if it is justified on the evidence as to the character of the road and the locality in which it is situated.\nThere is evidence in the case that there are road bans every year in the appellant municipality because of the frost leaving the ground and that depressions in the roads are caused by frost boils.\nThere is also evidence that the road had been gravelled one and one-half years prior to the accident. It is situate between two small communities and the traffic upon it is light. There had been excessive moisture in the fall of 1950, heavy snow during the winter of 1950-51 and a heavy snowfall in April, 1951. In addition, at the time of the accident, a late wet spring had added to the difficulty of keeping the 1,100 or 1,200 miles of road in the municipality under repair.\nIn my opinion, taking all these facts into consideration, the failure of the appellant municipality to repair the depression did not constitute a breach of its statutory duty and the learned Chief Justice of the Trial Division was right in holding it to be free from negligence. Moreover, I think that these facts, accompanied by the difficulty of frequent inspection, do not support the finding of the Appellate Division that the municipality should have known of the disrepair of the road.\nThe Appellate Division was of the opinion that the dimensions of the depression were in excess of those given by any witness and in support of this view made mention of the fact that eight yards of dirt were hauled to make the necessary repairs. While it is true that the witness Deitrich says that this amount of material was dumped in the depression, which would suggest that it was larger than the evidence indicated, I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Alberta in his dissenting judgment that it is reasonable to assume that some portion of this fill was spread over the road in order to level off any unevenness caused by the fill in the depression. The respondent was proceeding in daylight along a road twenty-four feet wide in a tractor six feet four inches wide. He approached a depression in the road which was well known to him, having passed over it a number of times, the danger of which had been brought to his notice by his employer and which was not a trap. In attempting to go around the depression\u2014and there was plenty of room for him to do so\u2014he drove too close to the loose sand on the extreme south edge, or shoulder, of the road and, in trying to get the tractor back on the road, it slid into a five-foot ditch, overturned and injured the respondent. I do not think that the respondent had the tractor under proper control and if the instability of tractors is notorious, as is indicated in the judgment of the Appellate Division, I think a greater degree of care is required in their management. In my view the accident was caused by the negligence of the respondent in the operation of the tractor.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Nolan I agree with his conclusion that no breach of the statutory duty resting upon the appellant was established and consequently do not find it necessary to consider whether the conduct of the respondent amounted to negligence.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Nolan.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macleod, Riley, McDermid, Dixon & Burns.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fitch & Lindsay.\n",

Williams (Applicant);\nand\nWilfred Lange (Claimant) Respondent.\n1956: May 23; 1956: June 27.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J., Rand, Cartwright, Abbott and Nolan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nConditional sale\u2014Automobile\u2014Agreement of sale not registered\u2014Vendor\u2019s name affixed to cowl under engine hood\u2014Whether \u201cplainly attached\u201d within s. 12 of the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 358.\nS. 12 of The Conditional Sales Act (R.S.S. 1953, c. 358) is sufficiently complied with if, at the time of the conditional sale of an automobile, there is affixed to the automobile, on the cowl under the engine hood, a decal or sticker, oval in shape, about four inches long by one and one-half inches wide, bearing the words \u201cSold by Canadian Motors Limited, Ford and Monarch Dealers, Regina\u201d. The name of the vendor is thus \u201cplainly attached\u201d to the automobile within the meaning of the section.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1, dismissing, Gordon and McNiven JJ.A. dissenting, an appeal from a judgment affirming an order dismissing a claim made in interpleader proceedings. Appeal allowed.\nJ. L. McDougall, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ. C. Osborne, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an appeal by Traders Finance Corporation, Limited, against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 2 dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Graham J., which in turn had dismissed an appeal from the order of Judge Hogarth of the Judicial District of Regina. That order was made upon the application of the Sheriff of the District by way of interpleader. At the instance of the respondent Wilfred Lange, who had secured judgment against Gus Kruger, the Sheriff had seized a 1952 Ford Coach. This automobile had been sold to Kruger by Canadian Motors, Limited, under a conditional sale agreement, dated November 3, 1953, and on the same day the latter assigned the agreement to the present appellant. At the time of the seizure by the Sheriff a substantial sum remained unpaid.\nAt the argument reference was made to The Conditional Sales Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 291 and also R.S.S. 1953, c. 358 and I will refer to the latter. The right of the execution creditor to seize and sell the automobile was disputed by the appellant on the ground that although a copy of the conditional sale agreement had not been filed as specified in s. 4(1) of R.S.S. 1953, c. 358, the provisions of s. 12 of that Act had been complied with. That section reads as follows:\u2014\n12. Registration shall not be required in the case of a sale or bailment of manufactured goods, of the value of $15 or over, which, at the time of the actual delivery thereof to the buyer or bailee, have the manufacturer\u2019s or vendor\u2019s name painted, printed or stamped thereon or plainly attached thereto by a plate or similar device; provided that the manufacturer or vendor, being the seller or bailor of the goods, keeps an office in Saskatchewan where inquiry may be made and information procured concerning the sale or bailment of the goods; and provided further that the manufacturer or vendor or his agent does, within five days after receiving a request to do so made to him either in person or by registered letter, furnish to any applicant therefor a statement of the amounts, if any, paid thereon and the balance (remaining unpaid. The person so inquiring shall if such inquiry is by letter give a name and post office address to which a reply may be sent; and it shall be sufficient if the required information is given by registered letter deposited in the post office within the said five days addressed to the person inquiring at his proper post office address, or where a name and address is given, addressed to such person by the name and at the post office so given.\nIt is not disputed that Canadian Motors, Limited, kept an office in Regina where inquiry might be made and information procured concerning the sale or bailment by it of automobiles, and the only problem is whether the name of Canadian Motors, Limited, was painted, printed or stamped on the automobile or plainly attached thereto by a plate or similar device.\nAt the hearing the Court suggested that if there was any question as to the facts a statement could be agreed upon by counsel and filed. No such statement has been sent but having had an opportunity of considering the evidence we are all satisfied that there is really no difficulty. At the time of the sale by Canadian Motors, Limited, to Kruger there was affixed to the automobile, on the cowl under the engine hood, a decal or sticker, oval in shape, about four inches long by one and one-half inches wide, bearing the following words \u201cSold by Canadian Motors, Limited, Ford and Monarch Dealers, Regina\u201d. The decal would be in full view of anyone lifting the hood and, therefore, the name of the vendor was plainly attached to the automobile whether as against a subsequent purchaser or an execution creditor. Clearly it does not have to be affixed to the outside of the car and, on the other hand, this is not to say that it would be sufficient to put it in the trunk or glove compartment of the car.\nThe appeal should be allowed and, in view of the fact that the automobile has been sold and the proceeds deposited in Court, or with the Sheriff, there should be a declaration that the appellant is entitled thereto. Leave was given by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan to appeal to this Court on terms that the appellant would not ask for or be entitled to its costs of that appeal and the allowance is, therefore, without costs. At the argument it was agreed by counsel for the appellant that if the appeal succeeded any costs ordered to be paid in any of the Courts below by the appellant to the respondent would be paid and any costs already paid should be retained by the respondent.\nRand J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is the narrow one whether an automobile seized on behalf of the respondent Lange as execution creditor and claimed to be subject to a conditional sale agreement held by the appellant as assignee is within s. 12 of The Conditional Sales Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 291:\u2014\n12. Registration shall not be required in the case of a sale or bailment of manufactured goods, of the value of $15 or over, which, at the time of the actual delivery thereof to the buyer or bailee, have the manufacturer\u2019s or vendor\u2019s name painted, printed or stamped thereon or plainly attached thereto by a plate or similar device; provided that the manufacturer or vendor, being the seller or bailor of such goods, keeps an office in Saskatchewan where inquiry may be made and information procured concerning the sale or bailment of such goods; and provided further that the manufacturer or vendor or his agent does, within five days after receiving a request so to do made to him either in person or by registered letter, furnish to any applicant therefor a statement of the amounts, if any, paid thereon and the balance remaining unpaid. The person so inquiring shall if such inquiry is by letter give a name and post office address to which a reply may be sent; and it shall be sufficient if the required information is given by registered letter deposited in the post office within the said five days addressed to the person inquiring at his proper post office address, or where a name and address is given, addressed to such person by the name and at the post office so given.\nOn what has been called the \u201ccowl\u201d, the vertical sheet metal partition between the seating portion of the automobile and the front containing the cylinder block, etc., the name of the vendor and its address in Saskatchewan, printed on a sticker or what is called a \u201cdecal\u201d was affixed in such a position as to be readily seen on lifting the hood. Was that a compliance with the section as having been \u201cplainly attached\u201d to the automobile?\nI must confess to a difficulty in appreciating how it could be taken otherwise. The car, in the possession of the buyer or bailee, is, towards a purchaser, mortgagee or execution creditor, mentioned in s. 2(1) of the statute, open to the fullest inspection for any relevant information. The object of the provision is not to enable the public on an outside view to obtain the information intended to be given by the plate or device. This is a requirement that appertains only to persons interested to ascertain whether there is a title to ownership or security of a certain character outstanding. Even when the name of the seller is ascertained, further particulars would be required to describe the property such as the licence plate number, the serial number, the make, year and model of the car. In possession of these data, the items of which may call for inquiry from the possessor or the examination of the engine block, the sheriff or proposing purchaser or mortgagee is then in a position to seek out the particular interests protected by the section by making the request for information which the section authorizes.\nI should say that the attachment here was in a most suitable place to serve that purpose. Since it is to safeguard the conditional sale security, it should be in a spot permitting as much permanence as possible. On the outside of the car it would run the risk of being knocked or deliberately taken off. Whether or not the seller assumes the risk of its removal by the purchaser from him, there is no reason why further and unnecessary risks should be added. To sum this up, I should say that the object is to furnish the interested third person with the means of searching the title to see whether a specific form of property interest in another than the possessor exists. But just as he must write to the seller for that information so must he make a reasonable examination to discover who the seller is. For that purpose the \u201cplate or similar device\u201d here was \u201cplainly attached\u201d.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below, and declare the appellant to possess a valid title under the conditional sale agreement in the case mentioned. There will be no order as to costs in any court.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nNolan J.:\u2014This is an appeal, by special leave of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, from a judgment of that Court 3, dismissing an appeal (Gordon and McNiven JJ.A. dissenting) from a judgment of Graham J., which, in turn, affirmed the judgment of Hogarth D.C.J., in which it was held that the claim of the appellant Traders Finance Corporation, Limited, made in interpleader proceedings, should be dismissed.\nOn November 3, 1953, Canadian Motors, Limited sold a 1952 Ford coach to one Kruger under a conditional sale agreement. On the same day Canadian Motors, Limited assigned its interest in the conditional sale agreement to the appellant Traders Finance Corporation, Limited. On February 9, 1954, the Sheriff of the Judicial District of Regina seized the car under a writ of execution obtained in an action brought against Kruger by the respondent Lange.\nOn September 14, 1954, the appellant, by letter, advised the sheriff that it had a lien on the vehicle under the conditional sale agreement dated November 3, 1953, and on October 6, 1954, the solicitors for the appellant wrote to the sheriff claiming ownership of the vehicle on behalf of their client. On October 20, 1954, the solicitor for the respondent Lange notified the sheriff that the claim of the appellant was disputed. The issue was tried summarily by Hogarth D.C.J. on affidavit evidence and the following facts were agreed upon by counsel for the appellant and for the respondent:\u2014\n(1) Neither Canadian Motors Limited nor Traders Finance Corporation Limited registered at any time, the Conditional Sale Agreement dated November 3rd, 1953 between Canadian Motors Limited and Gus Kruger, and covering the sale of one used 1952 Ford Coach, Model 0570 bearing serial No. 0570H52-50828.\n(2) At the time of actual delivery of the said automobile by Canadian Motors Limited to the said Gus Kruger the name of Canadian Motors Limited was attached or stamped to said automobile by a plate or similar device.\nNeither Canadian Motors, Limited nor the appellant registered the conditional sale agreement, but relied on s. 12 of The Conditional Sales Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 358, which, in part, provides:\u2014\n12. Registration shall not be required in the case of a sale or bailment of manufactured goods, of the value of $15 or over, which, at the time of the actual delivery thereof to the buyer or bailee, have the manufacturer\u2019s or vendor\u2019s name painted, printed or stamped thereon or plainly attached thereto by a plate or similar device; provided \u2018that the manufacturer or vendor, being the seller or bailor of the goods, keeps an office in Saskatchewan where inquiry may be made and information procured concerning the sale or bailment of the goods; \u2026\nThe point for determination is whether the vendor\u2019s name was \u201cplainly attached\u201d to the vehicle, within the meaning of s. 12.\nOn the hearing before Hogarth D.C.J. it was stated, in the affidavit of James F. Betteridge, that he was employed by the appellant as used car shop foreman and that as soon as a used vehicle was acquired by Canadian Motors, Limited it was turned over to him for service and repair prior to resale; that before being removed to the sale lot it was customary for him, or someone under his direction, to affix to the vehicle, in one or more places, a decal, or sticker, which was usually placed on the engine cowl under the hood, or under the dash, or on the steering column, or on the outside of the trunk of each vehicle. The affidavit of Arthur R. Nichols stated that he had had twenty years\u2019 experience in the garage and automotive sales business and that all motor vehicles manufactured during the past twenty years, which had come to his premises for repair, or sale, have had placed upon them, or in them, normally under the hood of the vehicle, a plate upon which the name of the manufacturer clearly appears. Hogarth D.C.J. held that the Legislature, in employing the word \u201cplainly\u201d, intended that the name of the vendor should be attached to some part of the exterior surface of the vehicle where it could be readily found and plainly seen, and not in some concealed part, or hidden recess, such as the under-side, or glove compartment of the vehicle.\nGraham J., in dismissing the appeal, pointed out that the purpose of the plate, or decal, is to give notice of the name of the vendor to the world, so that inquiry may be made, and consequently reasonable visibility is required.\nIn the Court of Appeal the majority judgment construed the words \u201cplainly attached\u201d as meaning \u201cattached so as to be plainly visible\u201d. Gordon and McNiven JJ.A., dissenting, were of the opinion that the decal was \u201cplainly attached\u201d within the meaning of s. 12, supra, and that it should be attached near the serial number of the vehicle.\nIn the Court of Appeal the decisions of Meredith C.J. in Mason v. Lindsay 4, and of Lamont J. in Cockshutt Plow Co. v. Cowan 5, were relied upon as indicating the strictness with which similar legislation has been construed.\nIn Mason v. Lindsay, supra; the words \u201cMason & Risch, Toronto\u201d, painted upon a piano by a company whose corporate name was \u201cThe Mason & Risch Piano \u2018Company, Limited\u201d, were held not to be a compliance with the provisions of s. 1 of An Act respecting Conditional Sales of Chattels (R.S.O. 1897, c. 149), which required that the name and address of the manufacturer or vendor of the article be painted, printed, stamped or engraved thereon, or otherwise plainly attached thereto.\nIn Cockshutt Plow Co. v. Cowan, supra, the company stamped on a plough manufactured and sold by it the word \u201cCockshutt\u201d, while the corporate name of the company was \u201cThe Cockshutt Plow Co. Ltd.\u201d, and it was held that this was not \u00e0 sufficient compliance with s. 11 of the Saskatchewan Ordinance respecting Hire, Receipts and Conditional Sale of Goods (1907, c. 17), which required that the name of the manufacturer, or vendor\u2019s name, be painted, printed, or stamped thereon, or plainly attached thereto by a plate or similar device. Neither of these cases is of assistance. They are authority only for the proposition that, where a statute requires that the name of a manufacturer be painted, printed, stamped, engraved or plainly attached to an article, and a name is used that is not the corporate name of the manufacturer, there has not been a compliance with the statute. In the present case, there is no dispute as to the correctness of the name of the vendor. The complaint is that the name has been put in a place where it is not plainly visible, which was not the question in issue in Mason v. Lindsay, supra, or Cockshutt Plow Co. v. Cowan, supra.\nIn the judgment of the Court of Appeal it is said that, if the requirement of s. 12 can be satisfied by placing the decal on the cowl under the hood of a motor vehicle, then the provision of the section can be satisfied by attaching it in other places so hidden from view that intending purchasers would be required, in order to find the plate, to perform more complicated operations than merely lifting an engine hood, and such a placing would be in compliance with the requirements of this section. I am, with respect, unable to agree, because, if the place where the decal is attached is a place of concealment, then, in my view, it would follow that it was not plainly attached and the statute was not satisfied.\nIt is common ground that there was, at the time of the sale, attached to the cowl of the vehicle, underneath the hood, a decal, or sticker, of oval shape, approximately four inches long and one and one-half inches wide, with the words \u201cSold by Canadian Motors, Limited, Ford and Monarch Dealers, Regina\u201d printed thereon. Also there is no dispute as to the sufficiency of the wording on the decal, but only as to the visibility of the place of attachment. This decal cannot, of course, be seen unless the hood cover over the engine is raised so as to make the cowl visible.\nAttaching the name is intended to serve the same purpose as registration under the Act; that is, to give to subsequent purchasers, mortgagees, execution creditors and attachment creditors notice of the prior interest claimed by vendors in articles in the possession of others having a limited interest therein. Vendors must keep an office in Saskatchewan, where, upon inquiry, information concerning the sale may be obtained. It should be pointed out that the requirements of s. 12, supra, are not confined to motor vehicles, but apply to all kinds of manufactured goods of the value of $15. It follows that no rule of general application can be laid down for the attachment of the names of manufacturers to their articles of manufacture, because of their great variety. We are here dealing only with a motor vehicle and what might be suitable in the case under discussion might be unsuitable in the case of other manufactured articles.\nWith respect, I am unable to agree with the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal that it is not a compliance with the requirement of the statute to attach the decal on the cowl of the engine, where it cannot be seen until the hood is raised, or removed.

S(1)(i), 3(4), 4(1) and 6(1). By his will the husband of the deceased left the residue of his estate to his trustees to pay the net income thereof to his wife during her lifetime and \u201cto pay to my wife \u2026 the whole or such portion of the corpus thereof as she may from time to time and at any time during her life request or desire\u201d. Upon the death of the wife the residuary estate was to be divided equally between his children. The wife never made any request or expressed any desire to be paid any of the corpus nor did she ever receive any portion of it. Following her death on March 8, 1953, the Minister, in computing the value of her estate, included therein the amount then comprising the residue of her husband\u2019s estate on the ground that by virtue of s. 3(4) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act , since the wife had at the time of her death a general power to appoint or dispose of the corpus, there was deemed to be a succession in respect of such corpus. The appellant contended that the wife did not have a general power of appointment but only a special restricted power to require the residue to be paid to her. The Exchequer Court held that she had a general power of appointment.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: The wife was \u201ccompetent to dispose\u201d of the residue of her husband\u2019s estate within s. 3(1)(i) of the Act, because she had a general power to dispose of it, since \u201cgeneral power\u201d includes under s. 4(1) of the Act \u201cevery power or authority enabling the donee \u2026 to appoint or dispose of the property as he thinks fit\u201d. By virtue of s. 3(4) there was deemed to be a succession when a deceased held such a power. (In re Penrose, [1933] Ch. 793, referred to).\nPer Rand J.: When a donee can require the whole of the residue to be paid to \u2018him and thereupon dispose of it as he sees fit, he has power or authority to dispose of the property as he thinks fit within the meaning of s. 4(1) of the Act.\nPer Cartwright J.: Semble, the power given to the wife was not strictly speaking a general power of appointment but she was \u201ccompetent to dispose\u201d of the residue of her husband\u2019s estate.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, Ritchie J., affirming the assessment made by the Minister.\nA. E. Johnston, Q.C., and D. L. Swancar, for the appellant.\nJ. A. MacAulay, Q.C., D. C. McGarvin and A. L. De Wolfe, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an appeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court 2 dismissing an appeal from an assessment by the Minister of National Revenue of succession duty in respect of alleged successions arising on the death of Mrs. Emily Rhoda Bathgate. As she died March 8, 1953, the applicable statutory provisions are those of the Dominion Succession Duty Act , 1940-41, c. 14, as amended down to that date. The question to be determined is whether, under the terms of her husband\u2019s will, Mrs. Bath-gate had a general power of appointment or disposition. The appellants admit that if this point is decided adversely to them there were successions and that the assessment made by the Minister was proper.\nBy paragraph (i) of subs. (1) of s. 3 of the Act of 1940 Parliament enacted that a \u201csuccession\u201d shall be deemed to include:\u2014\n(i) property of which the person dying was at the time of his death competent to dispose.\nSubsection (1) of s. 4 provides:\u2014\n4. (1) A person shall be deemed competent to dispose of property if he has such an estate or interest therein or such general power as would, if he were sui juris, enable him to dispose of the property and the expression \u201cgeneral power\u201d includes every power or authority enabling the donee or other holder thereof to appoint or dispose of property as he thinks fit, whether exercisable by instrument inter vivos or by will, or both, but exclusive of any power exercisable in a fiduciary capacity under a disposition but made by himself, or exercisable as mortgagee.\nSubsection (4) of s. 3 was added in 1944-45 but was repealed in 1952 by c. 24, s. 2 and the following substituted therefor:\u2014\n(4) Where a deceased person had at the time of death a general power to appoint or dispose of property, there shall be deemed to be a succession in respect of such property and the person entitled thereto and the deceased shall be deemed to be the \u201csuccessor\u201d and \u201cpredecessor\u201d respectively in relation to the property.\nThese statutory conditions are to be applied in the following circumstances. Mrs. Bathgate\u2019s husband died before there was any Dominion Succession Duty Act and by his will left the residue of his estate to his executors and trustees \u201cupon trust \u2026 to pay the net income thereof to my wife\u201d. There was a further trust \u201cto pay to my wife \u2026 the whole or such portion of the corpus thereof as she may from time to time and at any time during her life request or desire\u201d. Upon the death of his wife his residuary estate was to be \u201cdivided equally between my children\u201d.\nHis will provided for the vesting of the shares of his estate given to his children in the following words:\u2014\nI further declare that although the time at which a child of mine shall be entitled to receive a share in my estate may be deferred until he or she has attained a stated age or that the amount thereof may not be deter- minable until the death of my wife as herein declared, yet any share to which a child of mine is entitled in my estate under the terms of this my Will shall be deemed to vest and shall vest in him or her immediately at my death.\nMrs. Bathgate never had any control or possession of any of the assets of her husband\u2019s estate and, under the terms of his will, she acted as an executrix in an advisory capacity only. She never made any request or expressed any desire to her husband\u2019s executors to be paid any of the corpus of his estate and did not receive any portion of the corpus.\nNotwithstanding the matters mentioned in the preceding paragraph which were relied on by the appellants, Mrs. Bathgate was \u201ccompetent to dispose\u201d of the residue of her husband\u2019s estate (subs. 1 (i) of s. 3), because she had a general power to dispose of it since \u201cgeneral power\u201d includes \u201cevery power or authority enabling the donee \u2026 to appoint or dispose of property as he thinks fit\u201d (subs. 1 of s. 4). By subs. 4 of s. 3 there was deemed to be a succession in respect of property where the deceased person had at the time of death not merely the general power or authority to \u201cappoint\u201d, but also to \u201cdispose of\u201d property. Although this subs. 4 of s. 3 was added only in 1952, the provisions of subs. 1 of s. 4, stating who is to be deemed \u201ccompetent to dispose\u201d apply to it. By the terms of the trust the executors and trustees of the husband were to pay Mrs. Bathgate \u201cthe whole or such part of the corpus thereof as she may from time to time and at any time during her lifetime request or desire\u201d. This power or authority to \u201crequest or desire\u201d is sufficient to bring her within the terms of the statute.\nIn In re Penrose 3, a wife gave a power of appointment to her husband in favour of a limited class which, on construction, was held to include the husband. He purported to exercise the power in favour of himself with respect only to part of the property and died without any general exercise of the power. Luxmoore J. held that there was nothing to prevent the husband as donee of the power from also being an object and appointing the whole property to himself. It is unnecessary to consider all the implications of that decision, but, so far as the point under consideration is concerned, I agree so unreservedly with the reasoning of Luxmoore J. where he is dealing with comparable provisions of the Imperial Finance Act, 1894, that I transcribe the relevant paragraph which appears at pp. 807-8 of the report:\u2014\nIt is argued that the power in the present case is a limited power and does not authorize the donee to appoint or dispose of the property subject to it as he thinks fit. It is said that if he appoints to himself he only acquires the property but does not dispose of it, and that his power to dispose of it as he thinks fit does not arise under the power but after he has exercised it in his own favour. In my judgment this is too narrow a construction to place on the words of the definition. A donee of a power who can freely appoint the whole of the fund to himself and so acquire the right to dispose of the fund in accordance with his own volition, is, in my judgment, competent to dispose of that fund as he thinks fit, and it can make no difference that this can only be done by two steps instead of by one\u2014namely, by an appointment to himself, followed by a subsequent gift or disposition instead of by a direct appointment to the object or objects of his bounty. If under a power the donee can make the whole of the property subject to it his own, he can by exercising the power in his own favour place himself in the position to dispose of it as he thinks fit. The power to dispose is a necessary incident of the power to acquire the property in question. In my judgment, the word \u201cpower\u201d in the phrase \u201ca power to appoint or dispose of as he thinks fit,\u201d is not used in the definition section in the strict legal sense attaching to it when used with reference to a power of appointment, but in the sense of capacity; and I think this is made clear by the use of the words \u201cor dispose of\u201d in addition to the words \u201cto appoint,\u201d because otherwise the words \u201cor dispose of\u201d would be mere surplusage.\nThe decision in Wanklyn v. The Minister of National Revenue 4, is not in conflict with this conclusion: There the majority of the Court expressed doubts as to whether, on the proper construction of the will of Mrs. Chipman, a general power of appointment had been conferred on her husband, but arrived at their conclusion on another basis. What was sought to be assessed to succession duty was the property over which the Minister had argued the husband had a general power of appointment, although he had not exercised it except with respect to a small portion. The Minister sought to make his estate liable as if the power had been completely exercised.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Rand J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal is whether the following clause of a will creates a general power of appointment within the meaning of the Dominion Succession Duty Act , statutes of 1940-41, c. 14:\u2014\nSixthly: UPON TRUST as to all of my residuary estate including lapsed legacies, should my wife, Emily Rhoda Bathgate, survive me, to pay the net income thereof to my wife, Emily Rhoda Bathgate, for the term of her natural life, and to pay to my wife, Emily Rhoda Bathgate, the whole or such portion of the corpus thereof as she may from time to time and at any time during her life request or desire;\u2026.\nThis was followed by a provision declaring that the remainder interests of the residue given to the children should be deemed to vest immediately on the testator\u2019s death.\nSections 3(4) and 4(1) of the Act read:\u2014\n3. (4) Where a deceased person had at the time of death a general power to appoint or dispose of property, there shall be deemed to be a succession in respect of such property and the person entitled thereto and the deceased shall be deemed to be the \u201csuccessor\u201d and \u201cpredecessor\u201d respectively in relation to the property.\n4. (1) A person shall be deemed competent to dispose of property if he has such an estate or interest therein or such general power as would, if he were sui juris, enable him to dispose of the property and the expression \u201cgeneral power\u201d includes every power or authority enabling the donee or other holder thereof to appoint or dispose of property as he thinks fit, whether exercisable by instrument inter vivos or by will, or both, but exclusive of any power exercisable in a fiduciary capacity under a disposition not made by himself, or exercisable as mortgagee.\nMr. Johnston\u2019s argument is that in the ordinary definition of the expression \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d there must be an unlimited discretion as to appointees, including the donee of the power, either by instrument inter vivos or by will or both and that as the donee here could appropriate only to herself, that is, that on her request the money would be paid to her, the definition is not satisfied. What the clause does, the contention goes, is to give a power to appropriate the corpus as distinguished from the power to appoint.\nI will assume that the definition so stated is right but I think the question is disposed of by s. 4(1). By that language the expression used in s. 3(4) includes \u201cevery power or authority enabling the donee or other holder to appoint or dispose of the property as he thinks fit\u201d. If the language were \u201cto appoint as he thinks fit\u201d that would, no doubt, express the general understanding of such a power but the \u201cauthority to dispose of property as he thinks fit\u201d must obviously be given independent meaning and if it is then it necessarily effects an enlargement of the ordinary scope of the expression. \u201cAuthority to dispose of\u201d contemplates ultimate alienation. The technical conception of an appointment is that the property is deemed to pass from the donor of the power to the appointee, but with authority to dispose there is added the case such as is before us where the donee can admittedly require the whole of the residue to be paid to her and thereupon dispose of it as she sees fit. That was the view of similar language taken by Luxmoore J. in In re Penrose 5, and I think it is the right view.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The facts, the provisions of the will of the late James Loghrin Bathgate and the statutory provisions relevant to the determination of the question raised in this appeal are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nThe question to be determined is whether the corpus of the residue of the estate of James Loghrin Bathgate forms part of the estate of Emily Rhoda Bathgate for purposes of succession duty.\nRitchie J. was of opinion that the will of James Loghrin Bathgate conferred on Mrs. Bathgate a general power of appointment in respect of the residue of his estate. The clause of Mr. Bathgate\u2019s will which the learned judge construed as giving this power is as follows:\u2014\nSixthly: UPON TRUST as to all of my residuary estate including lapsed legacies, should my wife, Emily Rhoda Bathgate, survive me, to pay the net income thereof to my wife, Emily Rhoda Bathgate, for the term of her natural life, and to pay to my wife, Emily Rhoda Bathgate, the whole or such portion of the corpus thereof as she may from time to time and at any time during her life request or desire; and I further direct that upon the death of my said wife, Emily Rhoda Bathgate, my said residuary estate (including undistributed income) or so much thereof as shall not have been paid to my wife during her lifetime shall be divided equally between my children Mary Loghrin Calder and William Campbell Bathgate, or the same shall go wholly to one if only one of such children shall survive me, subject to the provision that if either of my said children shall have predeceased me leaving issue who shall be living at my death, such issue shall take, and if more than one equally among them, the share which such deceased child would have taken had such deceased child been living at my death. While it is not necessary to express a final opinion on the point, it is my present view that the power given to Mrs. Bathgate to obtain payment to herself at any time during her life of the whole or such portion of the corpus of the residuary estate as she might desire was not, strictly speaking, a general power of appointment. However, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice I agree with his conclusion that under s. 4(1) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act Mrs. Bathgate must be deemed to have been competent to dispose of the fund in question, which, accordingly, became subject to duty by the combined effect of ss. 3(1) (i) and 6(1) of the Act.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, Jessiman, Gardner and Swancar.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

In his defence, he alleged lack of opportunity and the fact that he was impotent. In rebuttal, the girl\u2019s older sister testified that the appellant had had sexual intercourse with her a number of times, and the mother of the girls testified that the appellant had admitted to her acts of intercourse with the older girl. The trial judge held that the appellant\u2019s statements as to opportunity and impotence were false. The Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed the conviction.\nHeld (Cartwright and Nolan JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. Per curiam: There was evidence upon which it was open to the trial judge to find that the child understood the nature and consequences of an oath and could therefore be sworn in as a witness.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: There was evidence from which the trial judge could infer corroboration in law. Whether a false statement is or is not corroboration must depend upon all the circumstances in a particular case. In the present case, both the lack of opportunity and the physical incapacity to commit the offence were material facts, either of which, if true, afforded a complete defence to the charge. The nature of the false statements and the circumstances in which they were made were such as could lead to an inference in support of the evidence of the child.\nPer Cartwright and Nolan JJ. (dissenting): In all the circumstances of the case at bar, the false statements could not in law be regarded as corroboration of the evidence of the child. Evidence in corroboration must at the least be independent evidence from which it results as a matter of inference that it is more probable that the offence was committed by the accused than not. The false statements were not evidence of that nature.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the conviction of the appellant.\nJ.M. Reycraft, for the appellant.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The relevant facts in this appeal are fully set forth in the reasons of my brother Cartwright, which I have had the advantage of considering.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was granted on the following questions of law:\u2014\n(1) Was there evidence on which it was open to the trial judge to find that the child, Pearl Miller, understood the nature and consequences of an oath and should be sworn as a witness?\n(2) Was there any evidence to corroborate the evidence of the child, Pearl Miller, in any material particular implicating the accused?\n(3) Did the trial judge admit inadmissible evidence of the witness, John Miller, as to statements made to him by Helen Miller in the absence of the appellant?\nAs to the first of these questions, I am satisfied that there was evidence upon which it was open to the trial judge to find as he did and this was the position taken by this Court at the hearing when it was indicated to counsel for the respondent that he need not pursue his argument on this point.\nThe argument before us was directed principally to the second question, that is to say, as to whether two false statements made by the accused at the trial were, in the circumstances of this case, evidence which in law could be corroborative. These two statements were[2] that the accused had no opportunity to commit the offence because the complainant\u2019s brother slept with him, and[3] that for several years he had been impotent and therefore physically incapable of committing the offence. The Court below2 held that these false statements were evidence from which corroboration could be inferred, relying upon the dictum of Lord Dunedin in Dawson v. McKenzie3, which has been quoted by my brother Cartwright and which has been discussed and applied in a number of subsequent cases, the most recent of which is Credland v. Knowler[4].\nMuch could be said for the view that upon a proper construction of the reasons given by the trial judge, he would have been prepared to convict without corroborative evidence. Be that as it may I share his view and that of the Court below that there was in law evidence from which the trial judge could infer corroboration.\nWhether a false statement is or is not corroboration must, of course, depend upon all the circumstances in a particular case. In the present case both lack of opportunity and physical incapacity to commit the offence were material facts, either of which, if true, afforded a complete defence to the charge laid. In my opinion the nature of the false statements made by the accused and the circumstances in which they were made were such as could lead to an inference in support of the evidence of the child. As Taschereau J., speaking for the majority of the Court, said in Macdonald v. The King[5]:\nThe behaviour of a witness as well as his contradictory or untrue statements are questions of fact from which a jury may properly infer corroboration. As to the third ground of appeal, I am satisfied that the learned trial judge specifically rejected the evidence complained of.\nSince in my opinion there is no error in the judgment of the Court below, I would dismiss the appeal.\nThe dissenting judgment of Cartwright and Nolan JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014On December 9, 1955, the appellant was convicted before His Honour Judge Legris in the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court of the County of Essex on the charge:\u2014\nThat he on or about the 11th day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-five, at the Township of Sandwich West, in the said County, did unlawfully have sexual intercourse with Pearl Miller, a female person not his wife and under the age of Fourteen years, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nHis appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[6] was dismissed by a unanimous judgment delivered on February 14, 1956.\nThe appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following questions of law:\u2014\n(1) Was there evidence on which it was open to the trial judge to find that the child, Pearl Miller, understood the nature and consequences of an oath and should be sworn as a witness?\n(2) Was there any evidence to corroborate the evidence of the child, Pearl Miller, in any material particular implicating the accused?\n(3) Did the trial judge admit inadmissible evidence of the witness, John Miller, as to statements made to him by Helen Miller in the absence of the appellant?\nAs to the first point, while the answers of the witness Pearl Miller in the course of her examination by the learned trial judge for the purpose of determining whether she should be sworn seem to me to leave room for doubt as to whether she did in fact understand the nature and consequences of an oath, some of her answers appear to indicate that she had the necessary understanding; and I am unable to say that, as a matter of law, there was no evidence on which it was open to the learned trial judge to find as he did on this point.\nIn dealing with the second point it is first necessary to refer briefly to the facts. Pearl Miller, with whom the offence was alleged to have been committed, was born on February 2, 1943, and so was 12 years and 5 months old at the date of the offence charged. She is a daughter of the appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s sister. Her father died in 1948 and from then until some time in 1955 the appellant made a home for her and her two brothers and three sisters. She testified that she slept in one bedroom with her two younger sisters and the appellant slept in another room, but that he would from time to time get her to come into his bed. Her evidence, if accepted, indicates that the offence had been committed; but when the Crown closed its case there was no corroboration of her testimony.\nThe appellant gave evidence in defence. He denied the charge explicitly and also testified (i) that he had for some years been physically incapable of having sexual intercourse and (ii) that at the relevant times John Miller, an elder brother of Pearl, had been sleeping in the same bedroom as the appellant. He was asked in cross-examination if he had had sexual intercourse with Helen, a sister of Pearl, who was born on April 2, 1938, and said he had never done so.\nThe defence then called John Miller who testified that he slept in the appellant\u2019s bedroom except during the summer when he slept with his brother in the playhouse. In cross\u2011examination he said that the appellant had told him that he had had intercourse with Helen frequently prior to her leaving his house, which she did in February 1955.\nIn reply the Crown called Helen Miller who testified that the appellant had had sexual intercourse with her a number of times, particularly in December 1954 and January 1955. The Crown then recalled Pearl\u2019s mother, Mrs. Santarossa, who testified that in August 1955, after the preliminary inquiry, she had had a conversation with the appellant. She was asked what the conversation was and answered:\u2014\nWell, he told me about the Children\u2019s Aid taking the children and he told me that he did touch Helen and he said he was sorry, but he said he didn\u2019t touch Pearl.\nIn delivering judgment the learned trial judge says in part:\u2014\nIt is true the accused is not in good health, but the several statements made by the accused and amongst others that he was not able to have an erection is certainly not correct. It is not a true statement. And again the statement that the playroom was only being used accidentally, so to speak, is also not correct; it was used through the summer months. Those are straight denials and clearly point to the unreliability of the accused in respect of several statements. The further admission which the accused made to Mrs. Santarossa at the time of the police court hearing leaves no doubt that he has undoubtedly lied as to his potency.\nTaken as a whole, I believe that the facts as they came out this morning are more than sufficient to give substantial corroboration to the story given by Pearl, and so much so on the weakness of the contradiction in the evidence of the accused and the impression that the evidence of Pearl gave me, I would strongly feel justified in finding the accused guilty without corroboration. In this case I am satisfied that there is more than sufficient corroboration in the statements made by the witnesses Helen and Mrs. Santarossa, and the contradiction by the accused himself in his own evidence. Therefore, the only conclusion to which I can arrive is that the accused is guilty as charged.\nCounsel for the respondent argues that, in the circumstances of this case, the learned trial judge having held on sufficient evidence that the statements made by the appellant, (i) that he was impotent, and (ii) that John Miller was sleeping in his bedroom at the relevant times, were false, it was open to him to find corroboration in the fact of the appellant having made such false statements.\nReliance is placed on the statement of Lord Dunedin in Dawson v. McKenzie[7], which was quoted by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario:\u2014\nMere opportunity alone does not amount to corroboration, but two things may be said about it. One is that the opportunity may be of such a character as to bring in the element of suspicion. That is, that the circumstances and locality of the opportunity may be such as in themselves to amount to corroboration. The other is that the opportunity may have a complexion put upon it by statements made by the defender which are proved to be false. It is not that the false statement made by the defender proves that the pursuer\u2019s statements are true, but it may give to a proved opportunity a different complexion from what it would have borne had no such false statement been made.\nCounsel for the respondent argues that, while the facts, (i) that the appellant occupied a bedroom alone in the vicinity of the room occupied by Pearl, and (ii) that the accused was proved to have been potent six months prior to the date of the offence charged, would not in themselves have amounted to any corroboration of Pearl\u2019s story, the false denials by the appellant of both of these facts could be regarded as corroboration. In Credland v. Knowler[8], Lord Goddard L.C.J. discusses the case of Dawson v. McKenzie, supra, and says in part at pages 54 and 55:\u2014\nI should be very sorry to lay down, and I have no intention of laying down and I do not think any case has gone the length of laying down, that the mere fact that an accused person has told a lie can in itself amount to corroboration. It may, but it does not follow that it must. If a man tells a lie when he is spoken to about an alleged offence, the fact that he tells a lie at once throws great doubt upon his evidence, if he afterwards gives evidence, and it may be very good ground for rejecting his evidence, but the fact that his evidence ought to be rejected does not of itself amount to there being corroboration.\n* * *\nIn other words, one has to look at the whole circumstances of the case. What may afford corroboration in one case may not in another. It depends on the nature of the rest of the evidence and the nature of the lie that was told.\nThe question we have to decide is whether, in all the circumstances of the case at bar, the two false statements, set out above, made at the trial by the appellant could in law be regarded as corroboration of the evidence of Pearl Miller. After an anxious consideration of all the evidence I have reached the conclusion that they could not. Evidence in corroboration must at the least be independent evidence from which it results as a matter of inference that it is more probable that the offence charged was committed by the accused than not. It is obvious from reading the record that the accused was a man of little education and limited understanding who protested his innocence and asserted that a false charge had been concocted against him. His false statements at the trial could justify the learned judge in refusing to believe his testimony but they do not, in my view, afford corroboration. They do not, I think, give a different complexion to the opportunity which was afforded by the fact of the appellant\u2019s residence in the same house as Pearl Miller. They are consistent with the panic of a man of limited mental powers faced with so serious a charge and do not in themselves warrant an affirmative inference of his guilt. In their nature the false statements do not appear to me to differ from those in the case, put by my brother Nolan during the argument, of an accused who sets up an alibi which is proved to be false, a course which would seem to me to impeach the accused\u2019s veracity but not to strengthen the case of the prosecution. In Macdonald v. The King[9], the false statement of the accused, referred to in the judgments, was made in connection with a meeting with a number of other persons proved to be participants in the crime with which he was charged; the fact of such meeting having taken place was in itself capable of being regarded as corroborative of the evidence of the accomplices apart from the making of the false statement.\nI do not read the reasons of the learned trial judge in the case at bar as asserting that he would, although fully conscious of the danger of so doing, have convicted if he had concluded that there was no corroboration; it was not necessary for him to direct his mind to that question since in his opinion there was \u201cmore than sufficient corroboration\u201d. In my respectful view, the learned trial judge erred in law in holding that there was corroboration in the evidence of Helen Miller and of Mrs. Santarossa and consequently the conviction cannot be upheld.\nThis renders it unnecessary for me to deal with the third point on which leave to appeal was granted.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.M.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nThe Canadian Fairbanksmorse Company Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent;\nand\nSociedade Geral de Commercio, Industria E Transportes LDA Mise-En-Cause.\n1956: March 13, 14; 1956: June 27.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nShipping\u2014Privilege\u2014Materials furnished for construction of four ships\u2014 Conservatory attachment\u2014Privilege claimed on two ships\u2014Arts. 1983, 2383 C.C.\nBy a contract of sale, the respondent sold to the appellant certain equipment to be installed in four ships being constructed by the appellant, for a price of $415,276.49 payable in five instalments. Prior to the institution of this action brought by the respondent to recover a balance of $48,611.18, now reduced to $44,832.16, owing under the contract, two of the ships had been completed and delivered to the mise-en-cause. The action was accompanied by a conservatory attachment on the two remaining ships to protect the privilege claimed under art. 2383 C.C. The privilege was maintained by the trial judge and by a majority in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J.: There was one contract of sale for a single price and not four separate sales for four separate prices. Therefore, no question of the apportionment or imputation of payments could arise.\nA privilege is indivisible in its nature. The last paragraph of art. 2383 C.C. refers in terms to a single ship, and where, as here, materials are sold for a single price and used in the construction of more than one ship, it may well be that the privilege can only be exercised upon each ship to the extent of that portion of the price assignable to the materials used in that ship. In the present case, it was established that the portion of the price represented by the equipment installed in each ship was $103,819.12. The claim for the much smaller amount is secured by privilege upon each of the remaining ships. Per Taschereau and Locke JJ.: There was but one contract of sale affecting the four ships, there was but one debt, and there was no imputation of payments.\nSince the privilege is indivisible in its nature, if the privileged object is fractioned, each part of the object guarantees the whole debt. Consequently the privilege covered the four ships. Since the debt is only $44,832.16, it follows that it is guaranteed by privilege on the two remaining ships and the question does not arise as to whether one or two ships could guarantee by privilege the totality of the debt of $415,276.49, if it had remained unpaid.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, affirming, Rinfret J. dissenting, the judgment at trial maintaining a privilege under art. 2383 C.C.\nA. Geoffrion, for the appellant.\nY. Pratte, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014The contract upon which the respondent\u2019s claim is founded provided for the sale by respondent to appellant of the propulsive equipment to be installed in four ships constructed by appellant, the various items of equipment for each ship being described in the contract as a \u201cship set\u201d. The sale price of all the machinery and equipment, at various unit prices specified in the contract, was $415,276.49 payable in five instalments of 20% each. In its action respondent claimed $48,611.18 as the balance owing under the contract. Prior to the institution of the action, two of the ships constructed by appellant had been completed and delivered to the mise-en-cause, and the claim for $48,611.18 was accompanied by a conservatory attachment on the two remaining ships to protect the privilege claimed by respondent. This claim was maintained to the extent of $44,832.16.\nWhile the amount of appellant\u2019s claim and certain other questions were in issue in the Courts below I understand that there is now no controversy except as to whether, and to what extent, respondent\u2019s claim for. $44,832.16 is privileged and as such entitled to be paid out of moneys set aside for that purpose. In the event that I am mistaken as to the appellant\u2019s concurrence in the views of the Court of Appeal upon the other matters, I should say that I am in agreement with those views.\nThe determination of this question involves the consideration of two points, (1) whether the contract referred to provided for a single sale with one sale price, or for four separate sales, one for each ship set, at four separate prices and (2) to what extent, if any, the respondent is entitled to be paid its claim by privilege.\nAs to the first of these points, I am satisfied there was no error in the decision of the Court below that there was one contract of sale for a single price, not four separate sales for four separate prices. This being so, no question of the apportionment or imputation of payments can arise.\nRespondent\u2019s claim to be paid by privilege is based upon the provisions of the last paragraph of article 2383 of the Quebec Civil Code, which reads as follows:\u2014\n2383. There is a privilege upon vesse\u2019s for the payment of the following debts:\n* * *\nIf the ship sold have not yet made a voyage, the seller, the workmen employed in building and completing her, and the persons by whom the materials have been furnished, are paid by preference to all creditors, except those for debts enumerated in paragraphs 1 and 2.\nThe privilege provided for under this article, in. common with other privileges created under the Code, gives to the creditor a right to be preferred to other creditors according to the origin of his claim and is indivisible of its nature (C.C. 1983).\nArticle 2383 of the Civil Code is similar to article 191 of the Code de Commerce as that article stood prior to the substantial amendments made in 1949 and both articles had their source to a very large extent in the provisions of l\u2019Ordonnance de la Marine of 1681. Each of these provided, among other things, for a privilege to secure payment of the price of materials furnished for the construction of a ship and to secure payment of insurance upon the ship for the last voyage. Moreover, the civil law of France concerning privileges upon moveable property was substantially the same as that of the Province of Quebec. Decisions of the French Courts and the works of the French commentators may therefore usefully be considered in determining the effect of article 2383 of the Quebec Code. In France, where insurance on a ship had been effected for a single premium but for a fixed period of time during which the ship made more than one voyage, the Cour de Cassation has held that the insurer\u2019s privilege must be limited to that portion of the premium assignable to the period covered by the last voyage, his claim for the balance of the premium being an unsecured one. Civ. rej. 20 juillet 1898, et le rapport de M. le Conseiller Durand: Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1900, 1. 231. See also Baudry-Lacantinerie, Privil\u00e8ges, Vol. 1. No. 696.\nThe last paragraph of article 2383 refers in terms to a single ship, and where, as in the case at bar, materials are sold for a single price and used by the purchaser in the construction of more than one ship, it may well be, as suggested by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec in the Court below, that the privilege of the seller can only be exercised upon each ship to the extent of that portion of the price assignable to the materials used in that ship. Under certain circumstances this might present some difficulty as to proof but this does not arise in the present case as it was established that the portion of the price represented by machinery and equipment installed in each ship was $103,819.12. It is clear therefore that the respondent\u2019s claim for the much smaller amount of $44,832.16 is secured by privilege upon each of the ships seized under the conservatory attachment.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014J\u2019ai eu l\u2019avantage de lire le jugement de mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Abbott, et je m\u2019accorde avec sa d\u00e9cision. Je ne veux ajouter que quelques notes pour appuyer la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle je suis arriv\u00e9.\nIl est \u00e9videmment inutile de r\u00e9citer de nouveau les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 ce litige. Il me sera suffisant de rappeler que l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame $48,611.18, \u00e9tant la balance due en vertu d\u2019un unique contrat de vente au montant de $415,276.49, pour marchandises vendues et livr\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, payable en cinq versements \u00e9gaux de 20% chacun. Ce montant repr\u00e9sente le prix de quatre machines \u00e0 propulsion et accessoires, \u00e0 \u00eatre install\u00e9es \u00e0 bord de quatre navires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 baptis\u00e9s sous les noms de \u201cCARTAXO\u201d, \u201cCOLARES\u201d, \u201cCOVILHA\u201d et \u201cCORUCHE\u201d.\nDeux navires compl\u00e9t\u00e9s ont quitt\u00e9 le port de Qu\u00e9bec, alors qu\u2019il restait d\u00fb le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 dans l\u2019action, qui \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une saisie-conservatoire pour garantir par privil\u00e8ge le paiement de la balance impay\u00e9e. C\u2019est la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelante que cette dette n\u2019est pas enti\u00e8rement privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e, car deux navires avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 quitt\u00e9 le port et entrepris leur premier voyage. L\u2019intim\u00e9e se base sur les dispositions suivantes du Code Civil de Qu\u00e9bec (article 2383):\u2014\nIl y a privil\u00e8ge sur les b\u00e2timents pour le paiement des cr\u00e9ances ci-apr\u00e8s :\u2014\n* * *\nSi le b\u00e2timent n\u2019a pas encore fait de voyage, le vendeur, les ouvriers employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la construction et ceux qui ont fourni les mat\u00e9riaux pour le compl\u00e9ter, sont pay\u00e9s par pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 tous les cr\u00e9anciers autres que ceux port\u00e9s aux paragraphes 1 et 2.\nLes paragraphes 1 et 2 sont \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les frais de saisie et de vente, les droits de pilotage, de quaiage et de havre, et les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s encourues pour infractions aux r\u00e8glements l\u00e9gaux du havre, ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur la cr\u00e9ance de ceux qui ont fourni les mat\u00e9riaux pour compl\u00e9ter les navires.\nIl est certain que l\u2019article 2383 (C.C.) ne semble couvrir que le cas d\u2019un seul navire, et que lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule cr\u00e9ance due \u00e0 un fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux, employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la construction de ce navire, elle ne peut \u00eatre garantie par privil\u00e8ge sur un navire diff\u00e9rent. L\u2019intim\u00e9e admet ce principe, qu\u2019il serait d\u2019ailleurs oiseux de contester s\u00e9rieusement.\nMais dans le cas qui nous est soumis, la cr\u00e9ance de l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9v\u00e8le en effet un caract\u00e8re qui doit la soustraire \u00e0 la rigidit\u00e9 de cette r\u00e8gle. Car le contrat est en effet r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes qui suivent et qui veulent que les \u201cshipsets\u201d devaient \u00eatre livr\u00e9s \u201cle premier, le ou avant le 2 f\u00e9vrier 1948, et les trois autres, \u00e0 raison d\u2019un par mois pour chaque mois subs\u00e9quent\u201d. Les paiements devaient s\u2019effectuer de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\n20% sur acceptation de la r\u00e9quisition par le vendeur;\n20% le ler d\u00e9cembre 1947;\n20% le ler f\u00e9vrier 1948;\n20% le ler avril 1948;\n20% soixante jours apr\u00e8s la livraison du dernier \u201cshipset of equipment\u201d.\nOn voit donc qu\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul contrat affectant les quatre navires, une seule cr\u00e9ance comme une seule dette, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune imputation faite quant \u00e0 ces paiements.\nLe privil\u00e8ge de sa nature est indivisible. On sait que c\u2019est le droit qu\u2019a un cr\u00e9ancier d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres cr\u00e9anciers suivant la cause de sa cr\u00e9ance (1983 C.C.). Cet article correspond \u00e0 l\u2019article 2095 du Code Fran\u00e7ais, sauf qu\u2019en France on n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de proclamer cette indivisibilit\u00e9, vu l\u2019\u00e9vidence de ce caract\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique au privil\u00e8ge. (Planiol et Ripert \u201cDroit Civil\u201d vol. 12, 2e \u00e9d. p. 276) (Rodi\u00e8re \u201cSolidarit\u00e9 et Indivisibilit\u00e9\u201d p. 379) (Beudant \u201cDroit Civil Fran\u00e7ais\u201d vol. 13, p. 318).\nIl en r\u00e9sulte donc que si la chose que le privil\u00e8ge frappe vient \u00e0 \u00eatre fractionn\u00e9e, chacune des parties de cette m\u00eame chose r\u00e9pond de la dette, et le d\u00e9tenteur peut \u00eatre poursuivi pour le recouvrement.\nDans le cas qui nous est soumis, il n\u2019y a eu aucune pr\u00e9cision quant aux fournitures faites respectivement \u00e0 chacun des navires composant cette flotte. Il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul contrat, qu\u2019une seule cr\u00e9ance, qu\u2019une seule dette, et en cons\u00e9quence, le privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 cause de son caract\u00e8re d\u2019indivisibilit\u00e9, porte sur l\u2019ensemble de la flotte. (Cour de Cassation, Dalloz \u201cJurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u201d 1913, p. 302.). Comme dans le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente, la r\u00e9clamation a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite \u00e0 $44,832.16, il s\u2019ensuit donc qu\u2019elle est couverte par privil\u00e8ge sur les deux navires saisis, et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, vu\u2019 que la question ne se pr\u00e9sente pas, de d\u00e9terminer si un seul ou deux navires pourraient garantir par privil\u00e8ge, la totalit\u00e9 de la dette de $415,276.49, si elle \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9e impay\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.

His main defences bad been self-defence, drunkenness and lack of intention to kill.\nThe evidence was that the appellant and the victim had, in a deserted lane at about 2 a.m. on a very cold night, engaged in a drunken fist fight; that the victim fell to the ground and was kicked by the appellant; that while the victim was lying bleeding and unconscious, in below zero weather, the appellant removed the victim\u2019s coat, placed a leather belt around his head, running it through the mouth and knotting it tightly behind the left ear, and then abandoned him. The autopsy revealed numerous cuts on the head and a depressed fracture of the skull. The lungs contained an abnormal amount of blood.\nThe conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, without written reasons.\nHeld (Rand, Cartwright and Nolan JJ. dissenting), the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: On the uncontradicted evidence of medical and law enforcement officials and the admittedly free and voluntary statements made by the appellant, the conclusion is irresistible that, failing any defence that could arise from the evidence, the appellant\u2019s conduct throughout the entire transaction could only manifest an intention either to cause the death of the victim or to cause the victim bodily injury known to him to be likely to cause or accelerate death and being reckless whether death ensued or not. It is impossible to say with any degree of certainty to which one of the various injuries death could ultimately be attributed. Whether the fracture of the skull was caused by the appellant, intentionally or accidentally, what he did, once his victim had become unconscious, on the medical evidence, accelerated death and there is no place for any speculation as to what his intentions then were if they are to be measured by his actions. Therefore, subject to the consideration of possible defences and assuming particularly that the appellant was sane and sober, as the law presumes, there could be no doubt that what he then did is only reasonably consistent with either an intention to kill or to cause such bodily injury known to him to be likely, in the circumstances, to cause or accelerate death, being reckless whether death ensued or not. Subject to the consideration of possible defences, whether such a killing by acceleration amounts to murder or manslaughter depends whether, on the evidence, the case is one within s. 201(a) (i) or (ii) of the Code.\nThe trial judge charged the jury as to insanity, provocation, self-defence and drunkenness. These directions are unimpeached by the appellant. Obviously, the jury reached the view that none of the defences was made out. Having particularly failed to find that the appellant was drunk to the extent required to support a defence of drunkenness, which was the main defence here, there was no other verdict possible but the one rendered. There was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nPer Locke J.: All the acts of the appellant must be considered together and the matter cannot be limited to the blows which presumably felled the victim.\nThere is no substance to the objection that the trial judge made a finding in law that the appellant\u2019s participation in the fight was an unlawful act and a crime when the facts were in dispute. The facts were not in dispute and assaulting another person is a criminal offence subject to the exceptions explained in the charge.\nReading the charge as a whole, there was no misdirection for the trial judge to say that the appellant was presumed to intend all the consequences which might flow from the fight, even though he may not have known that the victim received a fractured skull, and that he was thus presumed to be guilty of murder, subject to possible defences. The necessity for proof of the intent required by s. 201(a) of the Code was impressed on the jury.\nThe contention that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that if the victim fell during the fight and fractured his skull on some object it could amount to no more than manslaughter, cannot be entertained. If the appellant struck the victim with his fists intending to kill him or cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and being reckless whether death ensued or not, it would be murder and not manslaughter.\nThe reading by the trial judge of s. 196 of the Code, coupled with the reference to the condition in which the victim was left and the instructions in the charge as a whole, was sufficient to dispose of the ground that the trial judge failed to tell the jury under what circumstances it would have been manslaughter under that section. The objection that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury, that if they found that the appellant accelerated the death, under what circumstances it would amount to manslaughter, ignores the instructions as to whether the appellant had caused the death and as to his intent in assaulting and leaving the victim gagged and unconscious in the snow.\nThe jury, finding that the appellant was capable of forming the intent necessary to constitute the offence of murder, has by its verdict found that he had formed that intent. No other finding was open to them upon the evidence. No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting): The brain contusion was the vital physical fact and therefore the question of actual intent was of the first importance. The charge confused the question of causing a homicide with that of attributing to the appellant an intent or state of mind. If the appellant knew nothing of the skull fracture or existing conditions that coupled with a knockdown could cause it, it is impossible to see how anything flowing from it could be considered to be within any legal presumption of intention related to consequences, natural or unnatural. It was fatal to the charge to omit the vital link of knowledge actual or imputed that could produce such a natural consequence, as well as the intent to bring such an injury about.\nAs to the supplementary cause of tying the belt and abandoning the victim, which it was contended accelerated the death, the general verdict makes it impossible to say whether the jury proceeded upon the one cause or the other; and any finding by a court of appeal that the jury must have found guilt on the one or the other might be based on the one that the jury rejected. Furthermore, it cannot be seriously contested that the jury could have found in favour of the appellant that this supplementary conduct had not been carried out with \u2018the intent of s. 259 of the old Code and that the passion of the fight had not cooled. Nothing of this was contained in the charge and no Court can usurp the function of the jury and make such a finding under s. 1014(2) of the old Code.\nPer Cartwright J. (dissenting): It was misdirection, fatal to the -conviction, to tell the jury not that they might but that they must find that the appellant had the intent required by s. 201(a) (i) or (ii) of the Code unless they found that he was through drunkenness incapable of forming the intent to cause death or to cause bodily injury that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not. It was for the jury, giving due weight to the rebuttable presumption which imputes to a man an intention to produce those consequences which are the natural result of his acts, to decide as a fact whether the appellant had the guilty intent necessary to make him guilty of murder; and, in particular, it was for them to say whether the fracture of the skull was a natural consequence of any blow struck by the appellant.\nn the circumstances of this case, it is impossible to say that a jury properly instructed and acting reasonably must necessarily have convicted the appellant of murder. It was open to them on the evidence to find a verdict of manslaughter. On the other hand, it is not possible to say that there was no evidence on which the jury might find a verdict of murder, and, therefore, there should be a new trial. Per Nolan J. (dissenting): It was a fatal defect in the charge of the trial judge to instruct the jury, as he did, that the appellant was presumed to have intended the consequences which flowed from the fight, even though he might not have known that the victim suffered a fractured skull, and that an intent, as required by s. 201(a) (i) or (ii) of the Code, must be attributed to him. It was for the jury to say whether the intent of s. 201 was to be attributed to the appellant so as to justify a verdict of murder; also to say whether the fracture of the skull was caused by a blow of the appellant or by the victim falling on a pile of scrap iron nearby.\nIt was for the jury to determine whether, on the facts, manslaughter or murder was the appropriate verdict and there is a doubt, which must be resolved in favour of the appellant, that the verdict would necessarily have been the same had no irregularity occurred.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, affirming the conviction of the appellant for murder.\nJ. L. Crawford for the appellant.\nA. S. Dewar for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment, delivered without written reasons by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, affirming a verdict of murder rendered against the appellant. The grounds of law, upon which leave to appeal to this Court was granted, are all exclusively related to the address of the trial judge to the jury. These grounds and all the material facts leading to the conviction of the appellant, are set out in detail by other members of the Court and need not therefore be recited here.\nOn a consideration of the uncontradicted evidence of medical and law enforcement officials, who took charge of the case when the body of the victim was found lying in a lane on the morning of January 6, 1955, and of the admittedly free and voluntary statements made by the appellant, one is irresistibly forced to the conclusion that, failing any defence susceptible to flow from the evidence, the conduct of the appellant throughout the entire transaction can only manifest an intention either to cause the death of the person he killed or to cause to that person bodily injury known to him to be likely to cause or accelerate death and being reckless whether death ensued or not. In the course of the fight in which both were engaged in the lane, around two o\u2019clock of the night, the appellant gave a blow with his fist to the deceased and the latter fell to the ground; the appellant then kicked him; and knowing that the victim was lying unconscious, in that deserted lane, at that hour of a very cold night\u2014it being four degrees below zero\u2014the appellant removed the coat of his victim, placed a leather belt around his head, running it through his mouth and knotting it tightly behind his left ear; and he then abandoned his Unconscious victim, who was profusely bleeding, with part of his body exposed.\nNo one suggests that without these and all the other injuries inflicted on him by the appellant, Flatfoot would have died that day from any other cause; indeed, the case was pleaded throughout on the basis that the appellant himself caused the death of the victim. It is impossible to say with any degree of certitude to which one of the various injuries then suffered by the deceased death could ultimately be attributed. It is clear, however, that even if the fracture of the skull was, as suggested by counsel for the appellant, the result of the fall to the frozen ground or on some iron junk and that this fracture was the primary cause of death, the victim did not die immediately. He was still alive when the accused proceeded thereafter to tie the belt around his head and through his mouth, to remove his coat and to abandon him in this critical condition of unconsciousness and haemorrhage, in the circumstances above described. In the opinion of Doctor Ross, \u201cdeath was not instantaneous but more prolonged\u201d and exposure was a contributing cause. The large quantity of blood found, in the morning, where the head of the body was resting and which, while the appellant was kneeling close to the victim, permeated parts of his clothes, does not suggest that the circulatory system had immediately ceased to function. Whether the fracture of the skull was caused by the appellant, intentionally or accidentally, what he actually did, once his victim had become unconscious, on the medical evidence accelerated death and there is no place for any speculation as to what his intentions then were if they are to be measured by his actions. This was not an abandonment devoid of significance nor the case of a hasty flight from the scene of the crime. Subject to the consideration of possible defences which might arise from the evidence and assuming, particularly, that the appellant was sane and sober, as he is presumed under the law to have been unless the contrary is shown, there can be no doubt that what he then did is only reasonably consistent with either an intention to kill or to cause to the person he killed such bodily injury known to him to be likely, in the circumstances, to cause or accelerate death, being reckless whether death ensued or not. In Archbold\u2019s Criminal Pleading, Evidence & Practice, 32nd ed., it is stated at page 893 that:\u2014\nIf a man is suffering from a disease, which in all likelihood would terminate his life in a short time, and another gives him a wound or hurt which hastens his death, this is such a killing as constitutes murder (1 Hale 427), or at the least manslaughter.\nIn the case of Edmunds 1, the Lord Chief Justice, speaking for the English Court of Criminal Appeal, said at p. 258:\u2014\nIt is clear that if the injuries accelerated the death, the question whether the deceased was in a weak state of health at the time they were inflicted is immaterial, and that the appellant would be guilty of murder.\nUnder s. 199 of the Criminal Code:\u2014\nWhere a person causes bodily injury to a human being that results in death, he causes the death of that human being notwithstanding that the effect of the bodily injury is only to accelerate his death from a disease or disorder arising from some other cause.\nThe fact that such other cause would be, as in the present case, attributable to the same person who accelerates the death does not, in the eyes of the law, improve the position of the appellant.\nSubject to the consideration of possible defences, whether such a killing by acceleration amounts to murder rather than manslaughter depends upon whether, on the evidence, the case is one within the provisions of section 201(a) (i) or (ii).\nWith respect to possible defences, the trial judge charged the jury as to insanity, provocation, self-defence and drunkenness. These directions are unimpeached by the appellant. It is the defence of drunkenness, however, which in this case, was the defence of substance and indeed, on the evidence, drunkenness was the crucial issue. While it may be said that, when dealing generally with the presumption that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act, certain statements of the charge could be objectionable, the same matter was dealt with again, as it had to be, when the specific instructions were given as to drunkenness and were then related to the provisions of section 201(a) (i) or (ii). In this regard, the following instructions may be quoted:\u2014\nIf you decide that the accused caused the death of the deceased, you must next decide, Did he mean to cause him bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or not? That is, in either case you must consider the accused\u2019s capacity to form an intent, and in the second case, his ability to know that what he did was likely to cause death.\n* * *\nIf you come to the conclusion that the accused was not insane at the time the offence was committed, the question of drunkenness is still a matter requiring careful consideration, because it affects the capacity to form an intent and to know the consequences of his act. This involves a careful consideration of all the evidence relating to drunkenness.\n* * *\nThen, if you decide he was drunk, you must decide if he was, firstly, so drunk as to be insane; secondly, drunk to a lesser degree, but so drunk as to be unable to form an intent about what he did or to appreciate the consequences of his act; and thirdly, drunk, but not so drank as to be unable to form such an intent. Upon any of these points if you: have a reasonable doubt, the accused must be given the benefit of that doubt.\nNow if you come to the conclusion that the accused was not insane or so drunk as to be insane, then you must decide if he was so drunk as to be unable to form an intent to commit the crime with which he is charged. If on a full consideration of the evidence you conclude that he was in such a state of drunkenness as to be unable to form such an intent or if you have a reasonable doubt on the matter, then subject to the questions of self-defence and provocation, which counsel for the accused really left me to deal with and which I will have to deal with, you must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.\nThe judge then reviewed exhaustively all the evidence related to drunkenness and said:\u2014\nIf you come to the conclusion that the accused\u2019s condition of drunkenness did not render him incapable of forming the intent to do what he did, the intent to either cause the deceased\u2019s death, or alternatively, the intent to cause bodily harm and the inability to know the likely consequences, he being reckless whether death ensued or not, then the accused is guilty of murder. If you come to the conclusion that he was incapable of forming that intent, then he is guilty of manslaughter, unless he did what he did lawfully in self-defence.\nAnd at the end:\u2014\nI want to remind you again when the accused came before this Court he did so, as every accused does, with the presumption of innocence in \u2018his favour, and the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is upon the Crown from the beginning to the end of the case. There is never any burden on the accused to prove his innocence. It is not until the evidence is all in that a verdict can possibly be found. If the evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, he is entitled to the benefit of that doubt on every point that has to be decided.\nFrom the verdict rendered, it is evident that the jury reached the view that none of the defences upon which they were instructed was made out. Having particularly failed to find that the appellant was drunk to the extent required by law to support a defence of drunkenness, there was, in my view, no other verdict possible but the one rendered by the jury. Whatever may be the merits of all the points of law raised, there was, in view of the evidence before the jury, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. I agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. The appeal should be dismissed.\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014The controlling question in this appeal is whether the charge dealt properly with the matter of the intent of the accused.\nThe medical evidence presented by the Crown included that of Dr. Ross, a pathologist, who had performed the autopsy. Besides two cuts in the scalp to the bone each 1\u00bc\u201d to 1\u00bd\u201d long and one above each ear he found a star-shaped laceration 1\u00bc\u201d in diameter 1\u00bd\u201d behind the left ear which led to a fracture of the skull 2\u00bc\u201d below. The fracture held four bone fragments covering an area of 1\u00bc\u201d by \u00be\u201d. These were raised or extended \u00be\u201d inside the skull and into the brain which was lacerated and covered with blood. In the doctor\u2019s opinion the fracture was caused by external violence applied from above downwards, a much greater force than would be required for the cuts above the ears. The latter could have been caused by the kick of a boot shown to have been worn by the accused, who admitted having kicked the deceased \u201ca couple\u201d of blows. The doctor did not, however, believe that the stellated wound and fracture had been caused by the toe of a boot. He described the kind of instrument indicated by the form and character of the wound and fracture as having a surface moderately sharp with a relatively blunt point like a small-headed hammer or a very sharp rock. A scarf had been tied about the deceased\u2019s neck, but no evidence of constriction of the neck or of any obstruction to the throat was found. A belt had been fastened around the head covering the mouth or lips and its effect in relation to the death was speculative. The motive behind either the scarf or belt is not clear. An analysis of the blood showed 396 milligrams of alcohol concentrated in 100 milliliters of blood, indicating severe intoxication.\nIn his opinion several factors may have contributed to the death. An exposure to four degrees below zero of a person so intoxicated could itself have been fatal and that cause could have been accelerated by the brain injury. Conversely the contusion of the brain was equally sufficient, and probably aggravated by the alcoholic condition and the exposure:\u2014\n\u2026 the skull injuries were such \u2018that they would render a person unconscious, and being exposed to cold in this manner would result in his death. A high blood level of that level would similarly render a person unconscious and in similar exposure would be expected to cause his death.\nHe could not say which of the two had rendered the deceased unconscious but Mr. Dewar agreed that it could be taken as the fracture. It is not suggested that the other two scalp wounds or the abrasions on the cheeks played any part in the death.\nIt can be seen, therefore, that the vital physical fact was the brain contusion. It follows from the doctor\u2019s description of the instrument which might have caused it that if the deceased had been struck in the face and had fallen backwards on a sharp stone or piece of metal, the fracture could have resulted; and this possibility is strengthened by the direction taken by the violence, downwards and inwards. There was, near the body, in a lane leading to the rear of buildings, a pile of miscellaneous pieces of iron. The accused with the deceased had walked from a restaurant to the lane; two others who had been with them and were called as witnesses, following after, had stopped in a vacant lot 40 or 50 yards from where the body was found and after remaining there ten minutes or so had returned to the cafe. The movements of the accused from midnight until 3.05 a.m. were fairly well covered by a number of witnesses and nothing indicates the possession of an instrument that fits the description given. There was snow on the ground covering the area. The time taken up by the drinking and leading up to the quarrel was not considerable and Mr. Dewar rather stressed the fact that the period between leaving the restaurant and reaching the railway where the. accused entered a box car was within 45 minutes.\nThe charge did not deal with the iron pile as a condition within the area in which the fight had taken place or whether or not the accused was aware either of it or other objects scattered around that could have been the means of such a fracture: and there can be little doubt that he did not realize that such an injury had been suffered. The deceased was a well built man, evidently in good health, probably around thirty-five or forty years of age. The accused is thirty-seven and likewise seems well set up. Both had been drinking beer and alcohol. From an earlier incident the same night, the deceased seemed easily provoked although on that occasion easily mollified. What in fact took place between them was a brutal drunken brawl.\nThe question, then, of actual intent became of the first importance. In the course of the charge, the trial judge used the following language:\u2014\nIn considering whether an accused is capable of having the intent to cause death or of having the intent to cause bodily harm, and being reckless whether death ensues or not, and knowing that the bodily harm done is likely to cause death, we start with two presumptions of law.\u2026 The second presumption of law you have to consider is that every man is presumed to have intended the natural consequences of his acts, and therefore, for example, where one man deliberately shoots a gun at another, an intent to cause death, or at least to cause bodily harm likely to cause death, will be presumed.\n* * *\nThe injury (the fracture) was sustained in the fighting; the accused is presumed to intend the consequences of his own act, subject to drunkenness or provocation, which I have to deal with later, so that if this deceased sustained that injury in the course of that fight, then the accused must be considered to have intended all the consequences of his acts on that occasion, subject to what I will say later about other possible defences.\n* * *\nIf you decide that the accused caused the death of the deceased, you must next decide, Did he mean to cause him bodily harm that be knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or not? That is, in either case you must consider the accused\u2019s capacity to form an intent, and in the second case, his ability to know that what he did was likely to cause death.\nOther passages emphasized \u201ccapacity\u201d to the same effect. In none of them is any distinction made between what is meant by the \u201cnatural consequences\u201d as related to the direct or indirect cause of death in fact and as related to the intention made responsible for death. What the language used embraces is the consequence of death regardless of hidden and unappreciated causes. So stated it means that the legal presumption would hold the accused, because of the illegal fighting, to have intended to bring about the death by the fracture and the injury to the brain, an intention which, assuming him to be capable of forming it, the jury were told they must attribute to him.\nThis, with the greatest respect, confuses the question of causing a homicide with that of attributing to the accused an intent or state of mind. Under the Code as at common law the person whose act with its consequences operating directly or indirectly in fact do bring about a death is looked upon as the cause of it and in the earliest days that itself was sufficient to attract legal responsibility. In the course of years this was modified and under the Code the classification of the stages of homicide leading from the actual cause to the final liability for murder or manslaughter is clearly set out. Section 250 of the former Code defines \u201chomicide\u201d in the sense I have indicated. Next is a subdivision into \u201cculpable\u201d or \u201cnot culpable\u201d, with the latter of which we are not concerned. Culpable homicide is \u201cthe killing of any person either by an unlawful act or by an omission\u201d, s. 252(2), and is either murder or manslaughter. Section 259 proceeds to the definition of murder and in s. 260 it becomes associated as an incidental consequence with the commission of certain other crimes. By s. 252, culpable homicide, not, within those two sections, amounting to murder, is manslaughter, which is therefore the residual aggregate of acts of culpable homicide. The Code following the common law, does not expressly distribute mens rea to all cases of manslaughter; for example, \u201cunlawful acts\u201d still remain a not wholly determined area, the nearest pronouncement being that of the House of Lords in Andrews v. Director of Public Prosecutions 2.\nAssuming that the death here was a culpable homicide, the first and essential inquiry is whether it comes within the two sections dealing with murder. Applicable to the facts, there is, by s. 259(a), the specific intent to cause the death, and (b) that the offender \u201cmeans to cause to the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender to be likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not\u201d. If, in this case, the fracture was caused by the fall backwards on a sharp point of iron, it is not suggested by the Crown that the presence of such a means of injury was shown to be within the knowledge of the accused, much less that he intended to cause bodily injury by that means. Then in s. 260 the other crimes out of which murder may arise are specifically named but they do not include a mutual battery, to which the language, \u201cmeans to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission of\u201d an offence named or his flight thereafter, is inapplicable. Finally s. 261 reduces the act that would otherwise be murder to manslaughter if it is inflicted in the heat of passion aroused by provocation. But in the absence of knowledge of the iron or other object there was nothing to\/bring the case within the provisions of ss. 259 and 260 unless the intent was connected with the blow of the fist or the kicking and, apart from the fact that if these had been done in the passion of the fight an intent to kill would not have converted the offence into murder, that either could have caused the death, a view rejected by the medical evidence, is not contended.\nThe charge then never really put to the jury the substantial defence. If the accused knew nothing of the skull fracture nor existing conditions that coupled with a knockdown could cause it, I am quite, unable to see how anything flowing from it could be considered to be within any legal presumption of intention related to consequences, natural or unnatural. As put to the jury, the only question to be considered was the mental capacity of the accused to appreciate such a sequence of events and such a result, a capacity which I will assume him to have had; but that omitted the vital link of knowledge actual or imputed that could produce such a \u201cnatural consequence\u201d, as well as the intent to bring such an injury about. This, in my opinion, was a fatal omission which vitiated the charge.\nThese considerations deal with what may be called the primary acts which brought about the death. A subsidiary or supplementary cause, distinct and separate from the former, is suggested in the tying of the belt around the head of the deceased, the possible effect of which I have mentioned, and the flight of the accused, thereby abandoning the victim, drunk and unconscious, in a remote spot, in early morning and zero weather. These acts, it is said, \u201caccelerated\u201d the death, as on the evidence they might have been found to have done so, and are to be held themselves conclusively to constitute acts of murder.\nAssuming that flight, after knocking down in a mutual fight a person who, through a hidden cause, is rendered unconscious, can be looked upon as a new and felonious act, and assuming also that the charge sufficiently differentiated between these two groups of facts as independent causes, it is obvious that from the general verdict found it is impossible to say whether the jury proceeded upon the one or the other; and any finding by a court in appeal that the jury must have found guilt on the one or the other might be on that which the jury rejected.\nBut there is still graver objection to such a step. This supplementary conduct to be brought within s. 259 must have been carried out with the intent of bringing about death or was such as to be known by the accused to be likely to cause death and was done recklessly as to its result. It must further be found that before being done there had been time for the passion of the fight to have cooled. That these facts could have been found in favour of the accused cannot, in my opinion, be seriously contested. Nothing of this was contained in the charge and it would be a usurpation of the function of the jury for any Court to make, as we are asked by the Crown under s. 1014(2) of the Code to make, such a finding on this part of the issue.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct a new trial.\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought pursuant to leave from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, dismissing the appeal of the present appellant from his conviction for murder, after a trial before the Chief Justice of Queen\u2019s Bench and a jury.\nThe five questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted are stated in other reasons to be delivered in this matter and I do not repeat them. It is necessary for a proper consideration of this matter to consider in detail the facts which were proven in evidence at the trial. So far as they are relevant they were as follows:\u2014\nAt about 2.15 of the morning of January 6, 1955, the appellant left the St. Louis Caf\u00e9, a small restaurant situated on Higgins Avenue in Winnipeg, a short distance east of Main Street, in company with an Indian, August Flatfoot, and two other men, by name Jorundson and Bard. The appellant and the Indian had been drinking intermittently during the previous evening and earlier that morning. Both had been drinking a mixture of rubbing alcohol and some soft drink and, to the restaurant keeper who saw them at the time, Flatfoot appeared drunk. The four men separated shortly after leaving the place, the appellant and Flatfoot announcing they were going to get some more alcohol and walked together east on Higgins Avenue. Jorundson and Bard said they would wait for them and, according to them, after waiting a few minutes, the other two not returning, they left to go to a place where they might spend the night.\nAt about 7 o\u2019clock that morning the body of Flatfoot was found lying in a lane running east and west, south of and parallel to Higgins Avenue. Macdonald Avenue lies to the south of Higgins Avenue and runs parallel to it and the body was found lying face downward in the snow at the rear of 107 Macdonald Avenue, which is approximately opposite to the rear of 154\u00bd Higgins Avenue. Later that day the appellant was apprehended at St. Malo, a village south of Winnipeg, and brought by an officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to that city and lodged in the jail.\nEarly the following morning the appellant, after being properly warned, made a statement to the police which was admitted in evidence at the trial. When he was informed by Detective Hinton that he might be charged with the murder of Flatfoot, he said first that \u201cIt was self-defence\u201d and then dictated a statement which was taken down by the detective and, after having been read over, signed by the appellant. His statement, after reciting his movements up to the time he had gone to the restaurant and met Flatfoot and the other two, said:\u2014\nGus and me kidded each other along, and then we tossed up for the coffees and Gus lost, so he bought for the four of us. Then we went down Higgins Ave., you know that lot at the back of the terraces there. We started drinking there, then Gus started swearing at me. I guess I swore at him too, and then he pushed me. I got mad and we started to fight. The other two guys walked away. Gus hit me about three or four times. He gave me one right in \u2018the mouth. I got a couple of scratches. I hit him with my left. I got in a few, but I hurt my hand. You can see it\u2019s all swollen. Gus fell down and I kicked him a couple. I guess it was self-defence. Then I fell down, that\u2019s when I got the blood on my pants. I put his scarf around his neck because he was unconscious, and I thought he might get cold. I put the belt around his head loose. I guess I thought it would do some good.\nSome two hours afterwards, Detective Hinton, with another officer, after again properly warning the appellant, asked him what had happened to the coat Flatfoot was wearing and he then said:\u2014\nAfter the fight, Gus was lying on the ground, he had his coat half on, so I guess I took it off him. I put it under my arm. I had it with me in the gravel car. I was using it to sit on and that and I left it in the car when I got off the train.\nWhen brought to the police station on the afternoon of the previous day, the condition of his clothing and of his body had been examined by Inspector Webster of the city police force. The left leg of his trousers was stained at the knee and the underwear worn by him was stained in the same place, and the stains were shown to have been caused by blood. The appellant\u2019s left hand was badly swollen from the base of his fingers to the wrist and there were three slight scratches on his face. There was no evidence of any other physical injury.\nThe body of Flatfoot was lying with the head to the north, the feet being 4 feet distant from the back of a shed at the rear of 107 Macdonald Avenue. The conditions existing at the place were observed by police officers Edwards, Booden and Scott and photographs were taken before the body was moved. The coroner, Dr. Fryer, was summoned, arriving at 7.40 a.m. and, after examining the body, pronounced life to be extinct. He gave in evidence some account of its condition and attempted to estimate the time of death which, he thought, had been some time between 1 and 3 o\u2019clock that morning. The man was not wearing an overcoat, his trousers had been ripped down from the waist to the crotch, both back and front, and his buttocks were partly exposed. A leather belt obviously taken from the body of the victim ran through the man\u2019s mouth and was tightly knotted behind his left ear. The hands were bare and the arms and the eyelids were frozen. It was 4\u00b0 below zero and there was no wind. To what extent the rest of the body was frozen was not stated by the coroner. He observed the wounds on the head which were more closely described by Dr. Ross, a pathologist, who later the same day conducted a post mortem.\nA plan prepared by Constable Scott, from measurements made by him, before the body was moved, showed the width of the lane to be 18 feet. Its northern limit lay 82 feet to the south of the southerly limit of Higgins Avenue, the southerly limit being the same distance from Macdonald Avenue. Billboards erected opposite the place on the south side of Higgins Avenue obstructed the view from that street. The evidence of the constables and the photographs taken by the photographer Allison show that, a short distance to the east of the head and shoulders of the man as he lay on the snow and at a lesser distance to the east of his buttocks, there were large patches of what they assumed to be, and was proven to be, blood Flatfoot\u2019s hair, which was long and thick, was matted with blood which had come from three cuts on his head, one over each of the ears and one at the back behind the left ear, and there was blood on the back of his clothing. Between the place where the body was lying and the rear of the shed above referred to, there was what was described and which appears from the photographs to have been a quantity of metal and other junk, including what appears to be an old carriage wheel, part of a metal bed and some other miscellaneous material. Snow had drifted over the lower part of this junk.\nIn the back yard of 154\u00bd Higgins Avenue, a hat which proved to be that of Flatfoot was found at a distance of 30 feet from his body.\nAround the place where the body was lying, the snow had been trampled. The photographs of the snow drifted against the pile of junk do not indicate that it had been trampled or that there were any bloodstains on it, and there is no suggestion in the oral evidence that there was any blood found on this snow, or on the junk itself.\nThe nature of the injuries to the body of the deceased man was described by Dr. H. M. Ross, who performed the post mortem. Over the right ear there was a cut 1\u00bd inches long, the edges of this were sharp and it had cut through the tissues right to the bone. A somewhat similar cut 1\u00bd inches in length was found above the left ear, of the same nature as the one first described. An inch and a half behind the left ear there was what the witness described as \u201ca similarly-sized laceration except that it was more star-shaped in that it had a number of other cuts coming from it\u201d. Altogether it was 1\u00bd inches across. The examination disclosed in the immediate neighbourhood of this last injury a fracture of the back part of the skull, the bone having been broken inwards. This the doctor described as a depressed fracture of the skull and the brain in that region was covered with blood and lacerated. Dr. Ross considered that this injury had been \u201ccaused by external violence applied at this point above\u2014downwards\u201d. In addition to these very serious injuries, there were various minor abrasions on both cheeks but these were not through the skin and, some of them at least, he considered had been caused some days prior.\nSince the appellant had admitted that he had kicked Flatfoot after the latter had fallen down, the doctor was asked whether, in his opinion, the serious injuries could have been caused in this way. As to this, he said, after being shown the shoes worn at the time by the appellant, that he considered they could have caused the cuts above the ears but, as to the injury behind the left ear where the fracture was, he said:\u2014\nThe toe of a boot I do not believe in one blow could make all the various branches that this particular wound had.\nLater, on cross-examination, he said that he did not believe the skull fracture had been caused by the shoes. It was suggested to him that if a man hit in the face by another fell in a junk pile of iron of various sizes he might receive such an injury, and to this he said it was quite possible. The post mortem was conducted in the afternoon of January 6. Earlier that day, the belt fastened through the mouth and knotted at the back of the head had been removed and this had left what the doctor described as a white mark and a depression on either side of the mouth about three-quarters of an inch wide which, he considered, could have been caused by the belt. Further examination disclosed that the lungs were greatly congested and contained an abnormal amount of blood which suggested to him that death had not been instantaneous. The examination of the blood disclosed a very high level of alcohol and Dr. Ross said he would expect that the man had been suffering from \u201csevere intoxication\u201d.\nWhether the way in which the belt was in the man\u2019s mouth prevented him from breathing through it is not made clear, either by the evidence or the photographs. Dr. Ross was asked as to the effect it would have on causing or expediting death and he said:\u2014\nI detected only the marks. I had no knowledge, other than a photograph I was shown, that there was a constriction about the mouth. In a person dying of asphyxiation, as occurs in a number of unconscious persons when their tongue and the soft tissues fall backwards and block the airway, it is entirely possible. \u2026 The more unconscious a person is, the more likely it is that it could be aggravated by pressure over the mouth. Similarly, if a person were depending on breathing, for some reason or other, by mouth breathing, then similarly that would obstruct it. The determinations [sic] of the tissues in this particular area were such and the number of effects were such that I cannot state that this patient [sic] died only of asphyxiation.\nQ. But it might interfere with him if he were in the depths of a coma?\nA. Yes.\nAnd later he said:\u2014\nIn this precise case I believe that there was some evidence of asphyxial changes in the tissues, but I will not state as to the degree to which they influenced the death.\nAsked for his conclusion as to the cause of death, Dr. Ross said:\u2014\nI felt that there were a number of factors contributing to death in this case. The contusion of the brain as the result of the depressed fracture of the skull would be probably the most important, but I have seen people with such an injury survive for a considerable period of time. There was evidence of considerable loss of blood but I was unable to estimate how much or how severe that was, but the amount of blood in the scalp and the numerous injuries to the scalp would contribute, would be expected to cause the loss of considerable blood. There was the level of blood alcohol, which is a very serious level of alcohol and would certainly aggravate other serious conditions. There was evidence that the breathing would be possibly obstructed to a certain extent and that the congestion of the lungs and the other observations I made in the internal organs would suggest that the subject wasn\u2019t getting all the air into his lungs that he should.\nAsked again as to the effect of the belt on obstructing the passage of air, he said:\u2014\nIf he depends on air coming through his mouth it would interfere with it. If the belt so applied pressed the jaw upwards and caused the soft tissues of the back of the mouth, the palate, to close the airway, then it would, too, but it is difficult for me to state from a picture what would happen.\nWhen asked if a person suffering from such a fracture of the skull and contusion of the brain were exposed to the elements in cold weather what effect it would have, he said that it would greatly accelerate the deleterious effect.\nThe clothing found on the appellant when he was arrested was examined by Dr. D. W. Penner, and the stains on the trousers and underwear were found to have been caused by human blood. As stated in the confession, Bradley had removed Flatfoot\u2019s overcoat and this he took with him on to the freight train which he boarded immediately afterwards, by which means he reached Dufrost, a place on the Winnipeg-Emerson line not far from St. Malo. For obvious reasons, he got rid of this coat en route, throwing it apparently on the railway right-of-way where it was found by the section foreman near Grande Pointe, a few stations north of the point where Bradley left the train. This was a brown tweed overcoat and there were a large number of reddish brown stains over most of the back and the lower half of the right arm as well as a number of stains over the front of the shoulder on the right side, all of which Dr. Penner found to have been caused by human blood.\nIt appears that Bradley had been arraigned for the offence at an earlier date and had been then found mentally unfit to stand trial. At the outset of the present trial the question of whether he was then so unfit was tried and evidence given by alienists and he was found fit. It was undoubtedly because of this and of the fact that the appellant had been drinking heavily that night that the learned Chief Justice felt it necessary to explain at some length in the charge to the jury the effect of s. 16 of the Code and instruct them that excessive drinking might produce a condition such as delirium tremens which, if it existed, might be a defence to the charge.\nThe argument addressed to us on this appeal has invited us, in effect, to consider the sufficiency of certain passages in the charge to the jury as if the affair which resulted in the death of Flatfoot had been limited to the blows which the appellant struck with his fist and which presumably felled the victim. The matter cannot be split up in this way but all of the acts of the appellant above recited must be considered together. A contention that a charge of homicide might be dealt with in the manner suggested to us was recently rejected by the Judicial Committee in Meli v. The Queen 3.\nThe first ground of appeal is a contention that the learned Chief Justice erred \u201cin making a finding in law that the appellant\u2019s participation in the fight was an unlawful act and a crime when the facts were in dispute\u201d. The short answer to this is that the facts were not in dispute and that assaulting another person is a criminal offence subject to exceptions which were fully explained in later portions of the charge. I do not know what is meant by alleging error in treating the unlawful act as a felony. The distinction between felony and misdemeanour was abolished by s. 14 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C. 1927, c. 146). I find no substance in this objection.\nThe second ground is that the learned trial judge had erred in saying that the appellant was presumed to intend all the consequences which might flow from the fight, even though he may not have known that Flatfoot had suffered a fracture of the skull and that he was thus presumed to be guilty of murder, subject to possible defences. The contention is based upon the following portion of the charge:\u2014\nThe accused didn\u2019t have to know whether the injury was sustained in that way. The injury was sustained in the fighting; the accused is presumed to intend the consequences of his own act, subject to drunkenness or provocation, which I have to deal with later so that if this deceased sustained that injury in the course of that fight, then the accused must be considered\u2019 to have intended all the consequences of his acts on that occasion, subject to what I will say later about other possible defences. The charge is to be considered as a whole: the passage quoted is not to be divorced from the context. At the outset, after explaining in a manner to which no exception is or could properly be taken what constitutes homicide, culpable and non-culpable, and reading to the jury ss. 196, 199 and 201(a) of the Code, the learned judge, referring to the expressions \u201cmeans to cause his death\u201d and \u201cmeans to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death\u201d in the latter subsection, said:\u2014\nBy using this expression the Code makes it clear that the person charged must have intended to do the act complained of; that is, he must have intended to cause the death of the deceased or he must have intended to cause the bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death, at the same time being reckless whether death ensues or not.\nAnd later said:\u2014\nWhen we are considering intention, the intention that we are considering here is the intention to commit the crime with which the accused is charged.\nIn a following passage, which preceded the language complained of, the jury was informed that there was a presumption of law that every man is presumed to have intended the natural consequences of his acts and, by way of example, that when a man deliberately shoots a gun at another, an intent to cause death, or at least bodily harm likely to cause death, will be presumed, a statement which was followed by instructions that the presumption would not apply if on all the evidence there was a reasonable doubt that the accused was capable of having the intent either to cause death or to cause some bodily harm known to him to be likely to cause death in reckless disregard of the consequences.\nFollowing that portion of the charge first above quoted, the evidence of Dr. Ross as to the factors which, in his opinion, contributed to the man\u2019s death, and the evidence as to the condition in which Flatfoot had been left by the appellant was reviewed and the jury were instructed that, if they decided that he had caused the death, they must then decide if he had meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless as to whether death ensued or not. Thus the necessity of proof of the intent required by s. 201(a) was again impressed on the jury. Thereafter, the circumstances under which a person unlawfully assaulted may repel force by force, even though he causes death or grievous bodily harm, dealt with in s. 34 of the Code was explained and the nature of the provocation that may reduce what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter under s. 203.\nThe fight referred to in the passage complained of was not intended to refer merely to the blows struck while Flatfoot was still on his feet but everything that occurred up to the time that the appellant left him unconscious face down in the snow.\nWhile the second ground of objection was based upon the passage from the charge to which I have referred, a further passage has been said to be open to a similar objection. The learned Chief Justice dealt at length with the evidence as to the condition of. both the appellant and of Flatfoot as a result of their drinking, apparently considering that this raised the question as to whether the condition of the appellant was such as to render him unable to form the intent referred to in s. 201(a). Following this, the learned judge said:\u2014\nIf you come to the conclusion that the accused\u2019s condition of drunkenness did not render him incapable of forming the intent to do what he did, the intent to either cause the deceased\u2019s death, or alternatively, the intent to cause bodily harm and the inability to know the likely consequences, he being reckless whether death ensued or not, then the accused is guilty of murder. If you come to the conclusion that he was incapable of forming that intent, then he is guilty of manslaughter, unless he did what he did lawfully in self-defence.\nThis language must be read with the instructions twice repeated that they must find that in fact he had intended to cause the death or meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and being reckless whether death ensued or not. It cannot be assumed, in my opinion, that the jury would disregard these specific instructions twice theretofore repeated.\nRead in conjunction with other portions of the charge to which I have referred, there was, in my opinion, no misdirection.\nThe third question arises from a contention that there was error in failing to instruct the jury that if the deceased fell during the course of the fight and fractured his skull on some object \u201cit would be unintentional and could amount to no more than manslaughter\u201d. To so instruct the jury would clearly be misdirection since, if the appellant struck Flatfoot with his fists intending to kill him or cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and being reckless whether death ensued or not, it would be murder and not manslaughter. The point itself illustrates the manner in which this Court has been asked to deal with the appeal by considering only the offence of striking the blows which caused Flatfoot to fall and ignoring all the rest of the evidence. The jury were required to consider all of this evidence in coming to a conclusion on the question of intent.\nAs to the fourth question, the learned Chief Justice had, as stated, after referring to the condition in which Flatfoot had been left by the appellant, read s. 196 to the jury. With this I think no further instruction was needed than that given in the charge read as a whole to which I have already made reference.\nThe fifth ground asserts that there was error in failing to instruct the jury that, if they found the appellant accelerated the death of the deceased, under what circumstances it would amount to manslaughter and not to murder. The question ignores the instructions to which I have referred, which put the questions as to whether the appellant had caused the death of the deceased and as to his intent in assaulting the accused in the manner described and leaving him gagged and unconscious in the snow. There was no error, in my opinion.\nThe appeal to the Court of Appeal was heard by a court consisting of the Chief Justice of Manitoba, Coyne, Montague and Schultz JJ.A. and Tritschler J. (ad hoc) and dismissed, no written reasons being delivered. We are, therefore, not informed as to whether the Court acted on the ground that no error had been shown in the proceedings or under the powers vested in it by s. 592(1) (b) (iii) on the ground that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.\nIf there was error in the charge on any question of law (and in my opinion there was none), the application of that section should be considered. The evidence before the jury may be summarized as follows: the accused had admitted striking Flatfoot with his fists, that the latter had fallen down and that he had then kicked him and \u201cput the belt around his head loose\u201d while the man was unconscious, and had thereafter removed his overcoat and taken it away. He said that he had also fallen down and that he had then got the blood on his pants. The deep cuts inflicted on both sides of the victim\u2019s head had obviously been caused by blows of some nature when the man was prostrate on the ground. The three police officers who described the manner in which the deceased was found lying prostrate, and the places where they observed the snow to be stained with blood, said nothing about finding any blood or any evidence of a struggle on any of the junk a few feet distant from the body or upon the snow with which it was partially covered. In cross-examination, they were not asked any question as to whether there were any traces of a struggle or any blood found on or around the pile of junk. The photographs taken by the photographer Allison, showing the man\u2019s body lying as it was found and and patches of blood already referred to, disclosed no bloodstains on the snow which partly banked the pile of junk or any of the miscellaneous material in the pile. The coroner who also attended before the body was moved said nothing about seeing any evidence of struggle on or close to the junk pile and it was not suggested to him in cross-examination that there was any.\nThe belt had apparently been forcibly removed from the man\u2019s body, one of the loops holding it in place on the trousers and some buttons torn off the buckle of the belt, and the clothing had been ripped in the manner described leaving his buttocks partially bare. The photographs showed that the belt, contrary to what the accused said in his statement to the police, was tightly tied about the head, knotted behind the left ear and passed between the man\u2019s lips holding them apart: Whether the belt completely stopped the passage of air through the mouth or only did so partially does not appear to be clear either in the oral evidence or in the photographs, but it would completely prevent him from crying out. The man had bled profusely from his head wounds and his hair was matted with blood. His hat had been thrown over the fence into the back yard of 154\u00bd Higgins Avenue, 30 feet from the place where he lay. The view from Higgins Avenue was shut off by the billboards to which reference has been made. It was 4\u00b0 below zero when the body was found at 7 o\u2019clock. No evidence was given as to the temperature around 2 o\u2019clock but in cross-examination by counsel for the defence a question was directed to one of the medical witnesses which was based on the assumption that the temperature was the same at the earlier hour, and this appears to be common ground. The man\u2019s hands were bare and the body was at least partially frozen. Flatfoot had not apparently died at once after receiving the injuries to his head since, when his body was moved from the place where it lay face downward, the snow was glazed with ice to some extent, showing that the heat of his body had caused some melting.\nThat the deep cuts on either side of the victim\u2019s head had been caused by kicks delivered by the appellant was settled by the confession since there were no injuries to the man\u2019s body elsewhere than in the head. That a kick delivered by a powerful man to the side of the head, sufficient to cause the deep cuts, would render a man senseless, if he were not already in that condition, would be obvious. Whether these kicks were delivered before or after the wound to the back of the head was known only to the appellant and he elected not to give evidence. While Dr. Ross had at first said, as above pointed out, that he did not believe a blow of the toe of a boot could cause this latter wound and, later, that he did not believe it had been caused by the, shoes, that was a matter upon which the jury were at complete liberty to form their own opinion. There was no evidence to suggest that it had been caused by the man falling backwards on the pile of junk and the only evidence available would seem to negative any such suggestion. In view of the profuse bleeding from the wound, it would inevitably have been the case that had Flatfoot fallen backward on the pile there would have been evidence of that fact to be found in the snow and on the junk itself. The jury might properly assume that if there had been any blood or other evidence of struggle on or around the pile; the police officers, in fulfilment of their duty, would have disclosed the fact and that the photographer would have been directed to take further photographs, and further, that the three police officers, the photographer and the coroner would have been cross-examined to establish the fact that there were such traces, if that were the fact or if that was even suggested on behalf of the accused person.\nThe photographs showed that the belt was fastened so tightly through the man\u2019s mouth and around his head that considerable force must have been exercised in tying the knots behind his ear. The belt could only have been tied tightly in this position while the man lay face downward in the snow. The blood which had saturated the appellant\u2019s trousers around his left knee, and the underwear at that place, was the blood of Flatfoot and it was an inference which the jury might properly draw that the appellant had knelt on the man\u2019s back while tying the knots in the belt and that the blood came from the wound at the back of the skull. The knots so firmly tied, as shown by the photographs, were only a few inches from the place where the skull was fractured. While, in my opinion, in view of the other injuries inflicted and the condition in which the man was left helpless in the snow, it is a matter of no consequence as to whether the appellant did or did not know the severity of this particular wound, the jury may well have considered that since in tying the knots he would be looking directly at the wound (unless, indeed, it was inflicted after the knots were tied) the severity of it would be obvious to him.\nHad the jury concluded that that particular injury had been caused in fact in the manner suggested in argument, that would not of itself have reduced the offence to manslaughter. There was still the question as to the intent with which the blows with the fists had been struck and the intent with which thereafter the appellant had inflicted the cuts on either side of the man\u2019s head, torn his clothing leaving part of his body exposed, knotted the belt around his head, removed his overcoat and left him unconscious in an unfrequented place where it was improbable that he would be found until daylight. The jury, finding that the appellant was capable of forming the intent necessary to constitute the offence of murder, has by its verdict found that he had formed that intent. In my opinion, no other finding was open to them upon the evidence. I find no evidence of any wrong or miscarriage of justice in this case.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014On November 2, 1955, the appellant was convicted before Williams C.J.Q.B. and a jury of having, on January 6, 1955, murdered August Flat-foot. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was heard on February 8, 1956, and was dismissed, at the conclusion of the argument, by a unanimous judgment for which no written reasons were given.\nOn February 27, 1956, my brother Kellock made an order granting the appellant leave to appeal to this Court on the following grounds:\u2014\n1. That the learned Trial Judge erred in making a finding in law that the Appellant\u2019s participation in the fight was an unlawful act and a crime, when the facts were in dispute, and in treating the unlawful act as a felony.\n2. That the learned Trial Judge erred in charging the jury to the effect that the Appellant was presumed to intend all the consequences which might flow from the fight even though he, the Appellant, may not have known that the deceased suffered a fracture to the skull in a fall during the course of the fight and was thus presumed to be guilty of murder, subject to other possible defences.\n3. That the learned Trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the Jury that if the deceased fell during the course of the fight and fractured his skull on some object, it would be unintentional, and could amount to no more than manslaughter.\n4. That the learned Trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the Jury that if they found, under Section 196 of the Criminal Code of Canada, that the Appellant caused the death of the deceased, either directly or indirectly, under what circumstances the Appellant would be guilty of manslaughter and not of murder.\n5. That the learned Trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the Jury that if they found the Appellant accelerated the death of the deceased, under what circumstances it would amount to manslaughter and not to murder.\nAs, in my view, there should be a new trial I will refer to the evidence only so far as may be necessary to make clear the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nThe appellant did not give evidence at the trial and no witnesses were called by the defence.\nThe body of August Flatfoot, hereinafter called \u201cthe deceased\u201d was found at about 7 a.m. on January 6, 1955, in a lane in the City of Winnipeg. A post mortem examination, performed by Dr. Ross, shewed that in addition to some superficial injuries on the face the deceased had sustained, before death, (i) a laceration 1\u00bd inches in length on the head 2 inches above the right ear, (ii) a laceration 1\u00bc inches in length on the head 1\u00bd inches above the left ear, (iii) a stellate laceration 1\u00bc inches in diameter on the head 1\u00bd inches behind the left ear, and (iv) a depressed fracture of the skull on the left side which, in the opinion of Dr. Ross, had been caused by the same force which caused the stellate laceration; this fracture was 1\u00bc inches by \u00be of an inch in size and four fragments of bone were depressed inwards \u00be of an inch; it had caused contusion of the brain tissue and haemorrhage.\nThe post mortem also shewed that the blood of the deceased contained 396 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which, according to the evidence of Dr. Penner, indicates a degree of intoxication which would not infrequently cause a loss of consciousness.\nA statement made by the appellant to the police was admitted in evidence. From this statement and the evidence of other witnesses it appears that the accused was drinking heavily with the deceased and some other companions up to about 2 a.m. on January 6 and that during this time a good deal of rubbing alcohol was consumed. At about 2 a.m. the appellant and the deceased decided to go to Higgins Avenue to get some more liquor. The statement of the appellant as to what happened from that point on is as follows:\u2014\nThen we went down Higgins Ave., you know that lot at the back of the terraces there. We started drinking there, then Gus [i.e., the deceased] started swearing at me. I guess I swore at him too, and then he pushed me. I got mad and we started to fight. The other two guys walked away. Gus hit me about three or four times. He gave me one right in the mouth. I got a couple of scratches. I hit him with my left. I got in a few, but I hurt my hand. You can see it\u2019s all swollen. Gus fell down and I kicked him a couple. I guess it was self-defence. Then I fell down, that\u2019s when I got the blood on my pants. I put his scarf around his neck because he was unconscious, and I thought he might get cold. I put the belt around his head loose. I guess I thought it would do some good. Then I walked over to the railroad tracks, and I climbed into a car and laid down to sleep. It was a half car, open like a gravel car. Then the train pulled out. It should be mentioned that the men referred to as \u201cthe other two guys\u201d were called as witnesses but deposed they had left the appellant and the deceased before any quarrel \u2018 or fight started and, apart from the appellant\u2019s statement, there was no evidence of any eye-witness as to how the deceased received his injuries.\nThe train referred to in the statement pulled out at 3.05 a.m., so that the fight apparently occurred between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. It was a cold night 4 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.\nDr. Ross testified that while the injuries described as (i) and (ii) above could have been caused by kicks delivered by someone wearing the shoes of the appellant, the depressed fracture of the skull could not have been so caused; that death was not instantaneous; that a number of factors contributed to cause death; that the depressed fracture of the skull was the most important cause and that it was quite possible that it might have been caused by the deceased falling backwards and striking his head on a metal object. There was evidence that there was a pile of junk metal in the lane in which the body of the deceased was found.\nIt was one of the theories of the defence that if the jury found that the effective cause of the death of the deceased was the depressed fracture of the skull and that this injury was sustained as the result of the deceased being knocked down by a blow from the appellant\u2019s fist during the fight and striking his head on the junk pile they should find the appellant guilty of manslaughter and not of murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant either (a) meant to cause the death of the deceased, or (b) meant to cause him bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or not (vide the Criminal Code, s. 201).\nInstead of so charging the jury, the learned Chief Justice told them that the accused was presumed to intend the consequences of his own act and that if the death occurred in the manner suggested the appellant was guilty of murder subject only to the defences of drunkenness or provocation. This is made clear by the following extracts from the charge:\u2014\nThen we come to the other injury, the depressed fracture of \u2018the skull, the back part, the left-hand side, 1\u00bd by \u00be inches, and the contusion of the brain beneath. The depressed fracture broken into four bone fragments raised three-quarters of an inch inside the skull, betokening external violence, from outside, either a blow from above down or the skull pushed back against something which it would hit. And it would require a considerable degree of force; that the instrument which would cause it must be moderately sharp to cause it, because it was only an inch and a quarter by three-quarters of an inch, and would have to have a blunted point. A small-headed hammer or a very sharp rock might do it. That an ordinary wood implement would not likely make such an injury, but that if the man fell backwards as a result of a blow, and hit his head against some of the metal shown in the junk pile, that might have caused it. We don\u2019t know just exactly what did cause it. Counsel for the accused suggests that in the course of this fight\u2014and I think undoubtedly there was a fight; and equally undoubtedly, gentlemen of the jury, a fight is an unlawful act and a crime\u2014and that in the course of this fight, I think the suggestion was, that the accused might have hit the deceased, that the deceased might have fallen back on the scrap pile, and that as it was done, if the deceased sustained his injury in that way, the accused might not have known that the deceased sustained such an injury. The accused didn\u2019t have to know whether the injury was sustained in that way. The injury was sustained in the fighting; the accused is presumed to intend the consequences of his own act, subject to drunkenness or provocation, which I have to deal with later, so that if this deceased sustained that injury in the course of that fight, then the accused must be considered to have intended all the consequences of his acts on that occasion, subject to what I will say later about other possible defences.\n* * *\nIf you decide that the accused caused the death of the deceased, you must next decide, did he mean to cause him bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or not? That is, in either case you must consider the accused\u2019s capacity to form an intent, and in the second case, his ability to know that what he did was likely to cause death.\nI still have one or two matters to deal with. If you come to the conclusion that the accused\u2019s condition of drunkenness did not render him incapable of forming the intent to do what he did, the intent to either cause the deceased\u2019s death, or alternatively, the intent to cause bodily harm and the inability to know the likely consequences, he being reckless whether death ensued or not, then the accused is guilty of murder. If you come to the conclusion that he was incapable of forming that intent, then he is guilty of manslaughter, unless he did what he did lawfully in self-defence.\nThe meaning of these passages is not doubtful. The jury are told not that they may but that they must find that the accused had the intent required by s. 201(a) (i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code unless they find that he was through drunkenness incapable of forming the intent mentioned. In my view this was misdirection which is fatal to the validity of the conviction and there is nothing to be found in the remainder of the charge to correct this error. It was for the jury, giving due weight to the rebuttable presumption which imputes to a man an intention to produce those consequences which are the natural result of his acts, to decide as a fact whether the appellant had the guilty intent necessary to make him guilty of murder; and, in particular, it was for the jury to say whether the fracture of the deceased\u2019s skull was a natural consequence of any blow struck by the appellant.\nThe point with which I have just dealt is included in grounds 2, 3 and 4, on which leave to appeal was granted. I do not find it necessary to deal with any of the other questions argued before us except that as to the possible application of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code providing that the Court of Appeal may dismiss the appeal where\n(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.\nIt is unnecessary to refer to the numerous authorities dealing with this subsection. Bearing in mind that it was open to the jury to find that the injuries from which the death of the deceased resulted were sustained in the course of a sudden fight between two drunken men in which no weapon was used and that there was no evidence of any previous ill-will between them, I find it impossible to affirm that a jury properly instructed and acting reasonably must necessarily have convicted the accused of murder. In my opinion it was open to the jury on the evidence to find a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. On the other hand, I am unable to agree with the submission of counsel for the appellant that there was no evidence on which a properly instructed jury could have found a verdict of guilty of murder, and, in my opinion, there should be a new trial.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial.\nNolan J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, dismissing the appeal of the appellant from his conviction for murder, after a trial before the Chief Justice of Queen\u2019s Bench and a jury.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was granted on five questions of law, which are fully set out in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright and need not be repeated here.\nOn January 6, 1955, at about 7 o\u2019clock in the morning, the body of the deceased, August Flatfoot, was found lying face down in the snow in a lane in the vicinity of Higgins Avenue in the City of Winnipeg. The temperature was 4 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The body was clothed in long combination underwear, a shirt, a sweater, trousers, socks, shoes and overshoes, and a woollen scarf was tied around the neck, the knot being under the left ear. The trouser belt had been removed and tied tightly around the head through the lips and knotted at the back of the head. The trousers were ripped down the back and a portion of the buttocks was exposed. The belt buckle was lying on the ground near the body, two of the belt loops of the trousers were torn loose and a third was torn off completely. The deceased\u2019s brown fedora hat was found in a back yard in the vicinity. His overcoat was missing. Dr. H. M. Ross, a certified pathologist with the Winnipeg General Hospital, made a post mortem examination of the body. He found a cut laceration, one and one-half inches long, two inches above the right ear, which went through the tissues to the bone. Dr. Ross was of the opinion that this cut laceration could not have been caused by a fist, unless there was a ring or some object in the hand, but could have been caused by a kick from a shoe. He found another laceration, one and one-quarter inches long, one and one-half inches above the left ear, which was essentially the same as the first laceration and could have been caused, in his opinion, in the same way as the cut above the right ear. He also found a stellate, or star-shaped, laceration, about one and one-quarter inches in diameter, situate one and one-half inches behind the left ear. Dr. Ross\u2019s opinion as to the cause of this wound was the same as for the wounds on both sides of the head, except that he did not believe the toe of a boot could, in one blow, have made all the various branches that this wound had and doubted that simply the toe of a boot could have caused it. There were a number of superficial abrasions on the right cheek in front of the ear, on the left cheek in approximately the same place and on the nose. One incisor tooth was missing.\nThe examination of the head disclosed a depressed fracture of the skull on the left side at the back, one and one-quarter inches by three-quarters of an inch, and four fragments of bone were depressed inwards three-quarters of an inch. The depressed fracture had caused contusion of the brain and was almost below the star-shaped laceration. Dr. Ross was of the opinion that a considerable degree of force would be necessary to cause this fracture and felt that such force might have been applied from above downwards, or by the skull being pushed backwards against some point above. The skull fracture and brain contusion were of such a nature as to cause unconsciousness. An examination of the bones and cartilage of the throat disclosed no evidence of any obstruction or injury, nor was there any constriction mark upon the neck itself.\nDr. Ross stated that there were a number of factors contributing to the cause of death, the most important of which was the contusion of the brain resulting from the depressed fracture of the skull. A considerable amount of blood had been lost. There was a high blood alcohol level and evidence of some constriction in the air supply and exposure. He was of the opinion that the fracture of the skull had been caused by something with a blunt point, such as a very small-headed hammer or a very sharp rock, and that death had not been instantaneous. There were several possible causes of death\u2014alcoholic poisoning, if the deceased were rendered unconscious by alcohol; unconsciousness caused by alcohol, coupled with exposure to four degrees below zero weather. In such circumstances death would be inevitable and would not be accelerated by the skull injury. Death could also have been caused by the depressed fracture of the skull, coupled with exposure. It was impossible to tell whether the fracture or the alcohol rendered the deceased unconscious, or which caused his death. The post mortem examination disclosed that the deceased, with the blood alcohol level of 396 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, would be strongly under the influence of alcohol and would only be able to move about with difficulty. There was evidence that a few feet from the body there were two frozen piles of scrap iron, about three feet high, lying alongside some small, tumble-down sheds, and that, if the deceased fell backwards into the frozen iron, it would be quite possible that he would receive the fracture of the skull in the fall.\nThe evidence discloses that up to about 2 a.m. on January 6 the appellant was drinking heavily with the deceased and some other companions, during which time rubbing alcohol was consumed. The appellant, the deceased and two companions left the St. Louis Caf\u00e9 shortly after 2 a.m. and proceeded east on Higgins Avenue. The appellant and the deceased proceeded ahead to obtain more alcohol and the two companions remained behind awaiting their return. After about fifteen minutes of waiting, when the appellant and the deceased failed to return, the two companions went back along Higgins Avenue to the St. Louis Caf\u00e9 and, finding it closed, proceeded west upon Higgins Avenue to Main Street and left the vicinity. Later that day the appellant was apprehended at St. Malo, a village south of Winnipeg.\nThe appellant made a statement to the police early the following morning, which was admitted in evidence at the trial. Apart from that statement, there was no evidence of any eye-witness as to how the deceased had received his injuries, as the two companions swore that they had left the appellant and the deceased before any quarrel or fight started. The statement of the appellant recited his movements up until the time that he met the deceased and two other companions at the St. Louis Caf\u00e9 sometime after 1 a.m.:\u2014\nI met Gus and two other guys there. I don\u2019t know their names. Gus and me kidded each other along, and then we tossed up for the coffees and Gus lost, so be bought for the four of us. Then we went down Higgins Ave., you know that lot at the back of the terraces there. We started drinking there, then Gus started swearing at me. I guess I swore at him too, and then he pushed me. I got mad and we started to fight. The other two guys walked away. Gus hit me about three or four times. He gave me one right in the mouth. I got a couple of scratches. I hit him with my left. I got in a few, but I hurt my hand. You can see it\u2019s all swollen. Gus fell down and I kicked him a couple. I guess it was self-defence. Then I fell down, that\u2019s when I got the blood on my pants. I put his scarf around his neck because he was unconscious, and I thought he might get cold. I put the belt around his head loose. I guess I thought it would do some good. Then I walked over to the railroad tracks, and I climbed into a car and laid down to sleep. It was a half car, open like a gravel car. Then the train pulled out.\nSome hours later, when asked what had happened to the coat that the deceased was wearing prior to the fight, the appellant, in a further statement, said:\u2014\nAfter the fight, Gus was lying on the ground, he had his coat half on, so I guess I took it off him. I put it under my arm. I had it with me in the gravel car. I was using it to sit on and that and I left it in the car when I got off the train. The evidence discloses that the overcoat was found a number of miles away from Winnipeg along the railroad right-of-way and had considerable blood on the left side in the region of the shoulder and also on the right sleeve. When he was apprehended the appellant had a large bloodstain on his left trouser leg near the knee. His left hand was badly swollen from the base of his fingers to the wrist and there were three slight scratches on his face. There were no cuts, or lacerations, or marks on the rest of his body.\nThe following are extracts from the charge to the jury:\u2014\nCounsel for the accused suggests that in the course of this fight\u2014and I think undoubtedly there was a fight; and equally undoubtedly, gentlemen of the jury, a fight is an. unlawful act and a crime\u2014and that in the course of this fight, I think the suggestion was, that the accused might have hit the deceased, that the deceased might have fallen back on the scrap pile, and that as it was done, if the deceased sustained his injury in that way, the accused might not have known that the deceased sustained such an injury. The accused didn\u2019t have to know whether the injury was sustained in that way. The injury was sustained in the fighting; the accused is presumed to intend the consequences of his own act, subject to drunkenness or provocation, which I have to deal with later, so that if this deceased sustained that injury in the course of that fight, then the accused must be considered to have intended all the consequences of his acts on that occasion, subject to what I will say later about other possible defences.\n* * *\nIf you decide that the accused caused the death of the deceased, you must next decide, Did he mean to cause him bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued or not? That is, in either case you must consider the accused\u2019s capacity to form an intent, and in the second case, his ability to know that what he did was likely to cause death.\n* * *\nI still have one or two matters to deal with. If you come to the conclusion that the accused\u2019s condition of drunkenness did not render him incapable of forming the intent to do what he did, the intent to either cause the deceased\u2019s death, or alternatively, the intent to cause bodily harm and the inability to know the likely consequences, he being reckless whether death ensued or not, then the accused is guilty of murder. If you come to the conclusion that he was incapable of forming that intent, then he is guilty of manslaughter, unless he did what he did lawfully in self-defence. The jury was instructed that the appellant was presumed to have intended the consequences which flowed from the fight, even though he may not have known that the deceased suffered a fracture of the skull, and was instructed that an intent, as required by s. 201 (a) (i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code must be attributed to him. It follows that the only matter left for the consideration of the jury was whether or not the defences of drunkenness or provocation could make the crime less than murder.\nThis was, with great respect, a fatal defect in the charge, because it was for the jury to say whether the intent, as required by s. 201, supra, was to be attributed to the appellant so as to justify a verdict of guilty of murder; and it was also for the jury to say whether the fracture of the skull was caused by a blow of the appellant, or was caused by the deceased falling backward onto a sharp point of iron.\nThe appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed without written reasons and consequently there is no indication as to whether that Court decided the matter on the ground that there was no misdirection, or on the ground that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice (s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code). Nevertheless, it was contended by counsel for the respondent, in argument, that the appeal should be dismissed, pursuant to the powers vested in the Court under that section. I am unable to agree with that contention.\nIt is well established that the burden of satisfying the Court that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred is upon the Crown. In Northey v. The King 4, where s. 1014 of the old Code (now s. 592) was being considered, it was held that, where the irregularities at the trial are of such a nature that there is doubt whether the verdict would necessarily have been the same if they had not occurred, then the doubt should be resolved in favour of the accused. In the present case, in my view, such a doubt exists. The evidence establishes that the appellant and the deceased had, for some hours, been drinking rubbing alcohol and beer. There is no evidence of previous bad feeling between them. Swear-words were exchanged; a sudden fist fight took place, no weapon was used, and the deceased sustained injuries which caused his death. Section 203 of the Code provides that culpable homicide, that otherwise would be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation and before there was time for his passion to cool. In my view, it was for the jury to determine whether, on its view of the facts, manslaughter or murder was the appropriate verdict and there is a doubt, which must be resolved in favour of the appellant, whether the verdict would necessarily have been the same had no irregularity occurred.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Munson & Crawford.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Hon.

On May 9, 1955, the plaintiff secured judgment against the defendant in the Supreme Court of Ontario in the sum of $5,608.40 and costs and a counterclaim was dismissed2. On June 19, 1956, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the defendant in so far as the claim of the plaintiff was concerned, but allowed the counterclaim to the extent of $220, together with the costs of that counterclaim. The defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff his costs of the action and of the appeal.\nOn August 14, 1956, an amendment to the Supreme Court Act was assented to[3] whereby an appeal to this Court lies from a final judgment pronounced in a judicial proceeding where the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds $10,000, instead of $2,000 as formerly. It is clear that, as the judgment of the Court of Appeal was given before the coming into force of the amendment, the defendant\u2019s right to appeal has not been lost; but, as this is the first case in which the question has arisen, it should also be pointed out that the amendment does not apply to a case in which the action was pending when the amendment came into force, even though the judgment directly appealed from was not pronounced until afterwards: Hyde v.

H. Yule, Q.C., for the appellant.\nE. M. Hall, Q.C., and R. H. McKercher, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Nolan J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 2, affirming the judgment of McKercher J., who, in three actions which were tried together, awarded damages against the appellant municipality for having constructed a road which interfered with the natural flow of water and diverted it onto the lands of the respondents.\nAll the lands in question are situated in township 27, range 14, west of the third meridian, and had been cropped without interruption from the time they were first cultivated until 1951 after the construction of the road. The respondent Campbell farms the north half of section 35, the respondent McCallum the south half of section 34 and the respondents Williams and Johnston the north half of section 27, all in the said township.\nThe road in question was graded by the appellant between the years 1948 and 1950. Prior to that time it was only a road allowance in which a few low areas had been filled in. The road runs north and south between sections 2 and 3 in the south and between sections 34 and 35 in the north. The grading covered up a culvert which ran under the old road allowance between section 15 and section 14. No provision was made for the installation of a new culvert. Neither were there any other culverts constructed throughout the four-mile portion of road lying east of sections 15, 22, 27 and 34 until the summer of 1952.\nThe road was built under the statutory authority of The Rural Municipality Act, now R.S.S. 1953, c. 140. In 1948 The Rural Municipality Act, 1946 (Sask.), c. 32, s. 196(1), cl. 9 provided:\n196. (1) In addition to all other powers conferred on councils by this Act, the council of every municipality shall have power: ........\n9. to lay out, construct, repair and maintain roads, lanes, bridges, culverts and any other necessary public work in the interests and for the use of the municipality. A new Act was passed in 1950 (c. 37), which came into force July 1, 1950. The old s. 196(1), cl. 9 is, under that Act, s. 199(1), cl. 10. The wording is identical in the two sections.\nThe cause of action is based on s. 8 of The Water Rights Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 41, which provides:\u2014\n8. (1) No person shall divert or impound any surface water not flowing in a natural channel or contained in a natural bed and no person shall construct or cause to be constructed any dam, dyke or other works for the diversion or impounding of such water, without having first obtained authority to do so under the provisions of this Act.\n(2) If any person without having obtained such authority diverts or impounds surface water not flowing in a natural channel or contained in a natural bed or constructs or causes to be constructed any dam, dyke or other works for the diversion or impounding of such water, such person shall be liable to a civil action for damages at the instance of any person who is or may be damnified by reason of such diversion, impounding or construction.\nIt is common ground that the appellant did not apply for or receive any authorization to build the road in question under the authority of The Water Rights Act, supra.\nThe learned trial judge said:\u2014\nThe defendant did not obtain the necessary authority mentioned in said sub-section one, required to construct the road in question. The water involved was surface water not flowing in a natural channel or contained in a natural bed, and the provisions of the aforesaid Act are applicable in these circumstances to Rural Municipalities in Saskatchewan.\nThe learned trial judge held that, not having obtained the necessary authorization to divert the water, the appellant was liable, and he awarded damages in an amount aggregating $13,100.\nThe judgment of the learned trial judge was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 3.\nIt was established by the evidence and not disputed that the natural drainage on the lands was in an easterly direction to the road and that water so draining was blocked by the road, turned north and eventually emptied onto the lands of the respondents. The actual flooding in 1952 lasted for four days, from April 6 to April 9, and was more extensive than it had ever been before. Three hundred feet of highway were washed out between sections 34 and 35.\nThere was, however, a difference of opinion as to the amount of water which, originating on section 15, would flow onto township 27 in a spring run-off and would ultimately come to rest on the respondents' lands. The witness Webb, a surveyor called by the appellant, was of opinion, after examining the drainage channels and contours, that only about 15 per cent of the water so originating would come to rest on the respondents' lands. The evidence of the witness Webb on this point was rejected by the learned trial judge. On the other hand, evidence adduced on behalf of the respondents, which was accepted by the learned trial judge, established that the flooding originated west of the road on section 15, where the appellant had blocked the natural channels for surface water by the construction of the road without culverts.\nIt was contended by counsel for the appellant in the Courts below that s. 8 of The Water Rights Act did not apply in the case of a municipality constructing roads within its boundaries and with no intention of diverting or impounding water. It is plain from s. 2(4) of The Water Rights Act that it applies to a municipality. That subsection reads as follows:\u2014\n4. \"company\" means any incorporated company, the object and powers of which extend to or include the construction or operation of any works under this Act, or the carrying on thereunder of the business of the supply, utilization or sale of water for any purpose, and includes any person who has been authorized or has applied for authority to construct or operate such works or carry on such business, or who has obtained a licence under this Act; and also includes a municipality and an irrigation district.\nThe appellant also contended that it is inconceivable that the Legislature intended that, after 1935 when s. 8 was enacted, all roads built after that date would have to have special authorization. No question can arise as to the right of a municipality to build roads within its boundaries for the use of the municipality. It has complete authority so to do under the provisions of The Rural Municipality Act, supra. But the question for determination is whether authority is required under The Water Rights Act.\nCounsel for the appellant referred in argument to a number of sections of the Act which obviously do not apply to the construction of a road by a municipality. But does s. 8 apply?\nIn Baker v. The Rural Municipality of Lajord 4, the municipality built a grade on the road allowance and constructed a bridge or culvert in the road. Subsequently the bridge was washed out by flood and on the authority of the council the gap in the road where the bridge had been was filled in with earth. In 1944 the road was graded and was raised another one and one-half feet, making it four feet above the level of the surrounding land. In 1947 the water rose on the east side of the road on Baker's lands and was prevented by the road from draining to the west. Baker's lands were flooded.\nUnder The Rural Municipality Act the municipality was required to keep roads in repair and it did so by filling in the gap. The municipality applied, under The Water Rights Act, for authorization to \"repair and maintain the road as a dyke\". The application was refused, but the municipality did fill in the gap. It was held by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan that s. 8 of The Water Rights Act applied and that the municipality was liable for the flooding because it had not obtained authority to build a dam or dyke for the diversion of surface water. Martin C.J.S. stated at p. 980:\u2014\nThe road then became a dyke or dam which prevented the natural flow of surface water from sec. 24 to other lands to the west.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that \"diversion\", as used in The Water Rights Act, does not mean flooding, but a taking of water for the use or purpose of the municipality. I am unable to agree with this contention. In my view the construction of the road, with no provision for a culvert, turned the drainage water from its natural channel and so brought about a diversion within the meaning of s. 8.\nThe appellant further contends that the road was not built \"for the diversion or impounding of water\" and that no municipality builds a road for that purpose. Nevertheless, if the building of the road results in, what I conceive to be, a diversion of the water, then I think that authorization must be obtained under s. 8 of The Water Rights Act. This is particularly true when it is remembered that the new grade did away with the existing culvert which had previously carried the water from west to east under the old road. In a word, the road became a dyke or dam, which prevented the flow of surface water to other lands to the east, and authorization was necessary.\nThe respondents contended, in this Court, that, although it had not been pleaded or raised in argument in the Courts below, it was open to the Court to give judgment on the common law right of action.

The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 768\nDate: 1956-10-02\nJoseph Wilfred Parkes (Defendants) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1956: June 6, 7; 1956: October 2.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Habitual criminals\u2014Procedure\u2014Impropriety of judge hearing evidence as to previous record before commencing enquiry\u2014The Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 660, 662. The appellant was convicted by a jury of theft. Notice had been served on him, pursuant to s. 662(1) of the Criminal Code, that the prosecutor would ask to have him found to be an habitual criminal. Immediately after the jury\u2019s verdict the trial judge heard representations as to sentence, and had before him a probation officer\u2019s report setting out the appellant\u2019s previous history, including numerous convictions. Before actually sentencing the appellant on the theft charge, the trial judge held an enquiry in respect of the allegation that the appellant was an habitual criminal, and at the end of that enquiry, having found the allegation proved, he sentenced the appellant to preventive detention, as well as to two years\u2019 imprisonment on the conviction for theft. The accused appealed against the finding that he was an habitual criminal, and the sentence of preventive detention.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the sentence of preventive detention should be quashed.\nThe provision in s. 662(2) that an application under Part XXI shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the primary offence, requires that that hearing be opened immediately after the accused is found guilty, which enables the trial judge to enter upon the enquiry without previous knowledge of the accused\u2019s past conduct. By considering the probation officer\u2019s report before commencing the enquiry, and then relying upon it in finding that the accused was an habitual criminal, although it was not proved on that hearing, the trial judge had acted contrary to the provisions of the Code, and the proceedings on the enquiry were a nullity. In the circumstances the appeal could not be dismissed under s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal against a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal allowed.\nE.P. Hartt, for the appellant.\nW.B. Common, Q.C., for the Attorney-General for Ontario, respondent.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The appellant was convicted on June 7, 1955, at St. Thomas, Ontario, by His Honour Judge Grosch and a jury, upon the following charge:\u2014\nThat Joseph Wilfred Parkes, at the Township of Bayham, in the County of Elgin, on or about the 8th day of February in the year 1955, unlawfully did steal one automobile the property of Basil Nevill, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada.\nPrevious to that conviction, an application, with the consent of the Attorney-General, had been made by the Crown prosecutor pursuant to s. 660 of the Criminal Code, to have the accused declared a habitual criminal. This section reads as follows:\u2014\n660. (1) Where an accused is convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the offence of which he is convicted if (a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if\n(a) he has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life, or\n(b) he has been previously sentenced to preventive detention.\nSection 662 enacts certain provisions which apply to applications of this kind, and s-s. (2) says:\u2014\n(2) An application under this Part shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.\n(The italics are mine.)\nIt is clear from the record, that before hearing this application His Honour Judge Grosch, instead of hearing it immediately as required by law (vide Rex v. Triffitt[2]), considered a detailed probation report on the accused, obviously for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed on the theft charge. He then proceeded to hear the application under s. 660, found the accused to be a habitual criminal as defined by s-s. (2). He ordered him to be confined to a penitentiary for an indeterminate period and sentenced him to two years on the charge of theft. The Court of Appeal confirmed the order of preventive detention, and we are concerned only with that particular appeal.\nI am of the opinion that the learned trial judge did not follow the proper procedure in considering the probation report before hearing and determining the application made under s. 660. I entertain no doubt that this report, covering a period of twenty-five years, influenced him considerably in reaching the conclusion that the appellant was a habitual criminal and was leading persistently a criminal life. The latter suffered a prejudice such that I cannot see the possibility of applying s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code. I am not satisfied that the judgment on the application would have necessarily been the same if the provisions of the law had been followed. I would allow the appeal and quash the order for preventive detention.\nRAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the affirmance by the Court of Appeal for Ontario of a determination by a county court judge that the appellant was an habitual criminal.\nThe Criminal Code deals with this matter in s. 662, the relevant provisions of which are as follows:\n662. (1) Notice of application. The following provisions apply with respect to applications under this Part, namely,\n(a) an application under subsection (1) of section 660 shall not be heard unless\n(i) the Attorney General of the province in which the accused is to be tried consents,\n(ii) seven clear days\u2019 notice has been given to the accused by the prosecutor specifying the previous convictions and the other circumstances, if any, upon which it is intended to found the application, and\n(iii) a copy of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or the magistrate, as the case may be; and\n(b) an application under subsection (1) of section 661 shall not be heard unless seven clear days\u2019 notice thereof has been given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or with the magistrate, where the magistrate is acting under Part XVI.\n(2) An application under this Part shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.\nSeveral grounds were raised which were said to go to the invalidity of the conviction, among them the following: that the trial judge had heard evidence of a police record of the accused for the purposes of the sentence on the primary conviction before entering upon the subsidiary charge; that the proof of the prior convictions by way of certificate was defective because they had not been signed by the authorized officer of the court of conviction and that the description of the conviction was insufficient in omitting in each case the name of the court and the sentence given; that in the notice to the accused there was a similar failure to specify the court and the sentence imposed; that the notice failed to set forth the particulars of conduct to be adduced to show that the accused was \u201cleading persistently a criminal life\u201d. The question also of the powers of the Court of Appeal in such an appeal was raised, that is whether the appeal given by s. 667 and the reference in s-s. (3) to the provisions of Part XVIII \u201cwith respect to procedure on appeals\u201d enables the court to deal with the appeal as fully as in the case of an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence.\nI do not find it necessary to examine more than the first ground. Section 660(2) expressly requires that the application shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the main offence. The reference to sentence means before any step is taken toward the pronouncement of sentence and it embraces what has come to be a practice of submitting to the court a record or information showing the conduct, character, reputation, events, and circumstances of the life of the accused. What is the consideration behind this requirement of the subsection?\nThe question has been raised in England in a number of cases. In Rex v. Turner[3] Channell J., delivering the judgment of the court, at p. 363 says:\u2014\nThe facts which are to be proved on the charge of being a habitual criminal are the same as those with reference to which the Court at a trial always desires information before passing sentence, and it is therefore impossible that the Legislature could have intended that sentence must be passed before those facts are inquired into.\nThis was followed in Rex v. Coney[4]. At p. 129 the Lord Chief Justice said:\u2014\nCounsel for the prosecution then called witnesses with reference to appellant\u2019s previous convictions and character, and counsel for the appellant addressed the Court, putting forward reasons why he should not be sent to penal servitude. If that procedure is followed, the jury, and other jurors waiting in Court, may hear all that is relevant about a prisoner\u2019s antecedents given to enable the Court to decide whether a sentence of penal servitude should be imposed. All kinds of statements adverse to the prisoner and relevant to his punishment may be given in evidence in the presence of those who, on different and more limited grounds, may afterwards be called upon to decide whether he is a habitual criminal\u2026 It was never intended that the persons who, upon the particular grounds set out in the statute, might have to decide whether a prisoner was a habitual criminal, should have in their minds all the material necessary to enable a Court to decide whether a sentence of penal servitude should be imposed. In Rex v. Triffitt[5], in which the conviction and sentence on the main charge were made and pronounced by one court and the subsequent application dealt with by another, Humphreys J., speaking of the ground now being considered and referring to Rex v. Jennings[6], quotes the headnote of that case with approval:\u2014\nAn indictment for being a habitual \u2018criminal under the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, must be tried immediately after the primary charge.\nFinally, in Rex v. Vale[7], a case somewhat similar to Triffitt in which, however, only the plea of guilty had been received by the first court, Branson J. at p. 356, dealing with language of Humphreys J. in Triffitt, observes:\u2014\n\u201cFollow immediately\u201d means dealing with the case without hearing the man\u2019s previous history and before sentencing him.\nIn the proceeding before us the police record of the accused was handed to the judge immediately after he had found the accused guilty of the principal offence, and the latter was questioned on it as a preliminary to the sentence. This brought into the mind of the judge the very information the subsection was aimed to keep out. It goes to the substance of the proceeding and is fatal to the subsequent determination.\nOn the other questions I should add generally that there is no reason why a complete description of each conviction with particulars should not be set forth both in the notice given to the accused and in the certificate which likewise should be signed by the appropriate officer of the court of conviction. The grounds of conduct, evidence of which it is intended to adduce to show the criminal life being persistently followed by the accused to the time of the notice, should be furnished by at least general description such as persistence in petty offences, association with disreputable characters and other characteristics of criminal habit, sufficient to enable the accused reasonably to know what he is to meet.\nThere seems to be a tendency to treat a proceeding under the section as one in which strict compliance with the express requirements of the Code is not to be insisted on. That is altogether a mistake. Under such a determination. a person can be detained in prison for the rest of his life with his liberty dependent on the favourable discretion of a minister of the Crown. The adjudication is a most serious step in the administration of the criminal law in relation to which it is well to recall the words of the Lord Chief Justice of England in Martin v. Mackonochie[8], quoted by Meredith C.J.C.P. in Rex v. Roach[9]:\u2014\nIt seems to me, I must say, a, strange argument in a court of justice, to say that when, as the law stands, formal proceedings are in strict law required, yet if no substantial injustice has been done by dealing summarily with a defendant, the proceeding should be upheld. In a court of law such an argument \u00e0 convenienti is surely inadmissible. In a criminal proceeding the question is not alone whether substantial justice has been done, but whether justice has been done according to law. All proceedings in p\u0153nam are, it need scarcely be observed, strictissimi juris; nor should it be forgotten that the formalities of law, though here and there they may lead to the escape of an offender, are intended on the whole to insure the safe administration of justice and the protection of innocence, and must be observed. A party accused has the right to insist upon them as a matter of right, of which he cannot be deprived against his will; and the judge must see that they are followed. He cannot set himself above the law which he has to administer, or make or mould it to suit the exigencies of a particular occasion. Though a murderer should be taken red-handed in the act, if there is a flaw in the indictment the criminal must have the benefit of it. If the law is imperfect, it is for the legislature to amend. The judge must administer it as he finds it. And the procedure by which an offender is to be tried, though but ancillary to the application of the substantive law and to the ends of justice, is as much part of the law as the substantive law itself.\nMr. Common, with his customary fairness, conceded the importance of some of these omissions but took the position that, in view of all that had taken place before the judge including admissions drawn out, some by the judge in questioning the accused on his police record for the purpose of the first sentence, there could not by any possibility be a miscarriage of justice, the ground on which the Court of Appeal acted. For the reasons given, that submission cannot be accepted. In such a case form is substance and if the loose practice followed in the present proceedings were tolerated, the clear intention of Parliament to surround this new and extreme power over the individual with specific safeguards would be nullified.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and quash the conviction. LOCKE J.:\u2014The appellant was on June 7, 1955 found guilty of stealing an automobile, by a jury in the Court of General Sessions at St. Thomas.\nIn advance of this hearing the Crown had caused a written notice to be served on the appellant, which appears to me to comply with the requirements of s. 662 of the Criminal Code, informing him that, if he should be convicted of the charge of theft referred to, an application would be made under s. 660(1) for a sentence of preventive detention, in addition to any sentence that should be imposed for the offence of which he was then convicted.\nThe grounds for the proposed application as stated in the notice were that, since the age of eighteen years on at least three separate and independent occasions, the appellant had been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and that he was leading persistently a criminal life.\nSection 662(2) of the Code requires that an application under Part XXI for preventive detention shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.\nUpon the jury returning its verdict, before proceeding with the Crown\u2019s application a discussion took place between the presiding judge and counsel for the Crown and for the prisoner, which was relevant only to the consideration of the sentence to be imposed for the theft, in the course of which a document entitled \u201cProbation Office Presentence Report\u201d, signed by a probation officer, was handed to the judge by the Crown prosecutor. This report, apparently prepared under the provisions of s. 2 of The Probation Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 291, contained an extensive review of the previous career of the convicted person including information as to the criminal record of one of his brothers, the fact that he had some 22 years earlier abandoned his wife and four children, information as to his general habits and a detailed history of his criminal record said to have been taken from reports of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and covering a period from 1929 to 1954. In addition to convictions for some comparatively minor offences, this report showed that during the previous period of 25 years the appellant had been convicted and imprisoned for not less than 12 indictable offences for which he might have been imprisoned for periods of five years or more. During the discussion that took place, counsel acting for the appellant appears to have admitted three of the four convictions mentioned in the notice served upon the appellant in advance of his trial.\nAfter the appellant\u2019s long and unfavourable criminal record had been discussed, the learned judge proceeded to hear the Crown\u2019s application under s. 660(1). Counsel for the prisoner was asked if he had admitted three of the four convictions mentioned in the notice given to the prisoner and, referring to what had taken place during the discussion regarding sentence on the theft charge, counsel said that he had. Proof which appears to me to be in satisfactory form was then given of the fourth of these convictions which had been made at St. Thomas on July 15, 1952, on a charge of theft preferred under s. 377 of the Code, for which a penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment had been imposed. Other than the evidence afforded by these four convictions during the past ten years, the only evidence given on behalf of the Crown in support of the contention that the appellant was \u201cleading persistently a criminal life\u201d within the meaning of s. 660(2) (a) was that of a police constable who had first seen the accused when he was tried in 1952 on the offence above mentioned and who, when asked as to his general reputation in the community in which he lived, said that it was bad.\nThe appellant gave evidence on his own behalf, saying that he had been trying to straighten up but that whenever he got a job he lost it as soon as his criminal record became known. He was asked as to whether he was convicted of forgery at Whitby in 1929 but declined to admit the fact. He was not cross-examined as to the other convictions which had been referred to in the probation officer\u2019s report, other than in regard to the offence of breaking and entering for which he had been given five years\u2019 suspended sentence in January of 1955.\nPart X(A) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, dealing with habitual criminals, was first enacted in 1947, by c. 55, s. 18. Sections 575A to 575D were taken almost verbatim from s. 10 of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, 8 Edw. VII (Imp.), c. 59. If the person sought to be declared an habitual criminal was first tried for an indictable offence and found guilty by a jury, the issue as to whether or not he was an habitual criminal was tried by a jury. When these subsections were re-enacted in the new Code, this procedure was changed. Section 662(2), in addition to requiring that the application should be heard before sentence was passed for the offence of which the accused had then been convicted, directed that it should be heard by the court without a jury. There was no change in the requirement that upon the application, unless the accused person had previously been sentenced to preventive detention, it was necessary to show that since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions he had been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and was leading persistently a criminal life.\nAs pointed out by Channell J. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Turner[10], dealing with the requirement of s. 10(2) (a) of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, that if it is to be found that he is \u201cleading persistently a dishonest or criminal life\u201d:\u2014\n. . .the evidence against him must be brought down to date\u2014that is the important thing and that is necessary.\nThis applies with equal force to the language of s. 660(2) (a).\nIn the case of Brusch v. The Queen[11], decided under the sections of the Code applicable at that time, it will be noted that the Crown did not content itself with proving the three convictions but asserted that the accused had been \u201cleading a persistently criminal life in that you have been an associate of criminals, prostitutes, drug addicts and have had no regular employment or occupation\u201d, and called evidence in support of these statements. The sufficiency of the evidence in the present matter to justify a finding that the present appellant should be found to be an habitual criminal is, in my opinion, a matter of grave doubt. I, however, do not consider that the present appeal should be disposed of on that ground.\nThe judgment delivered by the learned judge upon the application showed clearly that, in arriving at his conclusion that the appellant was an habitual criminal, he had considered the statements made in the probation officer\u2019s report purporting to cover a period of 25 years prior to the trial. None of this was evidence that was properly before him. Evidence of this long previous criminal record was doubtless admissible on the application but it was not given and, in basing his decision at least partly upon it, the learned judge acted upon matters outside the record.\nIn these circumstances there is, in my opinion, no justification for applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii). As to this, I refer to what was said by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J., with whom Duff J. (as he then was) agreed, in Allen v. The King[12]:\u2014\nIt was argued that the section of our Code, upon which the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal relied, specially provides that the appeal shall be dismissed even where illegal evidence has been admitted, if there is otherwise sufficient legal evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitae.\nWhile the trial referred to in Allen\u2019s Case was before a jury, these remarks, in my opinion, apply with equal force to a hearing such as this before a single judge where the reasons delivered indicate that he relied, at least in part, upon evidence which was not properly before him.\nFollowing the finding made, the learned judge sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment on the charge of theft and, accordingly, nothing further can be done under the application for preventive detention. I would quash the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the direction that he be held in preventive detention.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by FAUTEUX J.:\u2014Whether or not an accused is a habitual criminal and by reason of this fact should, for the protection of the public, be sentenced to detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period, involves an important issue of fact which must be heard and determined according to law. Under the imperative provisions of s. 662(2) of the Criminal Code, the hearing and determination of this issue must take place before sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted. The reason for this order of precedence established in the procedure is to assure the effective operation of all the safeguards which, both by the method of inquiry and by the rules of evidence, attend the trial of any issue and, more particularly, to exclude definitely any possibility that the judge entrusted with the matter be, until it is finally determined, adversely influenced in any degree by facts or representations of which, once an accused is convicted, he may, without the same safeguards, be apprised for passing a sentence.\nIn the present instance, the sentence for the offence of which the appellant was convicted was actually pronounced after the hearing and determination of the issue related to preventive detention. However, prior to such hearing, the judge, for the purpose of determining what sentence he should impose, received from the prosecution and exacted from the defence, in a most exhaustive manner, information of a character highly damaging to the accused. In the result, when the subsequent hearing of the issue related to preventive detention commenced, his mind was no longer free, in the measure it should have been, had the provisions of s. 662(2) been complied with, and the effective exercise of the right which the appellant had, on the hearing of such issue, to remain silent and hold the prosecution strictly to its obligation to prove its case according to rules of procedure and rules of evidence, was thenceforward jeopardized.\nCounsel for the respondent admitted the violation of s. 662(2), attempting however, but in my view unsuccessfully, to show that \u201cno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred\u201d. The trial of the issue conducted in violation of the imperative provisions was wholly invalid and such defect is not one contemplated under the curative provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii). The appeal should be allowed; the finding that the appellant was a habitual criminal and the direction that he be held in preventive detention should be quashed.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.P.

(Ont.), c. 1, ss. 1(f)(i), 2(1)(d)(i).\nA settlor conveyed to a trustee a block of shares in B. Co., to be divided into equal parts for the four children of the settlor. In 1945 B. Co. redeemed the shares, and the trustee purchased shares in G.W. Co. in substitution for them. The settlor died in 1946, at which time the shares in G.W. Co. had greatly increased in value.\nHeld: The value of the \u201cdisposition\u201d for succession duty purposes was the amount received by the trustee on the redemption of the shares in B. Co., rather than the value, as at the date of death, of the shares in G.W. Co. The execution of the trust agreement, coupled with the transfer of the shares, constituted a \u201cdisposition\u201d within the meaning of s. 1(f)(i) of The Succession Duty Act, and by s. 2(l)(d)(i) the value of that disposition was the amount of money into which the shares had been converted during the lifetime of the deceased. The subject-matter of the disposition, or the \u201cproperty\u201d, within the meaning of the clauses referred to, was the shares in B. Co., and not a merely equitable interest in the shares or their proceeds.\nSuccession Duties\u2014Settlement of personal property for benefit of life tenant and remaindermen\u2014Whether life tenant has \u201cthe beneficial interest\u201d\u2014The Succession Duty Act, 1939, 2nd sess. (Ont.), c. 1, s. 1(f)(iv).\nThe trustee under the settlement above referred to was directed to pay the income on each share to the settlor\u2019s child for life, and upon the child\u2019s death to pay the capital as directed in the trust deed.\nHeld: Each child, during his life, had \u201cthe beneficial interest\u201d in the shares (or their proceeds) within the meaning of s. l(f)(iv), and hence payments of income to him were excluded from income by the clause, and were not dutiable. It could not be successfully argued that because of the interests of the persons (as yet unascertainable) who would become entitled on the death of the child, the latter had only \u201ca\u201d beneficial interest, rather than \u201cthe\u201d beneficial interest.\nAPPEAL by the Treasurer of Ontario from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Stewart J.[2] Appeal dismissed.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and P.B.C. Pepper, for the respondents Doyle et al.\nF.T. Watson, Q.C., for the Official Guardian, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal by the Treasurer of Ontario from the judgment of Stewart J.2 which allowed the appeals of the respondents from the statement of succession duty delivered by the Treasurer on October 15, 1952.\nOn December 27, 1941 the late Harry Clifford Hatch, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe deceased\u201d, entered into an irrevocable trust agreement with The Toronto General Trusts Corporation, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe trustee\u201d, establishing a trust with respect to 1,000 preference shares of T.G. Bright Co., Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cBright\u201d, \u201cand such cash and\/or other securities as may from time to time be paid, transferred to or purchased by the Trustee\u201d on the instructions of the deceased. The trustee was directed to divide the trust property into four equal parts and to set aside one part for each of the four children of the deceased, the respondents Mildred Hatch Doyle, Carr Hatch, Clifford Hatch and Douglas Hatch, and to pay the net income from each part to the child in respect of whom that part was set aside. Upon the death of a child there was a gift to the issue of such child in equal shares per stirpes and if a child died leaving no issue, such child\u2019s part was directed to be added equally to the other parts. On January 2, 1942 an additional 1,000 shares of \u201cBright\u201d were transferred to the trustee under the trust, and on January 2, 1943, a further 1,000 shares were so transferred.\nIn May and June, 1945, \u201cBright\u201d redeemed the 3,000 preference shares at par and the trustee received $300,000 cash. There were other assets subject to the trust at this time. The trustee used the $300,000 to purchase 4,000 common shares of Hiram Walker, Gooderham & Worts Limited at $75 per share.\nThe deceased died on May 8, 1946, and at this date the 4,000 common shares of Hiram Walker, Gooderham & Worts Limited still formed part of the trust property and had increased in value to the sum of $558,000.\nFrom the setting up of the trust until the date of the death of the deceased, his children received income from their respective parts of the trust estate, in the aggregate sum of $89,750. On these facts two questions arose.\nOn the first question, the Treasurer asserts that the creation of the trust respecting the shares of \u201cBright\u201d was a \u201cdisposition\u201d under The Succession Duty Act, 1939, with respect to each beneficiary; that succession duty was payable in respect thereof; and that the valuation of such disposition should be based on the value of the interest of a beneficiary in the trust property as of the date of the death of the deceased. The beneficiaries assert that the valuation of the disposition should be made by including, as to each beneficiary, the proportionate part of $300,000 received upon the redemption of the shares of \u201cBright\u201d and not the proportionate part of the value (at the date of the death of the deceased) of the shares of Hiram Walker, Gooderham & Worts Limited which had been purchased with such $300,000.\nOn the second question, the Treasurer asserts that succession duty was payable in respect of the income received in the lifetime of the deceased by the beneficiaries other than Mildred Doyle, who was at the deceased\u2019s death resident out of Ontario; as to the income received by Mrs. Doyle, the Treasurer asserts that it should be included in calculating the aggregate value of the estate of the deceased for the purpose of determining the rate of duty. The beneficiaries take the position that no duty was payable in respect of any of such income, and that it should be excluded in calculating the value of the estate of the deceased.\nStewart J. upheld the contention of the beneficiaries on all points[3] and the Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed his judgment[4].\nThe applicable statute, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d, is The Succession Duty Act, 1939, 2nd sess. (Ont.), c. 1, as amended by 1940, c. 29; 1941, c. 55, s. 37; 1942, c. 34, s. 36; and 1946, c. 90[5].\nThe answers to the questions raised do not appear to be affected by the facts that the shares of \u201cBright\u201d were transferred to the trustee at different times, that other securities were also transferred to it from time to time or that the dispositions in favour of the four children of the deceased were made by means of a single trust document; and it will be convenient to consider, as was done by counsel on the argument before us, the effect of the statute in regard to the disposition made in favour of the respondent Carr Hatch, by the transfer to the trustee of the first 1,000 shares of \u201cBright\u201d. Under the terms of the trust agreement, upon the transfer, of these shares to the trustee the deceased ceased to have any interest in them. The trustee became the legal owner of the shares and was obligated to set aside, immediately, 250 of them for Carr Hatch, to pay the net income derived from such shares (or from the proceeds thereof) to Carr Hatch during his lifetime, not to sell them except on the written direction of Carr Hatch, and, upon his death to divide them equally among his issue then living per stirpes, with special provisions as to issue under 21 years of age and a gift over to the brothers and sisters of Carr Hatch should he die without leaving issue him surviving.\nIt is common ground that the execution of the trust agreement coupled with the transfer of the shares constituted a \u201cdisposition\u201d and that duty is payable with respect thereto. The first question is as to the dutiable value of such disposition and turns upon the construction of s. 2(1)(d)(i) of the Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n2. (1) For the purposes of this Act,...\n(d) the value of a disposition shall be the value at the date of death of the deceased of the property in respect of which such disposition is made, provided that,\u2014\n(i) if such property has been sold for or converted into money during the lifetime of the deceased, the amount of such money shall be the value of such disposition.\nIt is the contention of the appellant that the property in respect of which the disposition which we are considering was made was not the 250 shares of \u201cBright\u201d but was the equitable interest in such shares (or the proceeds thereof) acquired by Carr Hatch for his lifetime and the equitable interests therein acquired by such of the other respondents as are contingently entitled upon his death; that none of these equitable interests had been sold for or converted into money during the lifetime of the deceased; and that the dutiable value to be determined is the value of these equitable interests at the date of the death of the deceased. The argument appeared to assume that the total value of these equitable interests would be equal to the total value at such date of the 333\u2153 common shares of Hiram Walker, Gooderham & Worts Limited purchased by the trustee with the $25,000 resulting from the redemption of the 250 \u201cBright\u201d shares. It is argued that, as generally speaking the scheme of the Act is to levy duty on the person receiv- ing a benefit from the deceased, it is important to ascertain not what property the deceased gave but rather what property the beneficiary received, and that none of the respondent beneficiaries at any time received any of the 250 \u201cBright\u201d shares.\nIn construing the words quoted above from s. 2 of the Act, it is first to be observed that these words contemplate that a disposition will be made in respect of property; it is next necessary to have regard to the definition of \u201cdisposition\u201d in s. 1(f) and the words which are relevant to the question before us appear to me to be:\u2014\n(f) \u201cdisposition\u201d shall mean,\u2014\n(i) any means whereby any property passes or is agreed to be passed, directly or indirectly, from the deceased during his lifetime to any person...\nwithout consideration in money or money\u2019s worth...\nand such means shall include...\n(aiii) any creation of trust...\nReading these portions of the Act together it appears to me that in the case of a disposition carried out by means of the creation of a trust the word \u201cproperty\u201d in s. 2(1) (d) was used by the Legislature as meaning the property made subject to the trust or, as it is usually called, \u201cthe trust property\u201d. As is said in 33 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1939, s. 156, p. 95:\u2014\nIn order to create a trust there must be (1) a declaration which is or can be construed as imperative in its terms; (2) a designation of the subject-matter or property to be affected by it within the limits permitted by law; and (3) a designation of the object or the person or persons to be benefited by it within the limits permitted by law.\nIn the case of the trust deed executed by the deceased the property affected is the 250 \u201cBright\u201d shares and in my opinion it is in this sense that the word \u201cproperty\u201d was used by the Legislature. I am accordingly in agreement with the conclusion reached by the Courts below on the first question.\nThe second question turns on the proper construction of s. l(f)(iv) of the Act reading as follows:\u2014\n(f) \u201cdisposition\u201d shall mean,...\n(iv) any payment during the lifetime of the deceased to any person as a result of the creation of a trust by the deceased, exclusive of the payment of any income derived from any property in which such person had the beneficial interest.\nThe income received by Carr Hatch from the 250 \u201cBright\u201d shares during the lifetime of the deceased was, of course, paid to him as a result of the creation of the trust by the deceased; and it is contended by the appellant that while Carr Hatch had \u201ca\u201d beneficial interest in the shares from which the income was derived he did not have \u201cthe\u201d beneficial interest. It is argued that there are outstanding beneficial interests in the shares in the person or persons, as yet unascertainable, who will become entitled to the shares on the death of Carr Hatch. If this argument is accepted it would seem to follow that the exclusion in cl. (iv) of s. 1 (f) could operate only where the recipient of income under a trust was exclusively entitled to the whole of the corpus from which the income was derived, in which case he could demand the immediate transfer of the corpus, although he might as a matter of convenience leave it in the hands of the trustee. It is difficult to suppose that the Legislature intended to provide for so unusual a situation. In ordinary speech I think that where realty or personalty is settled on A for life with remainders over on his death it may be said that during his life A has the beneficial interest in the settled property. In the case at bar, so long as Carr Hatch lives no one else has any beneficial interest in possession in the shares nor has anyone else any vested beneficial interest in them. The exclusion is, in my opinion, intended to operate where the recipient of income derived from trust property has such beneficial interest in the property as to give him the absolute right to be paid the income. So long as he lives Carr Hatch has such absolute right.\nIt appears to me that to construe the exclusion as inapplicable to the facts of the case at bar would be virtually to deprive it of all meaning; and that to construe it as applicable will give effect to the apparent intention of the Legislature to avoid double taxation.\nFor these reasons I am in agreement with the conclusion reached by the Courts below on the second question also.\nIt follows that I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.D.

Dictum of Trueman J.A. in Eyers v. Gillis & Warren Limited (1940), 48 Man. R. 164, disapproved. The proper rule is that where the age is not such as to make a discussion of contributory negligence absurd, it is a question for the jury in each case whether the infant exercised the care to be expected from a child of like age, intelligence and experience. Mercer et al. v. Gray, [1941] O.K.' 127, approved.\nExecutors and administrators\u2014Right to bring action in representative capacity\u2014Action instituted before grant of administration\u2014Other circumstances\u2014The Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 400, s. 87.\nThe plaintiff sued for damages arising out of the death of his infant son, claiming both personally, under The Fatal Accidents Act, and as administrator of his son's estate, under s. 37 of The Trustee Act. The action was commenced some two weeks before the grant of letters of administration to the plaintiff, and the Court of Appeal held that this fact was fatal to the claim under The Trustee Act, since an administrator had no status to sue until after his appointment.\nHeld: The judgment should be reversed in this respect. Assuming, but not deciding, that in Ontario an action under s. 37 of The Trustee Act could not be instituted by a person in the capacity of administrator before the grant of letters of administration to him, the writ in this action was nevertheless not void in toto, since the plaintiff admittedly asserted in it a valid claim under The Fatal Accidents Act. No period of limitation had expired when it came to the attention of the trial judge that letters of administration had not been granted until after the issue of the writ, and it would therefore have been open to him at that stage to order that the plaintiff, in his capacity of administrator, be added as a party plaintiff. The reason that no steps were taken at that time to regularize the matter was that counsel for the defendant made it plain that he was not raising the point that the action was improperly constituted. In these circumstances he should not now be heard to object on that ground, and the plaintiff should have judgment on this branch of the case. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario 1, varying the judgment at trial. Appeal allowed in part.\nP. J. Bolsby, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW. B. Williston, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014By leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario the plaintiff in this action appeals from a judgment of that Court 2 which had varied the judgment at the trial held before a judge and jury. The plaintiff is Douglas McEllistrum in his personal capacity and as administrator of the estate of his infant son. It would appear that leave was given in order that this Court might pass upon the question as to whether an action for damages under s. 37 of The Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1950, c 400, was properly brought by the father who, at the date of the issue of the writ, had not been appointed administrator. However, in order to appreciate various other questions raised by the appellant, it is necessary to set out in some detail the occurrence which gave rise to the action and some of the proceedings therein.\nOn March 3, 1953, the infant, who had just reached the age of 6 years, accompanied by a younger boy was walking westerly on the north side of McNaughton Avenue in the township of Chatham. Undoubtedly he moved from that position, which was a safe one, to the travelled portion of the highway and was struck by the defendant's motor vehicle which was also travelling westerly. His injuries consisted of a fractured or displaced nose, severe welts on his back, general bruises and internal injuries including a rupture of the spleen which was described as being an extremely painful injury. After removal to the hospital, he was kept under observation and about 10.30 on the next morning his condition began to worsen. About 1.30 p.m. the ruptured spleen was removed and from that time he remained unconscious except for response to deep or painful stimulus. He died on March 8, 1953. The writ was issued September 8, 1953; the statement of claim was delivered September 15, 1953, and in para. 1 thereof it was alleged that the plaintiff was the administrator of the estate and effects of the infant. In fact the plaintiff was not appointed administrator until September 25, 1953, but in its defence delivered September 26, 1953, the defendant admitted the allegation contained in the statement of claim. At the trial when the letters of administration were filed as an exhibit the following occurred:\u2014\nHis Lordship : What is the date of the letters of administration?\nMr. Bolsby [counsel for the plaintiff]: The date of the granting of the letters of administration is the 28th [sic] of September, 1953.\nMr. Thompson [counsel for the defendant] : On that particular point, I do not know what significance it has but this action was started by the plaintiff who is the administrator some considerable time before and before letters of administration were obtained.\nHis Lordship: The writ was issued the 8th of September?\nMr. Bolsby: The date of death was the 8th of March, 1953, the granting of the letters of administration was the 25th of September, 1953.\nHis Lordship: And the writ was issued on the 8th of September?\nMr. Bolsby: That is correct, my Lord, the application was then before the Court. I will deal with any legal arguments in due course.\nHis Lordship: There is nothing in the defence about it?\nMr. Thompson: No, I do not think it is significant anyway.\nMr. Bolsby: Then why fight about it?\nAt the conclusion of the plaintiff's case which included the reading of extracts from the examination for discovery of the defendant, the latter called no evidence. Although the statement of defence contained no allegation of contributory negligence on the part of the infant, presumably counsel on each side dealt with the matter and undoubtedly the trial judge did so. The questions submitted to the jury and the answers are as follows:\u2014\n1. Has the defendant Etches satisfied you that the accident was not caused by any negligence or improper conduct on his part? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\". Answer: No.\n2. Was there any negligence on the part of the deceased Douglas Craig Mcllistrum which caused or contributed to the accident? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\". Answer: Yes.\n3. If your answer to Question No. 2 is \"Yes\", then state fully of what the negligence of the deceased Douglas Craig Mcllistrum consisted? Answer fully: The deceased Douglas Craig McEllistrum was negligent in that he darted into the path of the oncoming vehicle. 4. If your answer to Question No. 1 is \"No\", and your answer to Question No. 2 is \"Yes\", state in percentages the degree of fault or negligence attributable to each.\nDeceased Douglas Craig McEllistrum \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 70%\nDefendant Etches \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 30%\nTotal ........................................................................................................ 100%\n5.

Nil\nUpon these answers, judgment was entered against the defendant for $1,191.21 made up as follows: For the plaintiff in his personal capacity, $216.21 (being 30 per cent, of the amount fixed by the jury for out-of-pocket expenses); for the plaintiff as administrator, $975. In view of the jury-having assessed the total damages under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 132, at $250 (the limit fixed by statute for funeral expenses) and in view of the finding of negligence on the part of the infant to the extent of 70 per cent., the trial judge directed that $75 be paid to the plaintiff in his personal capacity under that heading. The plaintiff was given his costs.\nThe defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal asking that the judgment be varied by re-assessing the quantum of the damages allowed the plaintiff under The Trustee Act, or that a new trial be ordered for the purpose of re-assessing such damages on the ground that the amount awarded was excessive and unreasonable and against the evidence and the weight of evidence. The plaintiff cross-appealed. By its first reasons the Court of Appeal directed that the judgment at the trial be varied and that the plaintiff personally recover from the defendant the sum of $216.21; that the claim of the plaintiff as administrator under The Trustee Act be dismissed without costs; that the plaintiff recover from the defendant $225 apportioned equally between him and his wife ; and that the costs of the action in respect of the claim under The Fatal Accidents Act be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff on the scale of the County Court without a set-off. In his notice of cross-appeal the plaintiff did not clearly say anything about the absence of any plea of contributory negligence but later he served a notice of : motion for leave to amend his original notice by raising the point, whereupon the defendant moved that in the event of the Court granting that permission to the plaintiff, he, the ] defendant, should be given leave to amend his statement of defence by adding a paragraph alleging such contributory negligence. Both of these motions were granted by the Court of Appeal and objection is taken to the action of the Court in permitting the defendant to raise such a plea at that late date. In view of the course of the trial this Court will not interfere with the discretion of the Court of Appeal.\nAfter the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal had been delivered the defendant moved to alter the minutes as settled by the Registrar on the ground that he had paid $1,000 into court in satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim at the time of the delivery of its defence, September 26, 1953. Upon that being brought to the attention of the Court of Appeal the direction as to costs was varied and the formal order provides that the costs of the action until payment into court should be paid on the scale of the County Court by the defendant to the plaintiff and that the costs after payment into court should be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant on the same scale. It was argued that the notice of payment into court did not comply with Rule 310 of the Ontario Rules of Practice and Procedure because, without any order of the Court, it did not specify the claim or cause or causes of action in respect of which payment was made and the sum paid in respect of each claim or cause of action. This question should have been raised at the time and it cannot now be said that the money was not properly paid into court.\nThere is no basis for the plaintiff's complaint of that part of the trial judge's charge to the jury where he instructed them that, if they considered the boy had \"darted\" into the path of the defendant's automobile, they might find that he had been guilty of contributory negligence, because whatever expressions were used in evidence, that was not an inappropriate manner of describing the infant's action. Extracts from the examination for discovery of the defendant having been put in as part of the plaintiff's case, there was no obligation on the trial judge to refer in detail to what there appeared. In his address to the jury counsel for the plaintiff had referred a number of times to the fact that the defendant had not gone into the witness-box or called any evidence. As to this, the trial judge directed the jury:\u2014\nDo not infer anything from that one way or the other; do not infer any liability against 'him or give him the benefit of anything by reason of his failure to go into the witness-box. It is quite proper in the course of a trial and it is not unusual for a defendant not to put in evidence. There is nothing unusual about that. Very often they do but you should not let that influence you in any way any more than you will allow the fact that the plaintiff called a great number of witnesses to weigh in his favour or against him. If you just consider the evidence that was given by the witnesses as they gave their testimony and the exhibits then you will not go far wrong.\nBearing in mind that throughout his charge he made it abundantly clear that the onus throughout was on the defendant no fault may be found with the extract quoted.\nIt is agreed that the trial judge had before him the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Mercer et al. v. Gray 3 that it is a question for the jury whether an infant such as the one here in question was guilty of contributory negligence. There is nothing inconsistent with that rule and the judgment of this Court in T. Eaton Co. v. Sangster 4 where the Court, without calling upon counsel for the other side, dismissed an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario 5 affirming a judgment at trial, from the report of which it appears that the child there in question was 2\u00bd years of age. Nor is it inconsistent with the decision in Hudson's Bay Company v. Wyrzykowski 6. According to the report in this Court the child was 4 years of age while in the Manitoba Reports the age is stated to be 3\u00bd years. In Eyers v. Gillis & Warren Limited 7, the Court of Appeal for Manitoba held that a girl of 6 years could not be guilty of contributory negligence. Whether the result arrived at in that case can be justified is not before us, but the statement of Trueman J.A., speak- ing on behalf of the Court, at p. 168, that it was well established \"that a person of her tender age and inexperience cannot be charged with contributory negligence\" must be taken to be inaccurate. The judgment of Duff J. in The Winnipeg Electric Railway Company v. Wald 8, relied on by Trueman J.A., does not decide the question as to whether a child of 6 years of age is accountable for contributory negligence; in fact he left it open and Girouard and Davies JJ. agreed with him. Idington J. did so hold, but it should be noted that the judgment of Ferguson J. in Ricketts et al. v. The Village of Markdale 9, referred to by him, did not settle the point because, as appears at p. 623, Ferguson J. was of opinion that contributory negligence on the part of a boy under 7 years of age had not been made to appear. The matter is mentioned but not decided in Joseph v. Swallow and Ariell Proprietary Limited 10, where there is a reference to Beven on Negligence. The present view of the law is summarized by Glanville L. Williams in his work on Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence, 1951, s. 89, p. 355. It should now be laid down that where the age is not such as to make a discussion of contributory negligence absurd, it is a question for the jury in each case whether the infant exercised the care to be expected from a child of like age, intelligence and experience. In the present case the trial judge so charged the jury.\nThe Court of Appeal considered that under the circumstances the amount allowed under The Trustee Act was so grossly excessive that it should be set aside. Counsel for both parties had agreed that in that event that Court should fix the damages rather than have a new trial, although Mr. Bolsby stated that his consent had been given on the condition that the infant would not be charged with contributory negligence. The Court of Appeal would have awarded $500 under that heading if it had not concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to anything because he was not administrator of the infant's estate at the date of the issue of the writ. We agree with the Court of Appeal that the jury's estimate was grossly excessive and counsel for both parties agreed that we should fix the damages and we see no reason to disagree with the amount mentioned by the Court of Appeal.\nIn view of the course of the trial, it is not necessary to decide whether the writ of summons so far as it related to the cause of action under The Trustee Act asserted by the plaintiff in the character of administrator was a nullity. Assuming without deciding that, in Ontario, an action under s. 37 of The Trustee Act for damages for a tort for personal injury caused to a deceased cannot be instituted by a person in the capacity of administrator before the grant of letters of administration and that in an action so commenced where no other claim is asserted the writ would be a nullity, it will be observed that in the case at bar the writ admittedly asserted a valid claim by the plaintiff in his personal capacity for damages under The Fatal Accidents Act. The writ therefore was not null in toto. It follows that when it was brought to the attention of the learned trial judge, on October 26, 1953, that letters of administration had not been granted to the plaintiff until after the issue of the writ it would have been open to him, on the view that so far as the writ related to the claim made qua administrator it was void, to order that the appellant in his capacity of administrator be then added as a party plaintiff. At that time no period of limitation had intervened, and the reason that the necessary steps to regularize the matter were not taken was that counsel for the respondent made it plain that he was not raising the point that the action was improperly constituted. Under these circumstances the respondent ought not to be heard to object in an appellate Court, and judgment on the cause of action under The Trustee Act should be entered for $150, that is, 30 per cent of $500. In fact counsel for the respondent did not seek to insist on the point and by letters written after the judgment in the Court of Appeal and again on the argument in this Court offered to submit to judgment for $150 on this cause of action.\nThe appeal should be allowed in part and para. 1 of the formal order of the Court of Appeal, dated November 26, 1954, which embodies the terms of the judgment at the trial as varied by the Court of Appeal, should be amended by striking out cl. (2) and inserting in lieu thereof the following:\u2014\n(2) This Court doth further order and adjudge that the plaintiff recover from the defendant as damages under The Trustee Act the sum of $150.00.\nThe costs before the Court of Appeal will be as directed by that Court. Under all the circumstances there should be no costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: P. J.

The magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction is absolute and does not depend upon the consent of the accused, under s. 467 of the Criminal Code, where the accused is \u201ccharged in an information\u201d, and s. 478, requiring the preparation of an indictment in Form 4, applies only where the accused has elected under s. 450, 468 or 475 to be tried by a judge without a jury. Ship v. The King (1949), 95 C.C.C. 143 at 150, approved.\nWhile it is true that criminal prosecutions must be conducted in the name of the Crown, and not in that of the informant, this requirement is sufficiently satisfied if the information is headed \u201cAu Nom de Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine\u201d. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec, affirming, without written reasons, a conviction made by a judge of the Municipal Court of Montreal. Appeal dismissed.\nAntonio Lamer, for the appellant.\nAndr\u00e9 Tessier, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014L\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 182 du nouveau Code Criminel qui stipule que toute personne qui tient une maison de d\u00e9bauche, est coupable d\u2019un acte criminel et passible d\u2019un emprisonnement de deux ans.\nLe 17 juin 1955, soit apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du nouveau Code Criminel, un juge municipal de la ville de Montr\u00e9al a \u00e9mis un mandat de perquisition, \u00e0 la demande du constable Louis Desjardins, l\u2019autorisant \u00e0 entrer et \u00e0 perquisitionner les lieux occup\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante. Tel que la loi l\u2019autorise (C. Cr., art. 171), apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre rendu compte que la maison en question \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement une maison de d\u00e9bauche, le constable proc\u00e9da \u00e0 l\u2019arrestation de l\u2019appelante. Le lendemain il logea une plainte formelle, et la d\u00e9nonciation fut d\u00fbment sign\u00e9e par lui et asserment\u00e9e devant M. le Juge Henri Monty de la Cour Municipale de Montr\u00e9al. Apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate, l\u2019appelante fut trouv\u00e9e coupable et condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9tenue dans la prison commune du district de Montr\u00e9al durant une p\u00e9riode de six mois. L\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine fut rejet\u00e9.\nL\u2019appelante a obtenu la permission d\u2019appeler \u00e0 cette Cour pour le motif suivant:\u2014\nLes tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs ont-ils err\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant que la d\u00e9nonciation de Louis Desjardins, constable de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, \u00e9tait suffisante sans qu\u2019il y ait un acte d\u2019accusation formel, au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine?\nC\u2019est la seule question que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider pour d\u00e9terminer le pr\u00e9sent litige.\nIl est certain qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019acte formel d\u2019accusation et que M. le Juge Monty a entendu la cause sur la seule d\u00e9nonciation du constable Desjardins. L\u2019appelante soutient qu\u2019il fallait de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 un acte d\u2019accusation \u00e9crit en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 491 du Code Criminel, qui dit qu\u2019un acte d\u2019accusation est suffisant s\u2019il est sur papier et r\u00e9dig\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s la formule 3 ou 4 suivant le cas.\nLes formules 3 et 4 exigent \u00e9videmment que l\u2019acte d\u2019accusation soit au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine. En outre, l\u2019art. 478 \u00e9dicte que lorsqu\u2019un pr\u00e9venu choisit, en vertu des arts. 450, 468 ou 475, d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9 par un juge sans jury, un acte d\u2019accusation selon la formule 4 doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou son repr\u00e9sentant.\nEn premier lieu, on peut disposer de ce grief de l\u2019appelante qui pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9nonciation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au nom du constable lui-m\u00eame, et non pas au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine. La lecture de la d\u00e9nonciation \u00e9tablit clairement le contraire, car elle porte comme titre \u201cAu Nom de Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine\u201d.\nCependant, le juge municipal avait-il le droit d\u2019entendre ce proc\u00e8s sur cette d\u00e9nonciation, sans qu\u2019il y ait eu un acte d\u2019accusation au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine?\nIl est essentiel de ne pas oublier que, dans le cas qui nous occupe, la juridiction du magistrat est absolue et ne d\u00e9pend pas du consentement du pr\u00e9venu. Lorsqu\u2019en effet un inculp\u00e9 est traduit devant le tribunal comme cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une d\u00e9nonciation d\u2019avoir commis certaines offenses, et entre autres d\u2019avoir tenu une maison de d\u00e9bauche, son consentement est immat\u00e9riel (C. Cr., art. 467). L\u2019article 478 ne couvre que les cas pr\u00e9vus aux arts. 450, 468 et 475 o\u00f9 le consentement du pr\u00e9venu est requis pour donner juridiction au magistrat. Il est alors imp\u00e9ratif qu\u2019il y ait, en outre de l\u2019information, un acte formel d\u2019accusation au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine.\nTel n\u2019est pas le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente, et quand la comp\u00e9tence du magistrat est absolue les tribunaux ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il y ait un acte d\u2019accusation formel, et je ne vois pas de motif s\u00e9rieux qui nous justifierait de changer cette jurisprudence constante.\nAinsi, dans Snow\u2019s Criminal Code of Canada, 6e \u00e9d. 1955, p. 409, l\u2019on voit ce qui suit:\u2014\nAn information and complaint in a summary trial case is often used as the formal charge or indictment and care should be taken to see that it properly describes the offence mentioned in s. 467\u2026 Dans Ship v. The King[1] M. le Juge Barclay de la Cour du Banc du Roi de Qu\u00e9bec, parlant pour toute la Cour, s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nWhere the Magistrate has absolute jurisdiction\u2026 \u201cbefore calling on the person charged for any statement which he wishes to make, shall state to such person the substance of the charge against him\u201d, it has been held that it is not necessary under this provision that there be a written charge\u2026\nLa cause actuelle est bien diff\u00e9rente de celles qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante, Woo Tuck v. Scalen[2]; Gaboury v. Gagn\u00e9; Fortier v. Gagn\u00e9[3]; Lavoie v. La Reine[4]. Dans ces trois arr\u00eats la Cour d\u2019Appel de Qu\u00e9bec a justement r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 le principe que les poursuites criminelles doivent \u00eatre prises au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9. Elle a conclu dans les trois cas que les accus\u00e9s devaient \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9s parce que les d\u00e9nonciations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivies par les plaignants eux-m\u00eames, sans la participation du Souverain.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamer & H\u00e9bert, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Andr\u00e9 Tessier, Montreal.\n[1] (1949), 95 C.C.C. 143 at 150, 8 C.R. 26.\n[2] (1928), Q.R. 46 B.R. 437, 51 C.C.C. 365 (sub nom.

The difference in wording between s. 170 and s. 986(4) of the old Code has changed the law as laid down in Laphkas v. The King, [1942] S.C.R. 84. The finding of such a machine therefore gives rise, under s. 170(1), to a conclusive presumption that the place where it is found is a common gaming house, as defined in s. 168, and renders the keeper of the premises liable to the penalties prescribed by s. 176.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec 1, reversing an acquittal by a magistrate. Appeal dismissed.\nDollard Dansereau, Q.C., and Rosario Richer, for the appellant.\nAndr\u00e9 Tessier, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J. :\u2014M. le Juge municipal Pascal Lachapelle a rendu, le 27 juillet 1955, un jugement acquittant l'appelant, d'avoir, le 26 mai 1955, tenu une maison de jeu publique \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, utilis\u00e9e pour l'op\u00e9ration de \"Bingo Pin Ball machines\". Dans son jugement, le juge au proc\u00e8s se base sur les raisons qu'il a donn\u00e9es dans une cause similaire de Roland Beausoleil, pour rejeter la plainte. Ce dernier jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit au dossier. La Cour d'Appel 2 a renvers\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision, et le pr\u00e9venu veut la faire r\u00e9tablir.\nLes arts. 170 et 176 du Code Criminel sont ceux qui s'appliquent dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. L'article 170 se lit ainsi:\u2014\n170. (1) Aux fins des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par la pr\u00e9sente Partie, un local que l'on trouve muni d'un appareil \u00e0 sous est de fa\u00e7on concluante pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 une maison de jeu.\n(2) Au pr\u00e9sent article, l'expression \"appareil \u00e0 sous\" signifie toute machine automatique ou appareil \u00e0 sous\na) employ\u00e9 ou destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre employ\u00e9 pour toute fin autre que la vente de marchandises ou services; ou\nb) utilis\u00e9 ou destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour la vente de marchandises ou services\n(i) si le r\u00e9sultat de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'op\u00e9rations de la machine est une affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'op\u00e9rateur; (ii) si, en 'Cons\u00e9quence d'un nombre donn\u00e9 d'op\u00e9rations successives par l'op\u00e9rateur, l'appareil produit des r\u00e9sultats diff\u00e9rents; ou\n(iii) si, lors d'une op\u00e9ration quelconque de l'appareil, celui-ci \u00e9met ou laisse \u00e9chapper des pi\u00e9cettes ou jetons.\nL'article 176 est dans les termes suivants:\u2014\n176. (1) Est coupable d'un acte criminel et passible d'un emprisonnement de deux ans, quiconque tient une maison de jeu ou une maison de pari.\n(2) Est coupable d'une infraction punissable sur d\u00e9claration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9, quiconque\na) est trouv\u00e9, sans excuse l\u00e9gitime, dans une maison de jeu ou une maison de pari; ou\nb) en qualit\u00e9 de possesseur, propri\u00e9taire, locateur, locataire, occupant ou. agent, permet sciemment qu'un endroit soit lou\u00e9 ou utilis\u00e9 pour des fins de maison de jeu ou pari.\nA l'art. 168 on y voit les d\u00e9finitions suivantes:\u2014\ne) \"maison de d\u00e9sordre\" signifie une maison de d\u00e9bauche, une maison de pari ou une maison de jeu;\nf) \"jeu\" signifie un jeu de hasard ou un jeu o\u00f9 se m\u00ealent le hasard et l'adresse.\nDans cette cause de Beausoleil, identique \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente, M. le Juge Lachapelle a dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nCette machine ne paye aucune monnaie, ne distribue aucune marchandise ou jeton et ne procure au gagnant que le seul choix de jouer l'appareil de nouveau avec un certain nombre de points enregistr\u00e9s tel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9crits. Les possibilit\u00e9s de chance du joueur sont laiss\u00e9es au caprice et hasard fix\u00e9s d'avance par un m\u00e9canisme \u00e9lectronique compliqu\u00e9, et l'habilet\u00e9 du joueur n'y est pour rien.\nEt plus loin dans son jugement, il s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nLa machine sous saisie est certes plus dispendieuse \u00e0 jouer que celle \u00e9tudi\u00e9e dans la cause de Adam 3, mais comme r\u00e9sultat elle ne fait que procurer un divertissement et un amusement au joueur.\nDans la cause de Laphkas v. The King 4, la machine qui faisait l'objet du litige a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e l\u00e9gale parce qu'elle ne faisait que procurer un amusement l\u00e9gitime au joueur en retour d'une modique somme d'argent. Dans cette m\u00eame cause, cette Cour a \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9, qu'en vertu de l'ancien texte du Code Criminel (art. 986(4)), lorsqu'une machine ne vendait que des \"services\", elle n'\u00e9tait pas ill\u00e9gale et que le mot \"services\" avait la m\u00eame signification que le mot \"amusements\". Le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que la machine en question dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, ne faisait que vendre des \"amusements\" et a, en cons\u00e9quence, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'op\u00e9ration de la machine l\u00e9gale.\nJe ne puis m'accorder avec cette conclusion, et je partage enti\u00e8rement les vues de M. le Juge Hyde de la Cour du Banc de la Reine qui, parlant au nom de tous ses coll\u00e8gues, en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une conclusion contraire. Il signale en effet, avec raison, que la loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e depuis le jugement dans l'affaire Laphkas, et que la machine est ill\u00e9gale si elle est utilis\u00e9e pour la vente de marchandises ou services, si le r\u00e9sultat de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'op\u00e9rations de la machine est une affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'op\u00e9rateur. (C. Cr., art. 170.)\nOn voit donc que lorsqu'une op\u00e9ration d\u00e9pend du hasard, et que m\u00eame si le r\u00e9sultat ne fournit que des \"services\" ou \"amusements\", deux mots qui ont le m\u00eame sens, l'appareil est ill\u00e9gal, et la maison o\u00f9 il se trouve est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on concluante \u00eatre une maison de jeu. Il ne fait aucun doute que, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations de cette machine est exclusivement du domaine du hasard, et fournit un amusement au joueur, comme r\u00e9sultat de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'op\u00e9rations. C'est \u00e0 cette conclusion qu'en sont arriv\u00e9s le juge au proc\u00e8s et la Cour du Banc de la Reine. Ceci fait tomber ce genre d'appareil sous le coup de la prohibition du statut.\nQuant au point soulev\u00e9 concernant l'absence d'un acte formel d'accusation, pour les raisons donn\u00e9es dans la cause de Beauvais v. The Queen 5, je ne le crois pas fond\u00e9. Il s'agit en effet d'une d\u00e9nonciation o\u00f9 le magistrat a juridiction absolue, et en cons\u00e9quence, l'absence d'un acte formel d'accusation ne vicie pas les proc\u00e9dures. (C. Cr., arts. 467 et 176.)\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec, cependant, une modification qui devra \u00eatre faite au jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine. Cette derni\u00e8re Cour, comme elle avait le droit de le faire en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 638 (C. Cr.), a suspendu la sentence, \u00e0 condition que le pr\u00e9venu souscrive un engagement, sans caution, selon la formule 28 (C. Cr.). Cet engagement devra \u00eatre souscrit pour la dur\u00e9e d'une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 compter de la date du pr\u00e9sent jugement, et non \u00e0 compter de la date du jugement de la Cour d'Appel.\nRand J. :\u2014The machine in question here, subject to one added feature, can be taken to be as described by the language of the magistrate quoted by the Chief Justice of this Court in DeWare v. The Queen 6. The added feature is that by inserting in the machine not a five-cent piece which will initiate an operation but a sum reaching as high as $1 in coins a chance is created of having the normal scores increased by a quantity related to the amount deposited but dependent on a fortuitous relationship of results in the individual's operations. No person is obliged to make the additional deposit, but the machine is offered for that as well as for its ordinary use.\nThe issue is whether the device is within s. 170 of the Criminal Code. Since the use is entertainment within the meaning given the word \"services\" in Laphkas v. The King 7 and as no slug or token is discharged or emitted, the machine must, if at all, come within para. (b)(i) or (ii) of subs. (2) which defines \"slot machine\" as follows:\u2014\n(2) In this section \"slot machine\" means any automatic or slot machine \u2026\n(b) that is used or intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if\n(i) the result of one of any number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator, [or]\n(ii) as a result of any given number of successive operations by the operator the machine produces different results.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench interpreted the finding of the magistrate to mean that the operations were essentially governed by chance, that whatever the skill exercisable in the control of the plunger or the flippers, there was not that degree which, although probably sufficient to exclude the machine from the category of the automatic, is insufficient to qualify the condition of chance in producing results. This interpretation was challenged by counsel for the appellant who took the finding to be related to the added feature only. But as the section includes \"intended\" as well as actual use this does not help the appellant; and admittedly the bonus operation is pure chance. This brings the case within para. (b)(i).\nI think it should be said that not every degree of influencing skill can be taken to eliminate or modify the contingent nature of results and that the scope for skill should be of such character and degree as to be capable of enabling an effectiveness to be maintained over the average of the unskilled.\nBut the machine comes also within the language of cl. (ii). The results are the scores and different results are different scores. The contention faintly advanced was that \"different results\" are in relation to their nature and not mere dimensions in the same nature; that, for example, different results must exhibit, say, scores, prizes and goods as against differences in scores and that the paragraph does not apply. But I see nothing to support that contention. The scores are the objects aimed at and accomplished and in ordinary parlance they are as fully capable of exhibiting differences as other results provided by these or similar machines.\nA further ground challenged the validity of the conviction in the absence of an indictment, but on this I agree with my brother Taschereau.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gauthier, Dansereau & H\u00e9bert, Montreal.\nSolictor for the respondent: Andr\u00e9 Tessier, Montreal.\n1 (1956), 23 C.R. 318.\n2 (1956), 23 C.R. 318.\n3 Regina v.

A growth was found in the plaintiff's stomach, and a test made by a pathologist while the plaintiff was still in the operating-room showed that it was probably malignant. The defendant thereupon decided to proceed with the operation rather than postpone it for a further (and more positive) test, which could not be completed in less than 24 hours. Because of his belief that the growth was malignant the defendant removed more of the plain-tiff's organs than he would have done if he had known (as was later established) that it was benign.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. dissenting) : The plaintiff had failed to establish even a prima facie case of negligence on the defendant's part, and the action was rightly dismissed by the trial judge.\nPer Rand and Nolan JJ.: A surgeon by his ordinary engagement under-takes with the patient that he possesses, and will faithfully exercise, the skill, knowledge and judgment of the average of the special class of technicians to which he belongs. Where the only question involved in one of judgment, the only test can be whether the decision made was the result of the exercise of the surgical intelligence professed, or was such that (apart from exceptional cases) the preponderant opinion of the group would have been against it. The only evidence given on behalf of the plaintiff in the case at bar failed to establish that this test had not been met. In particular, it was not established that any of the preliminary tests suggested in evidence would have been of any assistance in determining the nature of the growth.\nPer Abbott J.: The medical man must possess and use that reasonable degree of learning and skill ordinarily possessed by practitioners in similar communities in similar cases, and it is the duty of a specialist such as the defendant, who holds himself out as possessing special skill and knowledge, to have and exercise the degree of skill of an average specialist in. 'his field. In making the decision to proceed with the operation, the defendant exercised his best judgment in what he con\u00adsidered to be the best interest of his patient.\nThe evidence relating to certain pre-operative tests which, it was claimed, should have been made, was the only evidence which might be con\u00adsidered as prima facie evidence of negligence. But it fell short of meeting the test of prima facie evidence. The trial judge was right in holding not only that the plaintiff had failed to make out a prima facie case of negligence but that there had been no negligence. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment at trial[2]. Appeal allowed, Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. dissenting.\nD. McK. Brown, for the appellant.\nR. Young, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2011For the reasons given by Coady J.A. (1) this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The defendant in this action is a highly skilled surgeon who is charged with negligence in an operation involving the removal of a stomach ulcer. The negligence is said to have lain in the decision to remove the ulcer as a malignant growth which called for the resection of a larger portion of the stomach, pancreas and spleen than would have been required for the benign growth which it was.\nThe circumstances under which the decision was made were these. On March 26, 1951 the respondent, at that time 67 years of age, was admitted to a hospital at Lethbridge, Alberta. He complained of pains in the epigastrium or upper central portion of the abdomen, was feverish and weak. He had been troubled with periodic indigestion for many years. In 1926 he had undergone a laparotomy to investigate what he described as an ulcer of the liver, the result 'of which was the removal of the appendix. In the next year severe pains in the abdominal region were relieved following another laparotomy by the severance of adhesions. In 1944-5-6-7 he suffered attacks of indigestion extending over a week or two accompanied by epigastric fullness and associated with hunger pains which passed away with eat\u00ading, drinking milk or taking baking soda. Following a pro-longed buttermilk diet in 1947 the symptoms 'of indiges\u00adtion disappeared only to return in January, 1951, but accompanied by pain of a changed burning character. Before 1951 the pain was not accompanied by loss of weight, but between December, 1950 and March, 1951 he had lost between 15 and 20 pounds. His appetite generally was good and he suffered no nausea or vomiting. In the examination that followed a G.I. series of x-ray plates was taken which showed a filling defect of the lower third of the stomach and a presumptive diagnosis of cancer was made. As stated by Dr. Johnson of Lethbridge, \"We were preparing him for laparotomy and gastric resection if possible\" when he decided to return to British Columbia (for other than medical reasons) and there receive atten\u00adtion. The films were furnished him for the use of the British Columbia Cancer Clinic associated with the Vancouver General Hospital.\nFollowing a similar examination in Vancouver a laparot\u00adomy was decided upon, again with the provisional diagno\u00adsis of cancer, \"Cancer seems likely\", and on April 23, 1951 the operation was carried out.\nThere were disclosed numerous adhesions fixing the stomach to the liver, the transverse colon and the pancreas. On the posterior aspect of the stomach a firm annular lesion, adhering to the pancreas, was felt. The stomach was mobilized by a number of transections.\nAt this point some doubt was entertained of the nature of the tumour and the stomach was opened. A large ulcer was disclosed on the posterior wall involving the depth of the pancreas. There was no gross evidence of malignancy. A section of the ulcer was taken out and subjected to what is called the \"frozen\" test, on which the pathologist, Dr. Fidler, called to the operating-room, whose eminence is unchallenged, reported that malignancy was probably present. The radical procedure was thereupon carried out. In the course of it and at the suggestion of Dr. Fidler, a further 2 inches of the stomach was removed than Dr. Wilson had thought necessary. The ulcer was 3.5 cm. in largest diameter and would be described as large. The entire spleen was removed, approximately four-fifths of the stomach and between two-thirds and three-quarters of the pancreas. It is conceded that a gastric resection was required; this meant the removal of substantial portions of those three organs as well as a small and unimportant bit of the liver. The issue is on the decision to remove what would have been called for in the presence of carcinoma. The claim is supported by Dr. Kemp, a general prac\u00adtitioner in 'Vancouver; he is a certified anaesthetist and from 1920 to 1938 was so employed in the Vancouver General Hospital. For a short time he was with the British Columbia Workmen's Compensation Board since when he has engaged in general practice. He has published a hand-book on endocrine glands entitled \"Hormones and Vitamins in General Practice\". He is not put forward as having special standing or competency in any feature of the medical questions raised and his evidence is a statement of what he would have done prior to and in the course of the operation had the patient been his and what, if during the operation, he had been asked by the surgeon for his opinion, he would have advised.\nDr. Kemp puts himself on two grounds: the first that certain preliminary tests should have been made, which would have been of assistance to the judgment when the stomach was opened; and the second that when the actual condition was revealed, the ulcer, on the assumption that it was benign, which he would make \"until it is proved malignant\", (although on another occasion he would still \"have to be shown there was malignancy or the likelihood of it\") should have been removed, -the body closed, the \"paraffin\" test applied, and even perhaps other pathologists called into consultation. If the final judgment was of malignancy, a second operation would then be carried out. These positions will be dealt with in that order.\nThe alleged aids were several in number. The first was the fluoroscopic report of the radiologist in Lethbridge which was assumed to have been made in writing but which does not appear to have been forwarded to Vancouver. It seems to be implied, for nowhere is it expressly stated, that in some manner not clearly described the movement of the stomach observed on the fluoroscopic screen is, in the presence .of carcinoma, of a special nature. That irregular\u00adity in the rhythmic motion might indicate the presence of an ulcer or tumour is understandable; the normal muscular action would be interfered with by foreign growth of a radically different structure imbedded in the stomach wall; and if that is what was meant it would indicate only a test for the presence of an ulcer, not one for the detection of carcinoma, and it would become of no significance once the laparotomy was done. Nowhere is the significance of the fluoroscopic evidence to the character of the growth precisely stated by Dr. Kemp and I decline on such a matter to draw any inference in conflict with the obvious probabil\u00adity of what lay behind the medical conclusion in Lethbridge. Where the difference between the malign and the benign character of a mass of cells is so difficult to appreciate as the evidence here demonstrates, and no competent opinion is given us that the effect of the former on the stomach's rhythmic action is clearly to be distinguished from that of the latter, a circumstance that would end doubt on the presence of malignancy, there is no ground for giving any weight to the contention made.\nThe second omission was that of the use of a gastroscope. This is a very small tube apparatus which, lowered into the stomach, enables one to view the inside of that organ. It was suggested that the device permitted, also, a small piece of the ulcer to be snipped off and subjected to pathological testing. But the use of the device for such a purpose was rejected by Dr. Kemp himself and both features were super\u00adseded by the laparotomy.\nThen it was urged that the hydrochloric acid content of the stomach should have been ascertained. The conten\u00adtion was that the malignant ulcer \"usually\" brought about a decrease in the quantity of that acid. The authority for this was said to be Professor Boyd, eminent in pathology, but an examination of the 6th edition, 1947, of his work on \"Surgical Pathology\", at p. 248 discloses this statement: \"In early carcinoma free H Cl is often present and it may be demonstrated if the fractional measure is used.\" Dr. Kemp agreed that in the early stages it is present in 50 per cent. of the cases of carcinoma and it is made quite clear by reference to other authorities that its presence or absence yields no dependable assistance to the determina\u00adtion of the nature of the tumour. If acid in this case had shown normal, malignancy would not have been ruled out.\nA similar point was made for a test for lactic acid: its presence suggests the possibility of malignancy and it is not normally found in a fasting stomach; but on the facts before us, no inference drawn from its presence or absence would have been of value. The presence of occult blood in the stomach fluid was injected into the same views; bleeding is present in both types of tumour but Dr. Kemp stated his understanding to be \"that minute bleeding is more common in the malignant ulcers\", a statement on its face of no weight.\nAnother criticism was the absence of a blood count. On this Dr. Kemp observed that: \"If one found the presence of a secondary anaemia in the absence of definite bleeding one would say, one would consider that that might point to malignancy.\" A blood count had been directed in the initial report on the examination in Vancouver. On April 26, two days following the operation, the blood count was reported as 81 per cent. haemoglobin which he agreed was not a significant anaemia.\nThese items exhibit in a striking manner the character and substance of his suggestions. It was in relation largely to his own physical condition and treatment that he has had medical experience of some of these tests. As a witness, he is in the position of the ordinary practitioner, who, for the purpose of giving evidence, consults work of specialists, as Dr. Kemp had done, and voices the findings or opinions they set forth. For example, in speaking of the location of ulcers, he had expressed the view that the \"prepyloric was the most certain location for a malignant ulcer\": this proved to be an opinion given him by a local surgeon and he admitted having no view of his own on the question at all. It is a matter of textbook or verbalized knowledge unsupported by habituated professional experience. He has been associated with no case nor was any mentioned in which there was what he claimed should have been the procedure to be followed, a partial resection completed pending a determination of the nature of the ulcer removed, the operation, if malignancy was found, to be renewed. The confident assertions of what he would have advised if his opinion had been asked, or would have done if the patient had been his, rest upon no experience in the application of the ideas so freely but imprecisely dealt with, and they lack that obvious professional caution which is a distinctive mark of a highly qualified specialist.\nDr. Kemp attacked the opinion of Dr. Fidler on the \"frozen\" test-made during the operation-that there was \"probable\" linitis plastica. This type of carcinoma was declared by him to be a diffused infiltration of the walls of the stomach as distinguished from involvement with an ulcer and he rejected the possibility that such an ulcer as that here could be so classified. On a number of relevant matters, however, he was either uninformed or misinformed. For example, he mistakenly thought DX. Fidler had never had the gross specimen in his hands; he had overlooked in the doctor's report reference to a thickened mucosa around the ulcer which extended to the pylorus in the region of which the mucosa was much injected. He called Professor Boyd in aid of his view that linitis plastica was slow-growing and when nothing of that sort appeared switched, as his authority, to his early teacher of pathology. He was unfamiliar with different forms of linitis plastica carcinoma. Professor Boyd speaks of two, diffused and local, the latter at the pylorus. Dr. Bockus of the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Medicine speaks of varieties of linitis plastica as \"the cir\u00adcumscribed and the diffused. The circumscribed type may simulate an ulcer in its gross appearance if surface destruc\u00adtion keeps pace with the growth, producing an actual ulcer defect on the x-ray films\"; and \"This is a common type of so-called ulcerating carcinoma which simulates benign gas\u00adtric ulcer roentgeno-graphically.\"\nDr. Kemp was not aware that, in addition to polypoid, ulcerated, ulcer-like carcinomas with diffused infiltration into the neighbouring wall of the stomach, and extensively diffused carcinomas with a more or less uniform thickening of the whole or part of the stomach wall, there was a mixed type in which various combinations of the four types are found. He disclaimed any suggestion that Dr. Fidler was not justified in his opinion that the ulcer was probably malignant; but still he would not agree with the diagnosis for the reason that the picture described by Dr. Fidler \"could have been one of inflammation\". If such an infer\u00adence were possible, that it would not have been drawn by either Dr. Fidler or Dr. Wilson needs no comment. He added that the difference between the scirrhous or infil\u00adtrating tissue produced by inflammation and new growth or carcinoma tissue is \"very, very difficult to distinguish under a microscope\". I have dealt with his evidence in some detail because it is the foundation of the argument before us. I can only describe the opinions which it embodies as a collection of elementary views on the diagnosis of cancer by one who is a virtual stranger to the exercise of such a medical and surgical judgment. Dr. Kemp nowhere intimates that sur\u00adgeons of the rank of Dr. Wilson would, in the circumstances here, have followed the course he outlined or that any con\u00adsiderable number of them would not have clone what Dr. Wilson did. The latter admittedly executed the surgery with consummate technique, and admittedly acted in all according to his best judgment formed deliberately. Admit\u00adtedly Dr. Fidler stands at the highest level of pathologists. If under the microscope-which reaches nearest to certainty in detecting malignancy-the interpretation could be erroneous, what significance could tests have which can give the same result in either type of tumour? On the basis of what appears in the case, I should say none whatever.\nDr. Palmer was accepted by Dr. Kemp as of outstanding competency. He focused in its real dimensions the question that faced Dr. Wilson. The alternatives were to postpone the larger excision and run the risk of postoperative com\u00adplications-which actually followed-and the serious pos\u00adsibility of aggravating the activity of a malignancy, or to act on his own and Dr. Fidler's best judgment. The removal of the larger sections of the organs, while impor\u00adtant, was not a vital circumstance. The respondent made a good recovery and as Dr. Palmer put it, the difference between impairment to the bodily health of the effects of the admittedly necessary resection and that carried out can be disregarded where there is good cause for it. Such a cause was faced in the avoidance of action that might have had fatal results to the respondent.\nIn the presence of such a delicate balance of factors, the surgeon is placed in a situation of extreme difficulty; whatever is done runs many hazards from causes which may only be guessed at; what standard does the law require of him in meeting it? What the surgeon by his ordinary engagement undertakes with the patient is that he possesses the skill knowledge and judgment of the generality or average of the special group or class of technicians to which he belongs and will faithfully exercise them. In a given situation some may differ from others in that exercise, depending on the significance they attribute to the different factors in the light of their own experience. The dynamics of the human body of each individual are themselves individual and there are lines of doubt and uncertainty at which a clear course of action may be precluded.\nThere is here only the question of judgment; what of that? The test can be no more than this: was the decision the result of the exercise of the surgical intelligence pro\u00adfessed? Or was what was done such that, disregarding it may be the exceptional case or individual, in all the circum\u00adstances, at least the preponderant opinion of the group would have been against it? If a substantial opinion con-firms it, there is no breach or failure. No attempt has been made to show that the operation as completed was not within those limits. The only express evidence we have is that of Dr. Palmer who approved it; but there is the approval by action of Dr. Fidler as well as of Dr. Wilson himself. Dr. Kemp did not-and properly-pretend to suggest the mode of meeting the situation of anyone but himself.\nAn error in judgment has long been distinguished from an act of unskilfulness or carelessness or due to lack of knowledge. Although universally-accepted procedures must be observed, they furnish little or no assistance in resolving such a predicament as faced the surgeon here. In such a situation a decision must be made without delay based on limited known and unknown factors; and the honest and intelligent exercise of judgment has long been recognized as satisfying the professional obligation.\nIn Rann v. Twitchell[3], the following language is used:\u2011\nHe is not to be judged by the result, nor is he to Be held liable for an error of judgment. His negligence is to be determined by reference to the pertinent facts existing at the time of his examination and treatment, of which he knew, or in the exercise of due care, should have known. It may consist in a failure to apply the proper remedy upon a correct deter\u00admination of existing physical conditions, or it may precede that and result from a failure properly to inform himself of these conditions. If the latter, then it must appear that he had a reasonable opportunity for examination and that the true physical conditions were so apparent that they could have been ascertained by the exercise of the required degree of 'care and skill. For, if a determination of these physical facts resolves itself into a question of judgment merely, he cannot be held liable for his error.\nThis was approved in Green v. Stone[4]. In DuBois v. Decker[5], a qualification is introduced:\u2011\nWe are aware that he claimed to have waited ten days before operating, for the purpose of seeing whether the foot could not be saved, and that a physician and surgeon will not be held liable for mere errors in judgment. But his judgment must be founded upon his intelligence. He engages to bring to the treatment of his patient care, skill and knowledge, and he should have known the probable consequences that would follow from the crushing of the bones and tissues of the foot.\nIn M'Clallen v. Adams[6], Shaw C.J. deals with this feature:\u2011\nThe performance of this operation being within the scope of the plaintiff's authority, if in his judgment necessary or expedient, and that it was so, is to be presumed from the fact, it was not necessary for him to prove to the satisfaction of the jury, that it was necessary and proper, under the circumstances... .\nIn 1853 the Superior Court of New Hampshire in Leighton v. Sargent[7], following the general principles on the pro\u00adfessional undertaking enunciated by Tindal C.J. in Lanphier v. Phipos[8], and in the many other English authorities cited, observed, on the matter of judgment:\u2011\nTo charge a physician or surgeon with damages, on the ground of unskilful or negligent treatment of his patient's case, it is never enough to show that he has not treated his patient in that mode, nor used those measures, which in the opinion of others, even medical men, the case required; because such evidence tends to prove errors of judgment, for which the defendant is not responsible, as much as the want of reasonable care and skill, for which he may be responsible.\nThese statements articulate what is in fact the actual or mutually understood though unexpressed undertaking of the specialist in surgery and they are cited because they deal specifically with the element involved here, judgment.\nIn reaching this conclusion I have not overlooked the difficulty on occasion of obtaining critical opinions in such matters from those qualified to give them. But throughout this unfortunate episode, Dr. Wilson was most candid and every facility was furnished to the respondent to make the most searching enquiry into the facts. Dr. Wilson was sub\u00adjected to an exhaustive examination for discovery, many portions of which were put in evidence. Dr. Rose of Leth\u00adbridge was examined de bene esse and the respondent had the benefit of that before trial. Dr. Wilson as soon as the final report of the pathologist was received, himself con\u00adveyed to the respondent, then still in the hospital, its finding,\nIt is these circumstances and the fullness in which the case is before us that overbear the view expressed in the Court of Appeal that such an error called for a thorough explanation which-because no evidence was adduced by the defence-it did not receive. The onus was on the plain-tiff to establish negligence; the entire facts are before us; nothing could have been added except opinions. There was no obligation on Dr. Wilson personally to support the means he took: a sensitive person might very well prefer to leave his conduct to the judgment of others. That he expressed his own opinion on discovery can be assumed and whatever was considered helpful to the respondent was read against him.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judg\u00adment at trial with costs in both courts.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2011My consideration of the evi\u00addence in this matter leads me to the same conclusion as that reached by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal[9]. I respectfully agree with the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Coady.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nABBOTT J.:\u2011This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[10] reversing the judgment of the Supreme 'Court of British Columbia[11], which had dismissed respondent's action in which he had sued appellant for alleged medical malpractice.\nThe respondent, who had had stomach trouble off and on for some years, in March 1951 (prior to which date this stomach trouble appears to have become aggravated), went to a medical clinic in Lethbridge, Alberta, of which one member was a Dr. Johnson. He was placed in Galt Hos\u00adpital in Lethbridge where he was examined by Dr. Johnson and remained under observation for 16 days, until April 11, 1951. The respondent was x-rayed and fluoroscoped, and this examination revealed that he had a large filling defect on the rear wall of the stomach. He was told that he most likely had stomach cancer and an exploratory operation was recommended.\nThe respondent, either because he was unwilling to accept this diagnosis as definitive or because he preferred to have further treatment and advice in British Columbia where his home was, came to Vancouver with the x-ray films taken in Galt Hospital and a letter from Dr. Johnson to the British Columbia Cancer Institute. He visited the cancer institute on April 13, 1951, delivered the x-ray films and Dr. Johnson's letter, and was examined by Dr. Craw-ford and another doctor of that institute. So far as the record discloses, the respondent did not bring with him any report of the Lethbridge radiologist who had made the x-ray examination. That same day he was also examined by Dr. Wilson, the appellant, in Dr. Crawford's presence. As a result of his own examination, a consideration of the x-rays, Dr. Johnson's letter, and the report of Dr. Craw-ford's examination, Dr. Wilson diagnosed probable cancer of the stomach and recommended an exploratory operation and the removal of the growth, if it was operable.\nSome 10 days elapsed before respondent entered the Vancouver General Hospital where a room had been reserved for him by appellant. On entering the hospital he was also examined by an interne, Dr. Lambert, who diagnosed probable stomach cancer.\nNo further x-ray examination was made after respond\u00adent's arrival at Vancouver nor do any other special blood-tests or tests concerning the stomach area appear to have been made prior to the operation.\nThe operation took place on April 24, 1951, and after opening the abdomen and mobilizing the stomach, the sur\u00adgeon could feel the lesion on the rear wall of the stomach, confirmed that it was a large one which it was necessary to remove and that it was attached to the pancreas. Up to this point he still considered the lesion was probably can\u00adcerous and decided it would be necessary to open the stomach and view the lesion itself. This was done. At this stage in the operation, after viewing the lesion, the surgeon entertained some doubt as to whether it might be benign rather than cancerous; he therefore sent for the hospital's chief pathologist Dr. Fidler, and after removing a small portion of the lesion, a lymph-node and adjoining tissue, gave it to the pathologist for a pathological test known as a frozen section. This test, although admittedly not conclusive, can be completed in 15 to 20 minutes. It should be mentioned here, that it is in evidence that a con\u00adclusive test could not be made in less than some 24 hours. The pathologist reported that in his opinion the lesion was probably malign, of a type known as linitis plastica. Appel\u00adlant then removed a major part of the stomach, including all of the lesion, and handed it to the pathologist who, on examination, reiterated his opinion that it was probably malignant and suggested that a somewhat larger portion of the stomach be removed, which was done,\nIf the lesion were malignant,. it is conceded, appellant was bound to remove the adjoining portion of the pancreas and the spleen, which in fact he did. On the other hand, if the lesion were benign, all that needed to be taken out was the infected portion of the stomach. Faced with these alter-natives, the appellant decided to proceed with the removal of those portions of the organs necessary to ensure a com\u00adplete eradication of the cancer, if such in fact existed. A final test of the infected organs by what is known as the paraffin wax method (which admittedly could not have been done under 24 hours) disclosed that the lesion was not malignant.\nThe patient suffered post-operative complications but ultimately made a good recovery and was discharged from hospital on May 31, 1951. It was admitted on behalf of appellant at the trial that as a result of the operation and the removal of a portion of the pancreas respondent had developed mild diabetes. Respondent, who was 67 years of age at the time of the operation in April 1951, testified at the trial, which was held some four years later in March 1955. He died prior to the hearing of the appeal to this Court.\nThe only significant medical evidence led by respondent consisted of a portion of appellant's examination for discov\u00adery and the evidence of a Dr. Palmer and a Dr. Kemp. In addition to this, medical records of the Vancouver General Hospital, a copy of a letter from Dr. Johnson of Lethbridge, and a copy of Dr. Crawford's report were filed by respond\u00adent as exhibits.\nThe appellant elected to call no evidence and took the position that the respondent had failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence. This contention was upheld by the trial judge but has been reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nIn my opinion this appeal turns upon the question as to whether in the circumstances of this case the evidence of Dr. Kemp established a prima facie case of negligence against appellant. The learned trial judge held that it did not and while indicating that he felt both Dr. Palmer and Dr. Kemp were honest and endeavouring to help the Court to the best of their ability, stated that where the evidence of Dr. Kemp differed from that of Dr. Palmer, he preferred' to accept the evidence of the latter. Aside from any ques\u00adtion of credibility, where medical opinion evidence is involved, in my view the trial judge who heard the evidence was in a particularly favourable position to assess what weight should be given to such evidence.\nThe test of reasonable care applies in medical malpractice cases as in other cases of alleged negligence. As has been said in the United States, the medical man must possess and use that reasonable degree of learning and skill ordinarily possessed by practitioners in similar communities in similar cases, and it is the duty of a specialist such as appellant, who holds himself out as possessing special skill and knowl\u00adedge, to have and exercise the degree of skill of an average specialist in his field: see Meredith, Malpractice. Liability of Doctors and Hospitals, 1956, at p. 62, and the authorities there referred to.\nAs I have said, appellant, before making his diagnosis of probable stomach cancer, had the benefit of a similar diagnosis made by Dr. Johnson after two weeks' observa\u00adtion of respondent in the hospital, an examination of the x-ray films taken in Lethbridge which clearly showed a large filling defect in the stomach, his own physical examination of the patient and the results of the examina\u00adtion made by Dr. Crawford. In the course of the exploratory operation, when appellant had some doubt as to whether or not the lesion was malignant, he obtained the opinion of a pathologist of recognized competence. He then made an admittedly difficult decision but the sort of decision which every surgeon must be called upon to make from time to time. In making that decision I am satisfied he exercised his best judgment in what he considered to be the best interest of his patient.\nA great deal of the medical evidence was read to us at the hearing and I have again read all this evidence with care. I shall not attempt to review it in detail but I am satisfied that the only portion of Dr. Kemp's evidence which might be considered as prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of appellant is that portion relating to certain pre-operative tests which Dr. Kemp claimed he would have made. Dr. Kemp, who was the last witness to 'testify, stated that had the patient been his patient, before making a clinical diagnosis as to the probable character of the stomach lesion, he would have had certain tests made, including a test of the gastric juices and a blood count and that in addition he would have had fresh x-rays taken and a report from a radiologist. All that this proves, of course, is that Dr. Kemp would have made these additional tests, or had them made, not that other doctors would consider it necessary to do so. On cross-examination Dr. Kemp agreed that any conclusion which might be drawn from such tests could only be tentative and that to establish a conclusive diagnosis in the case of a suspected stomach cancer an exploratory operation must be undertaken and a pathological examination made of the suspected lesion. There is no evidence that either the medical history of the patient, or the result of the tests referred to by Dr. Kemp, would be of any assistance to the pathologist in his examination of the suspected tissue. The surgeon on receiv\u00ading a report from the pathologist of probable cancer, as was the case here, would still have to decide what he should do.\nAs to Dr. Kemp's special qualifications, he testified that for many years he had practised as an anaesthetist. After the last war he was for some time with the Workmen's Compensation Board of British Columbia and since leaving that board has been engaged in general practice. He has never practised as a surgeon, is not a pathologist, and stated in cross-examination that he had never at any time sug\u00adgested he was an authority on gastric disorders. Prima facie evidence has been defined as \"Evidence, which, not being inconsistent with the falsity of the hypo-thesis, nevertheless raises such a degree of probability in its favour that it must prevail if it be accredited unless it be rebutted or the contrary proved\": Kirk v. Kirkland et al. (I), affirmed sub nom Johnson v. Kirk (2).\nIn my opinion the evidence to which I have referred, given by a medical man of Dr. Kemp's limited experience and qualifications, falls far short of meeting such a test.\nThe learned trial judge found not only that the respond\u00adent had failed to make out a prima facie case of negligence but affirmatively that there was in fact no negligence. I respectfully share that view.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs throughout and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: R.

(a) to (i). The petitioner, as the registered owner of an island situate in the delta of a navigable and tidal river in British Columbia (the Fraser), claimed, under the Quieting Titles Act, the ownership of certain allegedly accreted lands. The island was granted by the Crown in 1889 and purchased by the respondent and his father in 1946. A provincial public road was constructed in 1931 leading from the village of Ladner to the north-westerly limit of the island and, as the important area claimed lay to the south-west of that road, the conditions as they existed prior to its construction were those to be considered. It was agreed that if there were accretion, it had been gradual and imperceptible, and that there was nothing in the terms of the Crown grant to prevent that accretion going to the petitioner. The trial judge allowed the claim and this judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and, subject to any claim the petitioner might wish to make in respect of two small areas east of the road, the petition dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright and Nolan JJ.: The petitioner had failed to show that prior to the construction of the road, the area in question was not overflowed by the waters of the river at the medium high tide between the spring and neap tides and, consequently, had failed to establish that the area had through accretion ceased to be the property of the Crown.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: The evidence was not sufficient to show that in 1930 any part of the area claimed was capable of ordinary cultivation or occupation.\nPer Rand J.: The essential condition for accretion is a slow and imperceptible change resulting in the projection outwards of the mean high water line and the correlative annexation to the land of what was formerly below that line. The elements of a practical nature such as convenience or utility are irrelevant. The gradual rise was not, during its progress, accretion; it was a process of widespread emergence of land owned by the Crown.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney-General for the Province of British Columbia from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [2], affirming, Robertson J.A. dissenting, the judgment at trial [3]. Appeal allowed.\nJ. D. Forin, for the petitioner, respondent.\nM. M. McFarlane, for the respondent, appellant.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014These proceedings commenced with a petition under the Quieting Titles Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 282, for a declaration that the petitioner, the present respondent, Thomas Edward Neilson, is the legal and beneficial owner of certain alleged accreted lands. The petition was granted by Wilson J.[4] and the accreted lands outlined in red on a sketch attached to and forming part of his formal order. This order was subject only to the reservations contained in clauses (a) to (j) of subs. [5] of s. 38 of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c, 171, and amendments, and to a certain easement in favour of British Columbia Telephone Company as marked on the said plan, but free from all other rights, interests, claims and demands whatsoever. No question arises as to the reservations or easement. In the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [6], O'Halloran and Sidney Smith JJ.A. agreed in dismissing an appeal by the Attorney-General for the Province of British Columbia but Robertson J.A. dissented. The Attorney-General now appeals.\nIn 1943, the respondent and his father agreed to purchase from the then owner, C. S. V. Branch, Lot 471, Group 2, Municipality of Delta, New Westminster District, Province of British Columbia. This lot was an island situated in the delta of the Fraser River which is a tidal stream emptying into the Gulf of Georgia. When the island was patented in 1889 it contained 168 acres and a sketch attached to the Crown grant shows that the island was of irregular shape, bounded on the east by a slough and at all other points by the waters of the Fraser River. The purchase by the respondent and his father was completed in December 1946 and the respondent alone now has the title to the island with the exception of that part which, pursuant to a proviso in the Crown grant, was resumed in 1930 by the Crown for the purpose of the Ladner Ferry Road and which road was constructed in 1931. In fact, most of the road is built on land which allegedly had been added to Lot 471 but all of the road is excepted from the area awarded to the respondent by the order of Wilson J.\nIt was agreed that if there were an accretion, it had been gradual and imperceptible within the meaning of the authorities and that there was nothing in the terms of the Crown grant to prevent that accretion going to the respondent. It was also agreed that the prevailing mean high tide for the area in question is a twelve-foot tide at Point Atkin- son, as shown on the official tide tables. It is unnecessary to consider if s. 2 of the Official Surveys Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 321, prevents the operation in British Columbia of the English common law in regard to accretion as that point which was taken before Wilson J. was abandoned by counsel for the appellant.\nHowever, the appeal should succeed on the ground that the respondent has failed to produce evidence that prior to the construction of the Ladner Ferry Road in 1931 the area in question was not overflowed by the waters of the Fraser River at the high-water mark of the ordinary or neap tides. I consider that the law is correctly expressed in the Moore's History of the Foreshore, 3rd ed. 1888, at p. 678:\u2014\n\u2026it may be regarded as good law at this day, that the terra firma, and right of the subject, in respect of title and ownership, extends beyond the lines of the high spring tides and spring tides, and down to the edge of the high-water mark of the ordinary or neap tides\u2026.\nreading \"ordinary\" and \"neap\" as synonymous. However, it was decided in Attorney General v. Chambers [7], that, in the absence of particular usage, the extent of the right of the Crown to the seashore is prima facie limited by the line of the medium high tide between the springs and the neaps, and, to avoid misunderstanding, it is preferable that that phraseology should be followed. In that case the principle of the rule which gives the seashore to the Crown is stated to be that it is land not capable of ordinary cultivation or occupation and so is in the nature of unappropriated soil. Lord Hale had given as his reason for thinking that lands only covered by the high spring tides did not belong to the Crown that such lands are for the most part dry and maniorable (i.e., manurable); and therefore the Lord Chancellor, sitting in equity in the Chambers case and assisted by Baron Alderson and Mr. Justice Maule, determined that the reasonable conclusion was that the Crown's right is limited to land which is for the most part not dry, or maniorable.\nBy 1931, when the Ladner Ferry Road was built, Mr. McGugan, the surveyor engaged by the previous owner, Mr. Branch, had already made a survey and testified at the hearing of this petition that the conditions in 1930, immediately prior to the construction of the road, were about the same as in 1953 when he made a new survey on the instructions of the respondent. However, this is not sufficient either by itself or in conjunction with the other evidence called on behalf of the respondent to show that in 1930 any part of the area in question was capable of ordinary cultivation or occupation. A reading of the entire record and even discounting, as did the trial judge, some of the testimony adduced on behalf of the appellant, satisfies me that the petitioner has failed to make out a case. Mr. McGugan when testifying as to the conditions in 1926, when the first survey was made by him, is reported as follows:\u2014\nWell, yes, definitely at times, the whole of it must have been. On very high tides, the whole of that island, the original island must have been under water. I know when we were surveying on that island there, there were numerous sloughs we crossed all the time. We had to make long detours to get around these sloughs. There may have been\u2014looking at Green Slough\u2014there was a ridge which was quite high, and there were trees on it and that was high. Most of the rest of it was relatively, you would call it relatively low, and when the tides were in you just couldn't work on it, that was all.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the matter and I say nothing further as to the other grounds urged except to point out that it is difficult to believe that what the trial judge described as \"ramparts\", even if they existed in 1930, could be said to form an accretion in the accepted sense of that term.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgments in the Courts below set aside and subject to one reservation the petition dismissed. That reservation is as to two small areas east of the Ladner Ferry Road, one at its northern extremity and the other to the south of Lot 471 and east of the Ladner Ferry Road. These are included in the order of Wilson J. and shown on the sketch attached thereto, but no particular reference was made to these comparatively small bits as the argument was directed mainly to the large alleged accretion to the west of the road. The dismissal of the petition should be without prejudice to any claim the petitioner may wish to make in respect of them.\nNo order as to costs was made by the judge of first instance or by the Court of Appeal and the Attorney-General did not ask for costs in this Court. There should, therefore, be no costs in any Court. RAND J.:\u2014This appeal raises a question of accretion. The respondent is the owner of land in the delta of the Fraser River granted by the Crown in 1889 which a plan annexed to the grant represents as an island. Since that time an area of what was then river bed to the west has been raised by alluvial deposits to an irregular level which at mean high tide is, to a greater extent than not, covered by water from 2 inches to 2 feet in depth. Narrow arms or reaches forming the outer rims or \"ramparts\", as Wilson J. at trial [8] described them, of the area have risen above the average level; and several sloughs or channels with their branches spread the incoming tides over it. It is covered with a mat of marsh growth about one foot thick and is overgrown with hydrophyte and hygrophyte types of vegetation such as sedges, rushes and weeds.\nThe Fraser River, from its sources and branches in the mountains to the north, carries a huge run-off in spring and the alluvial deposits are heavy. The process of the land formation is aptly described by Wilson J. [9]:\u2014\nThe process by which this area, and, indeed, the whole of the Fraser delta, has been created is this: At a certain time the deposits of alluvial soil on the river bottom in any given area, such as the one I have to deal with, will reach an approximate low tidewater level. From this time on the deposits follow a curious pattern. The edges of the formed area present an obstacle against which the water washes, and which take from the water the heavier particles of silt and sand. The result is to build up about the perimeter of the emerging land a natural rampart which is higher than the area behind it. At its simplest this would result in the creation of a lake dyked off from the river. But the pattern is far more complicated. Running back from the outer margin are sloughs penetrating deep into the interior, and each of these sloughs has many branches. Along these sloughs, and along their branches, the pattern is repeated; the banks attract the heavier deposits and build up higher than the areas behind them. But this does not mean that accretion is arrested in these posterior areas. At high tides, and particularly at extreme high tides occurring during the freshet, when the river is heavy with alluvial matter, they receive large deposits of new earth. The lesser branches of the sloughs have banks that taper off from a high point near their emergence from a main slough to a level, at their tips, approximating that of the land or marsh surrounding them. They thus serve as channels to admit silt-laden water to those areas and carry on the work of soil building.\nThey thus flood the lower land at mean high tide. The result, at that stage of water, is that there are large flooded areas surrounded by natural dykes or ramparts which do not flood. The depth of the flooding varies from a few inches to a foot or two, but it is nowhere great, and a man in knee-height rubber boots could probably walk over all but a few pockets at mean high tide.\nThe banks have lost their character of marsh land and are covered by upland growth. They are increasing in size and vary in width from a few feet to a hundred feet. The marsh is grown in sedges, bulrushes and other marsh vegetation. Through the marsh there are numerous high spots where upland growth is emerging.\nThe picture thus presented is of a skeleton of ridges emerging from a lower level of marshy soil. What may be called the main rampart extends from the north-westerly boundary of the original lot in the form of an arm curving westerly and southerly, a distance of approximately 4,000 feet roughly parallel to the down flow of the river. Wilson J. remarked that no one could question the fact that that arm was an accretion to the original lot, but whether that is so or not depends on the mode and circumstances of its formation.\nIn 1931 at the north-westerly end of the original lot, a ferry terminal was constructed which called for a public road, vested in the province, from that point southerly along roughly the western boundary of the island and extending to the town of Ladner on the mainland. The area claimed lies to the west of that road. In the course of the work a great deal of dredging was done and the discharge deposited just westerly of the highway at its northerly end. For some years a portion west of that deposit has been used as a garbage dump. Beyond these the main arm runs to its tip. The claim for accretion must, then, be established as of 1931: subsequent annexation would be to land owned by the province.\nFrom the finding quoted, the deposit is seen to have been generalized and the rise, except as to the ridges, substantially uniform over the area as a whole. The process of vegetational generation, predominantly marine or marsh, was likewise generalized. In that state of things, has there been, in the true sense of the word, any degree of accretion?\nAs applied to land bounded by the sea, accretion, under the ruling in The King v. Lord Yarborough [10] and Gifford v. Lord Yarborough [11], is the acquisition of extension to land, as distinguished from land covered with water, by its owner through the slow and imperceptible withdrawal of the line of the mean high tide as that expression is defined in Attorney General v. Chambers [12], followed in Lowe v. Govett [13]. The recession may be by the lowering of the sea level or by alluvion, the throwing up onto the shore by the flux and reflux of the tide of various kinds of marine matter. As this deposit rises the tide line retreats, and the boundary is gradually pushed out. It is found, then, in a situation of a fluid boundary. A sudden reliction of the water or displacement of land leaves the boundary as it was. The essential condition is a slow and imperceptible change resulting in the projection outwards of the boundary line and the correlative annexation to the land of what was formerly below the tide line: the determining fact is the line of the mean high tide which bounds the riparian land seaward.\nThe trial judge and O'Halloran J.A. in the Court of Appeal introduced into the idea of accretion elements which, while they may have been considered pertinent to the formulation of the rule, are not embraced within it nor can they be taken into account to supply a want of what the rule calls for as its necessary condition. These elements are of a practical nature: the general advantage from the standpoint of utility of giving the adjacent owner the added land which otherwise would remain less usable; and the maniorableness of the reclaimed portion, that is, its capacity to be worked by hand for ordinary land purposes such as the raising of herbage or crops. But these features of convenience and utility are irrelevant when the change of the tide line is perceptible, and they must be taken to be equally so when the change is imperceptible.\nThe rule is not one of justice or injustice, a consideration which, from the judgments below, one would gather to be of controlling importance. Here a private owner is claiming over 200 acres as an addition to his land to or for which he has contributed nothing. Under the Roman law, the line was drawn at that of the highest tides and Lord Hale was disposed to make it that of the neaps. The rule is of convenience and is arbitrary. It is said that the owner risks the loss of his land by action of the sea and should enjoy the benefit; but in either case the change must be imperceptible and he always has it within his power to prevent corrosion. How the Crown could, on its part, prevent withdrawal is not so apparent.\nBut accretion, the slow extension of land through the imperceptible change of boundary, is treated in both courts below as including the gradual generalized rise, through deposit, of the bed of a river. With the greatest respect I cannot but think this is a misconception. That gradual rise here was not, during its progress, accretion; it was on the contrary a process of widespread emergence of land owned by the Crown. Accretion does not arise until the high water line has retreated or been forced back by the expanding land. When the general low tide level in this case was reached, the area covered by water remained in the Crown: the deposit raising the bottom vertically had touched no other ownership. Then began the formation of outside ridges on that soil contemporaneously with that forming at the boundaries of the original lot. Except at the latter point they were emerging strips of what was river bottom unconnected with the lot. This generalized vertical formation had no element of progressive annexation to and extension of existing land resulting in a change of water boundary: the main ridge at the southerly end was in the same process and in the same degree of rising as at the northerly end.\nWhere the conditions of the operation of accretion for private benefit are not present, the ownership of the Crown is unaffected. The difficulties and confusion suggested by Wilson J. arise only when the rule is attempted to be applied to a situation in which its conditions are not present. The conditions in the Fraser delta may be exceptional but for that reason a modifying extension of the rule is not to be justified. I am unable to agree that, assuming certain portions of the ridges to satisfy the conditions of accretion, they carry with them the inner and larger body of soil which is not within those conditions; it would be a subtraction from ownership for which neither in convenience nor justice would there be any warrant. If, in such a situation, prac- tical necessities are to govern, the rule must be held not to given, the basis for any such assumption is not here present. attribute accretion to such strips which of themselves are quite without utility as land. But for the reasons already\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, reverse the judgment and declare the area in question to be vested in the Crown in right of the province. There will be no costs in any court.\nWhile the question was not argued, the plan prepared by McGugan in 1953 shows two small areas east of the Ladner Ferry Road, one at its northern extremity and the other generally to the south of Lot 471, which are marked as accretions. Since I have not dealt with the matter of the respondent's right to these areas as against the Crown, the dismissal of the petition should be without prejudice to any claim he may wish to make in respect of them.\nThe judgment of Locke and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [14], dismissing the appeal of the present appellant from an order made by Wilson J. [15], upon an application under the Quieting Titles Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 282. Robertson J.A. dissented and would have allowed the appeal.\nThe respondent is the registered owner of a parcel of land which was at one time an island situate in the Fraser River some five or six miles from the place where the south arm flows into the Gulf of Georgia. This land was, by a Crown grant dated April 20, 1889, conveyed to Boyd Nordman and was described as follows:\u2014\nAll that parcel or lot of land situate in New Westminster District, said to contain one hundred and sixty-eight acres, more or less, and more particularly described on the map or plan hereunto annexed and coloured red, and numbered Lot four hundred and seventy one (471) Group Two (2) on the Official Plan or Survey of the said New Westminster District in the Province of British Columbia.\nThe plan referred to showed an island surrounded to the north and to the west by the Fraser River and to the east and south by the waters of a slough. Among the terms and conditions of the grant, the only one requiring notice was that which reserved to the Crown the right to resume any part of the said lands which might be deemed necessary for the purpose of making, inter alia, roads or other works of public utility or convenience, providing, however, that \"the land so to be resumed\" should not exceed one twentieth part of the whole.\nThe respondent and his father acquired this land from one Branch, one of the successors in title of Nordman, by a deed dated December 30, 1946, the conveyance being expressed as being subject to the reservations, limitations, provisoes and conditions expressed in the original grant from the Crown. George Edward Neilson, the father of the respondent, died before the commencement of the proceedings and his interest passed to the respondent. The manner in which this was accomplished is not disclosed by the evidence. Sixteen years prior to the acquisition of this land by the respondent and his father, the Department of Public Works of British Columbia had established and constructed a road leading from the village of Ladner to a point immediately adjoining what was the north-westerly limit of the island, as shown on the plan annexed to the Crown grant.\nUnder the provisions of the Highway Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 103, s. 8, the Minister of Public Works was empowered to establish such highways and to declare the same by a notice in the British Columbia Gazette. The notice published in this matter defined the limits of the highway which commenced at a point on the Ladner highway and ran from there in a general north-westerly direction through various parcels of land, including District Lot 471, and terminated at the point above stated. A plan showing the exact location of the road was filed in the registry office at that time but was not put in evidence, though two rough sketches were marked as exhibits which do not show adequately the relative position of the easterly limit of the road and the westerly limit of Lot 471. A plan, however, prepared by Mr. D. J. McGugan shows that the highway which became known as the Ladner Ferry Road and led to a wharf used by the ferry operating between that point and Woodwards Landing on Lulu Island incorporated a small part of Lot 471. No part of that lot, as described in the Crown grant, lay to the west of the westerly boundary of the road, a fact the importance of which will become apparent.\nThe claim of the respondent as advanced in his petition is that an area, now 207 acres in extent, all of which was undoubtedly at the time of the issue of the Crown grant to Nordman covered with water and part of the bed of the Fraser River, has through accretion become part of Lot 471, and a declaration was asked that the petitioner was the legal and beneficial owner in fee simple of all the area in question. All of it has been completely separated from the property described in the Crown grant since the establishment of the highway in 1930. The conditions as they existed prior to the construction of the road in 1930 are those which must be considered in determining the matter.\nThe Fraser is a navigable and tidal river which rises several hundred miles distant in the interior of northern British Columbia. Large quantities of silt are carried down by the stream and it is the deposit of this material upon the shores of the river and islands in the river and upon the bed of the stream itself which causes accretions of the nature giving rise to the present litigation. On a map published by the Canadian Hydrographic Service showing that part of the south arm of the Fraser River from Sand Heads to Tilbury Island, the whole area including Lot 471, as shown in the Crown grant, and an area equally as large lying to the west of Ferry Road is described as Ladner Marsh, and the river to the west of it as Ladner Reach.\nCaptain H. A. Young, who came to New Westminster in 1889 and was the master of a Dominion Government dredge working on the river for a very long period of years, said that in the early days of his employment paddle steamers plied between New Westminster and the village of Ladner and passed through the Green Slough, which ran along the eastern and southern boundary of what became Lot 471, and that boats from Ladner passed over the area now described as an accretion by the respondent which lies to the west of the highway. It was along the westerly banks of the Green Slough that the respondent and his father placed their dyke when they bought the property and were proceeding to make it ready for cultivation. The time at which this use of the Green Slough and the property now lying to the west of the road ceased is not disclosed by the evidence. Mr. McGugan, a British Columbia land surveyor practising for more than forty years in New Westminster, had been asked by Branch in 1926 to survey Lot 471 and the area lying to the west of it. It is clear that between the times referred to by Captain Young and the date of McGugan's survey, very extensive deposits of silt had been made upon an area of approximately 200 acres lying between the western boundary of Lot 471 and Ladner Reach. While McGugan had made the survey in 1926, he did not prepare the plan which he produced until October 17, 1930. This was prepared from his field notes and shows the area and what he considered at that time to be an accretion to Lot 471 of 200. 7 acres. Describing the area at that time, he said that he had fixed the boundaries of what he referred to as the accretion where he could see vegetation growing \"indicating that that land was out of water sufficiently long to produce vegetation\u2014might be grass or it might be brush or whatever it might be\u2014but that was the point that decided it chiefly\". He said that the whole of the land including Lot 471 must have been under water when the tide was very high and that when they were surveying the island there were numerous sloughs to be crossed. This was, of course, long prior to the time when Lot 471 was dyked and the land made suitable for cultivation. Comparing the level of the disputed area with that of other farm lands in the Fraser Delta, he said that it was virtually the same and, referring to Lot 471, said:\u2014\nYou see, I think this island, the original island was surveyed in 1885, and all of this area has been subject to flooding and deposit of sediment and silt all the time, so that in 1926, the elevation of the original Crown grant would be slightly higher than it was when originally surveyed.\nAccording to this witness, some trees were growing on the bank of the Deas Slough which was to the north of Lot 471 at the point where the Ferry Road terminated, but the location of these in relation to the northern extremity of the road was not made clear.\nOther than the evidence of McGugan, whose capacity as a land surveyor and whose complete reliability as a witness is not questioned, the respondent gave no further useful evidence as to the conditions existing in 1930. For the Attorney-General, Mr. T. H. Oliver who had lived in Ladner for sixty-four years, speaking generally of the area west of the road at the time this was constructed, said:\u2014\nThere was the bulrushes and more or less a few willows, vegetation, marsh vegetation.\nand\nthere was growth all through here. The toolies come first on the marshes.\nThis witness was a hunter and had frequently been on the property when hunting and said that the property would always be covered with water at high tide and, in answer to a question of the learned trial judge, said that he meant by this any high tide around 12 feet or over. He had been on the property when the road was being built and said that the biggest part of the trees which were shown to be growing near the northern extremity of the road had come since it was constructed. A photograph of the property taken in April 1954 showed a growth of trees along a considerable part of the westerly side of the road and these, he said, had grown following the construction of the road.\nIt should be said as to this witness that the learned trial judge said that he rejected his evidence, considering that he was more interested in preserving the area for duck-shooting than in giving a veracious picture of the terrain. I take this to refer to the witness's evidence of conditions as they were at the time of the trial in 1954, and not to what he had said as to the conditions twenty-four years earlier.\nWith these exceptions, there is no evidence as to the extent to which the property lying west of the highway built in 1930 was covered with water at medium high tide. There was, however, a considerable amount of evidence as to the condition of the property in 1948 and 1954, when the hearing took place. The learned trial judge also considered that it would assist him in appreciating the evidence if he were to examine the property himself and he spent a considerable time in doing so.\nUnder the provisions of the Highway Act referred to, the soil and freehold of every public highway were declared to be vested in His Majesty, and the entry by the Minister, his agents, servants or workmen operated as a complete extinguishment of every title and claim to any lands so entered upon or taken possession of. These provisions of the Act, as it was at the date of the construction of the highway, are re-enacted in the Highway Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 144.\nIn these circumstances, evidence directed to the condition of affairs as they were from eighteen to twenty-four years after the establishment of the road is of little weight, unless it has been shown that the conditions existing on the property were at these respective dates essentially the same.\nThe witness McGugan had in 1944 been employed by the respondent and his father to construct a dyke around Lot 471, as it was shown in the Crown grant, and had directed the carrying out of this work. McGugan was also a member of the dyking authority in the area set up in the year 1948 and in that year, when there was a serious flood, the board had constructed a dam across the upper end of Deas Slough (which was in reality a channel in the river through which the current flowed) which, he considered, had had the effect of causing more silt to be deposited in the area further down stream, including the property to the west of the road. He had again surveyed the property in dispute in 1953 and said that he considered that a high tide would cover part of it but that with a 12-foot tide they could work there all the time. He did not say upon what part of the area this could be done. He had then prepared a plan which showed the area in dispute as 207 acres in extent and said that there had been a tremendous amount of sand and silt deposit on the northerly portion of it, caused by the damming of the Deas Slough. Asked if he could express an opinion as to the extent of the deposits upon the area generally, he said that he could not be definite but that it had been very gradual.\nCaptain Young whose dredge had pumped the sand used in the construction of the road in 1930 said that, as a result of his experience, he thought an average of 12 feet would be the mean average high tide in that area.\nThe respondent who, after dyking Lot 471, had by work done upon it converted it into highly arable land, said that with a 12 or 14 foot tide there would be no water on the lands in dispute and that in July, August, September and most of October there would be no water on it at all in any tide. The land west of the road, he agreed, was quite useless for agricultural purposes in its present state and it would be necessary to dyke and drain it to make it so.\nMr. H. L. Huff, a retired inspector of lands for the provincial Department of Lands, had on the instructions of the department examined the property in 1949. Huff was a graduate in agriculture of the University of British Columbia and had examined the vegetation on the property in dispute. He said that it consisted of sedges, rushes, reeds, scattered willows along the higher portion, and on the highest portions a true deciduous tree growth of the type of alder. Asked as to whether there was a common name for the type of willow found there, he said:\u2014\nWell, a willow is a tree, as far as that goes, but there is different types of vegetation and the types of vegetation out there are some hydrophyte and some hygrophyte types of vegetation. I make the distinction between that and your true grass or land vegetation which are your mesophyte type of vegetation.\nSpeaking of the trees growing at the north end of the property, he said that the deciduous type trees were from fifteen to twenty years old and that many were far less than that, and this applied also to the trees growing along the highway. He said that at a normal high tide \"the great body of that marsh is covered by water\". In 1949, accompanied by the Chief Inspector of Lands, he had started to walk on to the property from the road at a 12-foot tide and said that they did not get more than 20 feet from the road, that there was no wind at the time and said that he considered that was a normal high tide.\nMr. E. W. Taylor, a biologist in the employ of the British Columbia Game Department, had taken a series of photographs of the disputed property on April 17, 1954. These were taken on a calm day at around 5.30 in the afternoon. These photographs were taken from points about 400 yards west of the Ferry Road and not far distant from the westerly limit of the area. One showing the view to the east shows the line of trees which had grown along the west side of the highway and the greater part of the area covered with water, with some vegetation of the kind commonly seen in marshes growing in the water in the areas closest to the camera. The view to the south shows a considerable area covered with what appeared to be bulrushes and similar marsh vegetation and a larger area mostly covered with water.\nMr. George Macey, an operator of a marine machine shop in Ladner, was called in rebuttal by the respondent and said that the average high tide in that area was around 11 or 12 feet and that a 12-foot tide would cover part but not all of the area in question. He said that there were times during the year when it was possible to drive a tractor along the high part of the area close to its westerly limit and said that with a 12-foot tide the portions of the area which would be visible were the banks of the sloughs running through the property, the edge of the area next to the river proper and quite a few places in the middle.\nFurther evidence as to conditions in 1954 were given by John Devington, a neighbour of the respondent who at times rowed across the area in a flat bottom boat in order to salvage logs or posts carried on to the area, who said that it required a 14-foot tide to provide sufficient water for operations of this nature.\nThe respondent also gave evidence as to using a tractor on part of the area and said that there were various upland grasses and pea vines growing in places.\nBy consent, a letter written by an official of the Game Commission containing information as to the mean high tide for the period October 1, 1952 to September 30, 1953, obtained from the official records kept at Steveston, was read into the record. This showed that in the area the average high tide was 12.1 feet, there being normally two high tides in each twenty-four hour period. The records further show that on April 17, 1954, at the time the photographs referred to were taken, the tide was 11.7 feet and that the high for that day was 12 feet, this occurring at 6.20 p.m.\nIn addition to this evidence, a number of aerial photographs were put in evidence. Of these, one had been taken in 1928 of Lot 471 and the area to the west of it, this being prior to the construction of the highway. Other than the sloughs, no water appears on the land but no evidence was given as to the state of the tide when the photograph was taken, and it is thus of no assistance.\nBy s. 9 of the Quieting Titles Act, the judge investigating the title is entitled to receive not only any evidence properly receivable by the Supreme Court on the question of title or which the practice of English conveyancers authorizes to be received on the investigation of a title out of court, but \"any other evidence, whether the same is or is not receivable or sufficient in point of strict law\", provided the same satisfies the judge of the truth of the facts intended to be made out thereby.\nThe learned trial judge in making his findings of fact does not say that he exercised the power thus given to him when he took a view of the area in question. This was done, according to the reasons delivered, for the customary purpose of such a view in order that the judge might better understand the evidence. It should be emphasized that this view was taken in the summer of 1954, twenty-eight years after McGugan had made his first survey, and twenty-four years after the construction of the Ferry Road.\nThe learned judge found upon the evidence that the mean high tide in the area in question is a 12-foot tide at Point Atkinson and that, at such a stage of the tide, the lower land in the area is flooded, while about the perimeter of the land a natural rampart has been formed which is not. He said:\u2014\nThe result, at that stage of water, is that there are large flooded areas surrounded by natural dykes or ramparts which do not flood. The depth of the flooding varies from a few inches to a foot or two, but it is nowhere great, and a man in knee-height rubber boots could probably walk over all but a few pockets at mean high tide.\nThe banks have lost their character of marsh land and are covered by upland growth. They are increasing in size and vary in width from a few feet to a hundred feet. The marsh is grown in sedges, bulrushes and other marsh vegetation. Through the marsh there are numerous high spots where upland growth is emerging.\nHaving said this, the learned judge said:\u2014\nI find that at mean high tide probably more of this land has water on it (although, in many places, an inconsiderable depth of water) than is high and dry. and further:\u2014\nBut I do not consider this finding conclusive. The truth is that I think it impossible to call this 200-acre area foreshore. It is, as I have said, encompassed with natural walls and dykes stemming from and connected with the original island.\nAfter saying that these ramparts, referring to the higher area along the westerly and northerly limits of the area, were undoubtedly accretions, the learned judge found that, as they were connected to the original island by these natural walls, they were accretions to the land of the petitioner. Whether they were continuous in 1954 was not stated.\nPart of these findings, such as that as to the depth of water upon the area at mean high tide and as to the character of the vegetation, were clearly made as the result of the judge's own observations. The finding that the higher land around the perimeter of the area, to which reference was made, was connected to Lot 471, must clearly have been intended to refer to the situation that existed in 1930, prior to the time when the Ferry Road was built and, with great respect, is not supported by the evidence. Neither the evidence of McGugan nor the 1928 aerial photograph prove the existence of these so-called ramparts at that time or that they were connected with Lot 471 in any manner, and there is no other evidence on the point.\nWhile the learned judge had found that it was impossible to call the area foreshore, he said further that, assuming this to be wrong, since McGugan had said that the disputed area was in 1926 of the same character and level as Lot 471, the land in the original grant was foreshore and, if the accretion was foreshore, it was subject to the same rules as an accretion of cultivable land and became the property of the petitioner.\nI am unable, with great respect, to agree with these conclusions or with those of the majority of the Court of Appeal and agree with the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson. The case of the petitioner as advanced in the petition is that, since the date of the Crown grant, \"there has accreted to Lot 471 as it stood at the time of such Crown grant some 207 acres, mostly on the west side of Lot 471\". It is alleged\nThat a substantial portion of such accreted area is now grown over with willow or brush or grass and excepting for two very small sloughs is no longer washed by mean tides\nand a declaration is asked that the petitioner is the legal and beneficial owner in fee simple.\nThe Crown grant to Nordman, read with the attached plan, was a grant of an island in the Fraser River. I think the only possible inference from the evidence is that this island had been gradually formed by vertical deposits of silt, carried down the river. As the Crown in the right of the province was the owner of the bed of the river, the island was its property. As pointed out by Robertson J.A., the area might have been sold by the Crown even though it were covered with water. As the land had been built up above the surface of the water, it was treated as the sale of an island, the area and limits of which were shown by the plan, and not as of a portion of the bed of the river. I can see no basis for finding that the area described in the grant was either foreshore or sold as such and the petition does not, indeed, suggest it.\nIn Sir Matthew Hale's treatise De Jure Maris, as it appears in Hargrave's Law Tracts at p. 12, dealing with the King's right of property on the shore, it is said:\u2014\nThe shore is that ground that is between the ordinary high-water and low-water mark. This doth prima facie and of common right belong to the king, both in the shore of the sea and the shore of the arms of the sea.\nAs to what was included in the expressions \"shore\" or \"littus maris\", it is said that\nit is certain that that which the sea overflows, either at high-spring tides or at extraordinary tides, comes not as to this purpose under the denomination of littus maris; and consequently the king's title is not of that large extent, but only to land that is usually overflowed at ordinary tides.\nThe question as to the proper interpretation of the expression \"ordinary tides\" was considered in the judgment of Lord Cranworth L.C. in Attorney General v. Chambers [16]. In that case, in which the Lord Chancellor was assisted by Alderson B. and Maule J., Lord Cranworth said, referring to the statement of Hale, that it should be construed as the medium high tide between the springs and the neaps. A like interpretation had been placed on the expression in Blundell v. Catterell [17], to which the Lord Chancellor referred. See also 33 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1939, p. 525 and cases referred to in note (s).\nThe onus rested upon the respondent to establish that, prior to the construction of the Ladner Ferry Road, the area in dispute had through accretion ceased to be the property of the Crown. To establish this, it was necessary for him to show that at that time the area was not overflowed by the water of the river at ordinary tides, so construed. This has not been shown and that is decisive of the matter against the respondent, in my opinion.\nMcGugan, speaking of conditions as they were in 1926 when the survey was made, when asked whether the area was swept by tidal waters, said:\u2014\nWell, yes, definitely at times, the whole of it must have been. On very high tides, the whole of that island, the original island must have been under water. I know when we were surveying on that island there, there were numerous sloughs we crossed all the time. We had to make long detours to get around these sloughs. There may have been\u2014looking at Green Slough\u2014there was a ridge which was quite high, and there were trees on it and that was high. Most of the rest of it was relatively, you would call it relatively low, and when the tides were in you just couldn't work on it, that was all.\nThe matter was not explored further, in either direct or cross-examination and there is no other evidence on the point.\nIf there had been evidence that, prior to the construction of the Ladner Ferry Road, the so-called ramparts were not covered by water at mean high tide and, commencing at the north-west corner of Lot 471, extended continuously out into the river and surrounded or partly surrounded the lower portions of the bed of the river to the west of the respondent's property, the question as to whether the Crown's title was affected would require consideration. In my opinion, what has been called the doctrine of accretion is accurately stated in Coulson and Forbes on Waters and Land Drainage, 6th ed. 1952, at p. 39, where it is said:\u2014\nLand formed by alluvion, or gradual and imperceptible accretion from the sea, and land gained by dereliction, or the gradual and imperceptible retreat of the sea, belongs to the owner of the adjoining terra firma. Where the increase is sudden or perceptible, the land gained still belongs to its original owner. The word \"imperceptible\" means imperceptible in progress, and not in result\u2014that is to say, where the increase cannot be observed as actually going on, though a visible increase is observable every year.\nThe principle is that gradual accretion enures to the land which attracts it. It applies to tidal and non-tidal and navigable or non-navigable rivers: Foster v. Wright [18]. It was applied in this Court to lands through which the North Saskatchewan River runs in Clarke v. City of Edmonton [19].\nIf the so-called ramparts which were visible to the learned judge in 1954 extended in 1930 continuously from the north-west corner of Lot 471, westerly and then southerly along the boundary of the property in dispute, and had been gradually built up by accretion commencing on the foreshore of Lot 471 (and there is no evidence that they did), a question would arise as to whether the law relating to accretion would vest such a long narrow curving strip of land in a navigable river in the owner of the land upon which the accretion commenced and from which it was extended. It is not accurate, in my opinion, on the evidence in this case to say that this narrow strip of land is undoubtedly an accretion since if, for example, the portion of it along the westerly boundary of the property was formed by alluvion at that place and did not project out from Lot 471 and was not connected to an accretion there, it would be the property of the Crown, just as the island which formed the subject matter of the grant was its property. There is a complete absence of evidence, however, as to when and in what manner these ramparts rose above the surface of the water at medium high tide. I am further unaware of any authority for the proposition that, assuming the ramparts were continuous and were true accretions to the respondent's property, the very large area of lands subject to flooding at medium high tide which were the property of the Crown and which lay between these ridges and Lot 471 thereby became the property of the respondent. No principle of the law as to accretion would make it so, in my opinion.\nThe conflict between the decision of the judges in Gifford v. Lord Yarborough [20], and part of the judgment of Lord Cranworth in Attorney General v. Chambers [21], which is discussed at length in the judgment of Palles C.B. in Attorney-General v. M'Carthy [22], does not touch any of the matters in issue in the present case. There is, however, a conflict which, I think, should be noted. In Chambers' Case, Lord Cranworth said, relying upon a passage from De Jure Maris, that the principle which gave the shore to the Crown was that it was land not capable of ordinary cultivation or occupation and so in the nature of unappropriated soil and, in Lord Hale's language, not maniorable. A passage in the judgment of Best C.J., referred to by O'Halloran J.A. in his judgment in this case, suggests that the right of the owner to an accretion depends not on the fact that the land which is above the mean high water mark is maniorable (or manurable) as it is left by the action of the tide but by virtue of the owner entering upon the area and improving it, thus acquiring title \"by occupation and improvement\". The question, it should be noted, was not one that was in issue in Lord Yarborough's Case and the accuracy of that portion of the judgment will have to be considered when the question arises. It does not arise in the present matter.\nFor these reasons, it is my opinion that this appeal should be allowed and, subject to one reservation, the petition dismissed. We were informed on the argument that the Attorney-General does not ask for costs in this Court. No order as to costs was made by Wilson J. or by the Court of Appeal and I would make no order as to the costs of the proceedings before them. While the question was not argued before us, the plan prepared by McGugan in 1953 shows two small areas east of the Ladner Ferry Road, one at its northern extremity and the other generally to the south of Lot 471, which are marked as accretions. Since the matter of the respondent's right to these areas as against the Crown has not been dealt with, I think the dismissal of the petition should be without prejudice to any claim he may wish to make in respect of them.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014I agree that the appeal should succeed on the ground that the respondent has failed to establish that prior to the construction of the Ladner Ferry Road the area in question was not overflowed by the waters of the Fraser River at the high-water mark of the ordinary tides as defined in Attorney-General v. Chambers (1). This renders it unnecessary for me to consider the ground on which my brother Rand would allow the appeal.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed, no costs.\nSolicitors for the petitioner, respondent: Campney, Owen, Murphy & Owen, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent, appellant: Lawrence, Shaw, McFarlane & Stewart, Vancouver.\n[1] (1899) , 7 B.C.R. 12 at 17.\n[2] 16 W.W.R. 625, [1955] 5 D.L.R. 56.\n[3] (1954) , 13 W.W.R.

Barnes, [1956] S.C.R. 842\nDate: 1956-10-02\nUnion Steamships Limited (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nArchie Barnes (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1955: October 26, 27[1]; 1956: June 14; 1956: October 2.\nPresent: Rand, Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nShipping\u2014Action by passenger for personal injuries due to negligence of ship's servant\u2014Condition limiting shipowner's liability printed on back of passenger's ticket\u2014Passenger not reading ticket\u2014Whether reasonable attempt to bring condition to passenger's attention. The plaintiff and his family boarded a ship operated by the defendant company in the early hours of the morning. There was no ticket-office on shore, and the plaintiff bought his ticket after he was on board. The ticket bore a notice on its face, in red print, to the effect that it was subject to the conditions printed on the back, and on the back was a condition relieving the defendant from any liability for injury, even if it resulted from the negligence of the defendant's servants. The plaintiff's evidence was that he knew that there was writing on the ticket, but had not read it or looked at the back. The plaintiff was seriously injured, as a result of the negligence of a steward on the ship.\nHeld (Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The defendant was not liable.\nThere being no law that prevented the carrier from entering into an agreement with a passenger which would relieve it from liability for injuries caused by the negligence of its employees, the question to be determined was whether the defendant had done what was reasonably sufficient to bring the limitative condition to the buyer's notice, and this was a question of fact. Grand Trunk Pacific Coast Steamship Company v. Simpson (1922), 63 S.C.R. 631, explained and distinguished. The trial judge had found that the form of the ticket was a reasonable attempt to bring the conditions under which he would be carried to the attention of the plaintiff, and this finding was conclusive. There was no evidence to support the further finding at the trial that the plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to read the ticket. His acceptance of the ticket without protest, and embarking upon the voyage, precluded him from now reprobating its terms on the basis that he had not read it. Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Robinson, [1915] A.C. 740; Hood v. Anchor Line, [1918] A.C. 837, quoted and applied; Nunan v. Southern Railway Company, [1923] 2 K.B. 703 at 707, approved; Parker v. The South Eastern Railway Company (1877), 2 C.P.D. 416 at 423, doubted.\nPer Rand and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): In the circumstances of this case, it could not be said that the defendant had taken reasonable steps to bring notice of the condition to the attention of the plaintiff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [2], affirming the judgment at trial [3]. Appeal allowed.\nL. S. Eckardt and A. H. Ainsworth, for the plaintiff, respondent, at the first hearing.\nA. Bull, Q.C., and J.I. Bird, for the defendant, appellant, at the first hearing.\nL. S. Eckardt, for the plaintiff, respondent, at the second hearing.\nJ. I. Bird, for the defendant, appellant, at the second hearing. RAND J. (dissenting):\u2014The question raised is whether a common carrier of passengers by water is entitled to rely on a condition printed on a ticket providing exemption from liability for negligence as forming a term of the carriage.\nThe vessel was engaged in a coastal service in British Columbia. The means employed was the printing on the ticket in small type and red ink of a notice that conditions were set forth on the back; and a line was provided for the passenger's name, whether for signature or mere insertion is not made clear. The respondent and his family had been taken aboard about 5 o'clock a.m., December 29, 1951 by means of a sling. Accompanied by them and a steward, he went to the purser's office to purchase passage and stateroom tickets to the next port of call. In the meantime, while the tickets were being purchased, the ship was already on her way out of the harbour. The respondent noticed printing on the face of the passage ticket but did not read it or sign it. He was in a hurry to get his children abed which called for some clothes in the baggage. The steward, accompanied by the respondent for the purpose of pointing out the piece of baggage to be brought up, left the stateroom to go below. The respondent, passing through a door into a dark space, fell down a hatchway and was badly injured.\nThe rule of law governing that question I take to be this: was what was done by the carrier reasonably sufficient to bring to the attention of the passenger\u2014himself acting with the alertness of the ordinary man\u2014this exceptional condition? Although Canadian courts, in contrast with those of many jurisdictions in the United States, have declined to hold that a common carrier cannot contract out for negligence, yet the requirement of notice laid down is intended to ensure that effective means within the range of reasonable action in the circumstances shall be employed to apprise a passenger of exceptional terms, in derogation of its common law duty, on which the carrier professes to undertake the transportation. Whatever the practicality of the choice presented by such a notice may be, theoretically, what is done must be such as is deemed to have brought notice of it to the patron's attention. In the circumstances here it seems almost absurd to say that the passenger, already on his voyage, can be said to have been given reasonable notice of such an extreme and unusual term of the ticket, or, as it is put, that the carrier had taken reasonable steps to bring it to his attention. Everything was hurried; his getting aboard, the vessel getting under weigh, the purchase of the tickets with the steward at his elbow, the settling of the family in the stateroom and the hastening for the baggage. One has only to imagine the incongruity of stopping to examine a ticket in such surroundings to ascertain its terms.\nIt is in these conditions that the company claims to be able to say to him: \"We told you that we carried only at your own risk of injury through our negligence and this you accepted.\" The examination of the ticket would, in those circumstances, be made by no person and none would anticipate such a condition. With an intention to carry passengers only at their own risk, one would have thought that common candour would make this known not by small letters on a small ticket but, at least in addition, by means that would make that important fact known almost to the dullest. It was not a case of a special feature: it was a regular ticket sold at the regular fare for passage on the regular service. If the company should object to advertising its terms in the suggested manner, for what reason would that be?\nI can think of none other than that such an advertisement would not promote patronage. This would mean that passengers generally did not read the conditions and that there was no reason to provoke discussion on the matter unnecessarily; it would be sufficient when the passenger was injured to invite his attention to the terms of the ticket. Accidents would be relatively few and injuries would not be as objectionable a means of publication as the open notice.\nSuch a conditioned service could amount to a virtual deception of passengers. That it could be reasonable to place carriage of this nature at the entire risk of the passenger I agree; the special circumstances of a local accommodation in given areas even at that risk could no doubt be of much convenience to residents along the coast. But equally the terms of the accommodation should be openly avowed. I do not examine the question whether the undertaking, commenced when the passenger boarded and the ship weighed anchor, continued regardless of the terms on the ticket; I will assume that the passenger, knowing he must buy a ticket, agreed in advance that it should govern the carriage from the beginning.\nThat in these conditions the company has failed in its duty of constructive notification is supported by what has been laid down in the courts of England and Scotland. In Henderson et al. (Steam-Packet Company) v. Stevenson [4], which, as here, was a case of carrier by water, the language of Lord O'Hagan at p. 481, although more exacting, perhaps, than the decision of the House can be said to have been, is peculiarly apposite in indicating the background of general considerations in which the question is to be viewed:\u2014\nWhen a company desires to impose special and most stringent terms upon its customers, in exoneration of its own liability, there is nothing unreasonable in requiring that those terms shall be distinctly declared and deliberately accepted; and that the acceptance of them shall be unequivocally shewn by the signature of the contractor. So the Legislature have pronounced, as to cases of canals and railways, scarcely distinguishable in substance and principle from that before us; and if the effect of your Lordships' affirmation of the interlocutor of the Lord Ordinary be to compel some precaution of this kind, it will be manifestly advantageous in promoting the harmonious action of the law, and in protecting the ignorant and the unwary.\nIn Parker v. The South Eastern Railway Company [5], the duty of the company is stated by Mellish L.J. in these words:\u2014\nBut if what the railway company did is not sufficient to convey to the minds of people in general that the ticket contains conditions, then they have received goods on deposit without obtaining the consent of the persons depositing them to the conditions limiting their liability \u2026that if he knew there was writing on the ticket, but did not know or believe that the writing contained conditions, nevertheless he would be bound, if the delivering of the ticket to him in such a manner that he could see there was writing upon it, was, in the opinion of the jury, reasonable notice that the writing contained conditions.\nHood v. Anchor Line [6]. In this case a steamship passage ticket was enclosed in an envelope, delivered to the passenger, on the front of which was printed in capital letters a notice requesting the passenger to read the conditions of the enclosed contract. The ticket itself, on its face, contained a notice that it was issued subject to conditions thereinafter set out and at the foot was a printed request to the passenger to read the contract carefully. The House of Lords held the steamship company to have taken all reasonable steps to bring to the knowledge of the passenger the existence of the conditions. Viscount Haldane at p. 843 considered the duty of the steamship company to depend upon the accepted standards of conduct according to which\na reasonable man ought to behave in these circumstances towards the neighbour towards whom he is bound by the necessities of the community to act with forebearance and consideration.\nAnd on p. 844, he defined the duty of the company:\u2014\nMy Lords, I agree that the appellant here (the passenger) was entitled to ask that all that was reasonably necessary as a matter of ordinary practice should have been done to bring to his notice the fact that the contract tendered to him when he paid his passage money excluded the right which the general law would give him, unless the contract did exclude it, to full damage if he was injured by the negligence of those who contracted to convey him on their steamer. Whether all that was reasonably necessary to give him his notice was done is, however, a question of fact, in answering which the tribunal must look at all the circumstances and the situation of the parties.\nIn Fosbroke-Hobbes v. Airwork Ltd., and British-American Air Services, Ltd. [7], an aeroplane had been hired for the carriage of the hirer and a party of guests. Just as it was preparing to set off, an envelope containing a \"ticket\" was handed to the hirer by the pilot. The ticket was a document called a \"special charter\" which contained, among other things, a number of conditions, one of which exempted the owners from liability for their own or their servants' negligence. The ticket contemplated signature by the passenger and its return when signed to one of the owners' officials. Before the hirer had an opportunity of seeing the contents of the envelope, the aeroplane started on its journey and almost immediately crashed. It was held by Goddard J., now Lord Goddard L.C.J., that the condition exempting the owner from liability was not binding on the hirer.\nMany cases have been brought to our attention in which some special character of the service or the passenger was involved such as workmen's tickets, excursion or special fares. In these instances the special feature itself to the ordinary patron would suggest special terms; and this circumstance plus a notice of conditions on the face of the ticket, with or without other acts of notification, can, in general, under the circumstances in which such services are ordinarily engaged, be found to be a compliance with the obligation on the carrier.\nFor these reasons I am unable to say that the Court of Appeal was wrong in finding that the company had not taken sufficient steps to give notice of the condition to the respondent and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [8] which dismissed an appeal by the present appellant from the judgment for damages awarded by Wilson J. at the trial [9].\nThe appellant owns and operates a line of steamships carrying passengers and freight along the west coast of British Columbia. During the early morning hours of December 29, 1951, the Catala, of the appellant's line, called at Brem River on Toba Inlet to pick up passengers. The only description of the facilities for the embarkation of passengers is that given by the respondent, who said that it was a \"float landing\" and that he and his wife and their children and his brother-in-law were picked up in a sling and lowered to the deck. Their luggage had been taken on board prior to this in the same manner.\nThe respondent and his wife and children were going to Westview, British Columbia, a settlement adjoining Powell River. The appellant did not maintain any place for selling tickets at Brem River and these were purchased by the respondent from the purser shortly after he went aboard. The only account of what took place when the tickets were bought is that of the respondent who said that he went to a wicket at the purser's office and bought tickets for himself and his wife, and for a stateroom, and that without looking at the tickets he put them in his pocket and went to the stateroom. He stated that he had no conversation with the purser about the tickets. A steward showed the respondent and his family to their room.\nApparently, the luggage had been placed in one of the holds and, shortly after they had gone to the stateroom, the respondent's wife asked him to get some articles out of their bags and he proceeded, with the steward who had shown them to their stateroom, to get the articles required. En route, in the darkness, he fell into a hatchway which was either unlighted or insufficiently lighted and suffered the injuries which gave rise to the action.\nThere are concurrent findings that these injuries were sustained due to the negligence of the steward and no question is raised as to this on the appeal, the only matter to be determined being whether, in view of the terms of the ticket purchased by the respondent, he has any enforceable claim.\nOn the face of the ticket it was stated to be good for the passage from Brem River to Powell River, where passengers for Westview would disembark, when stamped by the company's agent and presented with the coupon attached, and beneath this there appeared in red type the following words:\u2014\nThis ticket is issued subject to the conditions of carriage of passengers and baggage endorsed on the back hereof and those posted in the Company's office.\nOn the reverse side of the ticket there appeared in red type:\u2014\nThis ticket is good only for one month from date of issue as stamped on back. It is not transferable, no stop-over will be allowed and the person using it assumes all risk of loss or injury to person or property while on the vessel or while embarking or disembarking, even though such loss or injury is caused by the negligence or default of the shipowner, its servants or agents, or othewise howsoever.\nThe holder hereof in accepting this ticket thereby agrees to all the conditions stipulated thereon.\nBelow this there was stamped: \"Union Steamships Limited, Dec. 29, 1951, S.S. Catala.\"\nThe respondent is a logger by occupation and had been engaged in logging camps on the British Columbia coast for some fifteen years and had frequently travelled on vessels of the appellant company. He had a public school education. Cross-examined, he said that he knew there was some writing on the front part of the ticket but he did not read it and he did not look on the back. He was not asked, either in direct or cross-examination, as to whether he knew that there were any conditions affecting his passage endorsed anywhere on the ticket nor, indeed, whether, by reason of having travelled many times on the Union Steamship vessels, he was aware that their tickets were endorsed with any clause limiting their liability for negligence.\nThe defendants did not call the purser or anyone else who was present when the tickets were sold to the respondent.\nThe learned trial judge made the following findings:\u2014\nInsofar as the form of the ticket is concerned it seems to me to be such that a reasonable attempt is made to bring to the attention of the passenger the conditions under which he is to be carried. The plaintiff did not in fact read the ticket and was unaware of the conditions endorsed thereon. He was not asked to agree to them, nor were they verbally or by any notice posted at the ticket booth brought to his notice.\nReferring then to a passage said to have been taken from the judgment of Anglin J., as he then was, in Grand Trunk Pacific Coast Steamship Company v. Simpson [10], as to the burden of proof, he held that \"considering the hour and the circumstances, I think he had no reasonable opportunity to read the ticket\", and that the defendant had not discharged the burden which rested upon it.\nIn the Court of Appeal [11], O'Halloran J.A., who adopted the reasons delivered by Sidney Smith J.A., further expressed the opinion that the issuing of the ticket by the carrier and its acceptance by the respondent did not constitute a contract between them, the ticket being in reality no more than a receipt and that, accordingly, the conditions afforded no defence. Sidney Smith J.A., saying that the trial judge had said that the carrier had failed to satisfy him that reasonable means had been adopted to bring the limitative conditions to the attention of the respondent, considered that this finding of fact should not be disturbed. That learned judge did not mention the finding at the trial that the form of the ticket was a reasonable attempt to bring the conditions to the attention of the passenger. Davey J.A., who said that he was in substantial agreement with Sidney Smith J.A., referred to the finding at the trial that a reasonable attempt had been made, as far as the form of the ticket was concerned, to bring the special condi- tions to the respondent's notice but that the trial judge had properly treated that finding as indecisive, for the conditions would not bind the respondent \"unless he should have known the ticket was a contract or that it contained the special condition\".\nThe ticket which the respondent purchased from the purser does not, as in Simpson's Case, contain a long series of printed conditions. There is but the one condition which is the one in question. It is difficult to think of a means whereby the attention of the purchaser of a steamship ticket could be better directed to its terms than by printing in red letters the notice which appeared on the face of the ticket in this matter. The language of the condition is perfectly clear. It is printed in red and the concluding sentence reads:\u2014\nThe holder hereof in accepting this ticket thereby agrees to all the conditions stipulated thereon.\nThe trial judge, while making the finding to which I have referred, was of the opinion, however, that, considering the hour and the circumstances, the respondent had no reasonable opportunity to read the ticket. As to this, it should be said that there is no evidence as to the lighting in the Catala, in front of the purser's office or in the passageway leading to the stateroom or in the stateroom itself. Neither the respondent nor the witnesses called on his behalf gave any evidence on this point and I think it should not be assumed against the appellant that there was not the usual lighting in steamers of this kind on the west coast, or that the respondent could not have readily read the conditions of the ticket had he taken the trouble to do so. The fact that it was early in the morning when the respondent and his family boarded the steamer does not seem to me, with respect, to affect the matter. It would, of course, be dark at this early hour in the morning in December, but I am unable to see how, in the absence of any evidence to indicate that the ship was not properly lighted, this can have any relevance.\nIn addition to saying that the ticket was issued subject to the conditions endorsed on the back of it, reference is made to \"those posted in the company's office\", and there is again no evidence as to whether any such conditions were so posted or what they were. In the absence of any such evidence, it is to the ticket alone that one must look if, indeed, a contract was made on its terms.\nThe question to be determined is one that is of general importance, particularly to carriers of passengers by sea who undertake the transport of passengers from places where there are no ticket offices in which tickets are sold, these, of necessity, being purchased aboard ship. In the case of a carrier such as the present appellant, it is a matter of common knowledge on the west coast that their passenger vessels stop at many small places between Alaska and Vancouver where it is not practical to maintain such offices and where there are no docks from which passengers may embark. Persons wishing to travel upon these vessels are well aware that these conditions prevail and that tickets for passage must be purchased on board from the purser.\nThere is a vast number of reported cases in which the liability of carriers of passengers for reward has been considered, where the tickets sold exempted the carrier from liability for the negligence of its employees. Any difficulty arising in determining the question of liability in a particular case appears to me to arise from the task of reconciling what has been said in some of the leading cases as to the applicable principles of law with statements made in others.\nThere was at the time in question no law which prevented the appellant company from entering into an agreement with a passenger which would relieve it from liability for injuries caused by the negligence of its employees. It is further to be remembered that the appellant obtained at the trial a finding that there had been on the part of the appellant a reasonable attempt to bring to the attention of the passenger the conditions under which he was to be carried. This finding in itself distinguishes the case from such cases as Simpson's Case, supra, where the jury had found that, while the plaintiff knew there was writing or printing on her ticket, the company had failed to do what was reasonably sufficient to give her notice of the conditions which it contained. I do not regard that case as declaring any principle which affects the present matter. I do not think that what was said by Mellish L.J. in Parker v. The South Eastern Railway Company [12], can be taken without qualification to state the true principle to be applied in such cases. That case was in regard to a contract for the storage of luggage in a railway station, and the question considered in the Court of Appeal was whether the trial judge had left the proper questions to the jury.\nMellish L.J. said in part (p. 423) :\u2014\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the proper direction to leave to the jury in these cases is, that if the person receiving the ticket did not see or know that there was any writing on the ticket, he is not bound by the conditions; that if he knew there was writing, and knew or believed that the writing contained conditions, then he is bound by the conditions; that if he knew there was writing on the ticket, but did not know or believe that the writing contained conditions, nevertheless he would be bound, if the delivering of the ticket to him in such a manner that he could see there was writing upon it, was, in the opinion of the jury, reasonable notice that the writing contained conditions.\nAs to the first of these three propositions stated in such absolute terms, there is room, in my opinion, for grave doubt. It is unnecessary to consider its accuracy in disposing of the present matter. Mellish L.J., having thus stated the matter, concluded, however, by saying that the real question was whether the railway company did what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the condition.\nThe matter is expressed somewhat differently in the judgment of Viscount Haldane L.C. in Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Robinson [13]. In that case, the plaintiff who was travelling at half fare on a freight train, in charge of a horse, was carried pursuant to a contract in a form approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners which bore across the fact of it, in large red type, the words \"Read this Special Contract\". The contract was made on his behalf by the owner of the horse and neither of the parties read its conditions, which provided that the passenger was carried at his own risk. It was not suggested in the case that the carrier made any misrepresentation as to the nature of the contract, or that the owner or the passenger did not have an opportunity to read its terms: they simply did not do so. As to this, the Lord Chancellor said (p. 748) :\u2014 Moreover, if the person acting on his behalf has himself not taken the trouble to read the terms of the contract proposed by the company in the ticket or pass offered, and yet knew that there was something written or printed on it which might contain conditions, it is not the company that will suffer by the agent's want of care. The agent will, in the absence of something misleading done by his company, be bound, and his principal will be bound through him. To hold otherwise would be to depart from the general principles of necessity recognized in other business transactions, and to render it impracticable for railway companies to make arrangements for travellers and consignors without delay and inconvenience to those who deal with them.\nLater, he continued saying:\u2014\nThe company owes the passenger no duty which the contract is expressed on the face of it to exclude, and if he has approbated that contract by travelling under it he cannot afterwards reprobate it by claiming a right inconsistent with it.\nThis is to be compared with the third of the propositions stated in the judgment of Mellish L.J. in Parker's Case, supra. The difference is material: it is if the person contracting knew that there was something written or printed on it which might contain conditions, and not if the writing on the ticket constituted reasonable notice that the writing contained conditions.\nIn Hood v. Anchor Line [14], Viscount Haldane reiterated what he had said in Robinson's Case, that the question as to whether what was reasonably necessary to be done to draw the passenger's attention to the terms of the contract was, in substance, one of fact. Lord Finlay L.C., referring to Parker's Case, said that it showed that (p. 842)\nif it is found that the company did what was reasonably sufficient to give notice of conditions printed on the back of a ticket the person taking the ticket would be bound by such conditions.\nLord Parmoor, after saying that the Lord Ordinary had found that the respondent had done what was reasonably sufficient to give the appellant notice of the conditions, said that it was not material that other or different steps might have been taken, and that a clearly-printed notice on the envelope which enclosed the ticket and on the face of the ticket was as effective for this purpose as if the representative of the respondents had, at the time when he issued the ticket, verbally called the attention of the appellant to the conditions and asked him to read them. The result of the decisions appears to me to be accurately summarized by Swift J. in Nunan v. Southern Railway Company [15]:\u2014\nA number of cases were cited to me to show how the Courts had dealt with the question of fact to be determined in this case in various circumstances. I have examined those cases for the purpose of ascertaining in what way a jury should be directed to approach the consideration of such a question of fact if the matter had been one to be decided by them. I am of opinion that the proper method of considering such a matter is to proceed upon the assumption that where a contract is made by the delivery, by one of the contracting parties to the other, of a document in a common form stating the terms upon which the person delivering it will enter into the proposed contract, such a form constitutes the offer of the party who tenders it, and if the form is accepted without objection by the person to whom it is tendered this person is as a general rule bound by its contents and his act amounts to an acceptance of the offer to him whether he reads the document or otherwise informs himself of its contents or not, and the conditions contained in the document are binding upon him; but that if there be an issue as to whether the document does contain the real intention of both the parties the person relying upon it must show either that the other party knew that there was writing which contained conditions or that the party delivering the form had done what was reasonably sufficient to give the other party notice of the conditions, and that the person delivering the ticket was contracting on the terms of those conditions.\nThis statement was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Thompson v. London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company [16], per Lord Hanworth M.R. at p. 47.\nI have examined the reasons for judgment delivered at the trial which are contained in the file forwarded to this Court and are reproduced in the printed case at p. 111. There is an inaccuracy in the passage quoted from the reasons of Anglin J. in Simpson's Case. As quoted it reads:\u2014\nThe burden is on the defendant to show that it has done all that it could to bring the limitative conditions to the plaintiff's notice.\nThe sentence, as it appears in the Reports of this Court at p. 378 of 63 S.C.R. (and in [1922] 2 W.W.R. at p. 331), reads that the burden is\nto show that it has done all that could reasonably be required to bring the limitative conditions to the plaintiff's notice.\nIt is the latter of these statements that is supported by authority, the former is not, and if it were applied as the test it would be error. Whether it was applied does not appear to me to be clear since it was followed by a further quotation from the reasons of Anglin J. in which the expression \"whether the carrier has done what was reasonably sufficient\" appears.\nThe reasons do not suggest what other efforts the carrier might reasonably have been expected to make to bring the conditions to the passenger's attention. The suggestion that a carrier should be required to give a verbal notice, in addition to the printed notice, was rejected by Lord Finlay L.C. and Lord Parmoor in Hood's Case. The respondent admitted that he saw that there was writing on the face of the ticket and I think he must be taken to be thereby affected with knowledge that what was written referred to the contract of carriage and with notice of what would have been disclosed had he read it.\nI can find no evidence in the record to support the statement that the respondent had no reasonable opportunity to read the ticket and it is to be noted that Davey J.A. was of the opinion that it could not be supported. In my opinion, the issue in the present matter is determined by the finding of fact that the endorsement on the face of the ticket printed in red ink and referring to the conditions endorsed on its reverse side constituted a reasonable attempt to bring to the passenger's attention the terms of the contract and I consider that his acceptance of the ticket without protest and embarking upon the voyage precludes him from reprobating its terms, relying upon the fact that he did not read it.\nI would allow this appeal with costs throughout, if demanded.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [17] affirming a judgment of Wilson J. [18] in favour of the respondent for $10,328.50 damages for personal injuries.\nIn this, court no question was raised as to the amount of damages or as to the injuries suffered by the respondent having been caused by the negligence of the appellant's servant. The submission of the appellant is that it is relieved from liability by the conditions printed on the ticket purchased by the respondent.\nCounsel for the respondent does not attack the form of the ticket, which bore a notice on its face printed plainly in red ink stating that it was issued subject to the conditions on its back, conditions which, in turn, were clearly and legibly printed.\nOn the uncontradicted evidence the respondent did not read the ticket, he simply put it in his pocket and proceeded to his stateroom. There is no evidence that he had any actual knowledge of the fact that the appellant proposed to make it a condition of the contract of carriage that he must bear all the risk of injury resulting from the negligence of its servants, nor is there any evidence that he knew that the ticket had printed upon it either conditions or the terms of a proposed contract. The respondent stated that there was writing on the front part of the ticket but that he did not look at the writing \"so as to read it\".\nOn its facts this case does not fall within the line of cases in which a passenger knows that his ticket has printed upon it the terms of a proposed contract and, with such knowledge, does not bother to read it.\nIn my opinion the evidence supports the concurrent findings of fact in the courts below that the appellant has failed to satisfy the onus of shewing that reasonable means were adopted to bring the proposed condition relieving it from liability for the negligence of its servants to the attention of the respondent, \"in\", to use. the words of Sidney Smith J.A., \"the obvious realities of the situation\".\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, if demanded.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Jestley, Morrison, Eckardt & Goldie, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Campney, Owen, Murphy & Owen, Vancouver.\n[1] Reporter\u2019 s Note: The appeal was first argued on Oct. 26 and 27, 1955, before Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Fauteux JJ.

Co. carried on a business of operating or managing mining properties on behalf of others, advising on questions of mining and metallurgy, and supplying the services of qualified mining engineers for persons who required them. It entered into an agreement with T. Co. (a mining company) to provide \u201can engineer\u2019s services\u201d for a stated number of days in each month, in return for a monthly \u201cretainer\u201d. H, a qualified mining engineer employed by G. Co., was the person most frequently consulted by T. Co. While the agreement was still in effect H learned of a discovery made by a prospector who was not in any way connected with T. Co., and went to inspect the claims. Before leaving he had a telephone conversation with the president of T. Co., in which he told him that he was going on a trip for other clients and if possible would \u201cget some claims staked in the same approximate area\u201d for T. Co. He secured an option on the claims and then returned to Toronto, where he and the officers of G. Co. proceeded to raise the money to take up the option. He offered T. Co. an opportunity to participate, but this offer was declined. T. Co. later brought this action, claiming an accounting of the profits made by the defendants out of the transaction, on the ground that all claims and other mining interests or properties that came to H\u2019s attention were to be submitted to T. Co.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. dissenting), the action must fail. The written agreement was not ambiguous in its terms, and it did not require G. Co. and its employees to bring to the plaintiff\u2019s attention any properties or prospects of which they learned, or impose any of the other obligations suggested by the plaintiff. This was a complete answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Nothing in the telephone conversation before H\u2019s trip had the effect of imposing such an obligation on the defendants. Per Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J., dissenting: In all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, and particularly the telephone conversation, the acquisition of these claims by H on behalf of himself and the other defendants constituted a breach of trust, and the plaintiff was therefore entitled to the profits made by them as a result of that breach of trust.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Gale J.[2], dismissing the action.\nT. Sheard, Q.C., S.H. Robinson, Q.C., and W.D. Jordan, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., F.A. Beck, Q.C., and A. Findlay, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014For the reasons given by Roach J.A. the appeal should be allowed except as against the defendant Geco Mines Limited, as to which the action stands dismissed. In my opinion, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the other defendants for the amount of profits which they recovered on the transfer to Geco Mines Limited of their title to or interests in all the claims in question in this action. This is not the view of the majority of the members of this Court and it therefore becomes unnecessary to decide whether interest should be allowed by the Senior Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario, to whom I would have referred the matter. The plaintiff would be entitled as against those other defendants to its costs of the action and of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this Court, while no costs would be payable to Geco Mines Limited in any Court.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal taken by the present appellant from the judgment of Gale J. at the trial2, by which the appellant\u2019s action was dismissed. Roach and J.K. Mackay JJ.A. dissented and would have allowed the appeal. The appellant is a mining company incorporated under the Ontario Companies Act in the year 1935 and, during the period with which we are concerned, owned certain mining properties in the province, carried on prospecting and held shares in other mining companies.\nThe respondent Hargraft is a mining engineer, with some 28 years\u2019 experience, employed by the respondent The General Engineering Company Limited, at the city of Toronto. The activities of this company may be generally described as those of operating or supervising the management of mining properties on behalf of others, advising on questions of mining and metallurgy and supplying the services of qualified mining engineers for those requiring the same.\nIn the year 1946 the appellant company had acquired a number of properties in the neighbourhood of Geraldton, Ontario, and employed Hargraft to supervise and direct the operations on them and the exploration of their various claims. In 1948 the appellant dispensed with his services and he entered the employ of the General Engineering company. Thereafter, by arrangements made by the appellant with that company, Hargraft rendered professional services to the appellant from time to time. The terms of these arrangements do not affect the matter to be decided in this action.\nOn January 22, 1952, the appellant wrote to the General Engineering company a letter which read as follows:\u2014\nThis is to confirm our recent discussion regarding an engineering contract for the year 1952.\nOur understanding is that you will be paid a retainer of $200.00 per month. We will be given a monthly credit of an engineer\u2019s services of five days per month\u2014any time exceeding five days to be charged at $35.00 per day. It is understood, of course, that travelling expenses are extra.\nThe above is satisfactory to this Company, and we would ask you to please confirm if this is your understanding.\nThis letter was written on the appellant\u2019s behalf by J.A. Grant, its president, and the principal witness on its behalf at the trial.\nOn January 26, 1952, the General Engineering company wrote to Mr. Grant acknowledging the letter and confirming\nthe agreement covering our work as Mining Consultants to Tombill Gold Mines Limited for the year 1952. No correspondence was exchanged between the parties in regard to the year 1953 but, as found by the learned trial judge, the engagement was continued in that year on the same terms, save that the monthly fee of $200 was reduced to $100 and the number of days for which the appellant was to have what was referred to as \u201ca monthly credit of an engineer\u2019s services of five days per month\u201d was reduced to 2\u00bd days per month.\nWhile evidence was given of discussions which took place between the parties prior to January 22, 1952, and minutes of certain directors\u2019 meetings of the appellant in which the matter was discussed were put in evidence, none of these was admissible, in my opinion, the agreement covering the period in question having been reduced to writing and there being no attempt made to impeach its terms.\nIt is upon this agreement that the appellant must rely in support of the claim pleaded in para. 12 of the statement of claim in the following terms which, while relating to the earlier employment in the year 1949, are said to apply to the agreement made in respect of the year 1953:\u2014\nUnder the terms of its employment the Defendant The General Engineering Company Limited was to make available to the Plaintiff and the said Defendant did make available to the Plaintiff the services of the Defendant Hargraft to supervise the Plaintiff\u2019s further exploration of its mining properties and to seek out and develop new mining properties for the Plaintiff particularly in the Port Arthur Mining Division. All mining properties and interests in mining properties and options to purchase mining properties and interests in mining properties available for acquisition which came to the attention of the Defendant Hargraft and which he considered to have merit were to be submitted to the Plaintiff. In 1949 the said Defendant The General Engineering Company Limited was so employed on a retainer basis for a period of six months, and during 1950 was so employed on a per diem basis and from January 1st, 1951 was so employed continuously on an annual retainer basis plus a per diem charge to be made under certain circumstances.\nAt the time the agreements relating to the years 1952 and 1953 were made, the General Engineering company was actively engaged in carrying on its business, of the nature above referred to, at Toronto. In addition to managing certain mining properties, the services of its mining engineers were available to those requiring professional services of this nature. While this was undeniably so, the appellant takes the attitude that throughout this period and, indeed, continuously since the year 1949, an obligation had rested upon the General Engineering company to bring any mining properties or mineral claims, or, presumably, information received by them from prospectors in regard to ground that was not staked, to the attention of the appellant company. A company engaged in the activities carried on by the General Engineering company might, of course, agree to do this for reward but, as a practical matter, it appears to me inconceivable that it would do so for an amount such as was stipulated for in the agreement made in respect of the year 1953 or in any of the preceding years.\nThe agreement, it may be noted, does not stipulate anything of the kind and this is decisive of the question. The learned trial judge and all of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have arrived at this conclusion.\nDuring the year 1953, prior to the acquisition of the properties to which this action relates, Hargraft had rendered services to the appellant in regard to a uranium property in Saskatchewan and a nickel prospect in the Emo area of Ontario, and Grant had on very many occasions consulted him about various properties as to which he sought information. These were, apparently, all in respect of properties which had come to Grant\u2019s attention from other sources.\nShortly following July 14, 1953, the General Engineering company received a letter dated at Geraldton from a prospector, Roy Barker, which said:\u2014\nDear Mr. Hargraft\nWe have been prospecting this spring and have found a big break that looks good to us.\nWe have sent samples to Milton Hersey Wpg. and Bell Haileybury, they say our average samples sent [sic] 7% copper and 25% zinc in one sample sent.\nWe are sending you some samples, if you care to check these assays and are interested let us know. It\u2019s a new part for prospecting.\nBarker was a part-time prospector who was not connected in any way with the appellant company, though he had on an earlier occasion endeavoured to interest it in a prospect which Hargraft had looked at for the appellant and found worthless.\nThe General Engineering company was at the time engaged in some mill construction work for the McLeod Cockshutt Mining Company which had an operating mine adjoining the property of the appellant, and Hargraft had intended going to Geraldton in connection with this work early in August and wrote to Barker on July 20, 1953 suggesting he would meet him then. As a result, however, of a further message from Barker, he decided to go earlier and wired saying that he would be there on July 28.\nIt is necessary in Ontario, to enable a person to stake a mineral claim, to have a miner\u2019s licence issued under the provisions of The Mining Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 236. During the year 1946 when Hargraft, before associating himself with the General Engineering company, had been employed by the appellant, the latter had obtained a mining licence in his name and this had been renewed and the annual fee of $5 paid by the appellant between that time and the time in question. Hargraft had discussed with the two Hamiltons who were principals in the General Engineering company the letter from Barker and they had agreed with him to share the expense of examining the property, the location of which was then unknown to any of them. As doing this might require the staking of other claims, Hargraft telephoned to Grant to get the number of his own mining licence. According to Hargraft, he had earlier that spring spoken to Grant about his licence saying that he preferred to renew it himself, but Grant had said that as it was only a matter of $5 he would renew it with his own. Such licences expire annually on March 31. Hargraft said that when he telephoned to Grant he asked if the latter had renewed the licence and asked for the number, saying that he was going on a trip for other clients and that \u201cif it was possible I would try and get some claims staked in the same approximate area if I could for Tombill\u201d. According to Grant, when Hargraft telephoned he had asked for his (Grant\u2019s) mining licence and then said he would like to have his own licence and asked for the number of it. Grant said he gave the information requested. He remembered nothing about any further conversation at that time.\nHargraft went to Geraldton and met Barker and two other prospectors who were associated with him in staking the claims and proceeded by air to their location, which proved to be at a place some 80 miles south-east of Geraldton near Manitouwadge Lake. His examination showed Hargraft that the claims might be very valuable and, after arranging with prospectors to stake a number of additional claims adjoining those they had previously staked, and after going to the property of the McLeod Cockshutt company and doing the work for that company which he had proposed to do early in August, he returned to Toronto.\nMuch has been made in the case of the reference made by Hargraft, according to his own account, to the matter of \u201cother clients\u201d. Those to whom he referred were, according to him, named Easson and McConnell. According to Hargraft, before he had proceeded to the property, one of the Hamiltons had spoken to Easson while he himself had spoken to McConnell about this property that had been drawn to their attention and said that the latter had said that they could count on him up to $1,000. Neither Easson nor McConnell was called to give evidence and whatever discussion took place with either of these men appears to have amounted to nothing more than suggesting to them that they had what might be an interesting prospect which they might wish later to participate in and that McConnell, at least, agreed to contribute to the extent mentioned.\nOn his return to Toronto, having obtained an oral option for the claims, he and the Hamiltons proceeded to raise the money to comply with the terms of the option. None of the claims had been staked in the name of Tombill or on its behalf but, on instructions from the two Hamiltons, Hargraft telephoned to Grant on August 6 to offer the appellant an interest of 25 per cent. in the option. Hargraft\u2019s account of what took place differs to some extent from that of Grant. According to the former, he told him that he had returned from his trip, that the property was one that warranted further investigation and that a group was being formed to take it over, that it was a base metal property, and gave him the names of two of the prospectors. He said that he told Grant that the General Engineering company was to have the management both of the financing and of the property in the very early stages, to which Grant replied that he would have no part of anything that General Engineering was to manage and hung up the receiver, terminating the conversation. According to Grant, when Hargraft telephoned, he said that they had an option on a group of claims and were offering the Tombill company an opportunity to participate, though he did not say to what extent. Thereupon, according to Grant, he said they would not be interested, that General Engineering were acting for Tombill as consultants and the property would belong to Tombill. While Hargraft denies that the latter statement was made, the attitude said to have been expressed was at least consistent with the claim now advanced in the action.\nThereafter, the General Engineering company informed the Tombill company that they wished to terminate the arrangement existing between them and that Hargraft\u2019s services would be no longer available. Hargraft, the Hamiltons and their associates thereafter formed the respondent Geco Mines Limited and caused the claims, both those staked by Barker and his associates and those staked by them on Hargraft\u2019s direction, to be conveyed to that company and, apparently, profited greatly in the transaction.\nThe claim of the appellant as pleaded, that under the terms of the employment the General Engineering company undertook to seek out and develop mining properties for the plaintiff and that all mining properties and interests in mining properties and options to purchase mining properties and interests in mining properties available for acquisition which came to the attention of the defendant Hargraft and which he considered to have merit were to be submitted, failed. The agreement of January 22, 1952 is not ambiguous and it contains none of these suggested provisions. I have read with care all of the extensive evidence adduced at the trial of this action, apparently in an endeavour to establish that these obligations rested upon the General Engineering company. Even if this evidence as to what occurred between the parties prior to the agreement of January 22, 1952 had been admissible in evidence, and in my opinion none of it was, it would not support the appellant\u2019s claim. It is true that in some instances Hargraft suggested areas in which the appellant might conduct prospecting and examined some prospects which came to his attention in the course of work done by him for the appellant, as in the case of the worthless prospect located by Barker, but this cannot vary the terms of the written agreement or support the claims advanced in the terms hereinbefore quoted. This being so, I must confess my inability to understand how the discussions between Hargraft and Grant after Barker\u2019s letter of July 14, 1953 had been received but before the former left to examine the property, could have imposed upon Hargraft and his employers an obligation which theretofore did not exist. These respondents were under no duty to submit Barker\u2019s letter or the prospect referred to to the appellant. They were, as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, at perfect liberty to negotiate for the acquisition of these properties on their own behalf or on behalf of any other client. They had decided to investigate the property on their own behalf and had mentioned the matter to Easson and McConnell, suggesting that they had a prospect in which the latter might be interested, and McConnell had agreed to contribute to the expense of the examination. They had already decided upon this when Hargraft telephoned to Grant and asked for his mining licence and told him that they were going to examine a property for other clients and, if there was an opportunity, would stake some claims for Tombill. This was clearly simply gratuitous on the part of Hargraft and there is no pretence whatever in the evidence given on behalf of the appellant that it had been arranged that the trip which resulted in the staking of further claims and obtaining the option was made on behalf of the appellant. Hargraft and the Hamiltons had intended to offer a participation up to 25 per cent. to Tombill but, whether Grant\u2019s account of what occurred when Hargraft telephoned him on August 3 or that given by the latter be accepted, Grant refused to have anything to do with the matter and, according to Hargraft, terminated the conversation before he had an opportunity to offer him the proposed participation.\nHargraft clearly acted improperly when he obtained another mining licence and when the additional claims staked by Barker and his associates under Hargraft\u2019s licence were recorded. These matters are proper to be referred to as affecting his credit but, otherwise, have no bearing on the matter to be determined, which is one as to the construction of the written agreement. Whether it was inaccurate for him to say to Grant that he was going to examine the property on behalf of other clients is, in my opinion, equally irrelevant since he and the Hamiltons were completely free to stake the property on their own behalf if they wished to do so.\nIn agreement with the opinions expressed by the learned trial judge and the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, I consider that the evidence in this case does not disclose a cause of action and I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] affirming, by a majority, a judgment of Gale J.[4], dismissing the appellant\u2019s action with costs. Roach and J.K. Mackay JJ.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and awarded the appellant the relief claimed in the statement of claim, except as against the defendant Geco Mines Limited.\nThe relevant facts are fully set out in the reasons in the Courts below, [1954] O.R. at 871 and [1955] O.R. at 903, and it is not necessary to repeat them.\nI am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Roach J.A. but, as I am differing from the learned trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal, I propose to state my reasons briefly.\nExcept on one point, there appears to be little, if any, difference between the findings as to the primary facts made in any of the reasons given in the Courts below. The difference of opinion is as to whether on such facts it should be held that the dealings of the respondents other than Geco Mines Limited with the claims in question in this action fell within the scope of the employment of The General Engineering Company Limited as agent of the appellant and whether the acquisition of those claims was a benefit derived by the respondents from such agency.\nDuring the year 1952, the contractual relationship between the appellant and The General Engineering Company Limited was defined in a letter dated January 22, 1952, from the appellant to The General Engineering Company Limited reading as follows:\u2014\nThis is to confirm our recent discussion regarding an engineering contract for the year 1952. Our understanding is that you will be paid a retainer of $200.00 per month. We will be given a monthly credit of an engineer\u2019s services of five days per month\u2014any time exceeding five days to be charged at $35.00 per day. It is understood, of course, that travelling expenses are extra.\nThe above is satisfactory to this Company, and we would ask you to please confirm if this is your understanding.\nThis was assented to by The General Engineering Company Limited by a letter of January 26, 1952, reading as follows:\u2014\nWe wish to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of January 22nd, which sets forth our understanding of the agreement covering our work as Mining Consultants to Tombill Gold Mines Limited for the year 1952.\nIt is common ground that this contract was continued in 1953, subject to the variations that the monthly payment was reduced to $100 and the amount of engineer\u2019s services to be given was reduced to 2\u00bd days per month, and, so varied, was in force at the time of the events out of which this action arises.\nI do not find it necessary to consider the exact nature of the services which the appellant, under the terms of its contract, was entitled to call upon The General Engineering Company Limited to perform as it is clear that such services would include the examination by Hargraft of a specific property or area for the purpose of advising the appellant whether or not it should endeavour to acquire the same. It was not, and could not be, disputed that, if the appellant had heard of Barker\u2019s discovery from sources unconnected with the respondents and had asked The General Engineering Company Limited to make an examination and report to it, The General Engineering Company Limited could not have acquired the property for itself.\nAssuming the correctness of the view, entertained by all the judges in the Courts below, that the relationship between the parties in July and August 1953 was such that when Hargraft received Barker\u2019s letter of July 17, 1953, the respondents were free, if they saw fit, to acquire the claims for themselves, I am respectfully of opinion that the learned trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal have failed to give due weight to the arrangement made between Hargraft, representing the respondents, and J.A. Grant, representing the appellant, before the former set out for Geraldton. The effect of the evidence as to the conversation between the two is accurately summarized by Roach J.A. in the following paragraph in his reasons[5].\nAccepting everything that Hargraft swears he told Grant\u2014I am not concerned at the moment with what he now says he had in his mind and did not tell him\u2014it would certainly convey to Grant the meaning that General Engineering was sending Hargraft into the mining country on behalf of some other client and that while there he, Hargraft, would, if conditions were favourable, stake some claims for Tombill; it was for that purpose that Hargraft required the number of his miner\u2019s licence. That was agreeable to Grant. He apparently did not state in terms that he agreed. If any expenses were to be incurred in connection with that staking Tombill was liable for them under its contract, and there was no suggestion by Grant that Tombill did not want any expenses incurred on its behalf. Hargraft knew perfectly well that Grant was agreeing to the proposal on behalf of Tombill.\nIt is not open to doubt that if, after satisfying the requirements of the respondents\u2019 \u201cother clients\u201d, Hargraft had spent time making investigations and staking claims for the appellant, The General Engineering Company Limited could have treated the time so spent as a discharge pro tanto of its obligation to supply 2\u00bd days of engineer\u2019s service during the current month and could have required payment from the appellant at the contract rate for any additional time expended.\nIt is as to the existence of these \u201cother clients\u201d that the difference of opinion between the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal in regard to the primary facts arose. The learned trial judge says[6] in dealing with the conversation between Grant and Hargraft:\u2014\nAt that time Mr. Hargraft honestly believed, as was the fact, that others beside the defendants were to have an interest in any claims that might be staked or acquired. Two gentlemen by the names of Easson and McConnell had already been approached with respect to the proposition and had agreed to advance $1,000 each toward \u2018the acquisition of title to the claims involved. Those two persons, therefore, were the \u201cother clients\u201d whom Mr. Hargraft had in mind when he spoke to Mr. Grant on that occasion although I think it is only fair to say that it was also planned to include the General Engineering company in any allocation of the claims if they appeared to have merit. The view of the majority in the Court of Appeal is expressed as follows by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario[7]:\u2014\nHargraft made inquiry from the plaintiff as to the number of his licence for the purpose of staking the additional claims already referred to. At that time, he intimated to the president of the plaintiff company that he was going to Geraldton on behalf of other clients to look at certain property and that he might be able to stake some claims in the same area for the plaintiff. In my opinion, his statement to the president of the plaintiff company was untrue. It was true that he was going to Geraldton on the business of another client, but it was not true that he was going in to inspect the properties in question on behalf of other clients. He went to inspect those properties on behalf of himself and his associates.\nThe analysis of the evidence on this point made by Roach J.A. fully supports the conclusion, at which he also arrived, that there were no \u201cother clients\u201d on whose behalf the investigation of Barker\u2019s discovery was made by Hargraft.\nThere being then no \u201cother clients\u201d there remained the obligation undertaken by the respondents to the appellant, an obligation which prevented the former from acquiring the claims for themselves without being guilty of a breach of the fiduciary duty in relation to this particular property which they had undertaken in the arrangement made between Hargraft and Grant. I agree with Roach J.A. that the efficacy of this arrangement was not lessened by the circumstance that it was proposed by Hargraft to Grant.\nWe are not called upon to speculate as to the motives which prompted Hargraft to propose the arrangement which the evidence shews was made.\nIt is clear that once the true facts came to the knowledge of the appellant it promptly took the position that it was beneficially entitled to the claims in question.\nFor the reasons given by Roach J.A., with which I have already indicated my substantial agreement, and for those given above I would allow the appeal and direct judgment to be entered in the terms proposed in the final paragraph of the reasons of Roach J.A. As the majority of the Court are of opinion that the appeal fails it becomes unnecessary for me to consider whether the order referring the matter to the Master should provide for the charging of interest against the respondents. I would direct that the appellant recover its costs in this Court from the respondents other than Geco Mines Limited and would make no other order as to costs in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, KERWIN C.J. and CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Holden, Murdoch, Walton, Finlay & Robinson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: White, Bristol, Beck & Phipps, Toronto.\n[1] [1955] O.R. 903, [1955] 5 D.L.R. 708.\n[2] [1954] O.R. 871, [1955] 1 D.L.R. 101.\n[3] [1955] O.R. 903, [1955] 5 D.L.R. 708.\n[4] [1954] O.R. 871, [1955] 1 D.L.R. 101.\n[5] [1955] O.R. at 925.\n[6] [1954] O.R. at 879\n[7] [1955] O.R. at 916-7.\n",

Leslie (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Canadian Press (Defendant) Respondent.\n1956: June 18; 1956: October 2.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeals\u2014Ordering new trial on grounds of misdirection, etc.\u2014Whether substantial wrong or miscarriage occasioned\u2014Burden in this connection\u2014The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, s. 28(1).\nWhere a new trial of a civil action is sought on the ground of misdirection of the jury it is sufficient, under s. 28(1) of the Ontario Judicature Act, for the appellant to show that the misdirection may have affected the verdict; he is not required to show that it actually did so. If thereafter the appellate Court is in doubt as to whether it did or not, it is then for the respondent to show that the misdirection did not in fact affect the verdict. Storry v. C.N.R., [1941] 4 D.L.R. 169 at 174, disapproved.\nDefamation\u2014Defences\u2014Justification\u2014Fair and accurate report of judicial proceeding\u2014Charge to jury and jury\u2019s findings\u2014Whether substantial wrong or miscarriage occasioned\u2014The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, s. 28(1).\nAn action for libel was based upon the publication by the defendant of a newspaper account of the proceedings at a trial. The defendant pleaded both justification and that the words complained of constituted a fair and accurate report of proceedings in court. The jury found that the words were a report of judicial proceedings, that they were substantially true, but that they were not a fair and accurate report, and that they were \u201charmful without intent\u201d. On these findings the trial judge dismissed the action. Held, the judgment should be affirmed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ. The trial judge\u2019s directions to the jury did not make clear the distinction between the question whether the statements contained in the article were true and the question whether the article was a fair and accurate report of a judicial proceeding. But the jury by their answers had in fact distinguished between these questions, and the defendant had clearly shown that no substantial wrong or miscarriage had resulted from the misdirection; the appeal should therefore be dismissed under s. 28(1) of the Ontario Judicature Act.\nPer Rand J.: Although the record of the previous trial, to which the report related, did not of itself prove the truth of the matters stated, and could not be resorted to for the purposes of the plea of justification, the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence supplied any inadequacy there might otherwise have been in this respect. There was therefore evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding on this plea, and that finding was conclusive.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of LeBel J., after a trial with a jury, dismissing the action.\nG.A. Leslie, plaintiff, appellant, in person.\nP.B.C. Pepper, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an action for damages for an alleged libel contained in a dispatch sent out by the defendant, The Canadian Press, and appearing in a newspaper. On the first trial the case was withdrawn from the jury, but the Court of Appeal for Ontario directed a new trial whereat the presiding judge, after having received answers to questions put to the jury, dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal affirmed that decision and the plaintiff now appeals to this Court.\nThe Canadian Press accepts responsibility for the article in question which was printed in a newspaper published by one of its subscribing members. That article reads:\u2014\nToronto, June 12th,\u2014(C.P.) George A. Leslie, former house officer at the Royal York Hotel, used to take lengthy trips in a certain elevator, \u201csometimes for 15 minutes, sometimes for a whole hour.\u201d\nCatherine Ross, the elevator operator, today told a court hearing a slander suit in which Leslie is plaintiff that Leslie said he loved her and wanted her to go out with him.\nLeslie is suing L.C. Parkinson, hotel personnel manager, and the Canadian Pacific Railway, owner of the hotel, for alleged slander by Parkinson. Parkinson denied the charge. Miss Ross said the manager told Leslie to stay away from her and not talk to her, but Leslie persisted.\nMiss Ross, who said that Leslie was on duty during the times he rode in her elevator, used to ask her during the elevator trips to go out with him.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t like me snubbing him\u201d, she said.\nThe questions put to the jury on the second trial and their answers are as follows:\u2014\n1. Do you find the words complained of (including those in the first paragraph) a report on judicial proceedings? Answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Answer: Yes.\n2. Do yon find the words complained of substantially true or false? Answer either \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d. Answer: True.\n3. If your answer to Question No. 2 is \u201cfalse\u201d, do you find the words complained of defamatory of the plaintiff? Answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Answer:\n4. If your answer to Question No. 3 is \u201cyes\u201d, do you find the words complained of are substantially a fair and accurate report of the court proceedings in question? Answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Answer: No.\n5. Do you find the defendant, in writing this report, was actuated by malice? Answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Answer: Harmful without intent.\nThe directions of the trial judge to the jury were not clear as to distinguishing between the questions whether the statements contained in the article were true and whether the latter was a fair and accurate report of the proceedings of one day at the trial of the earlier action for slander, but the provisions of subs. (1) of s. 28 of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, require consideration. That subsection enacts:\u2014\n28. (1) A new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or because the verdict of the jury was not taken upon a question which the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to the jury, or by reason of any omission or irregularity in the course of the trial, unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\nThe terms of a similar provision in England were before the House of Lords in Bray v. Ford[1], and in several cases in Ontario, including the most recent one to which we were referred, Arland and Arland v. Taylor [2]. It was there pointed out by Laidlaw J.A., speaking on behalf of the Court, that in Storry v. C.N.R.[3], Chief Justice Robertson had said at p. 174:\u2014\nIn a criminal case...the appeal...is to be allowed unless the Court is \u201cof opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred\u201d (s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code). In a civil case the provision is that a new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection \u201cunless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned\u201d... The burden is on the respondent in the one case of showing that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, while in the other case the burden is on the appellant of showing that there was some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nAs Laidlaw J.A. points out, this opinion is in direct conflict with that expressed by Meredith C.J.C.P. in Gage v. Reid[4], which was apparently not referred to in the Storry case, and it is also in conflict with the opinions in Anthony v. Halstead[5], and White v. Barnes[6]. Laidlaw J.A. had also in Temple v. Ottawa Drug Company Limited et al.[7], expressed the view that \u201can appellant who seeks a new trial on the ground of misdirection must at least establish a doubt in the mind of the Court as to whether the misdirection occasioned a substantial wrong or miscarriage\u201d. There, and in the Arland case, he found it unnecessary to determine whether the onus rested on the appellant to show that such a result actually occurred. In Bray v. Ford[8] the House of Lords had not set forth any general rule. Bearing in mind the right of the plaintiff in such an action as this to have the issues passed upon by the jury, I am of opinion that the preferable rule and the one that should be adopted is that it is sufficient for the complaining party to show that a misdirection may have affected a verdict and not that it actually did so; and that, if an appellate Court is in doubt as to whether it did or not, it is then for the opposite party to show that the misdirection did not in fact affect the verdict. In the present case the defences set up by the respondent were: (1) That the statements were true; (2) that they were not defamatory; (3) that they constituted a fair and accurate report of judicial proceedings and were therefore privileged. Counsel for the defendant addressed the jury on all these defences and by their answers to questions 1 and 4 the jury were in fact distinguishing between the report of the slander action in the article complained of and the issue of the truth or falsity of the statements contained in it. I have not overlooked the fact that the efforts of counsel for the defendant had not succeeded in having the trial judge clarify the position, or the circumstance that the plaintiff, although having considerable experience in litigation, is not a lawyer and has acted for himself throughout these proceedings. Upon consideration of the entire record I am clearly of the opinion that the defendant has shown that no substantial wrong or miscarriage has been occasioned.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014This is an action for libel. It is brought on what purports to be a news report of evidence given at a trial in which the present plaintiff, the appellant, was suing one Parkinson and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for slander.\nThree defences are pleaded: justification, a fair and accurate report of a judicial proceeding, and that the words are not defamatory. The finding of the jury on the first ground was against the plaintiff; no answer was given to the third; and the second was found against the respondent. The determining question is whether the first finding was vitiated by the language of the charge or by a failure in proof.\nThat there was some confusion in the charge in relation to the first two grounds is conceded. The attention of the trial judge was drawn to it by Mr. Pepper but the correction exhibited the same confounding of a fair and accurate account of what had taken place with the truth of the facts to which the language related. In view of the action of the jury on the second question, the precaution to rely on the first plea appears to have been well advised.\nThe report, in the light of the jury\u2019s action, was a selection of items disclosed in the course of the trial and considered newsworthy through what, apparently, was thought to be their \u201cspiciness\u201d, and for the purposes of the second plea the record of the previous trial was put in evidence.\nAt the same time the main witness in the former case was called. She agreed that she had then been asked various questions and had given the answers which had previously been read in court, but she was not asked formally if the answers were true. In addition, she testified to certain of the primary facts. The ground was taken before us that the previous record of its own force could not be resorted to for the purposes of the plea of justification and that the respondent must rely on the testimony given by the witness alone.\nOn this view, which in the circumstances I consider to be sound, was there a sufficient foundation for the finding on that plea? On the testimony of the witness mentioned which was limited to what was thought to be the main item I should have held it insufficient.\nBut any inadequacy in this respect was supplied by the appellant himself. He admitted having made a remark to the effect of the significant item reported. That remark which gives colour to the course of conduct charged against him\u2014of wasting his time in one of the hotel elevators\u2014can be interpreted in two ways: as evidence either of a generous interest in the young woman operator\u2014an interest in which the appellant\u2019s wife was said to have participated\u2014or as a personal regard which led him to seek her company.\nWhich interpretation was to be given it was a question for the jury, to be found on a total of impressions and effects that are denied to a Court in appeal. The jury, it is true, is not infallible: it may have come to the wrong conclusion. The truth was hidden within the mind of the appellant and it may be that only an imaginative discrimination could appreciate the motivation for which he so strongly contended. But to the possible frailty of judgment of the jurors all such controversies are subject. The apparent inability of the appellant to realize the conclusive effect of the finding of justification is attributable to the fact that this selective report had in it nothing of significance or of serious interest to the reading public, and it was quite unnecessarily reported only because of the character of its matter. But that inability, however understandable, cannot affect the consequences of the verdict.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: John J.

(2). H.F. Parkinson, Q.C., and J.R. McCallum, for the appellant (respondent in the Court below).\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., and S. Paikin, for the respondent (applicant in the Court below).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014For the reasons given by Gale J.2 this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought pursuant to special leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming a judgment of Gale J.[2] ordering that certain resolutions passed by the appellant be removed into the Supreme Court of Ontario by way of certiorari.\nThe relevant facts are fully set out in the reasons for judgment of Gale J., with which I am in substantial agreement, and a brief summary of such facts will be sufficient for the purpose of indicating the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nThe resolutions in question were passed at a meeting held at 7 p.m. on July 29, 1953; they provided (i) that written notice be delivered to the occupants of a number of dwellings owned by the respondent requiring them to vacate the same within 14 days, and (ii) that any occupants who had not vacated the buildings at the expiration of the time stated in the notice should be forcibly evicted.\nThe proceedings before the appellant board were initiated by the medical officer of health and the sanitary inspector for the Township of Saltfleet who had inspected some of the buildings on the day on which the resolutions were passed. The respondent and several of the occupants had learned that the meeting had been convened to consider action such as was taken and attended to ascertain the nature of the complaints and to make submissions in answer to any adverse allegations as to the condition of the buildings. They were informed by members of the appellant board that the meeting was private and were denied any hearing. It was argued for the appellant that its action was the exercise of an administrative authority and not of a judicial or quasi-judicial function.\nThe appellant in passing the resolutions in question purported to act under s. 7 of the statutory by-law set out in sched. B to The Public Health Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 306, which reads as follows:\u2014\n7. If the local board is satisfied upon due examination that a cellar, room, tenement or building within the municipality, occupied as a dwelling place, has become by reason of the number of occupants, want of cleanliness, the existence therein of a communicable disease, or other cause, unfit for such purpose, or that it has become a nuisance, or in any way dangerous or injurious to the health of the occupants, or of the public, the board may give notice in writing to such occupants, or any of them, requiring the premises to be put in proper sanitary condition, or requiring the occupants to quit the premises within such time as the board may deem reasonable. If the persons so notified, or any of them, neglect or refuse to comply with the terms of the notice, every person so offending shall be liable to the penalties mentioned in section 35 of this by-law and the board may cause the premises to be properly cleansed at the expense of the owners or occupants or may remove the occupants forcibly and close up the premises, and the same shall not again be occupied as a dwelling place until put into proper sanitary condition.\nIt will be observed that it is a condition precedent to the exercise by the board of the power to require the occupants of a building to quit it and to remove them by force if they fail to do so that it shall be satisfied upon due examination that such building has become either (i) unfit for the purpose of a dwelling, or (ii) a nuisance, or (iii) in some way dangerous or injurious to the health of the occupants or of the public. I agree with Gale J. that in deciding whether or not such condition exists a duty to act judicially rests upon the board. It would, I think, require the plainest words to enable us to impute to the Legislature the intention to confer upon the local board the power to forcibly eject the occupants of a building for certain specified causes without giving such occupants an opportunity to know which of such causes was alleged to exist or to make answer to the allegation; and I find no such words in the statute or the schedule.\nOnce it has been decided that the board was under a duty to act judicially it is clear, for the reasons given by Gale J., that, the appellant having refused to listen to those whose rights would be vitally affected by the orders it proposed to make, s. 143 of The Public Health Act does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to proceed by way of certiorari.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the applicant, respondent: White, Paikin & Robson, Hamilton.\nSolicitors for the respondent, appellant: Robinson, McCallum & McKerracher, Hamilton.\n[1] [1955] O.W.N. 615, [1955] 3 D.L.R. 248.\n[2] [1954] O.R. 360, [1954] 3 D.L.R. 760.\n",

I DIRECT my Trustees to permit my son Charles James Moore and his wife Janet as long as either of them shall occupy the same to have the use and enjoyment of my property in the Municipality of Penticton British Columbia which is known as Lots Twenty-five and Twenty-six Block Twenty Map Nine Hundred and Thirty-seven free of any duty rent or taxes and I DIRECT that my trustees shall out of my Trust Fund pay the cost of maintaining any building thereon and the insurance of the same against damage by fire.\nA number of questions were raised in the originating summons and an amendment made thereto by consent but in the Court of Appeal it was agreed that that Court was called upon to decide only the three following questions:\u2014\n(1) Was the learned Judge right in holding that Clauses 6 and 7 of the Will were entirely void for uncertainty?\n(2) If not, is the restriction imposed by the words \"as long as either of them shall occupy the same\" void for uncertainty?\n(3) If the learned Judge was wrong in holding Clauses 6 and 7 entirely void for uncertainty, and if the restriction imposed by the words \"as long as either of them shall occupy the same\" is not void for uncertainty, what is the meaning and effect of Clauses 6 and 7 of the Will?\nIt will be observed that the only difference between the wording of clause 6 and that of clause 7 is as to the names of the son and his wife and the description of the property; and, for purposes of construction, it will be sufficient to consider the wording of clause 6.\nMacfarlane J. was of opinion that the words in this clause \"as long as either of them shall occupy the same\" constituted a determinable limitation and not a condition subsequent, that they were void for uncertainty and that, consequently, the gift failed. O'Halloran J.A. who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal was of the view that the words quoted were certain and unambiguous. The meaning he ascribes to them appears in clause (a) of the answer to question 3, set out above, as contained in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal; the complete answer to question 3 being as follows:\u2014\n(a) Under clauses 6 and 7 of the said Will the beneficiaries respectively named therein are entitled to the use and enjoyment of the premises respectively described in the said clauses as long as they continue to live there or do not abandon them as a home and the direction in favour of such beneficiaries shall terminate if, as and when they cease to live there in the ordinary sense that they abandon their occupancy or possession of the premises as a home;\n(b) Insofar as clause 6 is concerned, Frances Moore, widow of George Moore Junior is entitled to the use of the premises described in the said clause as long as she shall continue to live there or not abandon such premises as a home; such occupancy is free of any duty or rent and it is the duty of the Trustee out of the Trust Fund created under the said Will to pay the taxes on the said premises, the cost of maintaining the building thereon and the insurance of the same against fire. (c) Insofar as clause 7 is concerned, Charles James Moore and Janet Moore do not retain any right to the use and enjoyment of the premises described in the said clause, and the said premises form part of the estate of the deceased George Moore in the same manner as if the said clause had not been written into the Will;\nAt the date of the will, George Moore Junior and his wife Frances were residing in the property described in clause 6 of the will and continued to do so until the death of the former on February 4, 1955 and Frances Moore has ever since continued to reside there.\nAt the date of the will, Charles James Moore and his wife Janet were residing in the property described in clause 7 of the will but a few years before the death of the testator they moved to Westview, British Columbia and the property described in clause 7 was let to a tenant. This was the situation at the death of the testator and since then the trustees have continued to let the property and have received the rentals. Up to the time of his death the testator allowed Charles James Moore and his wife to retain the rental income from the property, but I do not regard that fact as relevant to the question of the construction of the will.\nCharles James Moore and Janet Moore have appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal and ask a declaration that they are jointly entitled to the property described in clause 7 as tenants for life. The respondent Frances Moore supports the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The other respondents, for whom Mr. Norris appears, support the judgment of the Court of Appeal; alternatively, they ask that the judgment of Macfarlane J. be restored.\nAfter examining all the cases referred to by counsel in argument and in the factums, some of which are not easy to reconcile with each other, and returning to the words of the will before us I have concluded that the intention of the testator according to the true construction of the will was not to give to George Moore Junior and Frances his wife an estate for life in the property described in clause 6, determinable on their ceasing to occupy such property, or indeed any estate therein, but merely a licence to occupy such property personally, such occupation to be by both or by one of them. From the death of the testator the legal estate in the property in question was in the trustees on trusts for sale, with a power of postponement (under clause 12 of the will), but subject to the obligation to permit George and Frances, or either of them, personally to occupy the property rent free and with the other benefits set out in clause 6. I do not think that the words \"as long as\", as used in clause 6, necessarily require continuous occupation by one or other of George and Frances as a condition of their being entitled to the permission given by the clause, but rather that the testator has used these words as the equivalent of \"while\" or \"during the time that\" or \"during such times as\". Bearing in mind the limited assistance that is to be derived from the construction placed upon similar words in another instrument, I am to some extent fortified in this view by the decision of R. M. Meredith J., affirmed by W. R. Meredith C.J. and MacMahon J. in Wilkinson v. Wilson [5], in which words conferring benefits on the plaintiff \"so long as he shall remain a resident on said lands\" were construed as not requiring continuous residence but as entitling the plaintiff to the benefits during such times as he resided on the lands; and in which it was held that the plaintiff's absence during several years did not bring about a forfeiture of his rights.\nIf I am right in this view of the meaning of the clause, it follows that during such times as either George or Frances is in personal occupation of the property described in clause 6 they are entitled to use and enjoy it free of rent or of any obligation to pay taxes, insurance premiums or costs of maintenance, but that they are not entitled to let the property or to claim any rents or profits that may be derived from it when neither of them is in personal occupation. Any rents or profits received during such periods would go to the trustees on the trusts declared for the residue of the estate. A similar construction should be placed on clause 7 of the will.\nIt follows from what I have said above that, in my opinion, Frances Moore is entitled to continue to reside in the property described in clause 6 and that should she cease to reside there in the future she could none the less return to the property and claim the benefits of such clause. It follows also that Charles and Janet Moore have the right to call upon the trustees to permit them to occupy the property described in clause 7 and are entitled while either of them is residing there to the benefits of such clause.\nIt is true that on this construction the sale of the properties described in clauses 6 and 7 cannot take place during the lifetime of the beneficiaries unless they consent, and that practical difficulties may be encountered in regard to the trustees renting the properties during such times as the beneficiaries do not wish to avail themselves of the permission to occupy; but it will be to the advantage of such beneficiaries, inasmuch as they share in the income from the residue, to facilitate the renting of the properties during any substantial periods of absence and it is to be hoped that the suggested difficulties will not prove insurmountable.\nI would allow the appeal to the extent of varying the formal order of the Court of Appeal so that the answer to question 3 therein set out shall read as follows:\u2014\n(a) Under clauses 6 and 7 of the said Will the beneficiaries respectively named therein are entitled to the use and enjoyment of the premises respectively described in the said clauses during such time or times as they or either of them occupy such premises personally, but are not otherwise entitled to the rents or profits thereof.\n(b) In so far as clause 7 is concerned, Charles James Moore and Janet Moore or either of them are entitled to occupy the premises described in the said clause in the manner set out in clause (a) of this answer, upon giving the trustees reasonable notice of their desire so to do.\nThe order as to costs made by the Court of Appeal should stand and the costs of all parties in this Court should be paid out of the estate, those of the respondents The Royal Trust Company, Gordon B. Moore and the unascertained class represented by Mr. Norris as between solicitor and client.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014Some assistance in construing clauses 6 and 7 of the will is to be obtained by a consideration of its other provisions and of the circumstances existing at the time of the death of the testator in August 1950.\nAfter the clauses which have occasioned the present dispute, the testator bequeathed his entire estate to the trustees upon trust to invest the capital and to divide what was referred to as the trust fund into three equal shares. As to one of these, the trustees were directed to hold the same upon trust during the life of the testator's son Gordon Moore to pay him from time to time or to employ for his maintenance and advantage such part of the capital and income thereof as they, in their uncontrolled discretion, should think fit. The reason for this provision appears to have been that Gordon Moore was apparently regarded by his father as incapable of wisely handling his own affairs and it was shown that, as of the date of the application made by the Royal Trust Company, he was mentally infirm and incapable of doing so or understanding the nature of the proceedings.\nThe other two shares of the trust fund were directed to be held upon similar trusts, namely, to pay one-half of the income to the sons George and Charles James and one-half to their respective wives and, upon the death of either husband or wife, to pay all of the income to the survivor in the case of the sons during their lifetime or, should the survivor be the wife, until her death or remarriage. Upon the death of the sons and, should their wives survive them, upon the death or remarriage of either of them, the shares were to be held as to both capital and income in trust for their children.\nA further provision of the will enabled the trustees in their uncontrolled discretion to raise from time to time any part of the capital of the shares held in trust for the sons George and Charles and to employ it for the benefit, maintenance or advantage of the son, his wife or their children.\nThe trustees named in the will, in addition to the trust company, were Mr. J. R. Kerr and Mr. R. J. Filberg, personal friends of the testator in whose judgment he had confidence.\nBy s. 22 of the Wills Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 365, every will is to be construed with reference to the real estate and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will. As the material shows, the testator had purchased the house in Penticton as a place of residence for Charles James Moore and his family in 1936 and they resided there until April 1948, when the son decided to change his occupation and endeavour to obtain employment elsewhere. At that time he and his family moved to Westview, British Columbia. Charles James Moore says that he discussed the matter at that time with his father and rented the Pentic- ton house with his father's approval and consent on April 8, 1948, for a term of two years. A short memorandum of lease dated April 8, 1948, signed by the son and by the testator was produced with the material filed on the application. Charles James Moore thereafter moved to White Rock, British Columbia, where he has since lived. Between the date the Penticton house was leased and the death of the testator, the son received the rent by his consent.\nAffidavits were filed by Charles James Moore and by his wife stating that they were desirous of returning to reside in Penticton but were restrained from doing so in the meantime by consideration for their daughter who was in a state of ill health.\nIn the case of the son George Moore and his wife Frances, they appear to have lived continuously in the house on 36th Avenue in Vancouver since a period some years prior to the death of the testator, and upon the death of her husband Frances Moore has continued to live there.\nIn Perrin et al. v. Morgan et al.[6], Viscount Simon L.C. said that the fundamental rule in construing the language of a will is to put on the words used the meaning which, having regard to the terms of the will, the testator intended, and that the question is not what the testator meant to do when he made his will but what the written words he used mean in the particular case. As required by the section of the Wills Act above referred to, the will is to be construed as if it had been made immediately before the death of George Moore in August 1950.\nIn my opinion, in considering the will as a whole, it is apparent that the desire of the testator was to ensure a competence to his sons, their wives and their children, and not to permit the sons George or Charles to obtain control of any part of the capital unless, in the good judgment of the three trustees, this would be advisable in the interests of themselves and their families. It was, I think, part of his plan that both George and Charles and their families should have a home provided by his estate and maintained at its expense. Immediately prior to the death of the testator, the situation in regard to the Penticton house was that it had been rented and Charles James Moore was living elsewhere. The son had vacated it under the above-mentioned circumstances. The language of clause 7 permitting Charles James Moore and his wife to have the use and enjoyment of the Penticton property \"as long as either of them shall occupy the same\" obviously did not mean as long as they continued to occupy it since neither was in possession, to the knowledge of the testator. The licence, as I think it is, was thus clearly to be exercised by them thereafter and, in my opinion, has not been affected by the fact that at least from 1950 to the time of the application in 1954 they continued to live at White Rock and may still be exercised by them.\nAs to clause 6, the rights of Frances Moore are unaffected and continue for the period defined by the will.\nI have considered with care the judgment of the learned trial judge, Macfarlane J., and the authorities relied upon by him for his conclusion. With great respect, my consideration of the evidence leads me to the conclusion that the intention of the testator in this case is ascertainable by consideration of the terms of the will and the circumstances permissible to be considered in construing it.\nI agree with the answers to the questions proposed by my brother Cartwright and would allow the appeal to the extent indicated by him. I also agree with his proposed order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs; order of Court below varied.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Freeman, Freeman, Silver & Koffman, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for Gordon B.

These supplementary letters were obtained pursuant to a decision by the company to avail itself of s. 95A of the Income Tax Act, 1948, as enacted in 1950, as a means of making available to the shareholders a large undistributed surplus. After payment of the tax provided for in that section the company, pursuant to by-laws, issued 240,000 preference shares \u201cas fully paid and non-assessable\u201d, and in the following two years about one-third of these shares were redeemed, at various times. A block of shares in the company was held by the trustees of an estate, and 64,000 of the new shares were issued to the trustees as a stock dividend; of these about 18,000 were subsequently redeemed.\nHeld: The trustees received the shares so issued, and the proceeds of those that were redeemed, as capital of the estate, for the benefit of the remaindermen, and not as income for the benefit of the life tenants. Once shares were issued as paid-up, the portion of the undistributed profits appropriated for the purpose of paying them up immediately became capitalized, and the shares were themselves an addition to the capital stock of the company.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of McLennan J.[2] on a motion for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court.

Watson, Q.C., for the Official Guardian, representing infants and unborn and unascertained persons, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The company, the proceeds of the redemption of whose preferred shares are in question in these proceedings, was incorporated as a private company under the Ontario Companies Act by letters patent dated May 2, 1893, with an authorized capital of 30,000 shares without nominal or par value, all of which were issued as fully paid. By supplementary letters patent, dated December 12, 1950, the authorized capital of the company was increased by the creation of 500,000 preference shares having a par value of $1 each, redeemable by the company on ten days\u2019 notice to the holders, such shares on redemption to be cancelled and not reissued.\nOn October 19, 1950, it was reported to the annual meeting of shareholders that the directors considered that the company should elect, under s. 95A of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, enacted in 1950 by 11-12 Geo. VI, c. 40, s. 32, to pay a tax of 15 per cent. on its undistributed income as at April 30, 1949. The directors advised that after payment of the tax, $240,000 of the remaining profits should \u201cbe placed in the hands of the Shareholders\u201d by creating preference shares to the value of $500,000 and issuing $240,000 of such shares by way of a stock dividend. It was also stated that the company \u201ccould\u201d then redeem the preference shares \u201cfrom time to time\u201d and that the amount of the \u201credemption price\u201d would not be taxable in the hands of the shareholders. The meeting duly resolved to follow this procedure.\nOn the following November 28, a by-law was passed authorizing the application for supplementary letters patent for the above increase in the authorized capital. These letters, as already mentioned, were obtained after the by-law had been confirmed by the shareholders. On November 28, 1950 also, another by-law was passed by the directors authorizing the issue of fully-paid shares for the amount of any dividends which might be declared.\nThe tax under s. 95A was paid on January 25, 1951, and on February 9 following, a stock dividend of $240,000 was declared payable by the allotment \u201cas fully paid and non\u2011assessable\u201d of $240,000 redeemable preference shares.\nOf these shares the respondent trustees received 64,000, of which, as at the date of the launching of these proceedings, May 14, 1953, 17,920 had been redeemed at various dates commencing March 1, 1951. The question involved is whether the remaining shares or the proceeds of those redeemed are to be regarded as capital or income in the hands of the trustees, who hold the corpus of the estate of the late Stella Maud Waters for the benefit of certain life tenants and remaindermen.\nIt was, of course, open to the company to have distributed the fund of $240,000 by way of dividend in cash, in which event it is perfectly clear on the authorities, to which I shall refer, that the trustees would have received the moneys as income to which the life tenants would have been entitled. Such a course, however, would have resulted in liability to income tax on the part of the trustees, as payment of the tax under s. 95A did not render free from taxation in the hands of the shareholders any cash dividends although paid out of the undistributed profits in respect of which the tax was paid. \u201cDividends\u201d are rendered expressly liable to taxation by s. 6(1) (a) (i) of the statute. However, while it was provided by s. 73(3), as enacted by s. 28 of the amending statute of 1950, that where the whole or any part of a corporation\u2019s undistributed income on hand has been capitalized a dividend shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder equal to the latter\u2019s portion of the undistributed income so capitalized, subs. (4) provided that in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income, his \u201cportion of the payer corporation\u2019s tax-paid undistributed income as of the time the dividend is deemed to have been received\u201d should be deducted from the amount of the dividend. Subsection (6) of s. 73 further provided that where a corporation has paid a stock dividend the corporation shall, for the purpose of subs. (3), \u201cbe deemed to have capitalized immediately before the payment undistributed income on hand equal to the lesser of (a) the undistributed income then on hand, or (b) the amount of the stock dividend\u201d. Accordingly, by using its tax-paid undistributed profits for the purposes of a stock dividend, thereby capitalizing them, the company could give to its shareholders the benefit of its payment of tax under s. 95A, and in this way only. But only by the payment of dividend in redeemable preference shares and the subsequent redemption thereof could the proceeds of redemption escape taxation in the hands of the shareholders, as subs. (2) of s. 73 specifically provided that, where a company having undistributed income on hand redeemed any of its common shares, the shareholders should be deemed to receive a dividend equal to the lesser of (a) the amount or value received, or (b) \u201chis portion of the undistributed income then on hand\u201d.\nIt may be said that while, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, a company\u2019s undistributed profits may be \u201ccapitalized\u201d, such need not be the result for all purposes. Such result must depend, for present purposes at least, upon company law, namely, in the case at bar, the relevant provisions of The Companies Act, R.S.O. 1950, s. 59. An examination of the relevant provisions of this statute, however, will show that the income tax legislation has the appropriate company law within its purview.\nBy s. 78 of the Ontario Act, by-laws \u201cfor creating and issuing any part of the capital as preference shares\u201d may be enacted by the directors, who, by s. 80(1), may make provision \u201cfor the purchase or redemption\u201d of such shares. By subs. (2) no such by-law which has the effect of increasing or decreasing the capital of the company shall be valid unless confirmed by supplementary letters patent. Subsection (3) provides, however, that subs. (2) shall not apply to any by-law which creates or attempts to create redeemable or convertible preference shares. In the present case supplementary letters patent were issued.\nSection 96 must also be taken into account. It provides that, for the amount of any dividend which the directors may lawfully declare payable in money, they may declare a stock dividend and issue therefor shares of the company \u201cas fully paid or partly paid\u201d, or they may credit the amount of the dividend on shares already issued but not fully paid.\nIt would therefore appear clear upon the face of this statute that an issue of paid-up shares by way of stock dividend requires the contemporaneous appropriation of sufficient of the company\u2019s undistributed profits to provide for the payment up of the shares; in other words, for the capitalization of the requisite amount. It follows from this that the subsequent payment out to the shareholders of this paid-up capital in redemption of the shares would, so far as the company is concerned, also be a payment of capital no matter how soon or late after the employment of the profits in paying up the shares.\nIt is, however, contended on behalf of the appellant life tenant that there was no \u201cpermanent\u201d addition to the company\u2019s capital of the fund here in question and that, the stated object of the issue of the preference shares having been \u201cto place in the hands of the shareholders\u201d the said fund, this is sufficient, regardless of the procedure actually adopted by the company, to enable the Court to declare that the proceeds of redemption constitute income and not capital. As this question has given rise to differences of opinion in recent Ontario decisions, it will be desirable to consider them. Before doing so, however, it is essential to consider the leading case on this branch of the law, namely, Hill et al v. Permanent Trustee Company of New South Wales, Limited et al.[3] In the course of delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee in that case, Lord Russell of Killowen said, at p. 729:\u2014 ...moneys paid in respect of shares in a limited company may be income or corpus of a settled share according to the procedure adopted, i.e., according as the moneys are paid by way of dividend before liquidation or are paid by way of surplus assets in a winding up.\n(The italics are mine.)\nHis Lordship went on to say that\nEach process might appear to involve some injustice, the former to the remainderman, the latter to the tenant for life\nbut that the only method by which the rights of the respective cestuis que trust can be safeguarded and made incapable of being varied or affected by the conduct of the company, is by the insertion of special provisions in the trust instrument clearly defining the respective rights of income and corpus in regard to moneys received by the trustee from limited companies in respect of shares therein held by him as part of the trust estate.\nLord Russell, commencing at p. 730, laid down certain rules, in part as follows:\u2014\n(1.) A limited company when it parts with moneys available for distribution among its shareholders is not concerned with the fate of those moneys in the hands of any shareholder. The company does not know and does not care whether a shareholder is a trustee of his shares or not. It is of no more concern to a company which is parting with moneys to a shareholder whether that shareholder (if he be a trustee) will hold them as trustee for A. absolutely or as trustee for A. for life only.\n(2.) A limited company not in liquidation can make no payment by way of return of capital to its shareholders except as a step in an authorized reduction of capital\u2026\n(4.) Other considerations arise when a limited company with power to increase its capital and possessing a fund of undivided profits, so deals with it that no part of it leaves the possession of the company, but the whole is applied in paying up new shares which are issued and allotted proportionately to the shareholders, who would have been entitled to receive the fund had it been, in fact, divided and paid away as dividend.\nWith respect to profits applied in accordance with rule 4, his Lordship said at p. 732:\u2014\nIn other words, moneys which had been capable of division by the company as profits among its shareholders have ceased for all time to be so divisible, and can never be paid to the shareholders except upon a reduction of capital or in a winding up. The fully paid shares representing them and received by the trustees are therefore received by them as corpus and not as income. At p. 732, Lord Russell referred to the decision of the House of Lords in Bouch and Bouch v. Sproule[4], in the following words:\u2014\nIn Bouch v. Sproule4, no moneys, in fact, left the company\u2019s possession at all. It is not an authority which touches a case in which a company parts with moneys to its shareholders. The essence of the case was that the company, not by its statements, but by its acts, showed that what the shareholders got from the company was not a share of profits divided by the company, but an interest in moneys which had been converted from divisible profits into moneys capitalized and rendered for ever incapable of being divided as profits.\n(The italics are mine throughout.)\nIn Hill\u2019s Case the company had made a distribution in cash.\nIn my opinion there is nothing in any part of the judgment delivered by Lord Russell which lends any countenance to the contention that undistributed profits of a company which have become capitalized by \u201cconversion by the company of the profits into share capital\u201d (p. 730) must remain permanently with the company in order to retain that character. He himself recognized that they might be paid out \u201cupon a reduction of capital\u201d, and payment out may occur at any time after capitalization so long as what is done is in accord with the governing legislation.\nNor is there any support for any such contention in anything that was said or decided in Bouch and Bouch v. Sproule[5]. As already pointed out, that case is to be treated as one in which in fact no money left the company at all. What their Lordships contradistinguished in that case was the situation where, in the language of Lord Herschell, at p. 397, the company has accumulated profits and used them, in fact, for capital purposes, and the quite different situation where (p. 403) it being\nwithin the power of the company to capitalise these sums by issuing new shares against them to its members in proportion to their several interests,\na\npermanent appropriation of the moneys to the capital purposes to which they had already been temporarily appropriated\nhas actually occurred by their being converted into share capital. The decision of the Court of Appeal in England in In re Duff\u2019s Settlements, National Provincial Bank, Ltd. v. Gregson et al.[6], is useful in this connection. In that case the trustee of certain settlements held shares in a company which, from time to time, had allotted shares at a premium, the aggregate amount of which premiums had been paid, in conformity with s. 56(1) of the Companies Act, 1948, c. 38, into a \u201cshare premium account\u201d. The section stipulated that the provisions of the Act relating to reduction of share capital of a company should apply to the share premium account as if it were paid-up share capital of the company. The company, having obtained the approval of the Court, paid to shareholders certain moneys out of this account and the question was whether such moneys in the hands of the trustee constituted capital or income of the trust funds. It was held to be capital. In the course of his judgment, at pp. 929-30, Jenkins L.J., who delivered the judgment of the court, referred to Hill\u2019s Case as well as certain other decisions and continued:\u2014\nThe cases to which we have referred show that the character, as a matter of company law, of any given distribution as it leaves a company determines its character in the hands of the recipient. The relevant company law in the present case seems to us to require that the distribution here in question should be treated from the point of view of the payer, that is, the company, as a distribution by way of return of capital. It follows, to our minds, that the trustees\u2019 proportion of the distribution should similarly be treated in their hands as paid-up capital returned by the company. The provision in sub-s. 2 permitting the application of a share premium account in paying up bonus shares does not, in our view, assist the tenants for life. This merely enables a company to substitute actual capitalization for the notional capitalization produced by the section itself. The section, as we read it, produces the same result on a direct distribution of a share premium account as if the company had first gone through the formality of actual capitalization by bonus shares and then paid off the bonus shares by way of reduction of capital\u2026 If the terms of s. 56 are concerned, as Mr. Walton submitted, with the \u201cmechanics\u201d of the distribution of premiums received on the issue of shares, still the \u201cmechanics\u201d are, in our judgment, an essential factor in determining the character as between capital and income of the sum distributed. A company, having an artificial person, can (as it has been laid down) make a distribution amongst its members (otherwise than in a winding up) in one of two ways\u2014but only in one of two ways: that is, by a distribution of divisible profit, that is, by way of dividend; and by way of a return of capital pursuant to an order of the court on a petition for reduction of capital in accordance with the Act. The question whether a given distribution lawfully made by a company is of the former or of the latter description may thus justly be determined by reference to the method or mechanics of distribution, permitted or enjoined by the Act, which the company has adopted in regard to it; and the answer to that question must prima facie also determine the question whether the distribution is capital or income as between tenant for life and remainderman of a settled shareholding: see per Lord Russell in Hill v. Permanent Trustee Company of New South Wales.\n(The italics are mine.)\nIn his use of the words \u201cprima facie\u201d in Hill\u2019s Case at p. 731, Lord Russell indicated that \u201csome provision in the trust deed\u201d would be required to change the result produced by the rule he had just enunciated.\nSubject to the effect of s. 61 of the (Dominion) Companies Act, 1934, c. 33 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 53), in cases where that statute is applicable, the principles enunciated by Jenkins L.J. in the language above set out apply in the case at bar and are in accord with the view which I have expressed as to the effect of the provisions of the Ontario Companies Act upon the procedure or \u201cmechanics\u201d adopted by the company here in question. This view is in accord with that reached by McRuer C.J.H.C. in Re Mclntyre[7].\nMcLennan J., the judge of first instance in the case at bar, followed the decision in Mclntyre\u2019s Case and held the moneys in question were part of the corpus of the estate[8]. This judgment was affirmed on appeal[9]. A similar view was expressed by Ferguson J. in Re Hardy Trusts[10], but he felt himself bound by Re Fleck, infra, and his judgment was affirmed on appeal[11].\nThe appellant relies upon the decisions in Re Fleck[12], and the later decision of Gale J. in Re Mills[13]. Fleck\u2019s Case, which was binding on the Court of Appeal in the present case, was distinguished by that court. In Fleck\u2019s Case the company in question had been incorporated under the Companies Act, Canada. Having paid income tax pursuant to s. 95A, the directors declared a stock dividend in redeemable preference shares and subsequently, on the same day, provided for their redemption. Hogg J.A., the judge of first instance, after considering Hill\u2019s Case, supra, and Bouch and Bouch v. Sproule, supra, deduced their principle as follows (p. 119):\u2014\nThe principle to be deduced from these judgments is that there must be, in fact, a conversion by the company of its profits or surplus into share capital in order that they shall be regarded as corpus and not income in the hands of a trustee, or as between a life tenant and a remainderman. Furthermore, that where a company has the power to deal with profits by converting them into capital of the company such exercise of its power is binding upon the person interested under a trust of the original shares set up by the testator\u2019s will.\nHaving so laid down the principle, the learned judge felt himself able, however, to come to the conclusion that the preferred shares there in question\ndid not form part of the paid-up capital of the Company and therefore the surplus profits represented by them were not capitalized.\nTo my mind, with respect, if this is to be taken as a statement of fact, it is in conflict with the evidence, as the stock dividend to which the shares owed their issue was expressly declared to be \u201cout of said tax paid undistributed income\u201d, which was thereby inescapably capitalized. In so far as the learned judge\u2019s statement is a conclusion of law, I find it impossible to reconcile it with his earlier statement of principle that\nwhere a company has the power to deal with profits by converting them into capital of the company such exercise of its power is binding upon the person interested under a trust of the original shares.\nThe company can, in the language of Lord Halsbury in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Blott; The Same v. Greenwood[14], \u201cconvert them into capital as against the whole world\u201d. In my opinion, the fact that, as Hogg J.A. says, \u201cthe steps taken by the Company were induced because of the provisions of the Income Tax Act\u201d is irrelevant.\nThe learned judge referred to s. 61 of the Dominion Companies Act and then proceeded as follows, at p. 120:\u2014 To use the language, in part, of Lord Herschell in Bouch et al. v. Sproule, supra, and applying it to contrary circumstances, it was obviously contemplated and was, I think, certain that no money would in fact remain in the hands of the Company as paid-up capital. The substance of the whole transaction and the intention of the Company as well as the form or manner in which it was carried out shows that the share of surplus profits represented by the $20,000 in question was not converted into capital by newly\u2011created shares but was distributed as a dividend to the trustee shareholders. The real pith and substance of the arrangements were to distribute the surplus profits of the Company in the form of money, and they were not dealt with so that, to use the words of Lord Russell in the Hill case, supra, they could \u201cnever be paid to the shareholders except upon a reduction of capital or in a winding up\u201d. The issue of redeemable shares was in the nature of a conduit-pipe to convey or transfer the surplus profits accumulated by the Company to the pockets of the shareholders as cash.\nIn this view the learned judge held the moneys in the hands of the trustee to be income. As already mentioned, this decision was affirmed on appeal without extended reasons[15].\nIn my opinion, with respect, the reasoning in Fleck\u2019s Case is erroneous. Once shares are issued as paid-up shares, that portion of the undistributed profits in the hands of the company appropriated for the purpose of paying up the shares, immediately becomes capitalized. The provisions of the Ontario Act to which I have referred so provide and I am unable to read the relevant provisions of the Dominion Act in a contrary sense. That Act, by ss. 7 and 12, provides for the creation of redeemable preference shares by either letters patent or supplementary letters patent or, under s. 59, by by-law. Section 61, to which Hogg J.A. referred, provides that if redemption, instead of being effected by payment to the shareholders of the capital behind the shares, the paid-up capital of the company being thereby reduced, is effected out of undistributed profits, the paid-up capital is deemed not to have been reduced. The plain implication of this provision is that if the redemption is effected by repayment to the shareholders of the paid-up capital in respect of such shares, a reduction of paid-up capital does occur which can be validly effected only upon the sanction of the shareholders, confirmed by supplementary letters patent under s. 49(2). These provisions, there- fore, perhaps even more plainly than s. 96 of the Ontario Act, completely reject any idea that payment to shareholders in accordance with such provisions is payment of anything other than capital.\nIn Fleck\u2019s Case the company had on hand a fund of over $515,000 after payment of tax under s. 95A, and had declared a stock dividend of 1,000 redeemable preferred shares of a par value of $100 which it immediately proceeded to redeem. The company had, therefore, sufficient funds left in its undistributed profit account after payment up of the par value of the issued shares, to effect their redemption. In view of s. 61, it must be considered that redemption took place out of profits, that being the only way it could validly have taken place without supplementary leters patent being obtained. Hogg J.A. would appear to have thought that the employment by the company of profits for the purpose of redemption rendered the proceeds income in the hands of the trustee. As this point does not arise in the case at bar, I express no final opinion upon it, although it is not obvious how a capital asset in the hands of trustees, namely, the shares, can become transformed into income merely because the company employs surplus profits to redeem them. It is further to be observed that s. 61 provides that\nthe surplus resulting from such redemption or purchase for cancellation shall be designated as a capital surplus, which shall not be redeemed or distributed by the company except as provided in sections forty-nine to fifty-eight, both inclusive, of this Act.\nEven where redemption takes place out of profits, therefore, the capital paid up on the shares originally appropriated out of profits remains as capital. This emphasizes, if emphasis be needed, that, in the purview of the statute, profits which have been used to pay up an issue of shares become capital and remain so from the moment the shares are so paid up.\nIn my opinion, therefore, as already stated, Fleck\u2019s Case, apart from the point above mentioned, as to which I express no final opinion, is out of harmony with the earlier authoritative decisions to which I have referred. I would dismiss the appeal but, in the circumstances, I think the costs of all parties should be taxed and be paid out of the estate, those of the trustees as between solicitor and client.\nRAND J.:\u2014The question here is between a life tenant and a remainderman whose interests are in shares of the capital stock of a company incorporated under the Ontario Companies Act. The dispute arises through the fact that at the death of the testator the company had accumulated a large amount of earnings which thereafter were capitalized into redeemable preference stock over the beneficial ownership of which the issue is joined.\nThe nature of a life interest in property depends upon the kind of property. If land, it will be possession and use or income of rents; if money or money obligations, it will be income of interest; where the asset is common stock of a commercial company, the income consists of dividends. The large amount of accumulated earnings, in this case, was, at the death, reflected in the value of the stock; the testator might have made it clear that the shares, in the value based on the assets then existing, were to be treated as capital and the income thereafter to be related to subsequent earnings only; but he did not do that; what he did was to bequeath the \u201cincome\u201d.\nThe question, in such circumstances, of what is income has been before the Courts in a number of cases and the principles applicable have been considered in both the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee. From them the following considerations, among others, emerge. A joint stock company, having modern powers and, in the absence of special provisions, bound to the preservation in its capital asset structure of property representing its share capital, is in absolute control of the profits which its business produces. They may be distributed as dividends, kept in reserves, applied to restore lost capital assets or be capitalized by appropriating them as assets representing or fulfilling the payment of unpaid existing or newly issued share capital. In Hill et al. v. Permanent Trustee Company of New South Wales, Limited et al.[16], Lord Russell of Killowen summarizes some settled propositions dealing with payments of money to shareholders and speaks of the \u201ccapitalization\u201d of accumulated profits as follows:\u2014\n(4.) Other considerations arise when a limited company with power to increase its capital and possessing a fund of undivided profits, so deals with it that no part of it leaves the possession of the company, but the whole is applied in paying up new shares which are issued and allotted proportionately to the shareholders, who would have been entitled to receive the fund had it been, in fact, divided and paid away as dividend.\nAnd at p. 735:\u2014\nTheir Lordships desire to adopt the language used by Eve J., and to say in regard to the funds out of which the sums of 19,380l and 8,360l were paid by the Buttabone Company to the trustee company: \u201cUnless and until the fund was in fact capitalized it retained its characteristics of a distributable property\u2026 no change in the character of the fund was brought about by the company\u2019s expressed intention to distribute it as capital. It remained an uncapitalised surplus available for distribution, either as dividend or bonus on the shares, or as a special division of an ascertained profit\u2026 and in the hands of those who received it it retained the same characteristics.\u201d\nKnowledge of that control over this type of property is to be attributed to the testator: it is with this actually or imputedly in mind that he confers the life interest: he knows or is held to know that the receipt of income or capital will depend on the acts of the company.\nWhen accumulated earnings are capitalized, the precise theory according to which the transformation takes place is by no means clear. If a dividend has been declared which the shareholder has the option of receiving either in cash or in paid up new shares, the latter alternative is to be deemed to consist of two steps: the creation of a real credit in the amount of the dividend to the shareholder, a debt owing by the company to him; and the application of that debt by way of release as payment for the new stock. The right to receive the dividend and its constructive receipt constitute a payment of income to the shareholder which belongs to the life tenant to whom the substituted stock goes as to a purchaser. On this stock he will be liable to tax as for income: Swan Brewery Company, Limited v. The King[17]. On the other hand, the capitalization of the accumulation directly without the option of a dividend presents difficulty in theoretical conception. In substance the interest of the shareholder represented by the original stock merely changes its form: from being X percentage of Y it becomes X plus A percentage of Y plus B. Nothing is withdrawn from the company and no immediate additional value passes to the shareholder. The company by declaration appropriates an asset available for dividends to the capital asset structure and creates for the shareholder a new capital stockholding, with the same fractional interest in a new total capital asset as before.\nIn Bouch and Bouch v. Sproule[18], the question was considered. Although the reasons, following the facts, are less than assured on the matter of an alternative right to elect for the dividend, they seem to me to hold that what was to be determined was the intention of the company as that was evidenced by its corporate acts interpreted in the total circumstances. At p. 399 Lord Herschell says:\u2014\nI cannot, therefore, avoid the conclusion that the substance of the whole transaction was, and was intended to be, to convert the undivided profits into paid-up capital upon newly-created shares.\n* * *\nUpon the whole, then, I am of opinion that the company did not pay, or intend to pay, any sum as dividend, but intended to and did appropriate the undivided profits dealt with as an increase of the capital stock in the concern.\nAt p. 401, Lord Watson:\u2014\nBut in a case like the present, where the company has power to determine whether profits reserved, and temporarily devoted to capital purposes, shall be distributed as dividend or permanently added to its capital, the interest of the life tenant depends, in my opinion, upon the decision of the company.\nAnd at pp. 402-3:\u2014\nIn these circumstances it was undoubtedly within the power of the company, by raising new capital to the required amount, to set free the sums thus spent out of the reserve fund and undivided profits for distribution among the shareholders. It was equally within the power of the company to capitalize these sums by issuing new shares against them to its members in proportion to their several interests. I am of opinion that the latter alternative was, in substance, that which was followed by the company. And at p. 405:\u2014\nIf I am right in my conclusion the substantial bonus which was meant to be given to each shareholder was not a money payment but a proportional share of the increased capital of the company.\nIn the present case a new element is introduced by the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, as amended, enabling a company by paying a tax, in this case 15 per cent., on earnings accumulated up to 1949, to capitalize the remaining fund by the issue of a stock dividend free from income tax in the hands of the shareholders. The earnings, if distributed as dividend, would have been taxable. This power furnishes a means by which, through the issue, as authorized by the appropriate company law, of redeemable preference shares, an amount of money equal to that of the earnings converted will reach the shareholders by the redemption; the nature of that payment, capital or income, will depend on the proper interpretation of what the company has done.\nThe corporate action in this case was embodied in a resolution of the shareholders electing under s. 95A of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, enacted by 1950, c. 40, s. 32, to pay the required tax of 15 per cent. on the undistributed income on hand as of April 30, 1949 and to issue the necessary redeemable preferred shares to take up the amount remaining. Following this the directors passed by-laws to implement the resolution. Preferred shares were issued in the amount of $240,000 at the rate of $1 a share which absorbed approximately the total of the remaining accumulation. They contained provisions for redemption; they also carried a right to non-cumulative dividends at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum but only when as and if they were declared in any year by the directors. The redemption was to take place on notice at any time or from time to time and in such amounts as the company might decide. Dividends at 3 per cent. per anum were paid annually from the time of issue in 1951 until the proceedings started in June 1953. The number of shares redeemed as of May 11, 1953 was 17,920 out of a total of 64,000 owned by the estate. The redemption was in the number of 1,280 shares every two months, the first having been made on March 1, 1951; and at that rate, the redemption would be completed in approximately 8\u2153 years. In these circumstances can it be found that the preferred shares were income and enured to the benefit of the life tenant?\nI take the principle laid down to be that unless the earnings as such actually or constructively pass from the company to the shareholder there is, for all purposes, capitalization. But the argument is that the machinery of capitalization and redemption can be used to effect a transfer of the earnings as such to the shareholders.\nHere, the retention of the preferred shares as part of the capital stock is sufficient of itself to negative the conclusion that the shares belong to the life interest as dividends: but I have reached the same conclusion on a broader ground.\nWhen earnings are \u201ccapitalized\u201d, they cease at that moment to be \u201cearnings\u201d; they become part of the capital assets; and if the transaction has not the elements of dividend and purchase, the shares, prima facie, are not income. Mr. Henderson urged very plausibly that the company\u2019s intention was to release those earnings and pass them to the shareholders as such in a single act consisting of several parts. The fallacy lies in overlooking what has taken place. The company undoubtedly intends by its total act to pass money to the shareholder: but if what the company does converts the earnings into capital, the \u201cintention\u201d of the company must take account of that fact: it \u201cintends\u201d that fact; and to carry the intention to a conclusion it intends to distribute capital assets by means of an authorized reduction in capital stock. Here form is substance; and the moment form has changed the character of the earnings as assets, the intention follows that change.\nIn the absence of a statutory provision, a stock dividend, so-called, would not appear to be \u201cincome\u201d: and the exemption from taxation provided for the shares here simply suspends the provision of the Income Tax Act imposing tax. From the standpoint of tax, it is indifferent to the company and the shareholder whether the ultimate receipt of money is capital or income: in neither case is it taxable. But its form is fixed and determined: and in the absence of special directions in the will, we are not at liberty to disregard what the testator is to be deemed to have foreseen as the possible action of the company. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs of all parties to be paid out of the estate, those of the trustees as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Sinclair, Goodenough, Higginbottom & McDonnell, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the executors and John Gavin Waters, respondents: Malone, Malone & Montgomery, Toronto.\nSolicitors for Marjory T.

A trustee, therefore, who, holding shares in the company as a trust asset, receives moneys in redemption of preference shares so issued, receives them as capital of the trust rather than as income. From the time that the trustee becomes entitled to receive a certificate for these shares their status, as between the settlor and the remaindermen under the trust, does not differ from that of the shares originally received by the trustee, and a capital asset (the shares) in the hands of a trustee will not be transformed into income merely because the company uses surplus profits to redeem, the shares.\nRe Fleck, [1952] O.R. 113 (affirmed [1952] O.W.N. 260), overruled.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Ferguson J.[2] on a motion for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court.

Parkinson, Q.C., for the trustee, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The following question was submitted to a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario for his advice and opinion:\u2014\nDoes the Thirty-one thousand one hundred and sixty-eight dollars ($31,168) representing the proceeds in respect of the share of Arthur Sturgis Hardy and payable to the Trustees of the Trust Deed of the said Arthur Sturgis Hardy on the redemption of 31,168 preferred shares, being part of the redemption of 260,000 preferred shares of G.T. Fulford Co. (Limited) issued by way of stock dividends out of the tax paid undistributed income of the company following an election by the company to exercise rights under Section 95A(1) of the Income Tax Act, S.C. 1948, Chapter 52, constitute income or capital in the hands of the Trustees? If he had not considered himself bound (as indeed he was) by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re Fleck[3], Ferguson J., before whom the application came, would have found that the money constituted capital in the hands of the trustees and not income, but in view of that authority he declared otherwise. The Court of Appeal decided that it was bound by its previous decision and dismissed an appeal by the Official Guardian, who now appeals to this Court.\nMr. Arthur Sturgis Hardy, referred to in the question, is one of the beneficiaries entitled to share in the estate of the late Senator Fulford, who died October 15, 1905. The trust deed is dated August 7, 1928, and was made between Mr. Hardy, as settlor, and The Toronto General Trusts Corporation, as trustees. That trust deed, after reciting the fact that the settlor, in the event he should survive his mother, who was a daughter of Senator Fulford, would be entitled to one-quarter of a distributive share or interest in one-half of the capital of the residuary estate, and the desire of the settlor to assign to the trustees 85 per cent. of his share if and when he should become entitled thereto, declared that:\u2014\nSecurities or assets, if any, of the estate of the Honourable George Taylor Fulford which may be assigned and transferred in specie to the Trustees herein by the Executors and Trustees of the Estate of the said Testator to form or partly form the said eighty-five per cent of the distributive shares of the Settlor in said estate shall be retained by the Trustees as investments of the Trust Estate,\nthis being followed by provisions for changing the investments from time to time. One of the obligations imposed upon the trustees was:\u2014\nDuring the lifetime of the Settlor, but subject as hereinafter provided, to pay to the Settlor or to expend for his benefit the net annual income derived from the Trust Estate,\nwith power to encroach upon the capital in a manner which does not affect the present consideration. Among the powers conferred upon the trustees was to take up as part of the trust estate any allotment of new stock in any com- pany whose stock formed part of such estate, to purchase the proportion of shares allotted by reason of the shares held, all of such new shares to be held as part of the trust estate.\nA further paragraph of the trust deed read:\u2014\nProvided further, and notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, the Settlor hereby declares that shares of Capital Stock in the G.T. Fulford Company, Limited, and Dr. Williams Medicine Company, Limited, Fulford Hanson Company or of any subsidiary Company of the G.T. Fulford Company Limited or in any business way connected therewith or of any one or more of said Companies which may be assigned and transferred to the Trustees in the due course of the administration of the estate of the said Honourable George Taylor Fulford deceased, as representing or forming part of the eighty-five per cent. of the Settlor\u2019s distributive shares therein may be retained by the Trustees herein as investments of the Trust Estate for such length of time or times as they the Trustees in their discretion may deem advisable, without the Trustees incurring liability by so retaining same; the intention of the Settlor is that no shares in the Capital stock of any of said Companies or business hereinbefore referred to in this paragraph shall form part of the fifteen per cent. of his distributive shares in the said estate which he intends to retain for his own use and purpose and which is not included in the Trust Estate hereby assigned, transferred and set over.\nThe G.T. Fulford Co. (Limited) was incorporated following the death of Senator Fulford in the year 1905 under the provisions of the Dominion Companies Act, to take over and carry on the business theretofore engaged in by him. The authorized capital was originally 10,000 shares of the par value of $100 each, and of these shares the trustees in due course received 1,193, which were held under the terms of the deed of trust. From the time of its incorporation the company actively engaged in business, earning substantial profits, and on December 31, 1949, had accumulated a surplus from earnings amounting to $314,063.41.\nBy appropriate steps the company elected under subs. (1) of s. 95A of the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, enacted by 1950, c. 40, s. 32, to be assessed and to pay a tax on such accumulated earnings and this being done, there remained in the hands of the company a tax-paid undistributed surplus of $266,953.90. Thereafter a by-law was adopted enabling the company to issue fully paid shares for the amount of any dividend, and on January 6, 1953, supple- mentary letters patent were granted to the company increasing the authorized capital by the creation of 500,000 3 per cent. non-cumulative redeemable preference shares of the par value of $1 each.\nOn January 21, 1953, a resolution was adopted by the directors which, after reciting the amount of the tax-paid undistributed income on hand, read:\u2014\nIT IS RESOLVED that a stock dividend be and the same is hereby declared to be payable out of the said tax paid undistributed income to shareholders of the company as of this date in the amount of one preference share for each common share held by a shareholder.\nOn the same date, a further resolution was passed, which, after reciting the issue of the 10,000 preference shares, resolved that they be redeemed, and this was done, the trustees receiving from the company the sum of $1,193.\nOn April 10, 1953, a resolution declaring a further stock dividend of 25 of the preference shares for each common share \u201cpayable out of the said tax paid undistributed income\u201d was adopted. A resolution authorizing their redemption was passed later on the same day. These were then redeemed, the trustees receiving a further sum of $29,975.\nWhile in the view that I take of the matter it does not assist in the determination of the question, it may be noted that at the meeting which authorized the stock dividend and the redemption of the preferred shares, the chairman stated that it had not been the intention of the company to make the preference shares part of its capital structure and that they had been created with the sole view of immediately redeeming them when they were issued in order to take advantage of the provisions of the Income Tax Act whereby the company might by paying a tax of $47,109.51, distribute the tax-paid surplus tax-free in the hands of the shareholders. The motive or purpose is, however, irrelevant if it is made out that the accumulated profits have been capitalized: Commissioner of Income Tax, Bengal v. Mercantile Bank of India, Limited et al.[4]\nI consider that none of the provisions of the Income Tax Act affects the question as to whether these moneys were income to which the settlor was entitled or capital which the trustees were required to hold for the benefit of those entitled in remainder. While the resolutions of January 21 and April 10, 1953, referring to a stock dividend \u201cto be payable out of the said tax paid undistributed income\u201d might have been more clearly expressed, both resolutions were undoubtedly passed under the authority of s. 83(3) of the Companies Act, now R.S.C. 1952, c. 53, the intention obviously being to convert the tax-paid undistributed income to the extent of $260,000 into capital and to issue the preference shares fully paid to the shareholders. There was no intention that the dividend should be paid in 00money to the shareholders as the wording of the resolutions might suggest. It was the said sum of $260,000 which by virtue and in consequence of the resolutions became part of the paid-up capital of the company that was employed for the redemption of the shares.\nThe respective rights of the settlor and those entitled in remainder are to be tested as of the time when the issue and allotment of the shares was authorized and their distribution directed.\nIt is the action taken by the company that is decisive of the matter. In In re Bouch; Sproule v. Bouch[5], Fry L.J. said in part:\u2014\nWhen a testator or settlor directs or permits the subject of his disposition to remain as shares or stock in a company which has the power either of distributing its profits as dividend, or of converting them into capital, and the company validly exercises this power, such exercise of its power is binding on all persons interested under him, the testator or settlor, in the shares, and consequently what is paid by the company as dividend goes to the tenant for life, and what is paid by the company to the shareholder as capital, or appropriated as an increase of the capital stock in the concern, enures to the benefit of all who are interested in the capital.\nThis statement of the law was approved in the judgment delivered by Lord Herschell in the House of Lords on the appeal (Bouch and Bouch v. Sproule[6]), and in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Blott; The Same v. Greenwood[7], per Viscount Haldane at p. 186. While the latter case was one concerned with income tax, Viscount Haldane discussed the general principle applicable in the case of companies incorporated under The Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, and while part of his remarks are inapplicable to companies incorporated by letters patent under the Dominion Companies Act, the statement at p. 182 as to the effect of the company\u2019s action applies equally, in my opinion, to such companies:\u2014\nSuch a company is a corporate entity separate from its shareholders, but the latter can control its action by passing resolutions in general meeting. If these resolutions are directed to what falls within the capacity of the company as the Act of Parliament defines it, they are treated as concerned with internal management, and if they have been passed in accordance with the statute and the articles of association no Court has jurisdiction to interfere in a question which is for the proper majority of the shareholders alone. The company, acting with the assent so given of the shareholders, can decide conclusively what is to be done with accumulated profits. It need not pay these over to the shareholders. It can convert them into capital as against the whole world, including, as I think the principle plainly implies, the Crown claiming for taxing or for any other purposes. The only question open is, therefore, whether the company has really done so.\nIn the present matter it is abundantly clear that it was the desire of the shareholders to distribute the accumulated profits among the shareholders without paying the high rate of income tax that would be payable by them if the dividend was declared in cash. In so far as the shareholders themselves were concerned, this result was accomplished by the creation, allotment and subsequent redemption of the preference shares. That in doing so they affected the rights of the settlor and those entitled in remainder in the present matter was not a matter with which qua shareholders or directors they were concerned.\nIn Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Fisher\u2019s Executors[8], Lord Sumner, referring to statements which appear in some of the reported cases that it is the intention of the company that is said to be dominant, said that desires and intentions are things of which a company is incapable, these being the mental operations of its shareholders and officers, and that:\u2014\nThe only intention that the company has, is such as is expressed in or necessarily follows from its proceedings. It is hardly a paradox to say that the form of a company\u2019s resolutions and instruments is their substance.\nIt was the net annual income derived from the trust estate which the trustees were required to pay to the settlor. The fully paid-up preference shares allotted to the trustees were part of the authorized capital of G.T. Fulford Co. (Limited) and were accretions to the capital of the estate. From the time when the trustees became entitled to receive a certificate from the company for these preference shares, their status as between the settlor and those entitled in remainder did not differ from that of the common shares received by the trustees from the Fulford estate. There is nothing in the language of the trust deed to indicate an intention that the word \u201cincome\u201d should be given an extended meaning and include distributions of this nature.\nIn a judgment delivered contemporaneously herewith in Re Waters; Waters v. The Toronto General Trusts Corporation et al.[9], Kellock J., with whose reasons I agreed, left open a point that did not arise in that case. It is now necessary to deal with it and it must be laid down that a capital asset (shares) in the hands of trustees will not be transformed into income merely because a company uses surplus profits to redeem shares. In fact those undistributed profits do not reach the shareholders as tax-free income, but as non-taxable capital. It must be taken that Re Fleck[10], was wrongly decided.\nThe appeal is allowed and the question submitted to the Court answered by stating that the moneys referred to constitute capital in the hands of the trustees. All parties may have their costs in all courts out of those moneys, the costs of the trustees to be as between solicitor and client.\nRAND J.:\u2014For the reasons given by me in Re Waters; Waters v. The Toronto General Trusts Corporation et al.9, judgment in which is being delivered contemporaneously with this, I would allow the appeal and answer the question submitted by stating that the moneys referred to constitute capital in the hands of the trustees. The costs of all parties in all courts shall be paid out of these moneys, those of the trustees as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal allowed.\nThe Official Guardian for Ontario: P.D.

Co., persuaded C to sign what was represented to be a mere grant of an option of mineral rights, but was in fact an assignment and transfer of a share in those rights. A. Co. later assigned all its rights of this nature to one of the plaintiff companies (the other company being a bare trustee for it). In an action brought to establish the plaintiffs' rights under the agreement, the defendants (C and his son, the purchaser under an agreement for sale), pleaded non est factum.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The defendants were entitled to succeed, and the assignment should be held void ab initio.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.: The representation having been as to the nature and character of the document, and not merely as to its contents, the mind of the defendant did not go with his hand, although he knew that he was dealing with his mineral rights. Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg, [1911] 1 K.B. 489, applied; Howatson v. Webb, [1907] 1 Ch. 537; [1908] 1 Ch. 1, distinguished. The document was void ab initio, and any option contained therein and which, admittedly, the defendant agreed to grant and for which he received payment, could not be severed and must fall with the rest of the transaction.\nPer Locke J.: The plea of non est factum would clearly have been available to the defendants if the action had been brought by A. Co., on whose behalf H was acting. Negligence on C's part would not estop him from setting up that defence as against the plaintiffs, since a person signing a document other than a negotiable instrument owed no duty to the public at large, or to other persons unknown to him who might suffer damage by acting upon the instrument on the footing that it was valid in the hands of the holder. Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg, supra, followed. In any event the proximate cause of the damage was the fraudulent act of H.\nPer Cartwright J. (dissenting) : Even if the misrepresentation could be said to have been as to the nature of the deed, the negligence (i.e. lack of reasonable care) of the defendant in signing and sealing it without reading it prevented him from asserting the defence of non est factum as against the plaintiffs which gave valuable consideration on the strength of the deed. The rule is that, generally speaking, a person who executes a document without taking the trouble to read it is liable on it and cannot plead that he mistook its contents, at all events as against a person who acting in good faith in the ordinary course of business has changed his position in reliance on such document. The defence operates in the case of a blind or illiterate person as an exception to that rule, but does not extend to a case such as the present.\nIn so far as the Bragg case decides that the rule that negligence excludes a plea of non est factum is limited to the case of negotiable instruments and does not extend to a deed such as the one at bar, it should not be followed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1, affirming the judgment at trial 2. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. L. McDougall, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nD. G. McLeod, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nNolan J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 3, unanimously affirming the judgment of the learned trial judge 4.\nThe appellant Prudential Trust Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as the appellant Prudential) is a trustee on behalf of the other appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited. The respondent Edmond Cugnet is a retired farmer who emigrated in 1902 from France to the Weyburn district in Saskatchewan. The respondent Raymond Cugnet is his son.\nOn October 31, 1949, the respondent Edmond Cugnet granted petroleum and natural gas leases to Rio Bravo Oil Company Limited in respect of the south-east quarter of section 27 and to Bandy Lee in respect of the north-west quarter of section 27, both in township 7, range 13, west of the second meridian.\nOn November 1, 1950, the appellant Prudential entered into an agreement with one Lamarr, whereby the company agreed to act for him as trustee of such mineral rights in petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons as he might purchase or lease from owners in Saskatchewan and agreed to file caveats in its own name in the various land titles offices against the titles of the registered owners to protect such interests as he might acquire.\nSubsequently Lamarr incorporated Amigo Petroleums Limited, in which he owned all the shares, which company sent out agents to purchase petroleum rights and to obtain oil leases from the owners, the documents being taken in the name of the trustee, the appellant Prudential.\nOne Nickle acquired, by assignment, the beneficial interest of Amigo Petroleums Limited in the petroleum rights so purchased or leased and, in turn, assigned his interests so acquired to the appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited.\nOn May 1, 1951, an agreement was entered into between the appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited and the appellant Prudential, whereby the latter agreed to hold in trust properties which had already been acquired.\nIt is not in dispute that the appellant Prudential is a bare trustee for the appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited.\nOn January 26, 1951, one Edward W. Hunter, acting as an agent of Amigo Petroleums Limited, called upon the respondent Edmond Cugnet at his home in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. At the time of this visit the respondent was playing cards in the sitting room and Hunter told him that he wanted to talk about mineral rights, whereupon they both went into another room. Hunter then told the respondent that he wanted an option in respect of the mineral rights on the north-west quarter and the south-east quarter of section 27 and offered to pay $32 on each of the quarter-sections for an option to take a petroleum and natural gas lease, such lease to take effect upon the expiration of the leases previously granted to Rio Bravo Oil Company Limited and Bandy Lee, and $32 yearly rental for each of the quarter-sections when the option was exercised and the petroleum and natural gas lease granted.\nAfter a short conversation between them, the respondent Edmond Cugnet signed a document entitled \"assignment\", wherein he assigned and transferred to the appellant Prudential an undivided one-half interest in all petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons in and under the said lands, subject to the terms and conditions of the petroleum and natural gas lease covering the said lands, and agreed to deliver to the appellant Prudential, as assignee, a registrable transfer of such interest. The respondent also granted to the appellant Prudential an exclusive option to acquire a petroleum and natural gas lease covering the said lands for a term of 99 years, to be computed from the date of the assignment, upon the termination of the current petroleum and natural gas lease. At the same time the respondent Edmond Cugnet executed a transfer, in favour of the appellant Prudential, of an undivided one-half interest in all of the mines and minerals within, upon or under the lands in question, reserving thereout all coal.\nAfter the execution of the documents by the respondent Edmond Cugnet, Hunter left, taking the documents with him, and on January 29, 1951, the respondent Edmond Cugnet received from the appellant Prudential a copy of the assignment and also a cheque for $64. The respondent Edmond Cugnet did not read the assignment or the transfer when they were executed by him, nor did he read the copy of the assignment when it was returned to him by the appellant Prudential.\nOn February 2, 1951, the appellant Prudential registered a caveat against the lands in question in the land titles office at Regina as instrument no. F.C. 2281.\nOn September 21, 1951, a letter was sent by the solicitors of the respondent Edmond Cugnet to the appellant Prudential, complaining about the transaction and requesting that the assignment and transfer be returned to them. On April 3, 1952, the respondent Raymond Cugnet, a son of the other respondent, filed a caveat against the titles of the lands in question, based upon an agreement for sale between his father as vendor and himself as purchaser, which agreement was entered into on November 12, 1945. On January 22, 1953, the registrar of land titles at Regina, pursuant to a requirement directed to him by the respondent Raymond Cugnet, gave notice to the appellant Prudential that the caveat of that company would lapse unless there was filed with him within 30 days a judge's order providing that the caveat continue beyond that period. The appellant Prudential obtained a judge's order continuing the caveat for an additional period of 30 days and providing for further continuance if, within the said 30 days, it brought an action to establish its rights under the caveat and filed with the registrar a certificate of lis pendens issued in the same action. In the result, this action was commenced and the certificate of lis pendens filed.\nAt trial it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the evidence adduced on behalf of the respondents did not establish a plea of non est factum as to the documents in question and that the transaction between Hunter, in the name of the appellant Prudential, and the respondent Edmond Cugnet was voidable and not void and that the appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice and was entitled to the interest in the lands in question specified in the assignment and to a transfer of an undivided one-half interest in the petroleum and natural gas within, upon or under the said lands. In the alternative, the appellants contended that the appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited was entitled to the option as specified in the assignment.\nThe respondents took the position that the transaction was not merely voidable, but void ab initio, and that a plea of bona fide purchaser for value was of no assistance to the appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited. They further contended that in any event, irrespective of misrepresentation, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties and no agreement between them, or that the agreement, if any, was void for uncertainty.\nThe learned trial judge, who was favourably impressed with the evidence of the respondent Edmond Cugnet, found that he never intended to complete the assignment and transfer, as they now appear in the record, and relied on the misrepresentation of Hunter that the documents he was asked to sign constituted only the granting of an option. Hunter was not called as a witness at the trial, his whereabouts being unknown. The learned trial judge further found that the respondent Edmond Cugnet was mistaken as to the nature and character of the assignment and transfer and that this mistake was induced by the fraudulent misrepresentation of Hunter, the agent of the appellant Prudential. In the result, the learned trial judge held that : the plea of non est factum was established and that the documents were void.\nWith respect to the submission on behalf of the appellants that Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited was a purchaser for value without notice of the fraud inducing the signing of the documents, the learned trial judge held that, while the evidence supported this submission, the rights of Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited were invalid and unenforceable because the documents were void. Further, the learned trial judge refused to give effect to the submission on behalf of the appellants that in any event Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited was entitled to the rights under the option granted by the respondent Edmond Cugnet and contained in the assignment, on the ground that the whole transaction, as evidenced by the documents, was void and the documents themselves were in a like position. The judgment of the learned trial judge, dismissing the action of the appellants, declared that the assignment and transfer were void and of no effect and ordered that they be delivered up to the respondent Edmond Cugnet for cancellation, and directed that the caveat and certificate of lis pendens be vacated.\nFrom that judgment an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal and by a unanimous judgment the appeal was dismissed on the ground that the plea of non est factum, as found by the learned trial judge, must be sustained. The Court of Appeal granted special leave to appeal from that judgment to this Court.\nIn the Courts below the appellants relied on Howatson v. Webb 5, affirmed on appeal 6. In that case the defendant Webb, who was formerly the managing clerk to one Hooper, acted as his nominee in a building speculation relating to certain property of which Hooper was the owner. Shortly after leaving Hooper's employment he was requested by Hooper to execute certain deeds, and, on asking what those deeds were, he was told by Hooper that they were deeds transferring the property in question, and the defendant thereupon signed them. One of the deeds so signed was a mortgage between the defendant, as mortgagor, of the one part, and one Whitaker, of the other part, and contained the usual covenant by the mortgagor for payment of principal and interest. In an action by the transferee of the mortgage for payment of the principal debt and interest the defendant pleaded non est factum. It was held that the misrepresentation being only as to the contents of a deed known by the defendant to deal with the property, the plea failed and that the defendant was liable on the covenant. Warrington J. at p. 549 said:\u2014\nWhat does the evidence in the present case shew? I may go so far in the defendant's favour as to say that Webb, having regard to his knowledge of Hooper, when Hooper said that the deeds were \"deeds for transferring the Edmonton property,\" was justified in believing that they were deeds such as a nominee could be called upon to execute either in favour of a new nominee or for the purpose of putting an end to his own position of nominee, and certainly not a deed creating a mortgage to another person. But in my opinion that is not enough. He was told that they were deeds relating to the property to which they did in fact relate. His mind was therefore applied to the question of dealing with that property. The deeds did deal with that property. The misrepresentation was as to the contents of the deed, and not as to the character and class of the deed. He knew he was dealing with the class of deed with which in fact he was dealing, but did not ascertain its contents. The deed contained a covenant to pay. Under those circumstances I cannot say that the deed is absolutely void. It purported to be a transfer of the property, and it wars a transfer of the property. If the plea of non est factum is to succeed, the deed must be wholly, and not partly, void. If that plea is an answer in this case, I must hold it to be an answer in every case of misrepresentation. In my opinion the law does not go as far as that. The defence therefore fails.\nThe appellants contend, on the authority of Howatson v. Webb, that, while the respondent Edmond Cugnet was indifferent and careless as to what he signed, nevertheless he is bound by what he did sign and cannot successfully maintain a plea of non est factum.\nThe respondents rely on Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg 7, where the facts were that the defendant, who pleaded non est factum, signed a document which purported to be a continuing guarantee by him, up to a certain amount, of the payment by one Rigg of any sum which might, at any time thereafter, be or become due from Rigg to the plaintiff, a banking company, on the general balance of his banking account with them. In fact the defendant had been induced by the fraud of Rigg to sign the document, without reading it, and not knowing that it was a guarantee, but believing it to be a document of a different character; namely, an insurance paper. Buckley L. J. said at p. 495:\u2014\nThe true way of ascertaining whether a deed is a man's deed is, I conceive, to see whether he attached his signature with the intention that that which preceded his signature should be taken to be his act and deed. It is not necessarily essential that he should know what the document contains: he may have been content to make it his act and deed, whatever it contained; he may have relied on the person who brought it to him, as in a case where a man's solicitor brings him a document, saying, \"this is a conveyance of your property,\" or \"this is your lease,\" and he does not inquire what covenants it contains, or what the rent reserved is, or what other material provisions in it are, but signs it as his act and deed, intending to execute that instrument, careless of its contents, in the sense that he is content to be bound by them whatsoever they are. If, on the other hand, he is materially misled as to the contents of the document, then his mind does not go with his pen. In that case it is not his deed. As to what amounts to materially misleading there is of course a question. Howatson v. Webb was a case in which the erroneous or insufficient information was not enough for the purpose.\nKennedy L.J. said at p. 497:\u2014\nThe principle involved, as I understand it, is that a consenting mind is essential to the making of a contract, and that in such a case as this there was really no consensus, because there was no intention to make a contract of the kind in question.\nIn order to determine the effectiveness of the plea of non est factum as applied to the facts of this case, it is necessary to examine the authorities.\nThe old cases on misrepresentation as to the contents of a deed were based upon the illiterate character of the person to whom the deed was read over, and on the fact that an illiterate man was treated as being in the same position as a blind man. Sheppard's Touchstone, 8th ed. 1826, p. 56.\nAn early instance of the application of the plea is to be found in Thoroughgood's Case 8, where it was held that a deed executed by an illiterate person does not bind him, if read falsely either by the grantee or a stranger; (2) that an illiterate man need not execute a deed before it be read to him in a language which he understands, but if the party executes without desiring it to be read, the deed is binding; (3) that if an illiterate man execute a deed which is falsely read, or the sense declared differently from the truth, it does not bind him.\nIt appears in more recent cases that the application of the plea has been extended beyond the earlier cases, which turned upon the question of illiteracy or blindness.\nThis extension is well illustrated in Foster v. Mackinnon 9, where the facts were that the defendant had been induced to put his name upon the back of a bill of exchange, making himself liable as indorser, on the fraudulent representation of the acceptor that he was signing a guarantee. The bill got into the hands of a bona fide holder for value, who sued the defendant as indorser, and the result of the action was that the defendant, having signed the document without knowing it was a bill and under the belief that it was a guarantee, and not having been guilty of any negligence in so signing it, was held not liable on the indorsement. Byles J. at p. 711 said:\u2014\nIt seems plain, on principle and on authority, that, if a blind man, or a man who cannot read, or who for some reason (not implying negligence) forbears to read, has a written) contract falsely read over to him, the reader misreading to such a degree that the written contract is of a nature altogether different from the contract pretended to be read from the paper which the blind or illiterate man afterwards signs; then, at least if there be no negligence, the signature so obtained is of no force. And it is invalid not merely on the ground of fraud, where fraud exists, but on the ground that the mind of the signer did not accompany the signature; in other words, that he never intended to sign, and therefore in contemplation of law never did sign, the contract to which his name is appended.\nIn Bagot v. Chapman 10, a married woman, entitled to a reversionary interest, was induced by her husband to execute a document which he represented to be a power of attorney enabling him to raise money at some future time. It was, in fact, a mortgage for \u00a312,000 of a reversionary interest to which she was entitled, containing a personal covenant for payment by the wife. The wife knew that if her husband did eventually raise money under the document it would be raised out of her reversionary interest. She did not intend to create a present charge or incur any personal liability. In an action brought by the mortgagees against the husband and wife for foreclosure and judgment on their covenants the wife pleaded, amongst other defences, non est factum, which was upheld. Swinfen Eady J. said at p. 227:\u2014\nIt is well settled that where a person is induced to execute a deed by a false representation as to the nature and character of the document he is signing\u2014where the document is of a totally different character from what he was told it was\u2014such a deed does not bind him.\nThe learned judge distinguished Howatson v. Webb at p. 227:\u2014\nThe present case is different from the recent case of Howatson v. Webb, where the grantor was told that the deeds signed by him related to the property to which they did relate, and were deeds transferring that property, and his mind was applied to the question of dealing with that property.\nThe principle that ignorance of the contents of a deed will not support a plea of non est factum was applied in L'Estrange v. F. Graucob, Limited 11. In that case the buyer of an automatic slot machine alleged that when she signed the order form she had not read it and knew nothing of its contents and that the clause excluding warranties could not easily be read owing to the smallness of the print. There was no evidence of any misrepresentation by the sellers to the buyer as to the terms of the contract. Scrutton L.J. said at p. 403:\u2014\nWhen a document containing 'contractual terms is signed, then, in the absence of fraud, or, I will add, misrepresentation, the party signing it is bound, and it is wholly immaterial whether he has read the document or not.\nIn Marks v. The Imperial Life Assurance Company of Canada 12, affirmed on appeal 13, the facts were that the wife of an insured, named as beneficiary in certain insurance policies, signed with the insured a borrowing agreement in respect of each policy. It was found as a fact that the insured misrepresented to his wife the nature of the documents she was signing, telling her that they were merely for the purpose of changing, to her advantage, the scheme of payment of the insurance moneys. It was held that the wife was entitled to succeed upon the plea of non est factum, since it was clear that the two documents signed by her bore no relation in class or character to the documents described to her by the husband when she signed them McRuer C.J.H.C., after a valuable review of the authorities, said at p. 68:\u2014\nIt would appear to be clear from these authorities that where a person signing a document is misled by the misrepresentation of another as to its true nature and character, as distinct from the purport and effect of its contents, it is invalid and the plea of non est factum is a good plea.\nIn Curtis v. Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co. 14, the dispute was as to whether or not the plaintiff; who had1 taken a dress to the defendants' shop to be cleaned and had signed a paper headed \"receipt\", was bound by a condition that the cleaners accepted no liability for any damage however arising. It was held that the defendants could not rely on the exemption clause because their assistant, by an innocent misrepresentation, had created a false impression in the mind of the plaintiff as to the extent of the exemption and thereby induced her to sign the receipt. Denning L.J., referring to the L'Estrange case, supra, said at p. 808:\u2014\nIf the party affected signs a written document, knowing it to be a contract which governs the relations between them, his signature is irrefragable evidence of his assent to the whole contract, including the exempting clauses, unless the signature is shown to be obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.\nand again at p. 808:\u2014\nIn my opinion any behaviour, by words or conduct, is sufficient to be a misrepresentation if it is such as to mislead the other party about the existence or extent of the exemption. If it conveys a false impression, that is enough. If the false impression is created knowingly, it is a fraudulent misrepresentation; if it is created unwittingly, it is an innocent misrepresentation; but either is sufficient to disentitle the creator of it to the benefit of the exemption.\nThe question for determination is whether the principle contained in Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg, supra, or that contained in the earlier case of Howatson v. Webb, supra, should be applied to the facts of this case.\nIt is to be observed; as was pointed out by the Court of Appeal in the present case, that in Howatson v. Webb, supra, the misrepresentation was made by a solicitor and that the defendant, also a solicitor, should have realized that he was signing a mortgage and not a transfer. Hals-bury, 3rd ed. 1955, Vol. 11, p. 360, note (o), also makes reference to the fact that the defendant was a solicitor and could not have been misled if he had read the document, but chose to execute it without doing so. When the defendant Webb asked what the deeds were that he had been asked to sign he was told that they were just deeds transferring the Edmonton property. In fact one deed was a mortgage, but it is to be remembered that in England a mortgage operates as a conveyance and is a transfer of property by way of mortgage. The Court may have been influenced by the fact that the document signed by Webb was not of a character \"wholly different\" from what was represented to him.\nThe principle contained in Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg, supra, was approved in this Court in Minchau v. Busse 15.. Sir Lyman Duff C.J.C. said at p. 294:\u2014\nThe law is stated in the most satisfactory way in the judgment of Buckley L.J. in Carlisle & Cumberland Banking Co. v. Bragg, [1911] 1 K.B. 489 at p. 495.\nIn my view, while the respondent Edmond Cugnet knew that he was dealing with his petroleum and natural gas rights, the representation made to him was as to the nature and character of the document and not merely as to its contents. It was represented to be an option to grant a petroleum and natural gas lease, when, in fact, it was an assignment and transfer to the appellant Prudential of an undivided one-half interest in the petroleum and natural gas rights of the respondent Edmond Cugnet in the lands in question in the action.\nApplying the principle contained in Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg, supra, as I do, I have come to the conclusion that the mind of the respondent Edmond Cugnet did not go with his hand and that the plea of non est factum has been established.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant Prudential, in the alternative, that, in any event, the appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited was entitled to the option con- tained in the document in question, which, on the evidence, the respondent Edmond Cugnet agreed to grant and for which he received payment.\nWith this contention I am unable to agree. The option is predicated upon the assignment and transfer to the appellant Prudential of an undivided one-half interest in the petroleum and natural gas upon or under the lands in question. It is an option given jointly by the respondent Edmond Cugnet and the appellant Prudential to grant a petroleum and natural gas lease to the appellant Prudential or its nominee.\nMoreover, the option provided that, in addition to the share of the production to which the appellant Prudential, or its nominee, would become entitled as lessee under the terms of any lease obtained under the option, the appellant Prudential should be entitled to its share of production reserved by the respondent Edmond Cugnet and the appellant Prudential as lessors under such lease.\nIn my view, if the assignment of the one-half interest is void, then that portion of the document granting the option cannot be severed and falls with the rest of the transaction.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the plea of non est factum has been established and that the whole transaction is void, it is unnecessary to consider the other points raised in argument on the appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLocke, J.:\u2014The question as to whether the respondents in the present matter are entitled to rely upon the plea of non est factum is not determined by deciding whether that plea would succeed if this action had been brought by the principals on whose behalf Hunter acted in obtaining the signature of Edmond Cugnet to the disputed documents: there remains the further and, to my mind, the more difficult question whether they are entitled to assert that defence as against the present appellants.\nHunter, at the time, appears to have been acting on behalf of Amigo Petroleums Limited, for which company the trust company was simply a bare trustee. Considering the matter, first, from the standpoint as to whether the agreement would have been enforceable if the action had been brought by the latter company, it is my opinion that either a defence of non est factum, or that Edmond Cugnet had been induced to sign the documents by fraudulent misrepresentation made to him by Hunter would have defeated the claim, though the first would have rendered the agreement void ab initio while the latter would merely render it voidable. Despite statements in some of the decided cases such as Howatson v. Webb 16, which would suggest that the plea non est factum cannot succeed if the person signing the document is aware that the instrument he is asked to sign disposes of some interest in his property, where as here documents represented as being simply an option on mineral rights to be operative in the event of an outstanding option being dropped, include in fact an out and out sale of an undivided half interest in the mineral rights, the defence is, in my opinion, an answer.\nThe question as to whether the respondents are entitled to rely upon the defence is raised by the plea of estoppel by conduct in the reply to the statement of defence. The basis for the contention is that Edmond Cugnet having, by his conduct, enabled Hunter and his principals to sell what appeared on the face of it to be a half interest in the mineral rights to a purchaser for value acting in good faith, he cannot dispute the validity of the instruments as against the latter. The estoppel, it is said, arises by reason of the negligence of Edmond Cugnet. The question is the same as that referred to by Buckley L.J. in Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg 17, in the following terms:\u2014\nThere has been so much discussion during the argument as to the plea of non est factum, and the relevance of negligence in relation to it under the circumstances of this case, that I wish to say a few words expressing -my view of the law on the subject. In an action upon a deed, the defendant may say by way of defence that it is not his deed, non est factum. If it is found to be his deed, the plaintiff gets judgment and there is an end of the case. But suppose that it is found not to be his deed, and he succeeds on non est factum, the case is not necessarily over, because the plaintiff may say, \"True you have established that this is not in fact your deed ; but you are estopped by your conduct from saying that it is not your deed, and I can recover against you, although it is not your deed.\" It is only in this latter case that the question of estoppel comes into action. Negligence has nothing to do with the question whether the deed is in fact the deed of the defendant. Negligence has only to do with the question of estoppel. That negligence of the nature suggested would preclude a person from relying upon the defence non est factum if the document were a negotiable instrument appears to have been suggested, if not decided, in Foster v. Mackinnon 18. The instructions to the jury in that case which were approved by the unanimous decision of the court said in part:\u2014\nIf the defendant's signature to the document was obtained upon a fraudulent representation that it was a guarantee, and the defendant signed it without knowing that it was a bill, and under the belief that it was a guarantee, and if he was not guilty of any negligence in so signing the paper, he was entitled to the verdict.\nIn the earlier case of Swan v. The North British Australasian Company 19, a decision referred to by Byles J. when delivering the judgment of the court in Foster's Case, there is a review of the earlier authorities to be found in the judgment of Martin B. at pp. 644 et seq. At p. 649 that learned judge said in part:\u2014\nI think it may be said with certainty that there is not one of them which is an authority for the proposition that, where a deed is not the deed of the party, he may be estopped by negligence or carelessness on his part from being permitted to aver that it is not.\nChannell B. who agreed with Martin B. said at p. 658:\u2014\nIt would seem that an estoppel may arise out of circumstances having reference to a bill of lading or negotiable instrument taking effect by virtue of the law and custom of merchants, where no estoppel could arise from nearly similar circumstances with respect to a document not operating by virtue of the law and custom of merchants.\nand referred to what had been said by Lord Chancellor Cottenham in William M'Ewan and Sons v. James and Archibald Smith et al. 20.\nIn Bragg's Case, Vaughan-Williams L.J. and Kennedy L.J. expressed the opinion that what had been said in Foster's Case as to the possible effect of negligence was applicable only to the case of a negotiable instrument.\nIn France v. Clark 21 where the question was as to the effect of a transfer of shares signed in blank which had been fraudulently made use of by the person with whom they had been deposited as security, Selborne L.C., at p. 262, referred to the rule relating to negotiable instruments in these terms:\u2014\nThe person who has signed a negotiable instrument in blank, or with blank spaces, is (on account of the negotiable character of that instrument) estopped by the law merchant from disputing any alteration made in the document, after it has left his hands, by filling up blanks (or otherwise in a way not ex facie fraudulent) as against a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value without notice.\nThat reason has no application to documents such as those signed by Edmond Cugnet in the present ease.\nIt is my opinion that the result of the authorities was correctly stated in Bragg's Case. To say that a person may be estopped by careless conduct such as that in the present case, when the instrument is not negotiable, is to assert the existence of some duty on the part of the person owing to the public at large, or to other persons unknown to him who might suffer damage by acting upon the instrument on the footing that it is valid in the hands of the holder. I do not consider that the authorities support the view that there is any such general duty, the breach of which imposes a liability in negligence. I think the validity of the contention may be tested by asking whether, in a case such as this, an action for damages would lie at the suit of Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited against Edmond Cugnet. The answer to that question must, in my opinion, be in the negative: Bank of Ireland v. Evans Trustees 22, Parke B. at p. 410; Swan's Case, supra, at p. 650. If, indeed, there were such a duty, I think, for the reason pointed out by Channell B. in Swan's Case, that such an action would fail since the proximate cause of the damage was the fraudulent act of Hunter.\nFor these reasons, it is my opinion that the appeal should fail and be dismissed with costs.\nCartwright J. (dissenting) :\u2014The question raised for decision in this appeal is which of two innocent parties is to suffer for the fraud of a third.\nThe relevant facts and the view of the Courts below are fully set out in the reasons of my brother Nolan and I propose to give only a brief summary of the salient points on which the rights of the parties depend. On January 26, 1951, the respondent Edmond G. Cugnet, hereinafter called \"Cugnet Senior\" signed and sealed a document whereby he conveyed an undivided one-half interest in all petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons in and under two quarter-sections owned by him to Prudential Trust Company Limited, hereinafter called \"Prudential\", and granted to that company an option to acquire upon the termination of an existing petroleum and natural gas lease a petroleum and natural gas lease covering the said lands for a term of 99 years from January 26, 1951, on the same terms as those contained in the existing lease except that the cash rental was to be 25 cents per acre. Cugnet Senior was induced to sign this document by the fraudulent representation made to him by one Edward Hunter that it contained only the grant of an option. Cugnet Senior is literate, has had experience in buying and selling properties, has been successful, and, in his own words, has \"lots of money\". He signed the document without reading it. He does not suggest that anything was done to prevent him reading it but appears to have been anxious to return without delay to the game of cards which had been interrupted by Hunter's arrival. He had not met Hunter previously. Hunter took the document away with him but two or three weeks later Cugnet Senior received a copy of it together with a cheque for $64 the amount of the consideration which he had agreed to accept. He did not read this copy until some months later when his son, the respondent Raymond A. Cugnet, called his attention to its contents. In the meantime the copy had been hanging up on a spike in the kitchen at the home of Cugnet Senior: Prudential in taking the conveyance was acting as bare trustee for Amigo Petroleums Limited. During February 1951, the last-mentioned company transferred the one-half interest and the option to one Nickle who, in turn, transferred them for value to the appellant Canuck Freehold Royalties Limited, hereinafter called \"Canuck\", for which Prudential holds as bare trustee. Canuck had no notice or knowledge of the fraud practised by Hunter.\nIn upholding the respondent's plea of non est factum the learned trial judge distinguished the case at bar from Howatson v. Webb 23, on the ground that the misrepresen- tation was in the latter as to the contents of the document and in the former as to the nature and character of the document. I must confess that I find difficulty in discerning a difference between a conveyance of a half interest in the oil and gas under specified lands and the grant of an option to obtain a 99-year lease of such oil and gas which is greater or more fundamental than the difference between a reconveyance by a bare trustee of the legal estate in specified land to the beneficial owner thereof and a mortgage of such land containing a personal covenant to pay. The following words of Warrington J. at the trial 24, might well be applied in the case at bar:\n\u2026 but it seems to me that these dicta contained in the judgments clearly point to this, that if a man knows that the deed is one purporting to deal with his property and he executes it, it will not be sufficient for him, in order to support a plea of non est factum, to shew that a misrepresentation was made to him as to the contents of the deed. The deed in the present case is not of a character so wholly different from that which it was represented to be as to come within the principle within which Lord Hatherley held that the case before him did not fall.\nIt is clear that Cugnet Senior knew that the deed which he was executing was one purporting to deal with the petroleum and natural gas under two correctly specified quarter-sections owned by him. On the assumption that a distinction can validly be drawn between the facts in Howatson v. Webb, supra, and those in Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg 25, it is my view that on its facts the case at bar falls within the class of cases of which the former is an example.\nIf, however, it be assumed that the Courts below were right in holding that the document of January 26, 1951, was entirely different in nature from what Cugnet Senior believed it to be, it is my opinion that in signing and sealing the document without reading it he was guilty of such negligence that as between himself and Canuck, which gave valuable consideration on the strength of the deed which he had in fact signed and sealed, he must bear the loss.\nThe general principle was stated as follows by Lord Halsbury sitting in the Court of Appeal in Henderson & Co. v. Williams 26.:\u2014\nI think that it is not undesirable to refer to an American authority, which, I observe, was quoted in the case of Kingsford v. Merry, Root v. French in which, in the Supreme Court of New York, Savage C.J. makes observations which seem to me to be well worthy of consideration. Speaking of a bona fide purchaser who has purchased property from a fraudulent vendee and given value for it, he says: \"He is protected in doing so upon the principle just stated, that when one of two innocent persons must suffer from the fraud of a third, he shall suffer, who, by his indiscretion, has enabled such third person to commit the fraud. A contrary principle would endanger the security of commercial transactions, and destroy that confidence upon which what is called the usual course of trade materially rests.\"\nIn Farquharson Brothers & Company v. King & Company 27, Lord Halsbury L.C. presiding in the House of Lords reaffirmed the above passage and pointed out that in the case then before the House the Court of Appeal had fallen into error through disregarding the words \"who, by his indiscretion\".\nA branch of the principle so stated is the rule that, generally speaking, a person who executes a document without taking the trouble to read it is liable on it and cannot plead that he mistook its contents, at all events, as against a person who acting in good faith in the ordinary course of business has changed his position in reliance on such document. But it is said that the plea of non est factum operates as an exception to this salutary rule. That this is so in the case of a blind or illiterate person may be taken to be established by Thoroughgood's Case 28, but whether the exception extends to an educated person who is not blind is a question which was treated by Mellish L.J. in Hunter v. Walters 29 and by Warrington J. and the Court of Appeal in Howatson v. Webb, supra, as being still open. In the former case at pp. 86-7, Mellish L.J. says:\u2014\nNow, I am of opinion that there is evidence that both Hunter and Darnell were induced by the fraud of Walters to execute that deed ; but the mere circumstance that they were induced to execute it by fraud does not make it a void deed in point of law. But it is said that there is something more than this, and that where a deed is procured by an actual false representation respecting the contents of the deed itself, or respecting the legal effect of the deed, there the deed is not only voidable, but is actually void at law, and, being void, the parties are in the same position as if it had never been executed at all. Thence, no doubt, it would follow, that Mr. Walters never got any estate in these premises at all, and therefore that an equitable mortgage by him would be altogether invalid.\nNow, in my opinion, it is still a doubtful question at law, on which I do not wish to give any decisive opinion, whether, if there be a false representation respecting the contents of a deed, a person who is an educated person, and who might, by very simple means, have satisfied him- self as to what the contents of the deed really were, may not, by executing it negligently be estopped as between himself and a person who innocently acts upon the faith of the deed being valid, and who accepts an estate under it.\nThis passage is quoted by Warrington J. in Howatson v. Webb and in the Court of Appeal 30, Farwell L.J. says:\u2014\nI think myself that the question suggested, but not decided, by Mellish L.J. in that case will some day have to be determined, viz., whether the old cases on misrepresentation as to the contents of a deed were not based upon the illiterate character of the person to whom the deed was read over, and on the fact that an illiterate man was treated as being in the same position as a blind man: see Thoroughgood's Case, and Sheppard's Touchstone, p. 56; and whether at the present time an educated person, who is not blind, is not estopped from availing himself of the plea of non est factum against a person who innocently acts upon the faith of the deed being valid.\nWhile he does not refer specifically to the question suggested by Mellish L.J., Buckley L.J. gives an answer to it in Carlisle v. Bragg, supra, at p. 496, where, speaking of the plea of non est factum, he says:\u2014\nI do not think myself that cases of this kind are to be confined to the blind and illiterate. Blindness and illiteracy constitute a state of things of which the equivalent for this purpose may under certain circumstances be predicated of persons who are neither blind nor illiterate. If a document were presented to me written in Hebrew or Syriac, I should for the purposes of that document be both blind and illiterate\u2014blind in the sense that, although I saw some marks on the paper, they conveyed no meaning to my mind, and illiterate as regards the particular document, because I could not read it. It seems to me that the same doctrine applies to every person who is so placed as that he is incapable by the use of such means as are open to him of ascertaining, or is by false information deceived in a material respect as to, the contents of the document which he is asked to sign.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that instead of the word \"or\" which I have italicized in this passage the word \"and\" ought to have been used. In a case where the deed in question has in fact been executed by the person raising the plea it is of the essence of the plea of non est factum that such person shall have been deceived as to its contents. I do not, of course, suggest that Buckley L.J. used the word \"or\" by inadvertence, for it seems clear that Bragg was capable by the use of such means as were open to him of ascertaining the contents of the document which he was asked to sign. All that he had to do was to read it.\nAn anxious consideration of all the authorities referred to by counsel and in the Courts below has brought me to the conclusion that, in so far as Carlisle v. Bragg decides that the rule that negligence excludes a plea of non est factum is limited to the case of negotiable instruments and does not extend to a deed such as the one before us, we should refuse to follow it. I do not read the judgment of Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in Minchau v. Busse 31 and particularly his reference at p. 294 to the judgment of Buckley L.J. as binding us to follow everything that was decided in Carlisle v. Bragg.\nIn my view the effect of the decisions prior to Carlisle v. Bragg is accurately summarized in Cheshire and Fifoot on Contract, 4th ed. 1956, at pp. 206-7, as follows:\u2014\nThe rule before 1911 was that if A., the victim of the fraud of C, was guilty of negligence in executing a written instrument different in kind from that which he intended to execute, then he was estopped as against innocent transferees from denying the validity of the written contract.\nThat rule was, I think, laid down by Byles J. delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court in Foster v. Mackinnon 32 as being applicable to all written contracts. It appears to me that the Court of Appeal in Carlisle v. Bragg misinterpreted the following passage in the judgment of Byles J. at p. 712:\u2014\nNevertheless, this principle, when applied to negotiable instruments, must be and is limited in its application. These instruments are not only assignable, but they form part of the currency of the country. A qualification of the general rule is necessary to protect innocent transferees for value. If, therefore, a man write his name across the back of a blank bill-stamp, and part with it, and the paper is afterwards improperly filled up, he is liable as indorser. If he write it across the face of the bill, he is liable as acceptor, when the instrument has once passed into the hands of an innocent indorsee for value before maturity, and liable to the extent of any sum which the stamp will cover.\nIn these cases, however, the party signing knows what he is doing: the indorser intended to indorse, and the acceptor intended to accept, a bill of exchange to be thereafter filled up, leaving the amount, the date, the maturity, and the other parties to the bill undetermined. But, in the case now under consideration, the defendant, according to the evidence, if believed, and the finding of the jury, never intended to indorse a bill of exchange at all, but intended to sign a contract of an entirely different nature. It was not his design, and, if he were guilty of no negligence, it was not even his fault that the instrument he signed turned out to be a bill of exchange.\nThis does not say that the rule, that the signer if guilty of negligence will be estopped from denying the validity of a document as against a purchaser for value in good faith, is confined to the case of negotiable instruments; but rather that a person who knows he is signing a negotiable instrument cannot deny its validity to a holder in due course although he was guilty of no negligence in affixing his signature.\nIt may be said that the term negligence is inappropriate because it presupposes a duty owed by Cugnet Senior to Canuck, but in the passages quoted the term is, I think, used as meaning that lack of reasonable care in statement which gives rise to an estoppel. As it was put by Sir William Anson 33 in an article on Carlisle v. Bragg:\u2014\nAnd further, there seems some confusion between the negligence which creates a liability in tort, and the lack of reasonable care in statement which gives rise to an estoppel. Bragg might well have been precluded by carelessness from resisting the effect of his written words, though the Bank might not have been able to sue him for negligence.\nOn the facts in the case at bar it cannot be doubted that Cugnet Senior failed to exercise reasonable care in signing the document in question. He executed a deed which he knew dealt with the oil and gas under his property without reading it, relying on the statements as to its contents made by Hunter who was a stranger to him. It does not appear that anything was done to prevent his reading the document. He chose to sign it unread rather than to absent himself for a few more minutes from the game of cards. His conduct, in my opinion, precludes him from relying on the plea of non est factum as against Canuck which purchased relying on the deed, in good faith, for value, and without notice or knowledge of any circumstance affecting the validity of the deed.\nThe terms of the deed appear to me to be sufficiently clear and I think that the plea that it is void for uncertainty must be rejected. In the result I would allow the appeal with costs throughout and direct that judgment be entered for the relief claimed in the amended statement of claim.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Thorn, Bastedo, McDougall & Ready, Regina.\nSolicitor for the defendants, respondents: D.

While gasoline was being delivered from one of these tank trucks it escaped as a result of the negligence of the driver of the truck and caught fire, and the fire caused extensive damage to the service station and to property of other persons then on the premises. The company paid the claims of the persons damaged, and then sought indemnity under two policies of insurance.\nHeld: The company was entitled to recover under one policy, but not under the other.\nThe first policy, an automobile liability policy, expressly insured against liability \u201carising from the ownership, use or operation\u201d of the vehicle, and the loss clearly arose from the \u201cuse\u201d of the tank truck within the meaning of the insuring clause. That term included not only the transportation of the gasoline from the company\u2019s premises to the service station but also its delivery into the tanks at the service station. (Per curiam.)\nThe second policy, however, was a general liability policy, and specifically excluded \u201cany claim arising or existing by reason of... Any motor vehicle\u201d. This must be taken to be an exclusion of liability arising in any way from the ownership, use or operation of an automobile, or precisely what was covered by the other policy. The exclusion extended even to the finding that the truck driver had been negligent in not ascertaining the quantity of gasoline already in the tank before starting to deliver it, since this was merely a circumstance annexed to the act of delivery. (Per Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Rand and Cartwright JJ.; Locke J. contra.)\nPer Locke J. (dissenting in part): The loss was covered in part by the second policy as well as the first. The risk covered by this policy was not defined by statute, and the policy was to be construed contra proferentem. Anderson v. Fitzgerald, (1853), 4 H.L. Cas. 484 at 507, applied. The liability for the negligent act of the driver fell squarely within the insuring clause and was not excluded by the special exclusion, construed, as it should be, in the sense in which the insured person might reasonably understand it; if the insurer had intended to exclude this risk it should have done so in clear and unambiguous terms, which admitted of no doubt. Life Association of Scotland v. Foster et al., (1873), 11 M. (Ct. of Sess.) 351 at 371; Provincial Insurance Company, Limited v. Morgan et al., [1923] A.C. 240 at 250, referred to. The insurer had therefore committed a breach of its contract in declining to investigate the claims made against the insured, to conduct the defence of the litigation and to pay the judgments up to the limits in the policy. The action against this insurer was one for damages for breach of contract, and the insurer\u2019s conduct amounted in law to a waiver of its right to insist upon compliance by the insured with the provisions of the contract as to admitting liability or settling claims. Jureidini v. National British and Irish Millers Insurance Company, Limited, [1915] A.C. 499 at 505, 507, applied.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], on appeal from the judgment of Spence J.[2] in two actions tried together. B.J. Thomson, Q.C., for the defendant Stevenson, appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant and respondent.\nR.F. Wilson, Q.C., for the defendant Canadian General Insurance Company, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014In the action by Reliance Petroleum Limited against R.C. Stevenson, C.A., in his capacity as attorney in Canada for the Non-Marine Underwriters at Lloyds, Spence J., the trial judge2 considered that the liability of Reliance for the negligence of their employee Anstey arose out of the use of the tank truck and, therefore, the claim fell within the following clause of the policy of insurance issued by Lloyds to Reliance:\u2014\nThe Insurer agrees to indemnify the Insured...against the liability imposed by law upon the Insured. for loss or damage arising from the ownership, use or operation of the automobile.\nWe are not concerned with the legislation respecting automobile insurance, to which counsel for Lloyds referred, but with the terms of the policy. There is no doubt on the evidence that Anstey was negligent and that a liability was imposed by law upon Reliance for the loss or damage detailed in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below. The tank trucks, which admittedly were covered by the policy, were stated, in the application therefor, to be used in the business of the insured, which was that of distributing oil and gasoline. These tank trucks were not merely to transport those products to service stations, but they were equipped so as to permit the discharge of gasoline into the tanks in such stations through faucets and hose. In the Court of Appeal[3] Roach J.A. considered that what was done in the present case fell as well within the \u201coperation\u201d as the \u201cuse\u201d of the tank truck and, in fact, that these two terms were synonymous. With respect, I am unable to agree, as it must be taken that the two words were inserted to denote different things and I am not satisfied that \u201coperation\u201d by itself would be sufficient to cover the cir- cumstances with which we are dealing. However, the liability imposed upon Reliance was for loss or damage arising from the \u201cuse\u201d of the tank truck and that is sufficient to warrant the dismissal of Lloyds\u2019 appeal with costs.\nThe appeal by Reliance against the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of its action against Canadian General Insurance Company raises different problems, only one of which, however, I find it necessary to consider. That company had issued to Reliance what is called a \u201cGENERAL PUBLIC LIABILITY POLICY\u201d and it is not suggested that the claims advanced by Reliance fall within the terms of the policy itself, because it covered merely the liability of Reliance for damages caused by bodily injury, sickness, or disease. In a \u201cPROPERTY DAMAGE ENDORSEMENT\u201d attached to the policy it was stated that the endorsement was issued \u201cIn consideration of an additional premium\u201d, but the body of the document shows that the additional premium was included in that prescribed for the policy. By para. 1 of this endorsement the company agreed:\u2014\nTo PAY on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the Insured by law, or assumed by the Insured under contract as set forth hereinafter, for damages because of injury to or destruction of property caused by accident occurring within the Policy Period and while this Endorsement is in force.\nHowever, this agreement was \u201csubject to the Statements, Exclusions and Special Conditions of the Policy\u201d and in the policy, under the heading \u201cEXCLUSIONS\u201d, appears the following:\u2014\nThis Policy shall have no application with respect to and shall not extend to nor cover any claim arising or existing by reason of any of the following matters:\n* * *\n3. Any motor vehicle (including trailer or semi-trailer) that is required by law to have a license or permit, and which is off premises owned, rented or controlled by the Named Insured, or which is owned, hired or leased by the Insured, and, except with respect to operation by independent contractors, the ownership, maintenance or use, including loading or unloading, of any (a) watercraft while away from such premises or (b) aircraft.\nDiffering from Lloyds\u2019 policy, which was a standard automobile insurance policy, the \u201cPROPERTY DAMAGE ENDORSEMENT\u201d of Canadian General Insurance Company when read, as it must be, subject to exclusion no. 3, was not to cover the insurance of automobiles, but other forms of public liability. In fact the very kind of insurance covered by Lloyds for \u201closs or damage arising from the ownership, use, or operation of the automobile\u201d is clearly and specifically excepted from the risk undertaken by Canadian General Insurance Company.\nThe appeal by Reliance should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014The questions on this appeal are whether the loss suffered is within the general public liability policy of the respondent Canadian General Insurance Company, or within the motor vehicle liability policy of the appellant Lloyds, or both; but notwithstanding Mr. Thomson\u2019s comprehensive argument I am of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal[4] was right.\nHis first contention is that the damage did not arise from the \u201cuse\u201d of the automobile as that word appears in Lloyds\u2019 policy:\nThe Insurer agrees to indemnify the Insured...against the liability imposed by law upon the Insured...for loss or damage arising from the ownership, use or operation of the automobile within Canada...\nThe main ground is that what was present was not negligence in any function attributable to an automobile: it was negligence in a function added to but distinct from that of an automobile, that is, the discharge of gasoline into the tank of a service station: the want of care of an employee in the course of work dissociated from operation or use of the truck. He classified what was being done with a number of examples of similar non-automobile uses of such a vehicle: receiving visitors on a home trailer while stationary; using spray-painting equipment set up on and moved from place to place on a truck; a circus truck carrying a cage from which a lion escapes and does mischief; a peanut or like familiar stand set up in a truck and disposing of its wares at different places. These can, no doubt, be described as separate and distinct in their nature and purpose from that of the automobile; the use of the truck can properly be differentiated from the function of the apparatus or means conveyed; but the question is whether we have here such a severable activity. Was the negligence of the employee in the course of work other than that of his operation or use of the truck? What was the undertaking entered upon by means of the truck? It was to carry gasoline products for delivery at filling stations, not merely to carry; delivery was as much a part of what was being done by means of the truck as the carriage.\nDid the fire, then, result from negligence in delivering the gasoline? I cannot see how that can be seriously doubted. For negligence we must have human action: the truck is not \u201cself\u2011operating\u201d or \u201cself-using\u201d; \u201cuse\u201d implies human direction and utilization of a means; it is the combination of the two that constitutes the act to which innocence or negligence is to be imputed. That is the act intended to be embraced by the language of the clause. Here the overflow was physically the direct result of the pressure from the oil in the tank truck which was then under the control of the driver. His failure to ascertain the capacity of the underground tank and to remain at the truck faucet or closing valve constituted negligence in relation to the use of the truck in discharging the gasoline. That was part of the function of the tank truck and does not come within the class of differentiated uses mentioned.\nAn analogous \u201cuse\u201d, as distinguished from \u201coperation\u201d, is exemplified in the case of a bus. The undertaking in such a case includes the entrance and exit to and from the bus of passengers. If the steps are defective and a passenger is injured, could it be said that injury did not arise out of the \u201cuse\u201d? The expression \u201cuse or operation\u201d would or should, in my opinion, convey to one reading it all accidents resulting from the ordinary and well-known activities to which automobiles are put, all accidents which the common judgment in ordinary language would attribute to the utilization of an automobile as a means of different forms of accommodation or service. It may be said that in these instances \u201cuse\u201d and \u201coperation\u201d are equivalents: but the statute uses both words and meaning can be given to each in this manner where the \u201cuse\u201d is that in fact of the automobile. Canadian General Insurance Company claimed exemption on two grounds, but I find it necessary to deal with one only. Its general contract is to indemnify the insured against liability imposed by law for damages to property \u201ccaused by accident\u201d. The exclusion is in this language:\nThis Policy shall have no application with respect to and shall not extend to nor cover any claim arising or existing by reason of any of the following matters:\n* * *\n3. Any motor vehicle... which is owned, hired or leased by the Insured.\nI agree with Roach J.A. that damage from accident arising by reason of \u201cany motor vehicle\u201d includes the damage done here. That phrase contemplates damage done by such a vehicle in use or operation within the scope and course of its ordinary functions. Here the insured is engaged in selling gasoline and other automobile supplies and in delivering them by means of tank trucks, a commercial activity that has become of wide dimensions. What the clause aims at is to exclude from its coverage the area of automobile insurance and to embrace public liability arising from other causes than automobiles. It is expressed in broad but unambiguous language which is to be interpreted in the light of the common knowledge of this new feature of our social condition.\nBut \u201cuse\u201d, it is argued, is to be distinguished from \u201coperation\u201d; that the condition of this exclusion, being in derogation of the general language of liability, must be confined to the narrowest common function of automobiles which the trial judge found to be \u201coperation\u201d. The words can, obviously, be given distinct meaning by limiting the scope of \u201coperation\u201d to the mere locomotion of the vehicle, and attributing to \u201cuse\u201d the discharge of the gasoline. But this limitation must be rejected because of the associated language and because of its overriding implication involving all liability related to an automobile. The fact that in the statutes of Ontario automobile insurance is dealt with in a most particularized manner must be kept in mind when we are dealing with insurances against public liability and the presence of such an exclusion.\nI have not overlooked the finding of the Court of Appeal that the truck driver was negligent in not measuring the depth of gasoline in the tank before commencing to deliver. But, just as the failure to remain at the truck during the discharge, that was merely a circumstance annexed to his act of delivery; the cause of the disaster was the unattended discharge into an unexamined tank, a composite negligent act in the operation of the truck.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting in part):\u2014These two appeals were heard together and were taken from two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[5], one of which dismissed the appeal of the appellant Stevenson from the judgment of Spence J. at the trial[6], the other allowed the appeal of the respondent Canadian General Insurance Company from a judgment of that learned judge delivered at the same time. As the evidence as to the occurrence which gave rise to the claims was equally applicable to both actions, they were, by consent, tried together.\nThe actions were brought upon policies of insurance issued by the Non-Marine Underwriters at Lloyds and by Canadian General Insurance Company, and the questions to be determined are as to the construction of the language of these policies. It is, however, necessary to consider the evidence to assist in determining these questions of construction.\nReliance Petroleum Limited is a distributor of oil and oil products in London, Ontario, and makes its deliveries of gasoline to service stations in that vicinity in tank trucks. On September 1, 1951, Ronald Riddell, the operator of a service station rented by him from the Reliance company, ordered by telephone a quantity of standard and ethyl gasoline. Anstey, an employee of the Reliance company, drove one of its gasoline trucks, which carried five tanks, to the service station to make the delivery. The tanks carried on the truck were each equipped with faucets to which a hose might be connected for delivering the gas into underground tanks. These faucets were operated by a spring mechanism so designed that it was necessary to hold them open while gas flowed from the tank by the force of gravity. After delivering the 200 gallons of ethyl gasoline which had been ordered, Anstey connected the hose to the faucet of a tank carrying standard gasoline, of which, according to him, Riddell had ordered 400 gallons. Without measuring the quantity of gasoline in the underground tank to which the delivery was being made, he then, instead of remaining at the faucet, as required by the regulations made under The Gasoline Handling Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 156, placed a stick, carried by him on the truck for the purpose, in such a manner as to keep the spring mechanism of the faucet open, and left the truck apparently for the purpose of obtaining payment for the gasoline being delivered. While he was thus absent, due to the fact that the underground tank already contained more gasoline than Anstey had thought, it overflowed. Gasoline spreading into the garage on the service station property and then igniting caused extensive damage.\nActions to recover damages for loss sustained were brought against the Reliance company by five persons who had personal property on the premises, by the owner of the service station property and by Riddell, and judgments were recovered which, with costs, totalled $15,498.40. In addition, the company incurred legal costs in connection with the actions totalling $934.70.\nBoth Lloyds and Canadian General Insurance Company took the attitude that the Reliance company was not insured against this risk by their respective policies. Lloyds, while disputing liability, entered into the usual non-waiver agreement with the Reliance company and took part in negotiations for settlement of the claims and in the defence of the actions that were brought. Canadian General Insurance Company, however, declined to take any part in the matter, preferring to stand upon the ground that its policy did not insure risks of this nature.\nWhile the learned trial judge did not specifically so find, it is implicit in the reasons for judgment delivered by him that he considered Anstey\u2019s conduct negligent and as having at least contributed to the loss sustained. The judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Roach J.A., found in terms that Anstey had been negligent in allowing the gasoline to spill out on the surface of the area and in failing, as required by regulations made under The Gasoline Handling Act, to remain in constant, uninterrupted control of the spring faucet at the rear of the tank truck. Apart from the regulations, the learned judge said that a common law duty rested upon Anstey to use consummate care in handling the gasoline and that he had failed in that duty.\nThe policies differ in their nature and must be considered separately. The policy issued by Lloyds had originally been issued through their representative in Canada to McManus Petroleums Limited of London on October 27, 1948, and continued by renewal certificates in the name of Reliance Petroleum Limited. The last of these which continued the policy in force was dated October 27, 1950.\nThe policy as originally issued was the standard owner\u2019s form of automobile insurance approved by the Superintendent of Insurance for use in Ontario, and by the renewal certificate, all its terms, provisions and conditions were continued in force for the period of a year. Apparently no new application was taken from the Reliance company, the renewal certificates stating that the insured, by accepting the certificate, renewed and reaffirmed as of the date of the renewal the statements in the signed application in the policy that was renewed. The business of McManus Petroleums Limited was described in the application made by it as gas and oil distributors, and in answer to the question as to the purpose to which the insured automobiles would be chiefly used, the answer made was \u201cIncidental to Insured\u2019s Business\u201d. No description of the vehicles intended to be insured appears in the material filed at the trial, the application referring to a \u201cfleet schedule attached\u201d. It is, however, common ground that the insured vehicles described in the schedule included tank trucks of the nature of the one driven by Anstey and that it was one of those intended to be covered.\nThe policy, as required by s. 207 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, insured, inter alia, the owner against the liability imposed by law upon it for loss or damage arising from the ownership, use or operation of the automobile within Canada resulting from damage to property. The question is as to whether the liability of the Reliance company for Anstey\u2019s negligent act is covered by this language. Spence J. was of the view that it arose out of the use of the tank truck and so the risk was insured. Roach J.A. considered that it fell within both the words \u201cuse\u201d and \u201coperation\u201d.\nThe argument addressed to us on behalf of Lloyds, put briefly, is that the history of the Ontario legislation regarding automobile insurance since it was first referred to by that name in c. 30 of the statutes of 1914, and the changes made since that time by the introduction of the financial responsibility provisions in 1930, when the words \u201cownership, maintenance, use or operation\u201d first appeared, show that it was the intention to provide the forms of policies designed to insure against an automobile accident in the commonly conceived sense of that expression and to provide indemnity which would be available to persons injured or for damage occasioned by the operation of the automobile as a means of transport on the highways and elsewhere. This, it is contended, indicates that neither the expression \u201coperation\u201d nor \u201cuse\u201d was intended to apply to an occurrence such as this where the vehicle was stationary and the negligence was in the operation of the faucet designed to permit the discharge of gasoline from the tanks.\nThis contention has been most ably advanced by Mr. Thomson but I am unable to accept it. It is the insuring contract and not the statute that we are required to construe. The meaning of these words is not to be considered standing alone but in the context in which they are employed in the contract and effect is to be given to the intention of the parties collected from their expression of it as a whole.\nThe policy was issued in acceptance of the application and the application was, by its terms, made part of the contract of insurance. The tank trucks insured were, as stated in the application, to be used in the business of the insured, which was stated to be that of distributing oil and gas. These tank trucks were designed both as a means of transporting, inter alia, gasoline to filling stations and also discharging the material into tanks through the faucets and connecting hose. In my view, the operation of manipulating the faucets for the purpose of permitting the gasoline to flow from the tank truck to the underground tank at the filling station was a use of the truck, within the meaning of the insuring clause in the contract, equally as the transport from the premises of the insured to the filling station was within that expression.\nCanadian General Insurance Company\u2019s policy, described on its face as a \u201cGeneral Public Liability Policy\u201d, was issued to the Reliance Company on June 22, 1950. By the policy itself, as distinct from the property damage endorsement attached to it, the insurer agreed to indemnify the insured to the extent provided against damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease as set forth in the insuring agreements, subject to certain exclusions and special conditions. One of the exclusions read:\u2014\nThis Policy shall have no application with respect to and shall not extend to nor cover any claim arising or existing by reason of any of the following matters:\n* * *\n3. Any motor vehicle (including trailer or semi-trailer) that is required by law to have a license or permit, and which is off premises owned, rented or controlled by the Named Insured, or which is owned, hired or leased by the Insured, and, except with respect to operation by independent contractors, the ownership, maintenance or use, including loading or unloading, of any (a) watercraft while away from such premises or (b) aircraft.\nBy the policy, the insurer further agreed to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which it should become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death, at any time resulting therefrom caused by events occurring within the policy period and suffered or alleged to have been suffered by any person or persons, to serve the insured by the investigation of any such claims and to defend in its name on its behalf any suit claiming damages on account of such injuries. By the special conditions the insured was required to give the insurer notice of any such claim and the insurer was entitled to determine whether it should be settled or litigated. It was further provided that the insured should not voluntarily assume or acknowledge any liability or interfere in any negotiation or legal proceeding conducted by the insurer on account of any claim, nor, except at its own expense, settle any claim. Compliance with these conditions was stated to be a condition precedent to the obligation of the insurer to indemnify the insured. The property damage endorsement made \u201csubject to the Statements, Exclusions and Special Conditions of the Policy\u201d obligated the insurer to pay all sums which the insured should become obligated to pay\nby reason of the liability imposed upon the Insured by law for damages because of injury to or destruction of property caused by accident occurring within the Policy Period and while this Endorsement is in force.\nThe obligation of the insurer to serve the insured by the investigation of claims and to defend actions against the insured, as contained in the policy itself, was repeated. A further clause in the endorsement, so far as it concerns the present matter, read:\u2014\nThis Endorsement shall have no application with respect to and shall not extend to nor cover any claim for injury to or destruction of (a) property owned or occupied by or leased to the Insured.\nThe property occupied by Riddell as a service station was in November 1950, owned by John J. Gardiner and Leona Gardiner and leased by them to the Reliance company for a term of 5 years. The property, together with the buildings erected upon it and certain equipment used in the operation of the filling station, was in turn sublet by the Reliance company to Ronald E. Riddell by a lease which was in effect at the time the fire occurred.\nThe actions brought were compromised by the Reliance company, with the approval of Lloyds but without the approval of Canadian General Insurance Company, for amounts which were found by the learned trial judge to have been reasonable. In some of the cases, evidence was taken at a trial and liability found. In others, apparently liability was admitted and judgment entered for the amount agreed upon. These judgments were paid by the Reliance company before the present actions were commenced.\nIt is contended by Canadian General Insurance Company that the insured did not comply with the conditions of the policy above referred to, requiring it to refrain from acknowledging any liability or interfering in any negotiations for settlement of claims and from paying claims the extent of which had not been finally determined by judgment after an actual trial of the issue of negligence. The learned trial judge considered that this defence was not open to the insurance company, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. While Canadian General Insurance Company did not repudiate the policy by contending that the risk had never attached, it took the attitude that the damages caused or contributed to by Anstey\u2019s negligence did not fall within the terms of the contract. In my opinion, this position is untenable. If, as I think to be the case, the risk was insured, the insuring company committed a breach of its contract in declining to investigate the claims, to conduct the defence of the litigation and to pay the judgments to the extent the policy provided. The action is one for damages for breach of the contract and, in my opinion, the conduct of the insuring company amounted in law to a waiver of its right to insist upon compliance by the insured in these respects with the terms of the contract, as was found in similar circumstances by the Supreme Court of the United States in St. Louis Dressed Beef and Provision Company v. Maryland Casualty Company[7]. The legal consequences of the action of the insuring company in this matter do not differ in this respect, in my opinion, from that resulting from the repudiation of liability based upon charges of fraud and arson considered in Jureidini v. National British and Irish Millers Insurance Company, Limited[8]. I refer to the judgments of Viscount Haldane L.C. at p. 505 and of Lord Dunedin at p. 507.\nThe language of exclusion 3 has quite understandably given rise to a difference of opinion. Spence J. considered that the purpose of the policy was to insure losses due to accidents in the general conduct of the business of the insured and that a loss due to the exploding or igniting of petroleum products was a loss within the contemplation of both parties. Roach J.A., saying that there could never be an accident \u201ccaused by\u201d the mere existence of a motor vehicle, considered that what was intended to be excluded was an accident caused by the negligent use or operation of a motor vehicle and that this was such an accident.\nIt is to be remembered that, unlike the form of policy issued by Lloyds, the risk to be insured by this policy was not defined by statute. The wording of the policy is that of the insurance company and it is to be construed, in my opinion, contra proferentem: Anderson v. Fitzgerald[9]. The language of the property damage endorsement forming part, according to the company\u2019s own designation, of a general public liability policy whereby it agreed to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the latter should become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed by law because of injury to or destruction of property caused by accident, is clear. The exclusion is expressed in a most unfortunate manner. It refers to a claim arising \u201cby reason of any motor vehicle, required by law to have a license, which is owned by the Insured\u201d. Here, as found by the Court of Appeal, Anstey was negligent in allowing the gasoline to spill out on the surface of the area, in failing to remain in control of the spring faucet and in failing to use consummate care in handling the gasoline. It was shown by the evidence that before opening the faucet he failed to ascertain by the use of a dip-stick the quantity of gasoline already in the tank, and it was his failure to do this which apparently led him to think that he could leave the spring faucet held open by a piece of wood and go into the service station to discuss business with Riddell. This act of negligence was one of the causes of the accident: the breach of The Gasoline Handling Act was another.\nThe liability for this negligent act appears to me to fall squarely within the insuring clause in the endorsement and not to be excluded by exclusion 3, which is an exception from liability and is to be construed in the sense in which the insured person might reasonably understand it: Life Association of Scotland v. Foster et al.[10] In Provincial Insurance Company, Limited v. Morgan et al.[11], Lord Russell of Killowen said that the printed forms which insurance companies offer for acceptance to the insuring public should state in clear and unambiguous terms the events upon which the insuring company will escape liability under the policy, and that these exceptions should be expressed in words which do not admit of doubt. It would, in my opinion, be giving a strained and quite unwarranted construction to the words \u201cany claim arising by reason of any motor vehicle\u201d as including negligent acts such as failing to ascertain the amount of gasoline in the tank in advance of opening the faucet and in failing otherwise to exercise the requisite degree of care, as found by Roach J.A.\nIn view of the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the risk was not insured by reason of exclusion 3, the question as to whether any of the claims were affected by the provision of the endorsement excluding claims for destruction of property leased to the insured was not considered. The learned trial judge was of the view that this should be construed as referring only to property occupied by or under the control of the insured and that, as the service station had been sublet to Riddell, this did not apply. I am unable, with great respect, to agree with this. The claim of Gardiner which was compromised for a total payment of $7,112.50 was for the damage caused to the property leased to the Reliance company for a term of 5 years from November 1, 1950, and the fact that it was thereafter sublet to Riddell does not, in my opinion, affect the matter. The language of the endorsement appears to me to be clear and unambiguous.\nI would allow the appeal of the Reliance company as against Canadian General Insurance Company and direct that judgment be entered for the amounts found payable at the trial in respect of the claims other than that of Gardiner, with costs throughout against that company. I would dismiss the appeal of Lloyds with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The nature of these appeals and the facts relevant to their determination are set out in the reasons of my brother Locke. I agree with the conclusion, which has been reached in the first appeal by my brother Locke, the Court of Appeal and the learned trial judge, that the liability imposed by law upon Reliance Petroleum Limited for the losses sustained by the seven persons set out in para. 5 of the statement of claim arose from the use of the insured tank truck, and I do not find it necessary to decide whether it arose also from its operation. I agree that the appeal must be dismissed with costs. In the appeal of Reliance Petroleum Limited against Canadian General Insurance Company I find it necessary to consider only one of the defences raised, i.e.,that the appellant\u2019s claim is excluded by the terms of exclusion 3 contained in the policy.\nThe relevant words of the policy setting out the respondent\u2019s agreement to pay are as follows:\u2014\n...the Insurer...subject to the Statements, Exclusions and Special Conditions of the policy...agrees with the Insured\u2026\nTo PAY on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the Insured by law...for damages because of injury to or destruction of property caused by accident occurring within the Policy Period and while this Endorsement is in force.\nThe words relied upon as excluding the appellant\u2019s claim are as follows:\u2014\nThis Policy shall have no application with respect to and shall not extend to nor cover any claim arising or existing by reason of any...motor vehicle...owned...by the Insured.\nI have already indicated my agreement with the unanimous opinion in the Courts below that the liability of the appellant for which it claims indemnity under the policy arose from the use of the tank truck owned by it. The tank truck is a motor vehicle. But for the fact that contrary opinions have been expressed in this case I would have thought it clear that the words \u201cany claim arising or existing by reason of any motor vehicle\u201d in their ordinary sense include a claim arising from the negligent use of a motor vehicle. Indeed the words quoted seem to me to be at least as comprehensive as those of the insuring agreement in the standard form of owner\u2019s policy, \u201carising from the ownership, use or operation of the automobile.\u201d I do not think that in ordinary speech it would be said that a claim arising from the ownership or from the use or from the operation of a motor vehicle did not arise or exist by reason of a motor vehicle. So to hold would, I think, render the clause meaningless, and it is a fundamental rule that in construing an instrument effect must as far as possible be given to every clause. The rule expressed in the maxim, verba fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem, was pressed upon us in argument, but resort is to be had to this rule only when all other rules of construction fail to enable the Court of construction to ascertain the meaning of a document.\nIt was suggested that one of the grounds on which Reliance Petroleum Limited was found liable for the damages caused was the negligent failure of its employee to measure the depth of gasoline in the tank before commencing delivery and that a claim resulting from such negligence does not fall within the words of exclusion quoted above. As to this I agree with the view expressed by my brother Rand that this omission and the omission to remain at the truck during the discharge of gasoline were merely circumstances annexed to the delivery. They were the circumstances which rendered the use made of the tank truck a negligent one.\nA motor vehicle was the instrument by the negligent use of which the damages were inflicted and in my opinion the claims for those damages arose by reason of the motor vehicle.\nAs already mentioned, the conclusion at which I have arrived as to the construction of the exclusion makes it unnecessary for me to consider the other grounds submitted by Mr. Wilson in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs, LOCKE J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent and appellant: Ivey, Livermore & Dowler, London.\nSolicitors for the defendant Stevenson, appellant: Haines, Thomson, Rogers, Benson, Howie & Freeman, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant Canadian General Insurance Company, respondents: Day, Wilson, Kelly, Martin & Morden, Toronto.\n[1] [1954] O.R. 846, [1954] 4 D.L.R. 730.\n[2] [1953] O.R. 807, [1953] 4 D.L.R. 755.\n[3] [1954] O.R. 846, [1954] 4 D.L.R. 730.\n[4] [1954] O.R. 846, [1954] 4 D.L.R. 730.\n[5] [1954] O.R. 846, [1954] 4 D.L.R. 730.\n[6] [1953] O.R. 807, [1953] 4 D.L.R. 755.\n[7] (1906), 201 U.S. 173.\n[8] [1915] A.C. 499.\n[9] (1853), 4 H.L.

VI, c. 40, ss. 8, 9, 10, 15.\nIf judgment is given in a provincial Court against Canadian Commercial Corporation for damages for breach of contract, interest on the damages can be allowed against the corporation pursuant to the general law of the province. By virtue of s. 10 of the Canadian Commercial Corporation Act, the obligation incurred by the corporation on behalf of the Crown is to be considered as having been incurred by the corporation itself. It is therefore in the same position as any other private Corporation.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, affirming, Barclay and McDougall JJ. dissenting, the judgment at trial.\nThe appeal was argued on March 20 and 21, 1956, and judgment 2 was delivered on April 24, 1956, reversing the judgment appealed from and holding the defendant liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for $20,000, with costs and with interest from the date the defendant was put en demeure by the service of process, on the authority of Montreal Gas Company v. Vasey 3. Leave was obtained by the defendant to argue the question of the liability for interest, which had not been raised at the hearing of the main appeal. The defendant accordingly moved to vary the judgment in respect of interest, and the reasons for judgment now reported are those delivered, following that reargument, on the motion to vary.\nG. Favreau, Q.C., and P. Ollivier, for the defendant, respondent, applicant on the motion to vary. V. Pager, Q.C., and F. Auclair, for the plaintiff, appellant, contra.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Fauteux and Abbott c JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014By leave of the Court we heard argument upon a point not previously raised. It is now contended that the respondent is an agent of the Crown and that its predecessor, Canadian Export Board, acted as such in the negotiations which, as we have held, resulted in a contract between the latter and the appellant; that the Crown may not be charged with interest on any principal sum, except by virtue of a special statutory provision, or of its own consent; that the respondent is in the same position as the Crown and, therefore, interest should not be allowed.\nThe respondent is the successor of the Canadian Export Board, whose rights and obligations under the contract it inherited, and was established by a Statute of Canada of 1946, 10 Geo. VI, c. 40, ss. 3(5), 9, 10 and 15(2) of which are as follows:\u2014\n3. (5) The Corporation is for all its purposes an agent of His Majesty and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of His Majesty.\n9. The Corporation may, on behalf of His Majesty, contract in its corporate name without specific reference to His Majesty.\n10. The Corporation may sue and be sued in respect of any right or obligation acquired or incurred by it on behalf of His Majesty as if the right or obligation had been acquired or incurred on its own behalf.\n15. (2) From the day this Act comes into force, all rights and obligations acquired or incurred by the Canadian Export Board shall, for the purposes of legal proceedings, be deemed to have been acquired or incurred by the Corporation on behalf of His Majesty.\nReading these together, it seems clear that, while the respondent may only exercise its powers as agent of the Crown, that is because it is not in the general business of buying and selling goods and merchandise, but only for the limited purposes as set forth in the other provisions of the Act. As long as it keeps within the powers thus conferred, it may, by s. 9, contract in its corporate name without specific reference to His Majesty, and by s. 10, which is the important provision, not only may it sue and be sued in respect of any right or obligation acquired or incurred by it on behalf of His Majesty (which includes the contract in question made with Canadian Export Board), but some meaning must be attached to the latter part of the section \"as if the right or obligation had been acquired or incurred on its own behalf\". If the obligation in this case had Keen incurred on its own behalf, the decision of the Judicial Committee in International Railway Company v. Niagara Parks Commission 4 would apply. It was there held that there was nothing to prevent an agent from entering into a contract on the basis that he is himself to be liable to perform it as well as his principal and that the Commissioners, having entered into a certain agreement \"on their own behalf\", as well as on behalf of the Crown, had done so on the express terms that they were to be liable for its fulfilment. By the latter part of s. 10 of the respondent's Act, the obligation here in question is to be taken to have been incurred on its own behalf. It is, therefore, in the same position as if it were not an agent for the Crown and it is subject to the general law of the province of Quebec, as the case was fought on the basis that it was the law of that province that was applicable.\nThe point now taken by the respondent is without foundation and it must pay the costs of the motion asking for leave to raise it and of the new argument.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014The respondent contends that interest ought not to have been included in the amount for which judgment was directed to be entered and moves to vary accordingly.\nBy s. 3(5) of the Canadian Commercial Corporation Act, 1946 (Can.), 10 Geo. VI, c. 40, it is provided that:\u2014\n(5) The Corporation is for all its purposes an agent of His Majesty and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of His Majesty.\nIt is contended, in view of this provision, that the Corporation cannot be subjected to any greater liability than the Crown itself and that had the Crown been sued in the Exchequer Court, as it might have been, s. 47(6) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, would have been a bar to the recovery of interest. It may be noted that the contract here in question is in writing.\nAssuming this contention to be otherwise sound, s. 10 of 10 Geo. VI must be considered. That section reads as follows :\u2014\n10. The Corporation may \u2026 be sued in respect of any \u2026 obligation \u2026 incurred by it on behalf of His Majesty as if the \u2026 obligation had been \u2026 incurred on its own behalf.\nIn my opinion, the proper interpretation of this provision is that, once it is determined in any case that the contract sued on falls within the ambit of the statute, the case against the corporation thereafter proceeds in the provincial Court as though the \"obligation\" of the corporation sought to be enforced \"had been incurred on its own behalf\", that is, had been incurred by the corporation itself. Had such been the case then unquestionably arts. 1067 and 1077 of the Civil Code would apply and the corporation would be liable for interest. The contention that the section merely permits the corporation to be sued instead of the Crown renders, in my opinion, the words \"as if the obligation had been incurred on its own behalf\" mere surplusage. To give any meaning to these words, I think they must be construed as indicated above, namely, that it is the express intention of the statute that the corporation shall stand in the same position before the Court as any private corporation.\nAccordingly, the motion must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs; motion to vary dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Deslauriers, Tr\u00e9panier & Auclair, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: A.

(dissenting) were of opinion that there was no dissent in the Court of Appeal on any question of law.\nEvidence\u2014Confessions\u2014Admissibility\u2014Test of voluntary nature of statement\u2014Effect of decisions\u2014Questioning by police officers\u2014Suggested \u201ccross-examination\u201d\u2014Intimation that previous statement not believed.\nThe decision in Boudreau v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 262, did not extend in any way the rule laid down in Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 at 609, as to the admissibility of confessions in evidence at the trial. It is still the law that a statement is admissible in evidence if it is shown to have been voluntary \u201cin the sense that it has not been obtained\u2026either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority\u201d, and the Crown need go no further than this, even in a case where questions have been asked by the police of a person in custody. In particular, the Crown is not required to show that the statement was not otherwise influenced by the course of conduct adopted by the police, or that it was \u201cself-impelled\u201d in any sense other than that it was not induced by fear or hope.\nThe accused, having been taken to the police station early in the morning, and there given an account of his movements on the previous evening, was left there all day, not formally under arrest. About 5 p.m. the police officers returned and told the accused that they had been working all day on the case (one of murder) and that they had discovered further facts indicating that what he had told them in the morning was untrue. The accused thereupon \u201cblurted out\u201d a damaging statement, whereupon he was stopped and given a formal warning in respect of a charge of murder, after which he made a statement, obtained in the form of question and answer, that was reduced to writing and signed by him. Held: There was nothing in the circumstances to make either the oral statement or the written one that followed it inadmissible in evidence, and the trial judge had rightly admitted them both.\nCriminal law\u2014Trial judge\u2019s charge to jury\u2014Whether defence adequately put to jury\u2014Murder.\nThe accused was charged with the murder of a young girl by choking her, the theory of the Crown being that the killing took place during the commission of a rape. The principal ground of defence, based on a statement made by the accused to the police, was that sexual intercourse had taken place with the full consent of the girl, and that the act that resulted in her death had taken place some time later, and was in no way connected with the act of intercourse.\nHeld: This defence had been adequately put to the jury by the trial judge, and there was no ground for interfering with the conviction.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney-General for Ontario from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] ordering a new trial on an indictment for murder. Appeal allowed and conviction restored.\nW.B. Common, Q.C., and W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the appellant.\nD.G. Humphrey, and J.G.J. O\u2019Driscoll, for the accused, respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The respondent\u2019s conviction of murder was set aside by the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 and the Attorney-General for that Province now appeals based on the dissent of Roach J.A. on two points, as to one of which Aylesworth J.A. agreed with him. The majority ordered a new trial on both grounds. As to the question of the admissibility of the oral and written statements of the accused, my view is that the dissent was on a question of fact and therefore we are without jurisdiction. According to my interpretation of the reasons in the Court of Appeal there is no difference as to the law, but merely as to its application to the circumstances. The evidence on the voir dire was uncontradicted and, in my opinion, the reasons of the majority and minority in the Court of Appeal are based on conflicting views as to the proper inferences to be drawn from that evidence. Such inferences are questions of fact.\nHowever, the majority of the members of this Court read the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal differently and are of opinion that this Court has jurisdiction. Since that is to be the judgment of the Court, I conceive that I should do what I would not otherwise do\u2014express my opinion upon both points. I am unable to discern any error in the trial judge\u2019s charge and particularly that he had not presented all aspects of the accused\u2019s defence to the jury. As to the other point, in view of the decision of this Court in Boudreau v. The King[2] I deem it unnecessary to restate the law as there enunciated, and applying that rule I agree with Roach J.A. that the trial judge correctly interpreted and applied it.\nAs the majority of the Court are of opinion that there is jurisdiction, the appeal is accordingly allowed and the conviction restored.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The respondent was convicted by the Honourable Mr. Justice Treleaven and a jury at the Toronto assizes on April 27, 1956, on the following indictment:\u2014\nThe jurors for our Lady the Queen present that Robert George Fitton on or about the 18th day of January in the year 1956, at the city of Toronto in the county of York, murdered one Linda Lampkin, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nThe respondent was found guilty and sentenced to be executed, but the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Roach dissenting, allowed the appeal and directed a new trial[3]. The majority of the Court reached the conclusion that there had been misdirection of the jury by the learned trial judge in matters of law under ss. 201 and 202 of the Criminal Code, and that the theory of the defence was not adequately explained to the jury.\nThe Chief Justice of Ontario, Laidlaw J.A. and Schroeder J.A. held that the oral admission and the signed statement of the respondent were improperly admitted at the trial, and allowed the appeal and also directed a new trial on this ground. Mr. Justice Aylesworth (dissenting on this ground) as well as Mr. Justice Roach, held that the learned trial judge did not err in law in holding that the oral admission and the signed statement of the accused were admissible in evidence at the trial, and would have dismissed the appeal on this point. Her Majesty the Queen now appeals to this Court pursuant to the provisions of s. 598 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:\u2014\n598. (1) Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction, pursuant to an appeal taken under paragraph (a) of section 583 or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 584, the Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\n(a) on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents.\nThe evidence might be summarized as follows:\u2014\nAt approximately 9 p.m. on January 18, 1956, the respondent, who is an employee of a cartage agency under contract with the Post Office Department, took the deceased Linda Lampkin for a ride in his mail truck, and two hours later left her dead body on Commissioners Street in south central Toronto. When the body was discovered, the underclothing was ripped and torn, and it is in evidence that this young girl of 13 years old, had been the subject of sexual intercourse. Around her neck was a deep groove in the flesh tissue, which corresponded in size to the width of a scarf which she was wearing. The evidence reveals that she died of asphyxia due to strangulation.\nAfter having discovered the body, the Toronto police force, as a result of their investigation, took the respondent Fitton into custody the next morning. During the day, Fitton made oral admissions and signed a statement, and it is the admission of this statement, which has been allowed by the trial judge, which is the first point in issue in the present appeal.\nI must admit that I am at a loss to understand the contradictory position taken by the respondent on this matter. This written statement was admitted without objection, and constitutes the only defence raised by the respondent. It is now said that it has been illegally admitted as not having been made freely and voluntarily. With this last contention I cannot agree, and I fully share the views of my brother Fauteux who holds that it was admissible and that this case must be governed by the rules laid down by this Court in Boudreau v. The King[4]. I am also of the opinion, for the reasons given by my brother Fauteux, that the rejection or admissibility of this statement is not merely a question of fact, but raises a question of law, conferring jurisdiction on this Court, in view of the dissenting opinions in the Court below.\nI further endorse what has been said by Mr. Justice Roach in his dissenting judgment as to the exposition of the theory of the defence by the trial judge, and as to the use that could be made of the expert evidence of Dr. McLean and as to the obligation of the jury to reject any of his opinions which he was not qualified as an expert to give.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The rule on the admission of confessions, which, following the English authorities, was restated in Boudreau v. The King[5], at times presents difficulty of application because its terms tend to conceal underlying considerations material to a determination. The cases of torture, actual or threatened, or of unabashed promises are clear; perplexity arises when much more subtle elements must be evaluated. The strength of mind and will of the accused, the influence of custody or its surroundings, the effect of questions or of conversation, all call for delicacy in appreciation of the part they have played behind the admission, and to enable a Court to decide whether what was said was freely and voluntarily said, that is, was free from the influence of hope or fear aroused by them.\nThe inference one way or the other, taking all the circumstances into account, is one for drawing which the trial judge is in a position of special advantage; and unless it is made evident or probable that he has not weighed the circumstances in the light of the rule or has misconceived them or the rule, his conclusion should not be disturbed.\nThe Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal, has treated the expression \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d, used in Boudreau v. The King, as if it connoted only a spontaneous statement, one unrelated to anything as cause or occasion in the conduct of the police officers; but with the greatest respect that is an erroneous interpretation of what was there said. The language quoted must be read primarily in the light of the matters that were being considered. As the opening words show, there was no intention of departing from the rule as laid down in the authorities mentioned; the phrase \u201cfree in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority\u201d[6] means free from the compulsion of apprehension of prejudice and the inducement of hope for advantage, if an admission is or is not made. That fear or hope could be instigated, induced or coerced, all these terms referring to the element in the mind of the confesser which actuated or drew out the admission. It might be called the induced motive of the statement, i.e., to avoid prejudice or reap benefit. As Professor Wigmore intimates, the terms promise or threat may be reduced to the word \u201cinducement\u201d, but that again may raise a question of meaning; and the justification of the illustrative use of other words is that together they indicate the general conception of influence of a certain kind producing the admission. Even the word \u201cvoluntary\u201d is open to question; in what case can it be said that the statement is not voluntary in the sense that it is the expression of a choice, that it is willed to be made? But it is the character of the influence of idea or feeling behind that act of willing and its source which the rule seizes upon. Nothing said in Boudreau v. The King was intended to introduce a new quality of that influence.\nBut it was with an enlarged view of what that case decided that the Chief Justice held the questions, express or implied, of the police officers, taken to be of the nature of cross\u2011examination, that is, as I understand it, that they suggested several items of his earlier statement to be false, and put without a warning, ipso facto, as having \u201cinstigated\u201d it, ruled out the statement. In this I think he has, and in a matter of law, erred. The accused was not at the time under formal arrest although he had been requested to stay in the police station and, for the greater part of the time, remained in the general office, and the earlier questions were such as the police might have addressed to any person in the remotest way drawn into the enquiry. Ques- tions without intimidating or suggestive overtones are inescapable from police enquiry; and put as they were here, they cannot by themselves be taken to invalidate the response given. The question still remains: was the statement made through fear or hope induced by authority?\nThe rules adopted in England relating to this matter express, no doubt, the wisdom of long experience; but they in fact contemplate questioning after the arrest has been decided on and a warning given; and there is discretion in the trial judge to admit a statement notwithstanding their non-observance. In this country they have no other force than what their innate good sense may suggest in individual determinations, as considerations to be kept in mind in weighing the total circumstances.\nOn the voir dire no attempt was made by counsel to show by cross-examination either coercion or inducement, and it was frankly conceded that the admission of the evidence, if not facilitated, was not seriously challenged for the reason that the statement contained the only evidence upon which the defence intended to rely. Not only, then, was the testimony of the officers accepted by the trial judge and unopposed on behalf of the accused, but its admission was looked on as for the benefit of the defence. In that situation I should say that there is nothing to warrant a finding that the statement was not shown to have been voluntary; and the ruling in appeal, on this view, also, is on a question of law.\nI am, therefore, in agreement with Roach J.A. and Aylesworth J.A. that the admission of the statement by the trial judge should not have been disturbed.\nThe second ground of dissent was from the holding of the Court that the charge was inadequate in presenting the case for the defence. That defence was extremely simple and it was contained in two or three sentences of the statement. It was to the effect that after the sexual intercourse had taken place and after the accused had proceeded on his route to another mail-box,\nshe started kibitzing around again and I just went out of my head. I grabbed her by the scarf and she just went limp. She didn\u2019t breathe no more, then I continued with the rest of my mail run. The act causing death was thus represented to have been completely divorced from the sexual act. The trial judge, after making it clear that the jury could believe any part of the evidence and disbelieve any other part, applied this rule to the statement. He contrasted this direct evidence with the circumstantial facts which could be held to show that death from strangulation had been immediately connected with the act of intercourse; and his final reference to the statement was in these words:\nNow gentlemen, as I see it, if I may put this very briefly to you, I would think that you would take that statement of the accused, consider it very carefully, and if you conclude that it is the truth or if you really have an honest doubt as to whether it is the truth or not, he is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and you would not find him guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.\nCounsel urged before us that this paragraph in some way deals with strangulation accompanying ravishment but I cannot so construe it. It is, strictly, more favourable to the accused than was justified: in effect it says, if you think the circumstances of tightening the scarf were as he puts them, you are to find manslaughter. This rules out intent in the act within s. 201(a) (ii) or (c) of the Criminal Code.\nI think we must credit the jury with ordinary intelligence. The defence had been elaborated to them by counsel, it was set forth on the statement which they had in the jury-room and they were told how to deal with it. There was no complication in the facts or their interpretation or in the distinction between the two views of the facts put to them, and I have not the slightest doubt that they came to their verdict with an intelligent appreciation of both.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nThe judgment of Locke and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nNOLAN J.:\u2014The respondent was convicted of murder at a trial before a judge sitting with a jury. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the appeal, by a majority judgment, was allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered[7]. This is an appeal by the Attorney\u2011General for Ontario pursuant to the provisions of s. 598 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code. At about 7.45 p.m. on January 18, 1956, the deceased, Linda Lampkin, left a dancing-school at 40 Wellesley Street East in the city of Toronto and at approximately 8.30 p.m. she boarded a Jane Street bus at Jane and Bloor Streets and shortly afterwards left it at Jane and Annette Streets. At approximately 8.45 p.m. a young girl was seen talking to the driver of a Royal Mail truck at Jane Street and St. John\u2019s Road.\nThe respondent was employed by the Bacon Cartage Company Limited as a Royal Mail truck-driver and his route on the day in question covered the area in which the deceased was last seen alive. The respondent turned in his truck at the Bacon Cartage garage at 104 Berkeley Street at 10.57 p.m., although his usual time was between 9.30 and 10 p.m.\nAt approximately 11.05 p.m. on January 18, 1956, the body of the deceased was found on Commissioners Street in the city of Toronto. Her wool skirt and underslip were pulled up around her waist. The three pairs of underpants she was wearing were torn, exposing her thighs and genitalia, and her brassiere was torn, exposing her breasts. One shoe was missing. A red truck, similar to the one driven by the respondent, was seen, during the evening of January 18, parked on Commissioners Street in the vicinity of the place where the body was found.\nA post-mortem examination disclosed that the deceased had been a virgin and that death had been caused by asphyxia due to strangulation resulting from the application of extreme force to a silk scarf which was knotted around her neck. There was a mark almost encircling the neck which showed a complete ring of bruising, with the exception of a gap under the right ear where the bruising was reduced. It was the opinion of the pathologist that such force would have to be applied for several minutes to cause death. The deceased had been the subject of a completed act of sexual intercourse. There was a tear in her hymen and in her vagina which, in the opinion of the pathologist, would have caused great pain. Her face was dark with acute congestion of blood and there were tiny haemorrhages in the skin of the face, the forehead, the ears and the mucous membrane of the eyes. Bloodstained froth had issued from the nose and mouth.\nOn the morning of January 19, 1956, two officers of the Toronto police force went to the Globe and Mail garage, at which time the respondent was putting mail-bags into a truck. The truck was searched and a paper bag containing two apples, a bobby pin and a tube of lipstick were found inside. This lipstick was, in evidence, identified and admitted by counsel for the respondent to have been the property of the deceased. The respondent was observed to be collapsing or fainting.\nThe respondent was taken by Detective Sergeant O\u2019Driscoll and Detective Coghill to police headquarters, where he was interrogated by Detective-Sergeant O\u2019Driscoll, and a T-shirt, a pair of trousers and a windbreaker were taken from the person of the respondent. An examination of the clothing disclosed that there was human blood on the trousers and the leather jacket. The detective\u2011sergeant told the respondent that he was \u201cinvestigating the rape and murder of a girl by the name of Linda Lampkin\u201d and that she lived on Brookside Avenue. This was the first time her name had been mentioned. The respondent said that he knew the deceased and that the last time he saw her was about 5.15 in the afternoon of January 17. He denied that he had seen her on January 18. He gave an account of his movements on January 18 until he stopped work at night. The discussion, which contained no reference to Linda Lampkin, lasted until approximately 9 a.m. and no caution was given. The discussion was not taken down in writing. O\u2019Driscoll and Coghill left to be present in court at 10 a.m. and the respondent was left in the custody of Detective Smith, who told the respondent that he wanted to get on paper a record of his movements on January 18. Detective Smith had typed about one paragraph when he was relieved by Detective Sergeant Simmonds, who typed the statement as it was related to him by the respondent. When it was finished the respondent read it, made certain changes and signed it. No objection as to its admissibility was made at trial and it was admitted in evidence. In his statement the respondent said that about the end of June he had met the deceased when he was collecting mail on his route and about a week later had taken her, at her request, for a drive around part of his route; that he had seen her three times since then, but only to say \u201chello\u201d. The statement relates his movements during January 18 and concludes by stating that he did not know anything about a lipstick or how it got in the truck.\nDetective Sergeant Simmonds then asked the respondent for a list of the box clearances on his route, which was given and typed on a sheet of paper, which was admitted at trial. He had a sandwich and milk brought in for the respondent for lunch.\nAt approximately 5 p.m. Detective Sergeant Simmonds and Detective McNeely again interviewed the respondent, who had been kept in the main detective office since the morning interview. What took place at this afternoon interview is described in the evidence of Detective Sergeant Simmonds:\u2014\nWe took our coats and hats off and hung them up and Detective McNeely and I went up to the accused and I told him, I said, \u201cI want to have another word with you. Would you come over to the office with us?\u201d He stood up and followed us out. We went over to the small room off the main detective office and into the office there.\nI told the accused to sit down and he sat down at a desk, at a chair opposite a desk, and I said to him, I said, \u201cYou know who I am. I was talking to you this morning\u201d or words to that effect. I said, \u201cThis is Detective McNeely, my partner.\u201d I then sat down at the desk opposite him and Detective McNeely sat to my right.\nI said to the accused man, \u201cBob, you have been sitting in the office here this afternoon and I haven\u2019t seen you since I left you around noon when you told me where you were last night and your movements last night.\u201d I said, \u201cYou have had all afternoon to think over where you were last night.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cWhat I told you this morning was true.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, it no doubt was true as far as your work with the post office was concerned but,\u201d I said, \u201cwe have been out going over the area in the west end of the city where you worked and we have been working pretty hard this afternoon,\u201d and I said, \u201cI have received information to the effect that you were seen last night with Linda Lampkin at St. John\u2019s Road and Jane about 8.45 p.m.\u201d\nHe was sitting in the chair, which has arms on it, and he had his elbows on the arms and his hands crossed in front of him and he was looking at me and at this moment he looked down to the floor, he put his head down. I was just about to say something else to him when McNeely spoke up, and McNeely said to him, \u201cYes, Bob, we have been working since 5 o\u2019clock this morning. It may be necessary for us to take you out with us in the police car and have you show us just how you do your work in the west end in the area that you work in. There may be other witnesses out there\u2014we don\u2019t know\u2014who may have seen things. We don\u2019t know. But the lipstick that was found in your truck this morning has been identified.\u201d He then said, \u201cAnd along with this information that we obtained this afternoon, it indicates that you may have been seen with Linda Lampkin last night. We don\u2019t believe what you have been telling us.\u201d\nAt this point the accused who was still looking at the floor paused and\u2014or he just seemed to just sit there, he didn\u2019t say anything, and at this point he said, \u201cI was just thinking of my wife and my kids. I didn\u2019t mean to do it. She started kibitzing around and I grabbed her by the scarf and she didn\u2019t breathe no more.\u201d\nAt this moment I said, \u201cJust a minute, Bob,\u201d and I pulled the drawer open in the desk and there was a pad of what we call caution sheets in the drawer and I put them on the table. I wrote some detail on the top of this caution sheet which has a printed form at the top, including the fact that I was at headquarters and the date and my name, the name of the accused and his age, and the charge. And I read from the sheet to the accused man.\nThe learned trial judge ruled that the inculpatory oral statement made in the course of this interview,\nI was just thinking of my wife and kids. I didn\u2019t mean to do it. She started kibitzing around and I grabbed her by the scarf and she didn\u2019t breathe no more.\nwas voluntary and admissible in evidence.\nAs soon as the respondent had made this statement he was immediately stopped, charged with the murder of the deceased and cautioned.\nThe written statement was obtained by question and answer and was written down in longhand by Simmonds. When it was completed the respondent was asked to read it aloud, including the caution, which he did, and then he signed it.\nIn the written statement the respondent said that he had seen the deceased on the evening of January 18; that she had come over to his truck and asked if she could go for a ride, he had said she could and she had gotten into the truck.\nThe statement further says:\nI parked up on Gooch Ave. to empty my small mail bag and tie up my big one and she started necking and then I had intercourse with her and then I went on a ways and did my other box and she started kibitzing around again and I just went out of my head, I grabbed her by the scarf and she just went limp. She didn\u2019t breathe no more, then I continued with the rest of my mail run and dropped my mail off and drove down to Cherry St. and took in my CODs I had left. She still wasn\u2019t breathing so the best thing I thought was to get rid of her. I drove to Commissioner St., I don\u2019t know Commissioner St. very well, I took her out of the truck and put her on the ground there. Then I took the truck back to Berkeley St. and went home.\nAt about 8.10 p.m. Detectives Simmonds, McNeely and Sellar drove the respondent out to the west end of the city to try to find the missing shoe. It was found underneath a truck on a vacant lot in the downtown area on Berkeley Street. A broken compact was found in the shoe. The girl\u2019s wallet was found by the police stuck in a sewer-grating on a street in the vicinity of a garage where the mail trucks were stored.\nThe learned trial judge held that the last-mentioned written statement was voluntary and it was admitted in evidence.\nThe majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A.), reversing the learned trial judge, held that[8]:\n\u2026the Crown has failed to show that the oral statement made by the appellant, or the written statement made by him immediately afterwards, was free and voluntary. Therefore the learned judge, in my opinion, should not have admitted either of those statements in evidence. The erroneous admission in evidence of these incriminating statements is in itself sufficient to warrant this Court directing a new trial.\nIt is contended by counsel for the respondent that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal on the question of the admissibility of the second statement, as it is not a strict question of law, but rather a question of fact, or at least a question of mixed law and fact. Section 598 (1) of the Criminal Code, under which the appeal on this ground is taken, reads as follows:\n598. (1) Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under paragraph (a) of section 583 or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 584, the Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\n(a) on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or\n(b) on any question of law, if leave to appeal is granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as the judge may, for special reasons, allow. If the decision as to the admissibility of the oral and second written statements turned upon the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, it would seem clear, from the decisions of this Court, that that was not a question of law alone and consequently this Court would be without jurisdiction.\nIn a case in which a statement is received in evidence over the objection of counsel for the accused and the point is raised that the statement is not free and voluntary, having been obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage held out by a person in authority, the Court must weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of the witnesses. The correctness of such a decision could not, I think, be raised before this Court on an appeal on a question of law alone.\nIn the present case entirely different considerations arise. The statements were admitted in evidence without objection. Indeed, it may be said that the second statement contained the defence of the respondent to the charge. No conflict arose as to the manner in which the statements were obtained, no suggestion was made that they had been improperly instigated or induced, and that they were free and voluntary appears to have been unchallenged.\nIn other words, the voluntary nature of the statements was not in dispute at trial. There was no evidence of any previous threat or promise and nothing in law to warrant their exclusion. To hold them to be inadmissible would, in my view, be contrary to established legal principles and would raise a question of law alone.\nAssuming that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal as to the admissibility of the oral and second written statements of the accused, it remains to be determined, as a question of law alone on which there has been dissent, whether they were properly admissible in evidence.\nIt was contended by the respondent in this Court that the statements obtained by the police officers were not freely and voluntarily made, but were obtained as a result of cross\u2011examination calculated to induce admissions.\nOn the other hand the Crown contended that, even though there was cross-examination (which was not conceded), failure to give a warning, or other violation of the usual rules relating to the proper securing of statements, such violation or failure does not, of itself, necessarily render such statements inadmissible.\nIn Regina v. Gavin et al.[9], it was held (per Smith J.) that when a prisoner is in custody the police have no right to ask him questions. This decision was overruled by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Best[10], which was a case in which, while the prisoner was in custody and had been cautioned, he was searched and a sum of money was found in his possession. The constable thereupon asked the prisoner where the money came from. Lord Alverstone C.J. at p. 693 said:\nThere is no ground for interfering in this case. It is quite impossible to say that the fact that a question of this kind has been asked invalidates the trial. There are many cases in which the prisoner is entitled to give an explanation as to anything found on him, and the question might give him an opportunity of saying and shewing that the thing found was his own property. In our opinion Reg. v. Gavin is not a good decision, and it is commented on in a note printed at the end of the report. The decision has certainly not been followed to its full extent. As set out in the report the statement of the law is too wide and requires qualification.\nIn Rex v. Voisin[11], the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the effect of the decision in Rex v. Best, supra, and at p. 539 A.T. Lawrence J. said:\u2014\nWe read that case as deciding that the mere fact that a statement is made in answer to a question put by a police constable is not in itself sufficient to make the statement inadmissible in law. It may be, and often is, a ground for the judge in his discretion excluding the evidence; but he should do so only if he thinks that the statement was not a voluntary one in the sense above mentioned, or was an unguarded answer made in circumstances that rendered it unreliable, or unfair for some reason to be allowed in evidence against the prisoner.\nIn the present case there was no evidence of inducement or coercion, no evidence of threat or promise of reward.\nIn my view it would be quite impossible to discover the facts of a crime without asking questions of persons from whom it was thought that useful information might be obtained. Indeed, such questions might give the suspected person an opportunity of demonstrating that the suspicion of guilt attaching to him was without foundation. The questioning must not, of course, be for the purpose of trapping the suspected person into making admissions and every case must be decided according to the whole of the circumstances.\nThe question of the admissibility of a statement made by an accused person was fully discussed in the judgment of this Court in Boudreau v. The King[12]. In that case the appellant Boudreau was convicted of murder and the point of dissent on which he came before this Court was the improper reception of two written statements, the first containing an admission of intimacy with the wife of the murdered man and the second, in addition to a repetition and an elaboration of the first admission, a full confession of the deed itself. At the time of making them the appellant was held under a coroner\u2019s warrant as a material witness. There was no more than a suspicion against him when, in the first conversation with police officers in which questions were asked him, he purported to detail his movements on the two or three days before the death and admitted the intimacy. Boudreau having consented to make the statement in writing, a justice of the peace was summoned and the statement was made out, signed and sworn to by him. Before the signing the justice read out the words of the usual warning, which were printed across the top of the paper. Two days later, after a formal warning, a further discussion took place with two police officers and, while one of them was momentarily out of the room and after a reference had been made to his mother, Boudreau suddently burst out with the words: \u201cJ\u2019aime autant vous le dire, c\u2019est moi qui l\u2019a tu\u00e9.\u201d The second statement was put in writing, with the consent of the appellant, and was signed and sworn to by him. The trial judge ruled that these statements were admissible in evidence and the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec, agreed with him.\nIn this Court, Kerwin J. (as he then was), at p. 267, states that the fundamental question is whether a confession of an accused offered in evidence is voluntary and goes on to point out that the mere fact that a warning was given is not necessarily decisive in favour of admissibility, but, on the other hand, the absence of a warning should not bind the hands of the Court so as to compel it to rule out a statement. Accordingly, the presence or absence of a warning is a factor and, in many cases, an important one.\nRand J., at p. 269, points out that no doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove. The rule is directed against the danger of improperly instigated, or induced, or coerced admissions and the statement should be that of a man \u201cfree in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority\u201d.\nKellock J., at p. 276, states that in all cases the question is whether the Crown has satisfied the onus that the statement has, in fact, been made voluntarily and that in none of the cases is it laid down that a statement made by a person in custody, in answer to questions put by a person in authority, is, as a matter of law, inadmissible.\nIn Boudreau v. The King the Court followed the governing principle as stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[13]:\nIt has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.\nThe principle laid down in Ibrahim v. The King was followed by this Court in Prosko v. The King[14], where, at p. 237, Anglin J. pointed out that the two American detectives who had the custody of the appellant were persons in authority and that the appellant was in the same plight as if in custody in extradition proceedings under a warrant charging him with murder and that no warning had been given, and that while these facts did not, in themselves, suffice to exclude the admissions, they were undoubtedly circumstances which required that the evidence tendered to establish their voluntary character should be closely scrutinized.\nApplying the principles contained in the authorities to the facts of the present case, I am of the opinion that the statements were properly admissible in evidence. It was contended by the respondent that there was misdirection and non-direction amounting to misdirection on the part of the learned trial judge in that he had failed to lay the theory of the defence adequately before the jury and failed to direct the jury as to how the law in relation to murder should be applied to the facts that they might find.\nThe majority of the members of the Court of Appeal, that is Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw, Aylesworth and Schroeder JJ.A., upheld this contention. The appeal was allowed and a new trial was directed.\nRoach J.A., dissenting, held that there was no misdirection or non-direction amounting to misdirection by the learned trial judge in such matters of law and that there was no failure to lay the theory of the defence adequately before the jury and no failure to direct the jury as to how the law in relation to murder should be applied to the facts, and would have dismissed the appeal.\nThe main theory of the defence is that the respondent had sexual intercourse with the deceased with her consent and, although the act of sexual intercourse was completed, the deceased was not sexually satisfied and wanted it repeated; that she then commenced to annoy the respondent and that, without intending to do her any harm, he grabbed her scarf and \u201cshe just went limp\u201d. This theory is based upon the evidence that there was haemorrhaging from injury to her private parts and consequently the deceased was not dead when the act of sexual intercourse took place. Put shortly, the intercourse and strangling were independent acts.\nThe Crown contended that the deceased had been raped and strangled and that the act of strangulation was done in furtherance of the act of rape.\nIn my view, the real problem which presented itself to the jury was the difficulty in reconciling the written statement of the respondent with the other evidence in the case. In other words, did the respondent cause the death of the deceased under the circumstances as set out in his statement, or did her death ensue as a result of bodily harm intentionally inflicted by him to facilitate the act of sexual intercourse? I agree with the opinion of Roach J.A. that the learned trial judge placed the two opposing theories fairly before the jury, so that they could not fail to understand the issue they had to decide. I am further in agreement with Roach J.A. that the fact of haemorrhaging is equally consistent with the Crown\u2019s theory that the respondent was throttling the girl while he was attempting, or engaging in, the act of intercourse as it is with the theory of the defence that the intercourse was completed and the strangling occurred subsequently.\nThe defence that the act of sexual intercourse was voluntary on the part of the deceased was rejected by the jury and, in view of the evidence relating to the disarray of the clothing of the deceased when her body was found, the pathological evidence as to the description of her injuries, together with the photographs which were entered as exhibits at the trial showing the condition of her neck and head, in my opinion it was properly rejected.\nAt the trial objection was quite properly taken to the evidence of the pathologist, Doctor McLean, where he stated that the deceased had been raped. This was a matter for the jury, but, on cross\u2011examination, the doctor made it quite clear that he was not prepared to venture an opinion, based on his medical observations, as to whether the deceased had or had not consented to having sexual intercourse with the respondent.\nI have nothing further to add to the reasons of Roach J.A. on the appeal on the ground of misdirection.\nIn the result, in my view, the charge was adequate and there was no misdirection or non\u2011direction amounting to misdirection and, in any event, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014On April 27, 1956, the respondent was convicted before Treleaven J. and a jury at the Toronto assizes of having murdered one Linda Lampkin on or about January 18, 1956. He appealed, and applied for leave to appeal, to the Court of Appeal on a number of grounds. His appeal was heard on June 18 and 19, 1956, the Court being composed of Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw, Roach, Aylesworth and Schroeder JJ.A. At the conclusion of the argument the learned Chief Justice announced that the appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed, with Roach J.A. dissenting, and that written reasons would be delivered later. These were delivered on June 27[15].\nPickup C.J.O., with whom Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A. agreed, was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed on two grounds, (i) that the Crown had failed to show that an oral statement made by the respondent to two police officers between 5 and 6 p.m. on January 19 and a written statement made by him immediately afterwards were free and voluntary; and that the erroneous admission in evidence of these statements was in itself sufficient to require the quashing of the conviction, and (ii) that, even assuming for the purpose of dealing with the sufficiency of the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury that the statements were admissible, the learned trial judge had failed to lay the theory of the defence adequately before the jury and had failed to direct them as to how the law in relation to murder should be applied to the facts as they might find them.\nRoach J.A. was of opinion (i) that the learned trial judge was right in holding that the written statement referred to above was admissible, and, while he does not say so expressly, it is, I think, implied in his reasons read as a whole that he was also of opinion that the oral statement which preceded it was admissible, (ii) that, while not saying that the charge of the learned trial judge was a perfect charge, he was satisfied \u201cthat it was entirely adequate; that there was no misdirection and no non-direction amounting to misdirection, and that in any event no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred\u201d.\nAylesworth J.A. agreed with the reasons and conclusion of Pickup C.J.O. on the ground of the inadequacy of the charge to the jury; but as to the admissibility of the statements he said[16]:\u2014\nI do not, however, agree that the statements given to the police by the appellant were inadmissible. On the contrary, I think they were admissible and were properly received in evidence at the trial. I concur in the reasons of my brother Roach in this respect and I have nothing to add to those reasons. It would appear from the paragraph quoted that Aylesworth J.A. read the reasons of Roach J.A. as deciding that the oral as well as the written statement was admissible.\nIn the result Aylesworth J.A. agreed with the order proposed by Pickup C.J.O.\nOn June 28, 1956, the Attorney-General for Ontario gave notice of appeal to this Court. In the view which I take of this case it is necessary for me to deal only with the point relating to the admissibility of the statements made by the respondent and therefore I quote only those parts of the notice of appeal which refer to that point. These are as follows:\u2014\nIn regard to the second statement of the Respondent filed as Exhibit 53 at the trial [i.e., the written statement referred to above], the Chief Justice of Ontario, Laidlaw and Sohroeder, JJ.A., held that the learned trial Judge erred in law in holding that the said statement was admissible in evidence at the trial and allowed the appeal also on this ground.\nMr. Justice Roach and Mr. Justice Aylesworth (dissenting on this ground) held that the learned trial Judge did not err in law in holding that the said statement was admissible in evidence at the trial.\nThe Attorney-General for Ontario appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the following grounds:...\n2. There was dissent on a question of law by the Honourable Mr. Justice Roach and the Honourable Mr. Justice Aylesworth from the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which erred in law in holding that the trial Judge erred in holding that the second statement of the Respondent, filed as Exhibit 53 at the trial, was admissible in evidence at the trial.\nCounsel for the respondent moved at the opening of the hearing before us to quash the appeal on the ground that ground of appeal no. 2, quoted above, did not raise a strict question of law alone. The Court decided to hear the argument of the motion with the argument of the appeal.\nIn my opinion the motion should be granted. After reading all the evidence and everything that was said by counsel and by the learned trial judge during the hearing and disposition of the issue raised as to the admissibility in evidence of the oral and written statements above referred to and everything said on the point in the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal I am unable to discern any dissent on, or indeed any difference of opinion as to, any point of law. The difference of opinion was as to whether the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence as to the primary facts leading up to and surrounding the making of the statements was that the Crown had satisfied the onus of showing that the statements in question were freely and voluntarily made. In the circumstances of the case at bar the question whether or not that inference should be drawn was, in my opinion, one of fact.\nThe evidence of the witnesses on the voir dire as to what I have called the primary facts was not conflicting nor was its veracity attacked in cross-examination and all of the learned judges in the Courts below have proceeded on the basis that it contained an accurate account of what occurred. The effect of that evidence is set out in some detail in the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal (vide [1956] O.R. 696). I propose to give a comparatively brief summary of it.\nThe lifeless body of Linda Lampkin was found on Commissioners Street late in the evening of January 18, 1956, and the police immediately commenced an investigation. At about 7 a.m. on January 19, police officers visited the place in which a truck which had been driven by the respondent on the previous evening was standing. They examined the truck and found in it a bobby-pin and a lipstick said to have belonged to the deceased. On seeing the lipstick the respondent collapsed and the officers rendered some assistance to him. When he had recovered his composure Sergeant-Detective O\u2019Driscoll and Detective Coghill asked him to accompany them to police headquarters. On arrival there he was questioned by these two officers in a small room, called the interrogation-room, until about 9 a.m. During this period police officers took from him a windbreaker, a shirt, a pair of pants, scrapings from his finger\u2011nails and some hairs taken from his head and body. Shortly after 9 a.m. these detectives left and Detective Simmonds proceeded to obtain a statement from the respondent which was later typewritten and was signed by the respondent about noon. There was nothing in this statement of an incriminating character. It contained a denial of having seen the deceased on January 18. Just after this statement was signed and completed, Sergeant-Detective O\u2019Driscoll and Detective Coghill entered the interrogation-room, and Detective Simmonds left them there with the respondent. They remained for a short time. The respondent was given a sandwich and a glass of milk for lunch. The respondent was kept in the general detective office during the afternoon, under close supervision, while Detective Simmonds and Detective McNeely continued their work of investigation elsewhere. About 5 p.m. they returned to headquarters and again took the respondent into the interrogation-room where he had been in the morning. They told the respondent that they had been working since 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, that they had been working pretty hard, that they had received information that he was seen with the deceased on the previous day about 8.45 p.m., that it might be necessary for them to take him out with them in the police car to the west end in the area that he worked in, that there might be other witnesses out there who might have seen things, that the lipstick that was found in his truck had been identified and that they did not believe what he had been telling them. It was at this point that the respondent made the oral incriminating statement. He was at once formally cautioned and then made the longer statement which was reduced to writing and signed by him.\nAfter a full recital of this evidence, the learned Chief Justice of Ontario quotes from the judgment delivered in this Court in Boudreau v. The King[17], and continues[18]:\u2014\nThe principle as set forth in that case is a positive rule of English criminal law. It has been applied in many subsequent cases to which I need not refer, because the ruling which ought to be made by the Court depends on the evidence and particular circumstances disclosed therein in each case. I simply direct my mind and consideration to the fundamental question: Were the statements in question in the instant case freely and voluntarily made?\nAfter a further review of the facts and another reference to the Boudreau case the learned Chief Justice continues[19]:\u2014\nApplying that principle to the particular facts in this case, I have reached the conclusion that the Crown has failed to show that the oral statement made by the appellant, or the written statement made by him immediately afterwards, was free and voluntary. Therefore the learned judge, in my opinion, should not have admitted either of those statements in evidence. The erroneous admission in evidence of these incriminating statements is, in itself, sufficient to warrant this Court directing a new trial.\nRoach J.A. opens the portion of his reasons dealing with this point as follows[20]:\u2014\nIn my opinion the learned trial judge was right in holding that it was admissible. The question before him and now before this Court may be stated thus: Was that statement freely and voluntarily made or was it obtained from the appellant either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out to him by the detectives? If it was a free and voluntary statement it was admissible: if it was not it should have been barred.\nThere can be no doubt as to the rule.\nThe learned justice of appeal then refers to Ibrahim v. The King[21], quoting a passage on which, amongst others, the judgments in this Court in Boudreau\u2019s Case were founded. He stresses the fact that the respondent had not given evidence on the voir dire, attaches great weight to the caution given immediately before the taking of the written statement, points out that there had been no threats or promises and in concluding says[22]:\u2014\nIn determining whether the answers made are admissible or not, the Court inevitably must come back to the primary question: Were they made voluntarily in the sense described in the rule as laid down by Viscount Sumner, supra?\nOn reading and rereading the reasons of Pickup C.J.O. and Roach J.A. I look in vain for any difference as to the applicable law.\nIt was suggested in argument that the learned Chief Justice of Ontario had held as a matter of law that the fact, if established, that police officers \u201ccross-examined\u201d the respondent while in de facto custody and under suspicion required the trial judge as a matter of law to reject the statements. I can find no such ruling in his reasons. He regarded the fact that certain questions were put as one of the relevant circumstances to be weighed in deciding the question before the Court which he had already accurately described in words, which I have quoted above, which do not differ in any matter of substance from those used by Roach J.A. There is no suggestion in any of the reasons that the learned trial judge misdirected himself on the law on this branch of the case. His conclusion on the evidence before him was that the statements were shewn to be voluntarily made. The minority in the Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion but the majority were of the contrary opinion. It is not relevant to inquire which conclusion I would have reached on the evidence, for such a conclusion is one of fact and not of law.\nNo doubt there may be cases in which the question whether a statement made by an accused is admissible in evidence becomes one of law; but, in my opinion, the case at bar is not such a case. I conclude that we are without jurisdiction to deal with ground 2, quoted above from the notice of appeal of the Attorney-General. This being so it follows that the appeal cannot succeed as it is clear from the portion of the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario secondly quoted above that in dealing with this ground the majority decided that the erroneous admission of the statements in question was in itself sufficient to require the directing of a new trial.\nIf, contrary to the view that I have expressed, it could be asserted that (i) there is a difference of substance between the statement of the principles of law which are to be applied in determining whether a statement by an accused is admissible made by Pickup C.J.O. and that made by Roach J.A. and (ii) that there was error in the former statement, it would not follow that so far as this ground of appeal is concerned the appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored. Before restoring the conviction this Court would, at least, have to be satisfied that it could safely be affirmed that but for the supposed error in law the majority in the Court of Appeal would necessarily have concluded that the statements were admissible. As is pointed out by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King, supra, at pp. 609-10, the question whether it has been shewn by the prosecution that the statement of an accused was voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority is one of fact to be decided by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to weigh the evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and to substitute its decision for that of the trial judge. This Court has no jurisdiction to re-weigh the evidence and substitute its opinion for that of the Court of Appeal. In view of the rule that the onus of proving a statement by an accused to have been voluntary in the sense mentioned rests upon the prosecution, I find difficulty in accepting the view that it can ever be said as a matter of pure law that the question whether that onus has been satisfied must be answered in the affirmative. However in view of the conclusion which I have reached above as to our lack of jurisdiction in this case, I do not pursue these questions further.\nI would quash the appeal.\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[23] setting aside the conviction of the respondent for the murder of one Linda Lampkin and ordering a new trial. The appeal is taken under the provisions of s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code and the questions of law as to which a dissent is alleged are (i) whether, as held by Pickup C.J.O., with the concurrence of Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A., Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A. dissenting, a written statement, filed as ex. 53, and an oral statement immediately prior thereto, both made by the respondent, were illegally admitted in evidence, and (ii) whether, as held by Pickup C.J.O., with the concurrence of Laidlaw, Aylesworth and Schroeder JJ.A., Roach J.A. dissenting, the trial judge failed to lay the theory of the defence adequately before the jury and direct them as to how the law in relation to murder should be applied to the facts.\nDealing with question (i): it is the submission of counsel for the respondent that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this ground of appeal for the reason that it does not involve a question of law in the strict sense, but a pure question of fact or at the most a question of mixed law and fact. With this submission I am unable to agree. Whether or not evidence is admissible is always a question to be determined in the light of what the law is with respect to the particular nature of the evidence tendered. While as to certain subject-matters of evidence such as confessions, this determination requires a prior examination of the facts which, if judicially found to foe within the rule of law governing the admission of such evidence, will render the same admissible, any question as to what the rule is in the matter involves a question of law in the strict sense. Hence a divergence of views between the majority and minority members of a Court of Appeal as to what the law is clearly gives jurisdiction to this Court to examine the point and satisfy its statutory duty to determine the matter. With reference to the rule of law governing the admissibility of the extrajudicial admissions made by the respondent in the present instance, Roach J.A., for the minority, said[24]:\u2014\nThere can be no doubt as to the rule. It was stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 at 609, as follows: \u201cIt has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.\u201d\n* * *\nThere is no positive rule of evidence that if improper questions are asked of a prisoner in custody the answers to them are, merely on that account, inadmissible. The cases are reviewed by Kellock J. in Boudreau v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 262 at 270 et seq., 94 C.C.C. 1, 7 C.R. 427, [1949] 3 D.L.R. 81. I do not review them here. In determining whether the answers made are admissible or not, the Court inevitably must come back to the primary question: Were they made voluntarily in the sense described in the rule as laid down by Viscount Sumner, supra.\n(The italics are mine.)\nOn the other hand, Pickup C.J.O., for the majority, stated[25]:\u2014\nIn my opinion, the Crown does not discharge the onus resting upon it by merely adducing oral testimony showing that an incriminating statement made by an accused person was not induced by a promise or by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage. That statement of the rule of law is too narrow. The admissions must not have been \u201cimproperly instigated or induced or coerced\u201d: per Rand J. in Boudreau v. The King, supra, at p. 269. The admissions must be self-impelled and the statement must be the statement of a man \u201cfree in volition from compulsions or inducements of authority\u201d. Thus it appears that Roach J.A., with the concurrence of Aylesworth J.A., held the view that the decision of this Court in Boudreau v. The King did not change the law as stated by Viscount Sumner and that a declaration made by an accused is a voluntary statement if it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. In the view of Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A., this statement of the rule is too narrow and in addition to proving that the statement has not been obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, the prosecution must further show that the statement was not otherwise influenced by the course of conduct adopted by the police, that it must be self-impelled, failing which it is not a voluntary one in the sense required by law. The merit of each of these views of the law is, of course, foreign to the consideration of our jurisdiction to entertain this ground on appeal, for it is the precise point which this Court will have to determine on the appeal itself. The above difference in the statement of the law applied is essentially what gives jurisdiction to this Court. It may be added, before parting with the consideration of this preliminary objection, that none of the cases invoked by the respondent supports it or conflicts with the views here expressed.\nOn the merits of ground (i): as to what the law is in the matter, I agree with the views held by Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A. As I read the reasons for judgment of the majority in this Court in Boudreau v. The King, supra, I find nothing to suggest an intention to modify the rule of law as stated by Viscount Sumner. With respect to the English \u201cJudges\u2019 Rules\u201d as to questions put by police officers, it has been repeatedly and again recently said that they are administrative rules for the guidance of police officers but not rules of law and that a breach thereof does not per se render the statement inadmissible if the true test of voluntariness laid down by Viscount Sumner is met: Regina v. Wattam[26]; Regina v. May[27]; Regina v. Bass[28]; Regina v. Harris-Rivet[29]. As to all the evidence in this case and particularly that related to the circumstances prior to and contemporaneous with the impugned statements, it is extensively reviewed in the reasons for judgment of Roach J.A. in the Court below[30], and need not likewise be related here. In brief, while the law\u2011enforcement officers were apprising the respondent at police headquarters, where he had agreed in the morning to accompany them, that, as a result of further investigation, they could not believe some of the declarations he had there made in the morning, he was preoccupied in mind, eventually breaking his silence by saying:\u2014\nI was just thinking of my wife and kids. I didn\u2019t mean to do it. She started kibitzing around and I grabbed her by the scarf and she didn\u2019t breathe no more.\nHe was immediately stopped and informed that he was arrested on a charge of murder, and having been given the customary warning, he proceeded to make the declarations reduced in writing in ex. 53, which he signed. The above attitude and utterances of the respondent are no evidence that his mind was in any way affected by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage. On the evidence, led in the cross\u2011examination of the police officers relating the event, the thoughts of the respondent throughout the day had been directed to his wife and children, and he was explaining that it was on account of them that he had made, in the morning, some false declarations. Indeed it was never suggested by counsel for the respondent at any stage of the trial, including that of the procedure on voir dire, nor can it be implied from any of the questions or answers appearing in any part of the whole of the evidence, that the impugned statements were not voluntary in the sense indicated by Viscount Sumner or that the burden of the Crown to meet that particular test had not been discharged. As the issue was tried before, and left, to, the jury, these impugned statements, on the unchallenged information given at the hearing before this Court by counsel for the respondent, were represented by the defence to be voluntary in any sense of the word and truthful. The submission that these particular statements were inadmissible was raised for the first time for the purpose of the appeal, not in the original, but in a supplementary notice of appeal. That these statements were voluntary under the rule stated by Viscount Sumner is not challenged by the majority in the Court below which found it necessary to hold as a matter of law that the statement of the rule was too narrow and, on the law they applied, found as a fact, not that fear of prejudice or hope of advantage was exercised or held out by the police, but that the course of conduct they adopted precluded any conclusion that the statements were self-impelled. Assuming that it could be said that the conduct of the police in the circumstances of this case was not in accordance with the \u201cJudges\u2019 Rules\u201d, it was, particularly under the authorities above quoted, within the discretion of the trial judge, if otherwise satisfied that the test of voluntariness stated by Viscount Sumner had been met, to admit these statements in evidence. Again, while the defence objected successfully to the admissibility of certain declarations made subsequent to the signing by the accused of ex. 53, it did not invite the Court to reject the impugned statements. And if, on the view the trial judge formed on the voir dire, the occasion arose for him to exercise this discretionary power, I find it impossible to say that he failed to do so judicially in admitting them in evidence.\nDealing with question (ii): the theory of the Crown was that Linda Lampkin had been strangled in furtherance of the act of rape. The theory of the defence, contained in the statement filed as ex. 53, was that, sexual intercourse having taken place with her full approval and consent, Linda Lampkin not being sexually satisfied began to annoy the accused who then grabbed her scarf without intending any harm, \u201cand she didn\u2019t breathe no more\u201d. The evidence with respect to the condition both of the body of the victim and of her clothing is violently inconsistent with any suggestion of consent on her part. On the evidence, the cause of death was asphyxia due to strangulation resulting from the forceful tightening during a continuous period of 3 to 5 minutes of a knotted scarf she had around her neck, producing thereby a deep groove in the flesh-tissue corresponding in size to the width of the scarf. The fact that death actually occurred subsequent to the rape does not necessarily show that this forceful and continuous tightening of the scarf, which brought death by strangulation, was divorced from the act of rape. As Roach J.A. puts it[31]:\u2014\nThat theory [the theory of the defence] rested on the foundation that the act of sexual intercourse was voluntary on her part and that she wanted it repeated. Remove that prop from beneath that theory and it would collapse. It was her persistence, so the accused said, in wanting the act repeated that caused him to take hold of the scarf. That was his explanation. If that explanation should be rejected then he must have taken hold of it for some other purpose. What was that other purpose? That other purpose, according to the Crown\u2019s theory, was to overpower her so that against her will he could have sexual intercourse with her.\nThat the accused killed the girl there was no doubt. He said so. What the jury had to decide was: Did he slay her under the circumstances contained in his explanation or did her death ensue as the result of bodily harm intentionally inflicted by him to facilitate him in having sexual intercourse with her?\nWeak as it was, the theory of the defence was put to the jury and I agree with Roach J.A. that the two opposing theories were fairly and squarely explained to them in such a manner that they could not fail to understand the issue they had to decide according to law.\nThere remains to consider two other grounds of appeal raised by the respondent before the Court of Appeal and with which the majority did not find necessary to deal in view of their conclusions as to the two points already heretofore considered. It is the respondent\u2019s submission that the learned trial judge failed to instruct the jury (i) as to what use could be made of the expert evidence of Dr. Chester McLean and (ii) of their obligation to reject any of his opinions which he was not qualified as an expert to give.\nThese objections are dealt with in the reasons for judgment of Roach J.A. and I am in respectful agreement with the manner in which he disposed of them.\nI am also of the opinion that, on all the evidence in this case, no jury properly instructed could, if true to their oath, return any other verdict than that the accused was guilty as charged.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and restore the verdict of the jury. ABBOTT J.:\u2014A question which has caused me some difficulty is that raised by respondent in his motion to quash the appeal, namely, whether or not, in connection with the ground of appeal relating to the admissibility of certain oral and written statements made by respondent, there was dissent on a question of law. I have reached the conclusion that there was.\nAs to the admissibility of the incriminating oral and written statements made by the accused, in his reasons in the Court below, Roach J.A. (speaking for himself and Aylesworth J.A.) has stated the rule of law to be applied in the following terms[32]:\u2014\nWas that statement freely and voluntarily made or was it obtained from the appellant either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out to him by the detectives?\n(The italics are mine.)\nIt is to be noted that he has used the precise words of the rule as laid down by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[33], with the exception that he has substituted the words \u201cthe detectives\u201d for \u201ca person in authority\u201d.\nThe Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the majority and referring to the rule in question, held that[34]:\u2014\nIn my opinion, the Crown does not discharge the onus resting upon it by merely adducing oral testimony showing that an incriminating statement made by an accused person was not induced by a promise or by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage. That statement of the rule of law is too narrow. The admissions must not have been \u201cimproperly instigated or induced or coerced\u201d: per Rand J. in Boudreau v. The King, supra, at p. 269. The admissions must be self-impelled, and the statement must be the statement of a man \u201cfree in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority\u201d. The statement must be \u201cfreely and voluntarily made\u201d.\nThis difference between the dissenting judgment and that of the majority is in my view clearly a question of law, which gives this Court jurisdiction.\nMoreover, referring to the statements made by the respondent, Roach J.A. said[35]:\u2014\nThe appellant did not give evidence either on the voir dire or in defence to the charge. To put it otherwise he has not at any time said in evidence that in making the statement he felt under any compulsion or that it was induced by any fear of prejudice or hope of advantage held out to him. When he blurted out the words \u201cI was just thinking of my wife and kids\u201d, and so forth, he was immediately stopped by the detectives and cautioned. He said he understood that caution. If he understood it then he understood that he was not obliged to say anything, because in administering the caution to him he was told \u201cyou are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so\u201d. In my respectful opinion the statement could be held inadmissible only on the theory that he did not understand the caution, in the face of his statement, not denied, that he did, or that, though he understood it, he still felt under some compulsion induced by some improper external stimulus to make it.\nI do not think it should now be held that he did not understand the caution, in the face of his statement that he did. If he understood it then I can see no room for the suggestion that, despite his understanding, he still felt some compulsion. It would have been quite a different matter if, on the voir dire, he had gone into the witness-box and stated either that he did not understand the caution or that, understanding it, he nevertheless made the statement because he was fearful that if he did not he would be prejudiced, or hoped that if he did it might be to his advantage. In the absence of such a complaint or explanation coming out of his mouth, to hold now either that he did not understand the caution or that, understanding it, he felt under some compulsion, would in my respectful opinion be to act on sheer speculation, and would not be justified by the evidence.\nIt was not suggested on cross-examination of the officers on the voir dire, in the argument submitted by counsel for the accused to the trial judge, or in the argument presented to this Court, that what the detectives said to the appellant with respect to the information they had obtained that afternoon was not true and that by pretending that they had such information they had tricked the accused into making an admission of guilt. If I understood the argument of counsel for the appellant in this Court it was simply this, that when the detectives told the accused that as a result of their investigations they had received some information to the effect that he had been seen with the deceased on the previous night at St. John\u2019s Road and Jane Street, and that they did not believe what he had told them to the contrary in the morning, they thereby invited him to make some reply. I concede that that is so. It is true that what the detectives said consisted of affirmative statements and was not interrogatory, but I think there could have been no other reason for them to make those statements than to invite a reply. The detectives did not know what the reply might be. It might be a denial or an explanation, or it might be an admission. Let me assume for the moment that the detectives hoped that it would be an admission of guilt. The fact remains that they made no threats that may have raised any fear in the mind of the appellant, nor did they hold out any promise or hope of advantage if he admitted his guilt nor did they suggest to him that he might be prejudiced if he did not.\nAs I read this passage, the learned judge has held that in his opinion there was no evidence to justify a finding that the respondent\u2019s statements were obtained from him \u201ceither by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out to him\u201d\nby the two detectives. This is a question of law upon which I share his view. I am therefore in agreement with Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A. that the statements in question were properly admitted by the trial judge.\nAs to the other ground of dissent, I am in respectful agreement with Roach J.A. that there was no misdirection and no non-direction amounting to misdirection. There is nothing which I could usefully add to his reasons for judgment.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nAppeal allowed and conviction restored.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Clarence P.

Edward Sylvester (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJohn Crits, an Infant, by his Next Friend Neil Crits, and Neil Crits (Plaintiffs) Respondents;\nand\nLionel A. Macklin, the Stratford General Hospital Trust and the Stratford General Hospital Corporation (Defendants).\n1956: October 9, 10, 24.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPhysicians and surgeons\u2014Negligence\u2014Anaesthetist\u2014Sufficiency of precautions taken to prevent explosion\u2014Use of combination of ether and oxygen\u2014Danger from static electricity.\nAn anaesthetic was administered by introducing oxygen from a tank into a can containing ether, and then forcing the mixture of ether and oxygen through a tube (known as a Magill tube) into the patient\u2019s throat. Almost immediately after the start of the anaesthetizing process the patient developed a cyanotic condition, necessitating the administration of pure oxygen. The tubes were thereupon withdrawn from the can and oxygen was drawn from the tank into a bag, from which it was introduced through the Magill tube into the patient\u2019s lungs. As soon as the bag was filled the tube from the tank was again inserted in the ether-can, but with the pressure reduced. When the patient\u2019s condition had returned to normal the Magill tube was disconnected from the oxygen-bag, with a view to restoring the flow of the anaesthetic. At that moment a violent explosion took place, causing serious injuries to the patient. It was established in evidence that the explosion had been caused by a spark of static electricity setting aflame the ether-oxygen mixture that had escaped from the can while the Magill tube was disconnected, and accumulated near the patient\u2019s head.\nHeld: The anaesthetist was liable in damages for the patient\u2019s injuries. It amounted to negligence in the circumstances to leave the oxygen flowing into the ether-can while the Magill tube was not connected to it. It was not sufficient merely to reduce the pressure; the oxygen should have been turned off at the tank, which would have entailed no material delay and would have substantially reduced the danger. It was conceded that the ether-oxygen vapour was highly explosive, and that in surgical operations there was constant danger of a spark from static electricity. Admittedly there was no absolute security against either spark or explosion, but the duty of all working in such conditions was to reduce that possibility to the practicable minimum. There was no evidence that what was done in this case was approved as standard practice in hospitals.\nA second alleged ground of negligence was the failure to remove the ether-can from the operating-table, close to the patient\u2019s head. But the anaesthetist\u2019s conduct in this respect had been approved by other medical witnesses, and it would be dangerous for a Court to attempt in such a matter to proscribe a step approved by the general experience of technicians and not shown to be clearly unnecessary or unduly hazardous.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], in so far as it reversed the judgment of Smily J. at trial[2].\nG.F. Henderson, Q.C., and R.F. Merriam, for the defendant Sylvester, appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal by an anaesthetist from a judgment1 holding him responsible for an explosion of ether-oxygen gas in the preparatory stages of a tonsillectomy in an action brought as well against the surgeon and the hospital. Smily J., at trial, dismissed the action2, and this was affirmed by the Court of Appeal1 except as to the anaesthetist.\nThe items of negligence relied on are reduced to two: the first, that a small can containing a quantity of ether into which oxygen was introduced and from which the mixed gas was conveyed to the patient had been kept on the operating-table at a distance of between 6 and 7 inches from the face of the patient; and the second, that during a suspension of anaesthetizing and while pure oxygen was being administered to counteract cyanosis, the flow of oxygen into the can and thence into the air was allowed to continue, producing a condition for the explosion which followed.\nWith the first ground I find it unnecessary to deal. Schroeder J.A., who gave the judgment in appeal, held it to have been practicable to keep the can in some other place than on the operating-table. During the trial the suggested place was the floor, but I would accept the opinion of Dr. Gordon that that is no place for any part of the apparatus in such a procedure. Dr. Nichols agreed that at times he had removed the can from the table, but where or under what circumstances was neither asked nor stated. The practice followed here was approved by Dr. Gordon, and it would be extremely dangerous for a Court to attempt in such a matter to proscribe a step for technicians where their general experience approves it and it is not clearly unnecessary and unduly hazardous.\nThe second ground, however, does not appear to be open to that stricture. It is conceded that in surgical operations there is a constant danger of a spark from static electricity and that the general means of avoiding it are known by all concerned. In particular there is a common understanding of \u201cgrounding\u201d a charge, and of the scientific theory of differences in potential from which sparks may result. Among the means taken in the hospital to drain off or neutralize any electric condition were, a metal grid imbedded in the floor and gathered into a grounding, the wearing of cotton outer garments and leather-soled footwear, a regulated humidity, temperature and ventilation, and a prescribed mode of separating parts of the apparatus against the effects of different potentials. It is conceded also that the ether-oxygen vapour is a highly explosive mixture.\nAn absolute prevention of any diffusion of ether gas or of the ether-oxygen mixture is not practically possible. In the can here, besides an aperture for the admission of the oxygen tube, there was a somewhat smaller one, about 1\/4-inch in diameter, through which the vapour from ether as well as the mixture could escape into the air, designed to prevent a pressure being built up beyond the capacity of the patient to accept.\nIn this case, the patient, a young boy about 5 years of age, had been given pentothal to induce the first stage of anaesthesia. That was at once followed by the introduction of a small tube into the trachea, called a Magill tube, to which was connected another leading from the can. Into the can the oxygen was led from an oxygen-tank about 5 feet from the operating\u2011table. The oxygen enters the can at a much reduced pressure from that in the tank. The tube may reach below the surface of the ether or above it, but in either case the flow causes the ether to bubble and the mixed vapour to rise and through a central orifice in the top of the can to pass into a connector and tubes leading into the trachea.\nWithin half a minute or so of the setting up of the apparatus connecting the oxygen-tank, the can and the patient, for some part of which the ether-oxygen gas was in flow, Dr. Sylvester noticed a bluish tinge about the lips of the patient and satisfied himself that a cyanotic condition was present which had to be corrected immediately. The connector on the tube\u2011system from the can was disconnected from the tracheal tube, the oxygen-tube was withdrawn from the can, and both connector and oxygen-tube were introduced into a rubber bag for the purpose of filling it with pure oxygen. The pressure from the tank was stepped up and the bag was filled in the course of 10 or 15 seconds. The oxygen-tube was thereupon removed from the bag, reinserted into the can and the pressure from the tank reduced\u2014or intended to be reduced\u2014to normal. The oxygen-bag was then connected with the tracheal tube by means of the connector and by manual compression the oxygen was introduced into the child\u2019s lungs. In half a minute or so he was restored and respiration had become normal.\nThe next step was to disconnect the oxygen-bag from the tracheal tube and restore without delay the flow of the anaesthetic from the can into the lungs. To make that disconnection, Dr. Sylvester took hold firmly of the end of the tracheal tube with thumb and finger of the right hand and the metal face-piece of the bag and the connector with the left hand and in a sort of sweeping or bending motion he brought about the separation. At that instant, with a sizzling sound, a flash of blue flame and a violent explosion followed, and the flame appeared to the doctor to be between the can and the patient\u2019s face. The effect reached to the surgeon who was standing at the foot of the operating-table and serious injuries were caused to the child.\nNo other cause is suggested than that of a spark of static electricity setting aflame the ether\u2011oxygen mixture accumulated in the space between the can and the patient\u2019s head. As mentioned, from the breaking of the pipe-connection between the can and the tracheal tube until the oxygen-tube was removed from the can and connected with the oxygen-bag, and, following the \u201cbagging\u201d of the child, from the time of restoring the oxygen-tube to the can until the breaking of the connection between the oxygen-bag and the tracheal tube, the oxygen was flowing into the can mixing with the ether and escaping through both the small release aperture and the main opening from which led the tube to the patient. In addition to that, there was the flow of oxygen to the can before action was taken to restore respiration, and that the gas did not, in any quantity, then reach the lungs is indicated by the cyanotic development. The time, therefore, of the flow which escaped and was escaping when the final disconnection was made cannot have been less than 2 to 3 minutes. It does not require a technician\u2019s understanding to see that a dangerous volume of the gaseous mixture had built up in the immediate area in which the flash of flame appeared.\nThe evidence is not at all clear whether, when the bag was filled and the oxygen-tube restored to the tank, the pressure in the tank had been reduced by Dr. Sylvester or by a nurse. In one place his language would indicate that he had done it but in another he could not be certain that it was not by a nurse. It was suggested to him that, at that point, to have turned the oxygen-tank off completely would have entailed no material delay and would have reduced substantially the danger. This he first met with two objections, that he wanted the gas to be ready immediately upon resuscitation, and that it was just another manipulation which he thought unnecessary. Later, he spoke of the latter as the real objection. It was obviously as easy, if not easier, to turn the oxygen pressure off completely than to turn it down to the normal. He could not say whether there was a flow\u2011gauge on the tank, and the degree of flow was estimated. If this reduction had been made by a nurse it is impossible to say what amount was made or at what speed the flow continued. Upon restoring the anaesthetizing\u2011system, it would have been only a matter of a second or so for him to reach to the oxygen-tank and open the valve and the time for the oxygen to pass through the distance of 6 or 7 feet of tube into the can and the distance of 6 or 7 inches to the mouth of the patient would not have exceeded 5 to 10 seconds. No doubt it was desirable to renew the anaesthesia without unnecessary delay, but since the respiration was back to normal and the effects of the pentothal were far from exhausted, the additional step would have been immaterial to the procedure.\nThe fact seems to be that Dr. Sylvester assumed that static electricity was sufficiently guarded against. Admittedly there is no absolute security against either spark or explosion. While all operations must run a risk of such an unlikely eventuality, the duty of all working in such conditions is to reduce that possibility to the practicable minimum. Was, then, the act of allowing the ether-oxygen mixture to escape reasonably necessary? Involved in that determination is its working out in actual practice and if it could be shown that a uniform practice throughout hospitals had found it to be one of the requirements of the procedure, then the Court is not in a position to dictate to that judgment. Was it a step approved by what is called \u201cstandard practice\u201d?\nOn that there is a minimum of evidence. An answer given by the doctor on cross-examination is said by Mr. Henderson to establish that fact. To understand the answer, it is necessary to read a previous question and answer:\nQ. Now, I want to ask you what was your custom and practice in regard to that? That is to say, when you administer this type of anaesthetic using an ether-can did you always put it on the cotton sheet on top of the mattress? A. That was my custom and practice. Q. Yes. Well, then, I believe you spoke of the fact that when you were administering the oxygen by means of the bag\u2014compressing the bag\u2014that the cotton sheet\u2014that the oxygen was still flowing through the rubber tube into the ether can? A. That would be the practice, yes.\nTo this last language I can give only one interpretation, that \u201cthe practice\u201d to which he refers was his practice and not standard or general practice. Neither Dr. Nichols nor Dr. Gordon was questioned specifically on this point; but that it was looked upon as one of importance appears from the cross\u2011examination of Dr. Sylvester by counsel both for the hospital and for the plaintiff. It was, therefore, an issue clearly raised by the evidence but left in the state I have indicated.\nI think the evidence justified the Court of Appeal in holding that it was an improper practice because quite unnecessary. Although to turn the oxygen on again to the normal pressure was an additional act, it was one that could fit easily and habitually into the procedure, even more so than turning the pressure down\u2014without a gauge\u2014to the normal. It created, undoubtedly, a serious increase in the hazard; the extra time involved was insignificant; and in the proximity to the patient of such a body of explosive gas it would seem to me, in the absence of the evidence of wide and confirmed experience, to be without justification. At any rate, I am quite unable to say that the view taken by the Court of Appeal was wrong.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Gregory, Anderson, Ehgoetz & Bell, Stratford.\nSolicitors for the defendant Sylvester, appellant, and the defendant Macklin: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant corporations: Mitchell & Hockin, London.\n[1] [1956] O.R. 132, 1 D.L.R.

VI, c. 104, s. 19, which reads as follows:\nEnglish version:\n536c. No action in damages shall lie against the city when the damages resulting from flooding shall be due to the failure to install, in any immoveable erected after the 28th of April, 1939, Safety Valves of a model approved by the Quebec Public Service Commission, to prevent the backing up of the waters from the sewers of the City into the cellar of such immoveable.\nFrench version:\n536c.

Had the appellant alleged and proved a case of \"flooding\" due to the inability of the respondent's sewer serving the premises to carry away the drainage it was at the time called upon to carry, including that from the appellant's premises, it might have lain upon the respondent to establish not only that the presence of an approved valve or valves would have prevented the reverse flow of the contents of the sewer into the cellar but also that the appellant's premises would not have suffered damage by reason of any inability of its own drainage to get away. It is, however, unnecessary to consider this aspect of the matter, as the case actually alleged and proved by the appellant was one of damage caused by water backing up from the sewer into the cellar.\nThe other questions raised by appellant were, in my opinion, satisfactorily disposed of in the Courts below.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Stein & Stein, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Choquette & Berthiaume, Montreal.\n1 [1954] Que.

The other defendant, P, took part in the negotiations of the contracts in an advisory capacity, but did not disclose his partnership with B in the utilization of the patent.\nHeld: Tacit confirmation of the contracts was alleged in the defence to the action, and the plaintiff's conduct in continuing to take full advantage of the contracts long after its discovery of the relationship between the two defendants, amounted to a tacit confirmation. In the circumstances, the question of fraud and error need not be considered and the action should be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, reversing the judgment at trial and dismissing the action. Appeal dismissed.\nA. M. Watt, Q.C., and L. Tremblay, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. Ahern, Q.C., and E. Lafontaine, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Rand, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014En juin 1951, la compagnie appelante intentait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 P\u00e9loquin et Hilaire Blanchett une action en annulation de deux contrats intervenus entre elle et Blanchett, l'un en mai 1946, l'autre en mars 1947, ayant trait \u00e0 l'exploitation d'une invention faite par ce dernier. Au temps des n\u00e9gociation et signature de ces contrats, auxquelles l'intim\u00e9 P\u00e9loquin participa, l'exploitation de cette invention \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0, \u00e0 l'insu de l'appelante, le sujet d'une convention entre Blanchett et l'intim\u00e9 P\u00e9loquin. A raison de ce fait et de ses incidences, l'appelante pr\u00e9tendit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 induite \u00e0 croire erron\u00e9ment contracter avec Blanchett uniquement alors qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, elle contractait avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Blanchett et P\u00e9loquin, et qu'en acquies\u00e7ant \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode de division des profits sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par P\u00e9loquin, son aviseur financier, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 fraud\u00e9e.\nBlanchett n'a pas plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 l'action. P\u00e9loquin a soumis, en d\u00e9fense, que les relations existant entre lui et l'appelante, au temps des n\u00e9gociation et signature de ces contrats, ne lui faisaient aucune obligation de lui d\u00e9noncer sa convention avec Blanchett; que l'appelante n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'aucune fraude, n'a subi aucun pr\u00e9judice et que, de toutes fa\u00e7ons, elle a, pendant deux ans, apr\u00e8s avoir appris que Blanchett et P\u00e9loquin \u00e9taient associ\u00e9s, confirm\u00e9 ces contrats de fa\u00e7on non \u00e9quivoque. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9cart\u00e9 cette d\u00e9fense et en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appelante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'erreur et de fraude et que la conduite tenue par elle apr\u00e8s avoir connu l'existence de la convention non d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e ne pouvait, sous les circonstances, \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une confirmation tacite des contrats attaqu\u00e9s. Ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 en appel 2 sur un motif, commun aux trois juges, soit la confirmation; M. le juge Rinfret ajoutant que l'erreur et la fraude n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es.\nPour les raisons ci-apr\u00e8s indiqu\u00e9es, il est impossible d'accepter la proposition de l'appelante voulant que la confirmation n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9e en d\u00e9fense, ni \u00e9tablie en preuve. Dans ces vues, il devient inutile de s'attarder \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer si pour aucune des raisons invoqu\u00e9es, les contrats attaqu\u00e9s pouvaient \u00eatre annul\u00e9s. Mais il para\u00eet juste de reconna\u00eetre que si, sous toutes les circonstances de cette cause, la non d\u00e9nonciation de la convention \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait partie pouvait constituer un acte reprehensible susceptible en droit de justifier l'annulation des contrats, rien dans la preuve n'\u00e9tablit que, de fait ou d'intention, P\u00e9loquin ait tromp\u00e9 l'appelante par les avis qu'il lui donna en l'occurrence.\nPour disposer des pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelante \u00e0 l'encontre du principal motif de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel, il convient de rappeler g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l'\u00e9conomie de la loi sur la confirmation tacite des contrats. Disons d'abord que si la loi frappe de nullit\u00e9 absolue certains contrats, en raison de la nature juridique des relations des parties, tels, par exemple, certains actes entre tuteur et mineur, personne, dans le cas qui nous occupe, ne pr\u00e9tend que, sans la r\u00e9ticence dont on se plaint, les contrats en question ne pouvaient \u00eatre validement pass\u00e9s. La r\u00e9ticence consistant \u00e0 garder volontairement le silence sur un fait que l'autre partie au contrat aurait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 conna\u00eetre peut sans doute constituer un dol. Mais le dol et l'erreur ne sont pas cause de nullit\u00e9 absolue, mais simplement relative, et la convention qui en est entach\u00e9e peut \u00eatre confirm\u00e9e par la partie qui aurait droit de s'en plaindre, soit de fa\u00e7on expresse ou purement tacite. Cette confirmation pr\u00e9suppose \u00e9videmment de la part de son auteur la connaissance du vice du contrat. Elle peut alors r\u00e9sulter de l'ex\u00e9cution volontaire, totale ou m\u00eame partielle, ou de l'exercice des droits acquis par la convention, m\u00eame par des actes pass\u00e9s avec des tiers. Dans certains cas, la connaissance du vice, une fois \u00e9tablie, entra\u00eenera une pr\u00e9somption de fait de l'intention de confirmer: ainsi en pr\u00e9sence d'une ex\u00e9cution proprement dite ou de l'exercice des droits acquis par l'acte : Planiol et Ripert, Droit Civil, 1952 2e \u00e9d., tome 6, n\u00b0 201 et nos 303 et seq.\nIl n'est pas douteux que la confirmation tacite des contrats en question est soulev\u00e9e aux plaidoiries. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la demanderesse elle-m\u00eame a jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, au soutien de son action, de se justifier de n'attaquer qu'en juin 1951 ces contrats consentis par elle en mai 1946 et en mars 1947. C'est ainsi qu'elle all\u00e8gue : au paragraphe 22, n'avoir acquis la connaissance de la d\u00e9ception dont elle se plaint que le 20 mai 1949, et aux paragraphes 23 et 24, avoir, depuis cette date, recherch\u00e9 l'accord de P\u00e9loquin et Blanchett pour l'annulation des contrats. Ces all\u00e9gations sont ni\u00e9es par la d\u00e9fense o\u00f9 on plaide, aux paragraphes 23 et 27, que l'appelante, au printemps 1949, a fait des instances aupr\u00e8s de P\u00e9loquin pour lui faire amender son contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avec Blanchett et qu'au printemps 1951, elle a recherch\u00e9 de remplacer la stipulation des contrats voulant que les profits soient partag\u00e9s dans une proportion de 40 pour cent pour elle et de 60 pour cent pour les d\u00e9fendeurs, par une royaut\u00e9 d'un montant fixe par machine. On plaide aussi, aux paragraphes 26 et 29, que la demanderesse continue la fabrication et la vente de la machine \u00e0 des profits consid\u00e9rables. Aux termes des r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales relatives \u00e0 la plaidoirie \u00e9crite, il suffit d'\u00e9noncer les faits qui, sans cette \u00e9nonciation, seraient de nature \u00e0 prendre par surprise la partie adverse ou \u00e0 soulever une contestation \u00e9trang\u00e8re aux plaidoiries; le tout sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire d'employer une formule particuli\u00e8re et sans entrer dans une argumentation: arts. 105 et seq. C.P.C. Rien n'obligeait le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 caract\u00e9riser en droit la nature juridique des faits invoqu\u00e9s. Il est manifeste que ces all\u00e9gations de faits, et particuli\u00e8rement celle dans la d\u00e9claration indiquant la date de la connaissance acquise de la d\u00e9ception, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en raison du jeu de la th\u00e9orie de la loi sur la confirmation tacite des contrats. C'est d'ailleurs ainsi que la contestation li\u00e9e fut comprise par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance; ceci ressort clairement de questions pos\u00e9es par lui au cours de l'enqu\u00eate, aussi bien que du fait qu'au soutien de son jugement, il a jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer la question en d\u00e9cidant qu'il n'y avait pas eu confirmation.\nCe fait juridique est non seulement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 mais, comme en a jug\u00e9 la Cour d'Appel, il est \u00e9tabli au dossier et, \u00e0 mon avis, de fa\u00e7on p\u00e9remptoire. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audition que c'est au d\u00e9but d'avril et non \u00e0 la fin de mai 1949 que l'appelante acquit la connaissance de la convention P\u00e9loquin et Blanchett. Nonobstant ce fait, elle a continu\u00e9 et . continue encore la fabrication et la vente de la machine et l'exploitation des brevets en prot\u00e9geant l'invention, n'ayant en fait jamais eu l'intention de suspendre ses op\u00e9rations. De ceci, elle a fait judiciairement l'aveu en admettant, au paragraphe 8 de sa r\u00e9ponse, l'all\u00e9gation de ces faits au paragraphe 30 du plaidoyer. Sauf dans une lettre en date du 17 mai 1951, dans aucune pi\u00e8ce de correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre les parties peut-on apercevoir une intention de l'appelante d'annuler ces contrats. Dans cette lettre du 17 mai 1951, soit un mois avant l'action, l'appelante, par son pr\u00e9sident, remercie P\u00e9loquin de ses services, lui inclut un ch\u00e8que au montant de 100 dollars repr\u00e9sentant ses honoraires pour le mois de mai et termine en disant: \"Il nous reste maintenant \u00e0 tirer au clair la question des royaut\u00e9s sur les machines Blanchett qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fabriqu\u00e9es \u00e0 venir jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant\". Il est inconcevable que si vraiment l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de d\u00e9ception et qu'eut-elle connu l'existence de la convention Blanchett et P\u00e9loquin elle aurait refus\u00e9 de n\u00e9gocier et signer les contrats attaqu\u00e9s, elle ait, l'ayant appris, retenu et gard\u00e9 \u00e0 son emploi les deux auteurs de cette fraude \u00e0 moins de se r\u00e9signer \u00e0 confirmer ces contrats. Enfin, dans une lettre adress\u00e9e, le 10 mai 1949, \u00e0 une compagnie de Paris, en vue de lui accorder une franchise pour la vente de la machine en territoire europ\u00e9en et celui des colonies fran\u00e7aises, l'appelante, par son pr\u00e9sident, s'oblige, avec l'approbation de ses \"associ\u00e9s P\u00e9loquin et Blanchett\", \u00e0 n'accorder aucune franchise pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois de la date de la lettre.\nTous ces faits sont plus que suffisants pour justifier la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel sur le point.\nJe rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nKellock J.:\u2014I am unable to say that, in concluding, upon all the evidence, that the appellant had elected to affirm the contract on discovering the relationship subsisting between the respondents at the time of its negotiation, the Court of Appeal was wrong. I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Foster, Hannen, Watt, Leggat & Colby, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: E.

The trial judge told the jury that they were entitled to consider this evidence in determining whether or not the accused had been guilty of criminal negligence.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The evidence was properly admitted and there was no misdirection. It was open to the jury, in the circumstances of the case, to draw an inference from the subsequent conduct of the accused as to his wantonness and reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons at the time of and immediately before the accident. The whole conduct was part of the res gestae.\nGudmondson v. The King (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332, distinguished.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: Criminal negligence, as defined by s. 191 of the Criminal Code, must be shown to have existed prior to or at the instant of the accused\u2019s car striking the other car, and although the fact that the driver fled from the scene was a relevant item of circumstantial evidence, it was essential that it be made plain to the jury that his conduct after the accident was relevant only in so far as it assisted them to determine by inference the nature of his conduct before it, and whether or not he had, before the impact, been driving with wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others. Without such a warning (which was not given) there was grave danger of their convicting because in their opinion the accused had acted with that disregard after the impact.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming his conviction, before Ferguson J. and a jury, of causing the death of one Lawrence Vipond by criminal negligence. Appeal dismissed. J.G.J. O\u2019Driscoll and Patrick Galligan, for the appellant.\nW.B. Common, Q.C., for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This appeal should be dismissed. As to the second ground of appeal, I agree with the reasons of Mr. Justice Kellock and merely add that, in addition to the references by him to the charge of the trial judge, it might be pointed out that the latter, at several earlier stages, had referred to the fact that \u201cthis is a hit-and-run case\u201d\u2014and necessarily so, since one of the main matters in dispute was as to the identification of the driver of the automobile. The subsequent conduct of the driver relied upon by the Crown occurred immediately after the impact and could be treated as part of the res gestae as accompanying those earlier acts as to which it was contended that the driver had been criminally negligent in doing, or omitting to do, anything which it was his duty to do, showing wanton, or reckless, disregard for the lives or safety of other persons. Unquestionably no appreciable time elapsed between the automobile striking Vipond and the skidding, swerving and picking up speed.\nThe first point upon which leave to appeal was granted is:\nWas the verbal statement attributed to the appellant by the investigating police officer improperly admitted in evidence?\nWhether or not one considers that at the time of the making of this statement the appellant was under arrest on any charge, the rule laid down by this Court in Boudreau v. The King[1], was not infringed. Although the evidence as to this verbal statement was given before the voir dire, and the trial judge was apparently of the view that it should not have been so given, at that time, and although he ruled against the admissibility of a subsequent written statement, there is nothing, considering all the circumstances, to take the case out of the rule so established.\nThe judgment of Kellock, Locke and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014When the sequence of events is properly understood, I do not think the ruling of the learned trial judge, confirmed, as it was, by the Court of Appeal, as to the admissibility of the oral statement of the appellant to the police officer, can be questioned.\nWith regard to the second ground of appeal, it is contended that there was misdirection on the part of the learned trial judge in instructing the jury that in determining the issue as to criminal negligence, they were entitled to take into consideration the conduct of the appellant in leaving the scene after the accident.\nThe evidence was that of two witnesses, who testified as to seeing the appellant\u2019s car immediately after the accident, one of them stating that \u201cit skidded and swerved up the street; as soon as it got under its right control it picked up speed\u201d and disappeared. The learned trial judge instructed the jury:\nThis, you see, is a hit-and-run case and you have to consider that in considering whether this was a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other people. Is the conduct of the person who hit Vipond consistent with anything but a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other people?\nAnd again:\nAsk yourselves, how could he have failed to see this car; how did he get over in front of the door? You will ask yourselves about these questions. If he had any regard for the life and safety of people on the street would he not have stopped after he came in collision with this door? It is for you to say. In order to convict him you must be able to say that he showed a reckless and wanton disregard for the lives and safety of other people.\nIn my opinion, evidence of the conduct of an accused person immediately after an accident, if of such a nature that it may reasonably be thought sufficient, if believed, to warrant an inference upon the issue of criminal negligence, may be properly received in evidence. The appellant\u2019s subsequent conduct was, therefore, a proper consideration for the jury in the case at bar.\nCounsel for the appellant referred to the decision of this Court in Gudmondson v. The King[2], as supporting a contrary view. In that case there was evidence on behalf of the Crown that the car which had struck the deceased kept on going after the accident and in order to get away, drove around another car which had been stopped in the middle of the highway in an effort to bring it to a stop. In addition, there was evidence on behalf of the accused that his conduct in not stopping was due to panic and that in any event, his brakes were gone and he could not a bring the car to a stop. The learned trial judge had charged the jury that the conduct of the accused after the accident was relevant on the issue of criminal negligence from the standpoint of \u201csimilar facts\u201d and had told them: \u201cThere is no doubt he fails by hitting and running away in this case. As far as I am concerned I will tell you that has been established by the evidence.\u201d[3] It was in these circumstances that this Court said, at p. 333:\nHaving said what he did upon this matter, he ought at least to have added a warning to the jury that such conduct, however reprehensible, could have no more than an indirect bearing upon the issue before them. He had already virtually withdrawn from them the charge of intoxication; but, in view of his other observations, he should have told them that they ought to be very cautious in imputing to the accused a consciousness of guilt, because of actions which, on reflection, they might think capable of explanation as due to panic.\nIn the case at bar there was no evidence with regard to the conduct of the appellant after the accident apart from that to which I have already referred. In my view, therefore, what the learned trial judge said to the jury was not objectionable from the standpoint which this Court considered objectionable in the case to which I have referred and, in my opinion, it was open to the jury in the circumstances of this case to draw an inference from the subsequent conduct of the appellant as to the wantonness and reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons at the time of and immediately prior to the accident here in question. The whole conduct was part of the res gestae.\nI do not think the charge is open to the construction that the jury were told they could draw from the mere fact that the appellant ran away from the scene of the accident, the inference that his driving at the time of the accident amounted to criminal negligence. The learned judge had already instructed the jury with considerable care as to the elements of negligence of that character.\nI would dismiss the appeal. CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014-The appellant was tried at the assizes at Brantford before Ferguson J. and a jury and, on January 16, 1956, was convicted on the charge that at the town of Paris, on November 12, 1955, he did by criminal negligence cause the death of Lawrence Vipond, contrary to s. 192 of the Criminal Code. On April 9, 1956, the Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously dismissed his appeal.\nOn April 24, 1956, Abbott J. granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law:\n1. Was the verbal statement attributed to the appellant by the investigating police officer improperly admitted in evidence?\n2. Did the learned Trial Judge misdirect the jury when he instructed them that in determining whether or not the appellant was guilty of criminal negligence they were entitled to take into consideration his subsequent conduct, namely, leaving the scene of the accident?\nAs in my opinion there should be a new trial I will refer to the evidence only so far as may be necessary to make clear the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nAt about 11.20 p.m. on November 12, 1955 Lawrence Vipond and a Miss Pfeiffer were standing on Dundas Street in the town of Paris on the south or right-hand side of an automobile which was parked facing easterly on the north side of the street. The right\u2011hand door of this automobile was open. A motor vehicle driven westerly struck the open door and the right rear fender of the stationary automobile with considerable violence. Vipond suffered injuries from which he died shortly afterwards. Miss Pfeiffer was seriously injured and was found 14 feet west of the stationary automobile. The motor vehicle which struck Vipond did not stop and none of the witnesses could identify its driver or say whether it was driven by a man or a woman.\nThe theory of the Crown was that the appellant was the driver of the motor vehicle which struck the deceased. There was circumstantial evidence to support this theory and the Crown also relied on an oral statement said to have been made by the appellant to a police officer after he had been arrested on a charge of vagrancy on the day following the fatality. It is to the admissibility of this oral statement that the first question is directed. I do not find it necessary to answer this question. Unfortunately the statement in question was given in evidence by the police officer in the presence of the jury without any preliminary enquiry or ruling as to its admissibility. The learned trial judge appears to have been at first inclined to the view that the statement was inadmissible and that a mistrial would result; but as he did not discharge the jury and in his charge invited them to consider the statement, it must be taken that at the conclusion of the evidence he had decided that it was admissible, although he ruled against the admissibility of the written statement said to have been made by the appellant immediately afterwards. It will be for the judge presiding at the new trial to decide the question of admissibility upon the evidence then given as to the circumstances in which the statement was made.\nTurning to the second question, it was, of course, incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the appellant was the driver of the car which struck Vipond but also that he was criminally negligent in driving it. In dealing with this question I will assume that the jury found that the appellant was the driver of the car.\nCriminal negligence is defined in s. 191 of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:\n191. (1) Every one is criminally negligent who\n(a) in doing anything, or\n(b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\n(2) For the purposes of this section, \u201cduty\u201d means a duty imposed by law.\nThe appellant while driving was under a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid injuring any persons on the highway; but, in view of the definition quoted, he could be found guilty only if the jury were satisfied not merely that he failed to perform this duty but also that his failure showed wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others. Such wanton or reckless disregard must be shown to have existed prior to or at the instant of the car striking Vipond. Counsel for the respondent argues that the jury were entitled to infer the existence of such disregard from the facts that it was a clear night, that the parking lights of the stationary car were on, that it was parked between two street lights, that there was nothing to prevent the driver of the car which struck Vipond from seeing the stationary car, that the impact was violent, and that the driver fled from the scene. I agree that all of these were relevant items of circumstantial evidence. But, in my opinion, it was of vital importance that the jury should be carefully instructed that they must consider the fact of flight only for the purpose of reaching a decision as to the manner in which the driver was driving up to the instant of the impact, and particularly as to whether up to that instant he was driving with wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons. Without such a warning there would be a grave danger of the jury convicting the appellant because in their opinion he had immediately after the impact acted with such wanton or reckless disregard. In other words, it was essential that it be made plain to the jury that the conduct of the accused subsequent to the impact was relevant only in so far as it assisted them to determine by inference the nature of his conduct prior to the impact.\nFar from giving any such direction the learned trial judge used words which the jury may well have understood, and which, in my opinion, they would have understood, to mean that they might convict the appellant if satisfied that he had immediately after the impact acted with a reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others. I refer to the following passage in the charge of the learned trial judge, and particularly to the sentences which I have italicized:\nIf you decide it was negligence, was it the kind of negligence I described? that is, was it criminal? This, you see, is a hit-and-run case and you have to consider that in considering whether this was a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other people. Is the conduct of the person who hit Vipond consistent with anything but a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other people? The car had crossed the bridge; there was not very much traffic on Dundas Street; the street lights were on; the driving conditions, as you have heard, were good; this is a fairly wide street; yet whoever drove this car crashed into the door of Kennedy\u2019s car and crushed these two young people. Miss Verna Farr said they flew through the air, and Miss Pfeiffer was found fourteen feet beyond the rear of Kennedy\u2019s car, and Vipond was found with his feet sort of underneath the rear wheel. The car skidded, according to Miss Farr, and then speeded up when it righted and after swerving, passed on. You will ask yourselves how could a driver driving under those conditions with the car parked between these two lights\u2014someone gave the exact distance the car was from the easterly light, and as you can see there is seventy-six feet from Burwell Street to the first light, and then there is some distance from the first light to the car\u2014so that whoever passed Burwell Street and crossed this corner had, as I recall it, some ninety feet before he would come to this door. Ask yourselves, how could he have failed to see this car; how did he get over in front of the door? You will ask yourselves about those questions. If he had any regard for the life and safety of people on the street would he not have stopped after he came into collision with this door? It is for you to say. In order to convict him you must be able to say that he showed a reckless and wanton disregard for the lives and safety of other people.\nI am unable to find anything elsewhere in the charge of the learned trial judge which would make it clear to the jury that they must not convict unless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was driving prior to or at the moment of impact with a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\nIn considering the likelihood of the jury having been misled it is well to bear in mind the natural tendency towards a feeling of indignation at the conduct of a person who, having struck another down, leaves him lying on the roadway and flees from the scene. That Parliament takes a stern view of such conduct is evidenced by the penalty prescribed by s. 221 (2) of the Criminal Code; but the appellant was not on trial for an offence against that section.\nIn my opinion the second question on which leave to appeal was granted should be answered in the affirmative.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Edmonds, Maloney & Edmonds, Toronto.\n[1] [1949] S.C.R. 262, 94 C.C.C. 1, 7 C.R. 427, [1949] 3 D.L.R. 81.\n[2] (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332.\n[3] 41 Man.

Bagwell (Suppliants) Appellants;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Respondent) Respondent.\n1956: October 16, 17, 18, 19; 1956: December 21.\nPresent: Rand, Locke, Cartwright, Abbott and Nolan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCompensation\u2014Injurious affection of land\u2014Regulations governing height of buildings and use of land in vicinity of airport\u2014Effect of subsequent repeal of part\u2014The Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1937, c. 3, s. 4, as amended by 1950, c. 23, s. 3, and 1952, c. 14, s. 1.\nBy s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act, 1927, as amended, power was given to make regulations with respect to, inter alia, \"the height, use and location of buildings \u2026 situated on lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of airports\", and subs. (8) of the section provided for compensation to anyone \"whose property is injuriously affected by the operation of a zoning regulation\". The Toronto Malton Airport Zoning Regulations were made pursuant to this section in 1953, and they prescribed, in s. 4(1), the maximum height of buildings within specified distances of the airport. They further provided in s. 4(2) that if any building exceeded the stated limits the Minister might require the owner to remove, demolish or modify it, and s. 5 prohibited the operation of \"any machine, device, contrivance or thing\" likely to cause \"a hazard or obstruction to aircraft using the airport\". In 1955, ss. 4(2) and 5 of these Regulations were revoked.\nHeld: (1) Lands could be \"injuriously affected by the operation\" of the Regulations notwithstanding that no order for demolition or modification had in fact been made by the Minister. Vertical regulation was necessary in the vicinity of airports and the vesting of the powers mentioned operated with an immediate effect on the use and value of the land. It became at once a burden on the land and the resulting diminution in value was a proper subject of compensation.\n(2) The revocation of ss. 4(2) and 5 in 1955 did not affect the amount of compensation to which owners of lands affected were entitled. The Regulations should be considered as a whole, and the Court should not attempt to determine the extent of the loss produced by one particular section, such as s. 5. It would be impossible to distribute the diminution in value among different individual sections. It was quite clear that the subsequent revocation of a regulation could not give rise to a claim against the owner for the return of any part of a compensation already paid, and that result could not be in effect reversed by withholding compensation until after the particular burden had been removed.\n(3) Evidence of sales in the vicinity of the lands in question, made after the enactment of the Regulations, might have been admissible as relevant to the value prior to the enactment. If a subsequent sale was shown to be as free in all respects from extraneous factors such as prior sales, and made within a time in which, according to the evidence, prices had not changed materially from those before the critical date, it was a relevant consideration. The rule should allow the Court to admit evidence of such sales as it found, in place, time and circumstances, to foe logically probative of the fact to be found. In the circumstances of this case, however, the exclusion of such evidence did not affect the result.\nTown planning\u2014Effect of adoption of official plan and subdivision by-law \u2014Subsequent annexation of municipality by another\u2014Whether subdivision by-law abrogated\u2014The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 277, s. 24(3)\u2014The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, s. 31.\nWhen a municipality having a subdivision by-law is annexed by another municipality, having no such by-law, it is extremely doubtful whether s. 31 of The Municipal Act has the effect of abrogating the by-law. By s. 24(3) of The Planning Act a subdivision can be altered or dissolved only with the approval of the Minister, and therefore a by-law establishing a subdivision cannot be repealed by the council that passed it. The by-laws contemplated by s. 31 are primarily of legislative character, applicable throughout the whole municipality, whereas zoning is essentially administrative, and not a matter of general legislation so applicable. An official plan, under the Act, is not limited to a single municipality, but may cover several or parts of several, and it would defeat the purpose in view if a realignment of township boundaries were to effect a disruption of planned development.\nAPPEAL by the suppliants from a judgment of Thorson P., of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1. Appeal dismissed.\nA. S. Pattillo, Q.C., A. F. Rodger and J. F. Howard, for the appellants.\nW. B. Williston, Q.C., and D. S. Maxwell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nNolan J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada 2 awarding the appellants the sum of $40,000 as compensation for the decrease in value of their lands which were injuriously affected by the enactment of the Toronto Malton Airport Zoning Regulations.\nThe Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 3, as amended by 1950, c. 23, s. 3, and 1952, c. 14, s. 1 (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 2), authorized the Minister, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, to make regulations for the control of air navigation over Canada and provided, in part:\n4. (1) Subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, the Minister may make regulations to control and regulate air navigation over Canada and the territorial waters of Canada and the conditions under which aircraft registered in Canada may be operated over the high seas or any territory not within Canada, and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may make regulations with respect to \u2026\n(j) the height, use and location of buildings, structures and objects, including objects of natural growth, situated on lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of airports, for purposes relating to navigation of aircraft and use and operation of airports, and including, for such purposes, regulations restricting, regulating or prohibiting the doing of anything or the suffering of anything to be done on any such lands, or the construction or use of any such building, structure or object.\n(2) Any regulation made under subsection one may authorize the Minister to make orders or directions with respect to such matters coming within this section as the regulations may prescribe.\nSubsections (3) and (4) of s. 4 provided penalties for the violation of the provisions of a regulation or of the order of the Minister made under a regulation. Subsections (5), (6) and (7) dealt with the publication and registration of the Regulations.\nSubsection (8) provided:\n(8) Every person whose property is injuriously affected by the operation of a zoning regulation is entitled to recover from Her Majesty, as compensation, the amount, if any, by which the property was decreased in value by the enactment of the regulation, minus an amount equal to any increase in the value of the property that occurred after the claimant became the owner thereof and is attributable to the airport.\nSubsection (9) limited the time for the recovery of compensation to two years after a copy of the Regulations was deposited pursuant to subs. (6) or (7).\nRegulations under this authorization were approved by the Governor General in Council on April 9, 1953 3 and a copy was deposited in the Registry Office for the County of Peel on June 1, 1953, together with a plan and description of the lands affected by the Regulations. A copy was published in the Toronto Daily Star on July 13 and July 14, 1953, and in The Globe and Mail on July 11 and July 13, 1953.\nThe Regulations provided, in part:\n4. (1) No person shall erect or construct, on any land to which these regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which exceeds in elevation the elevation at that point of such of the surfaces hereinafter described as projects immediately over and above the surface of the land upon which such building, structure or object is located, namely,\n(a) a horizontal surface, the outer limits of which are at a horizontal radius of 13,000 feet more or less; (b) the approach surfaces abutting each end of the strip designated as 10-28, the strip designated as 14-32 and the strip designated as 05-23, and extending outward therefrom, the dimensions of which approach surfaces are 600 feet on each side of the centre line of the strip at the strip ends and 2,000 feet on each side of the projected centre line of the strip at the outer ends, the said outer ends being 200 feet above the elevations at the strip ends, and measured horizontally, 10,000 feet from the strip ends; and\n(c) the, several transitional surfaces, each rising at an angle determined on the basis of a ratio of one foot vertically for every seven feet measured horizontally from the outer lateral limits of the strips and their abutting surfaces,\nas shown on a Plan No. T724 dated December 17, 1952, and revised February 20, 1953, of record in the Department of Transport.\n(2) Where any building, structure or object on any land to which these regulations apply exceeds the limits in elevation specified in subsection (1), the Minister may order the owner or occupier of the land to remove, demolish or modify such building, structure or object or do any act or thing necessary to ensure that such building, structure or object complies with the limits in elevation so specified and may, in any such order, specify the time within which such removal, demolition, modification, act or thing shall be done.\n5. No person shall operate or cause to be operated on any lands to which these regulations apply any machine, device, contrivance or thing after being notified by the Minister that, in the opinion of the Minister, the machine, device, contrivance or thing causes or is likely to cause, by the emission of light, smoke, noise or fumes, a hazard or obstruction to aircraft using the airport.\nBy order in council P.C. 1955-1302, dated September 1, 1955 4, the Regulations were amended by revoking subs. (2) of s. 4 and s. 5, and a copy of the order in council was deposited in the registry office on September 29, 1955. In order to remove any doubt as to the effectiveness of this amendment, a further order in council, P.C. 1955-1580, dated October 19, 1955 5, was passed and deposited in the registry office on November 4, 1955.\nThe lands of the appellants consist of 100.09 acres of vacant property and form part of the north half of lot 8, 7th concession, of the township of Toronto (formerly Toronto Gore), county of Peel. They lie immediately east of Malt-on Airport and in the direct path of the east-west runway. The property has a frontage of 755 feet on the 6th line (known as the Airport Road), a depth of 4,460 feet, a rear frontage of about 807 feet on the unopened 7th line and a railway frontage of approximately 302 feet on the Canadian National Railway line, which crosses the north-east corner of the property. On March 26, 1951, one Harry R. Walker, the owner of the lands, in consideration of the payment of $600, granted to Alan R. Campbell an option until October 1, 1951, to purchase at a price of $400 per acre. On August 28, 1951, Campbell assigned the option to the appellant Roberts for a consideration of $600. The option, in consideration of a payment of $200, was extended to November 1, 1951, and was exercised by Roberts on October 29, 1951. By deed registered on November 30, 1951 Walker conveyed the lands to the appellants, who hold their interest in common in trust for certain others, the particulars of the trusteeship being set out in a deed of trust dated January 21, 1952. On November 28, 1951 the appellants entered into an agreement with Walker, who owned and operated a farm on the south half of lot 8, for the construction of a roadway between the two properties, which agreement was registered on November 30, 1951.\nThe lands were subject to two easements: one in favour of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario to erect and maintain three poles across the north-east corner of the lands, about 150 feet from and parallel to the railway line; the other in favour of Her Majesty the Queen to erect and maintain eight approach light poles, a minimum distance of 200 feet apart, in a line running eastward from the west boundary of the lands. The easement is 15 feet wide and 2,398.67 feet deep. '\nThe evidence is that Roberts wanted to purchase the lands for development, subdivision and resale for industrial and commercial use and, before exercising his option, in order that he might be certain that the land could be so used, engaged a surveyor, W. S. Winters, to prepare a plan of a proposed subdivision, and approval of the Department of Planning and Development was sought.\nOn October 24, 1951, the Department wrote to Winters that the draft plan of the subdivision had been approved, subject to certain conditions and amendments noted thereon. One of the conditions was: \"1. That the owner observe the height restrictions shown on the attached draft plan.\" The maximum building height restrictions endorsed on the draft plan began at 19 feet, approximately 50 feet from the Airport Road frontage, and increased to 34 feet at approximately 725 feet from the front of the property. The option was exercised after receiving the conditional approval of the plan and the condition quoted does not appear to have been objected to by the appellants.\nThe proposed plan of subdivision was not registered and in 1952 and 1953 the lands were leased to Walker for farming purposes.\nSubsequently the appellants furnished one Lyons, a real estate agent, with a copy of the proposed plan and attempted, unsuccessfully, to sell the lands through him. In May 1952 the appellants listed the property for sale with Willoughby & Sons for a period of 60 days at a price of $110,000 and in April 1953 they again listed the lands for sale with Shortill & Hodgkins Limited for a period of 30 days at a price of $150,000. No offers to purchase were made.\nOn February 26, 1954, the appellants entered into an agreement with one Oliver to sell a portion of the lands 500 feet wide and 700 feet deep at a price of $40,000. A deposit of $1,000 was made and, although the transaction was not completed at the time of trial, the deposit had not been returned.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court, in his reasons for judgment, reviewed with great particularity the opinions both of the expert witnesses called by the appellants and of those called by the respondent to establish the value of the injuriously affected lands, together with the other evidence of value introduced by the parties. The learned President came to the conclusion that the valuations of the appellants' expert witnesses must be rejected as being much too high. He concluded that the valuation of $95,500 submitted by Mr. Davis, a witness for the respondent, while high, came nearest to reality and he adopted it as the value of the property immediately prior to the enactment of the Regulations on April 9, 1953, and was of the opinion that the sum of $95,500 was adequate to cover every factor of value to the owners as at that date.\nThe President further held that there was no evidence to support a finding that any increase in the value of the appellants' property after its acquisition by the appellants on October 29, 1951, was attributable to the airport and that the revocation of subs. (2) of s. 4 and s. 5 of the Regulations, by order in council dated September 1, 1955, did not reduce the amount by which the lands had been decreased in value by the enactment of the Regulations. He further held that the term \"zoning regulation\" in s. 4(8) of the Aeronautics Act should be interpreted as meaning the Toronto Malton Airport Zoning Regulations in their entirety and that the section did not contemplate separate effects of the several sections of the \"zoning regulation\" referred to.\nAt trial there was conflict in the evidence adduced by the appellants and by the respondent as to whether the lands were ready for development and the valuations of the experts called on behalf of the appellants were, to a large extent, based on the assumption that they were ready immediately prior to April 9, 1953.\nIt appears from the evidence that the water supply, having regard to the demands upon it, was perilously close to inadequacy. The maximum capacity of the system was 1,250,000 gallons a day Of this the A. V. Roe company required 1,000,000 gallons, Malton Subdivisions Limited a maximum of 125,000 gallons a day and the construction of water-mains in the village of Malton was under contemplation. Some additional water had been promised to one Levinter. There was evidence that the capacity of the water-main could be increased by further pumping facilities involving a large expenditure of money, but that immediately prior to the enactment of the Regulations no additional pumping stations had been installed and consequently water was not then available for use by developers of the property.\nA great deal of evidence was adduced at trial as to whether or not a sewage system was available, which was a matter of importance because, without sewage facilities, the appellants could not sell their land by lots for industrial and commercial use. In the latter part of 1953 work had been begun by Malton Subdivisions Limited on a sewage-disposal plant sufficient to serve 3,000 people in the subdivision where approximately 2,400 people were expected to reside. When a large parcel of the land owned by Malton Subdivisions Limited was expropriated in February 1954, work on the sewage-disposal plant stopped and there was no evidence to show that the appellants would have the right to connect their lands with this sewage-disposal plant even if it were completed.\nOn the whole of the evidence I agree with the conclusion ' of the learned President that the lands were not ready for development immediately prior to April 9, 1953, and would only become so gradually and when sewer and water facilities were available.\nMoreover, as has been pointed out, the lands in question were situate at the end of a runway and land in such a position and underneath a flightway would be less desirable if other land were available. In addition, the A. V. Roe plant was situated nearby and one major industry had moved from the area because of difficulty in competing in the labour market with A. V. Roe because that company paid substantially higher wages than those paid in other industries. There was some evidence that the financial position of the Township of Toronto would be a discouragement to subdividers.\nI have examined the evidence of the sales of other properties in the area prior to the enactment of the Regulations. This evidence discloses that there were five sales in 1951, the price per acre varying between $500 and $700. There were no sales of lots in concession 7 in 1952 or prior to April 9 in 1953. There was a sale of part of lot 7 in concession 8 on February 18, 1953, from one Levinter to Malton Subdivisions Limited, but this property was purchased for the purpose of building a sewage-disposal plant for a subdivision then being developed and was the sale of property in a particular place and for a particular purpose. In Etobicoke Township, which lies immediately west of Toronto Township, there were four sales in 1952.\nIn 1953 there were eight sales, five of which were to the Ontario Jockey Club. I am of the opinion that these sales are not a safe guide to the value of the lands in question, as it seems to have been common knowledge that the Ontario Jockey Club was buying land in the area for the purpose of building a race-track and it appears plain that the prices it paid were above the market price and are not indicative of the value of the lands of the appellants. With regard to the value of the lands after the enactment of the Regulations, the learned President rejected the opinion of the experts for the appellants that they had no value other than for agricultural purposes and were only worth, in the opinion of the witness Bosley, $10,000, and, in the opinion of the witness Stewart, $20,000. The evidence discloses that within the area affected by the Regulations some sales were made for speculation or development and, while the effect of the enactment of the Regulations was to postpone the development of the lands, it did not preclude long-term speculative possibilities and the lands were more valuable than farm land. With regard to the decrease in value, the learned President found that the frontage on the Airport Road, for a distance back of about 400 feet, being approximately 4 acres, with a potential use for a service-station, or motel, or some similar use, had a value of not less than $26,000. He then placed a value on 14 acres up to a height restriction of 35 feet at $200 an acre, making a total of $2,800 for this acreage. The remaining 82 acres he valued at $350 an acre, or $28,000, bringing the total value of all the lands to $57,500. He then came to the conclusion that the decrease in value of the appellants' property could be fairly fixed at $40,000.\nThe appellants, in proof of the value of the lands prior to the enactment of the Regulations, tendered evidence of sales in the vicinity of those affected after that date, but such evidence was excluded. The Crown was subsequently permitted to adduce similar sales as evidence to refute the statements of the appellants' witnesses as to diminution of value resulting from the Regulations. If sales made after the enactment were totally excluded, obviously there could be no evidence whatever of sales affected by the Regulations in the Malton area and apparently there was no other airport area which afforded such instances.\nIn my view, evidence of a sale after the enactment can, in the absence of special circumstances, be relevant to the value prior to the enactment. The sale must be shown to be as free in all respects from extraneous factors such as prior sales and made within such time as the evidence shows prices not to have changed materially from those before the critical date. In other words, the mere circumstance of the sale being before or after a particular date cannot nullify the relevance of subsequent sales while the general market conditions have remained the same. The rule should allow the Court to admit evidence of such sales as it finds, in place, time and circumstances, to be logically probative of the fact to be found. In my respectful view, however, the exclusion of the evidence in this case as evidence of value based upon the element of time alone, while techncially erroneous, did not materially affect the finding of the learned President as to compensation to which the appellants should be held to be entitled.\nAs has been pointed out, subs. (2) of s. 4 and s. 5 were revoked by order in council P.C. 1955-1302 dated September 1, 1955. These Regulations provided:\n4. (2) Where any building, structure or object on any land to which these regulations apply exceeds the limits in elevation specified in subsection (1), the Minister may order the owner or occupier of the land to remove, demolish or modify such building, structure or object or do any act or thing necessary to ensure that such building, structure or object complies with the limits in elevation so specified and may, in any such order, specify the time within which such removal, demolition, modification, act or thing shall be done.\n5. No person shall operate or cause to be operated on any lands to which these regulations apply any machine, device, contrivance or thing after being notified by the Minister that, in the opinion of the Minister, the machine, device, contrivance or thing causes or is likely to cause, by the emission of light, smoke., noise or fumes, a hazard or obstruction to aircraft using the airport.\nTwo questions present themselves for determination in connection with the two Regulations. In the first place, the appellants contend that they are entitled to compensation for the diminution in value due to the effect of these revoked Regulations.\nIt was argued by counsel for the Crown that, until an order was actually made by the Minister, the property could not be said to have been \"injuriously affected\". Under s. 23 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106, injurious affection can result only from some positive act by the Crown, but that is because of the language contained in the section itself, which provides that the injurious affection must be caused by the \"construction\" of a public work. Under s. 4(8) of the Aeronautics Act, 1927, as amended, compensation is to be awarded to every person whose property is injuriously affected \"by the operation of a zoning regulation\". The question arises whether there can be injurious affection giving rise to a claim for compensation when no order has actually been made by the Minister. If this question were answered in the negative, the Minister, by forbearing to make an order within two years, could effectually deprive an owner of compensation for what might render his land almost valueless. The purpose of the statute is clear. Vertical regulation is necessary in the vicinity of airports and the vesting of the powers mentioned operates with an immediate effect on the use and value of the land. It becomes at once a burden on the land and the resulting diminution in value is a proper subject for compensation.\nThe second question for consideration is, what is the effect of the revocation of the two Regulations in 1955 on the compensation?\nIn determining the extent of loss in value due to the Regulations, in my view, the Regulations as a whole should be considered, and not the extent of loss produced by one particular section such as s. 5, and it would be impossible to attempt to distribute the diminution in value among individual Regulations. It is quite clear that the subsequent revocation of the Regulation could not give rise to a claim against the owner for a return of any part of compensation already paid and that result cannot, in effect, be reversed by withholding compensation until after the particular burden has been removed. In any event, the revocation did not affect the quantum of the award of compensation in the present case, as the learned President states specifically that the revocation of ss. 4(2) and 5 was not taken into account in making the award.\nSection 4(8) of the Aeronautics Act, 1927, provides that every person whose property is injuriously affected by the operation of a zoning regulation is entitled to recover from Her Majesty, as compensation, the amount, if any, by which the property was decreased in value by the enactment of the regulation, \"minus an amount equal to any increase in the value of the property that occurred after the claimant became the owner thereof and is attributable to the airport\". \u00cf agree with the learned President that there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that there has been an increase in the value of the property which is attributable to the airport. A cross-appeal was made by the Crown\" against the award on the ground, to put it shortly, that at the time of the enactment of the restrictive Regulation there was already, on a portion of the land, a provincial height limitation which, on the evidence, reduced the value of the whole radically and to little more than was paid for it. This contention makes it necessary to go into the facts in some detail.\nUnder The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 277 (now 1955, c. 61), provision is made for the formulation of what is called an \"official plan\" of an area in any municipality or municipalities. Its purpose is to exhibit a programme of development, in the language of the definition, \"designed to secure the health, safety, convenience or welfare of the inhabitants of the area\". The \"development\" of an area means its settlement, utilization and growth in all features and aspects of urban and suburban life. When a planning area has been defined by the Minister, a planning board is appointed by the council of the municipalitiy, or, in the case of two or more municipalities, that one designated by the Minister. The planning board thereupon applies itself to an investigation and a survey of the physical, social and economic conditions pertinent to the development; it prepares maps, statistical information and other material necessary for the \"study, explanation and solution\" of the problems presenting themselves, holds public meetings, draws up a plan and recommends it to the council for adoption. Upon adoption the plan is submitted to the Minister, and upon his approval it becomes the official plan of the planning area.\nThe plan necessarily deals broadly and somewhat generally with features of the development, such as the designation of industrial, commercial and residential sectors, and other prescriptions of the mode and character of use to which the area may be put. From time to time the planning board may recommend to the council the implementation of any of these features of the plan.\nWhen an official plan comes into effect no public work shall be undertaken and, except for a qualification which is not material here, no by-law shall be passed by the council for any purpose that does not conform with it. The effect of this is that wherever a by-law is required to enable private action to be taken, it must conform with the plan, but where a by-law is unnecessary, and in the absence of action by the Minister, who is authorized by s. 25 to exercise any of the powers conferred on councils by s. 390 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, the scope of action, so it is argued by the appellants, is at large.\nHere an official plan for the township of Toronto Gore was approved by the Minister on March 5, 1951, and in an appendix to the map and as part of the plan it was stipulated as Item B. 1:\nSpecial height regulations are shown on the plan of the Department of Transport for one flightway and may be extended to others if required by the Department of Transport. These will apply to all structures. A maximum height limitation will be imposed on the whole urban area of 40 feet, to be measured from the present ground level to the highest point of the roof, not only as a flight safety factor, but also as a means of reducing the ultimate cost of fire fighting equipment.\nAlthough the maximum height limitation \"will be imposed on the whole urban area\", it would seem that this is a specific feature of the plan and that it is as effective as if it were embodied in a by-law of the council or an order of the Minister.\nThere is next the matter of the subdivision of property. By s. 24 of The Planning Act, supra, the council may, by by-law, designate any area within the municipality as an area of subdivision control and thereafter no agreement to sell land and no conveyance of land can be made otherwise than by describing the land in accordance with a registered plan of subdivision. To this there are three exceptions: (a) where the land to be sold or conveyed is more than 10 acres in area; (b) where it is the whole part then remaining to the owner of one parcel described in a registered conveyance to him; or (c) where the consent of the planning board or the Minister is obtained.\nThe lands in question were formerly part of the township of Toronto Gore which, on the west, adjoined the township of Toronto. By a by-law of the Township of Toronto Gore dated November 15, 1948, the whole of the township was, under the provisions of the Act then in force, declared an urban development area. Prior to that, on August 4, 1948, a by-law of the Township of Toronto made a similar declaration, but described the area by a specification of lots. By an amendment made to the Act in 1949, where a council had so designated such an area and the by-law was in force on March 9, 1949, the area was to be deemed to be one of subdivision control. By virtue of that enactment the land in question became part of a subdivision area.\nBy an order of the Ontario Municipal Board of June 18, 1951, effective June 30, 1951, the southerly portion of the township of Toronto Gore, embracing the area designated urban on the official plan and including the land in question, was annexed to the township of Toronto. By s. 31 of The Municipal Act, supra:\nWhere a district or a municipality is annexed to a municipality, its by-laws shall extend to such district or annexed municipality, and the by-laws in force therein shall cease to apply to it, except those relating to highways, which shall remain in force until repealed by the council of the municipality to which the district or municipality is annexed, and except by-laws conferring rights, privileges, franchises, immunities or exemptions which could not have been lawfully repealed by the council which passed them.\nCounsel for the appellants argued that the effect of that section was to nullify the by-law of the Township of Toronto Gore of November 15, 1948, and, as the by-law of the Township of Toronto of August 4, 1948, was specific and limited to the lots described, there was no by-law regulating the subdivision of the land in question from and after June 30, 1951. At the same time it was contended that the official plan created no restriction until implemented by by-law or order of which there was none.\nWhether a subdivision by-law can be said to come within s. 31 of The Municipal! Act, supra, is extremely doubtful. By s. 24(3) of The Planning Act, supra, a subdivision can be altered or dissolved only with the approval of the Minister: a by-law establishing a subdivision cannot, therefore, be repealed by the council which passed it. The bylaws contemplated by the section are primarily of legislative character which as general laws can apply throughout the municipality. But zoning is not a matter of general legislation in that sense; it is essentially administrative; it may be limited to a small portion of the township; there might be several areas so declared within a township with different features and it could not be said that any one or which of them extended to the annexed area. An official plan is not bound by the limits of one municipality; it may cover several or parts of several; and it would defeat the purpose in view if realignment of town-ship boundaries were to effect a disruption of a planned development. Under s. 14 a by-law that conforms with an official plan, and whether passed before or after the plan, is to be deemed to implement the plan. This means that the official plan of March 5, 1951, was implemented by the by-law of the Township of Toronto Gore of November 15, 1948. The effect of this was to continue the plan and the by-law as in force after the transfer of part of the township of Toronto Gore to the township of Toronto.\nIn that situation, the appellants, in September 1951, applied to have about 950 feet of this land, running back from the Airport Road, brought under a plan of subdivision. On October 24, 1951, the approval of the Minister to a draft plan was given, subject to certain conditions, among which was a height 'restriction endorsed on the plan. This fixed a maximum building height of 19 feet at a distance of 50 feet from the street line, of 24 feet at 275 feet, and of 34 feet at 725 feet. It was argued that these restrictions were beyond the power of the Minister to impose, but this would seem to be without substance in view of s. 26(4), which provides that in considering a draft plan of subdivision regard shall be had by the Minister to\n(f) the restrictions or proposed restrictions, if any, on the land, buildings and structures proposed to be erected thereon and the restrictions, if any, on adjoining lands.\nMoreover, under s. 25(1) (a), the Minister, as already mentioned, has all the powers of a council under s. 390 of The Municipal Act and the imposition of the limitation here comes within the scope of that power. It was suggested that the limitation was in conflict with the official plan and so far violated s. 25(1) (a) which requires such an order to conform with the official plan. As the latter establishes only a maximum height of 40 feet, the limitations within that maximum made by the Minister are in conformity with it.\nAlthough I have expressed my views on the legal questions raised, it is not necessary to make a definite holding on them. It is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal that the official plan, the by-law and the restrictions on the draft plan of subdivision were in de facto existence with a strong presumption of their validity at the time of the imposition of the Dominion restrictions. That fact itself was sufficient to cast such a cloud upon what has been claimed to have been free land as to affect the market value almost as significantly as if their validity were unchallenged.\nIt is argued in support of the cross-appeal that the learned President has failed to give sufficient weight to the existence of this cloud, but I am not satisfied that this is so. He refers to the contention in some detail in his reasons and, in speaking of the draft plan conditionally approved in October 1951, says in part 6:\nOne of the conditions was that the owner should observe the height restrictions shown on the draft plan. The height restrictions were marked on it. The maximum building heights were 19 feet at just a little back from the frontage on the Airport Road, 24 feet at about 225 feet further back and 34 feet at about 450 feet still further back. This plan with the height restrictions on it and Mr. Tyrrell's letter attached was filed as ex. 38. It was not until Mr. Roberts was satisfied that the draft plan was approved that he decided to exercise the option and he did so on October 29, 1951. He then listed the property. It is clear that he knew of the height restrictions and never tried to have them changed. They are, of course, somewhat less severe than those imposed by the Regulations.\nI am unable to say that the learned President did not give this factor due consideration in arriving at his final figure.\nIt was a necessary step in ascertaining the amount of compensation in this matter to determine, first, the value of the land to the owners, freed of the restrictions. The principle to be applied is stated in the judgment of this Court in Woods Manufacturing Company Limited v. The King 6. The question is as to what amount a prudent person in the position of the owners, being in possession of the property but without title to it, would be willing to give sooner than fail to obtain it. The learned President has not applied this principle, but rather the one stated by him in his judgment in The Queen v. Supertest Petroleum Corporation Limited 7, decided since the date of the Woods judgment. I am, however, of the opinion that the amount determined upon as the value of the property is adequate and that the sum of $40,000 allowed as compensation for injurious affection is sufficient.\nI would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal both with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the suppliants, appellants: Chappell, Walsh & Davidson, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada, respondent and cross-appellant: F.

This onus is not satisfied by showing that since his release from imprisonment he has done no work and has no visible means of earning an honest livelihood, and on the other hand the fact that he has done some honest work since his last release is far from conclusive proof that he is not an habitual criminal, although it is an important consideration. Rex v. Stewart (1910), 4 Cr. App. R. 175 at 178; Rex v. Baggott (1910), 4 Cr. App. R. 67 at 70; Rex v. Lavender (1927), 20 Cr. App. R. 10, quoted or referred to.\nThere are cases in which an accused\u2019s criminal record, coupled with the conviction for the substantive offence, may form a sufficient basis for the finding that he is an habitual criminal. But Parliament did not intend that a man should be found to be an habitual criminal merely because he has a number of previous convictions against him. Rex v. Jones (1920), 15 Cr. App. R. 20 at 21, agreed with. In all the cases in which this has been held sufficient the substantive offence has been of such a nature as to show premeditation and careful preparation, and in this way to constitute in itself evidence of leading persistently a criminal life. Rex v. Keane and Watson (1912), 8 Cr. App. R. 12 at 14; Rex v. Heard (1911), 7 Cr. App. R. 80 at 83, quoted. If the circumstances of the primary offence are consistent with the view that the accused yielded to a sudden temptation, and do not establish premeditation or a plan, the fact of that offence, even when coupled with a lengthy criminal record, does not constitute sufficient evidence to support a finding that the accused is an habitual criminal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from a sentence of preventive detention imposed on the appellant as an habitual criminal. Appeal allowed.\nJ.W. Brooke, for the accused, appellant.\nW.B. Common, Q.C., for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated May 26, 1953, affirming the finding of His Honour Judge Lovering dated February 26, 1953, that the appellant was an habitual criminal.\nOn February 26, 1953, the appellant was tried before His Honour Judge Lovering, without a jury, on the charge of having, on October 4, 1952, stolen from the person of Hugh McCulloch a wallet containing $107 in money and personal papers. The learned judge convicted the appellant on this charge and then proceeded with the hearing to determine whether or not he was an habitual criminal, with the result indicated above.\nIn view of the dates of the proceedings the questions raised on this appeal are to be determined under the provisions of Part X (A) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, as enacted by 1947, c. 55, s. 18.\nThe notice required by s. 575C(4)(b) was given to the appellant. In it the grounds upon which it was intended \u201cto found the charge of being an habitual criminal\u201d were specified as follows:\n1. That since attaining the age of eighteen years you have been convicted of the following indictable offences for which you were liable to at least five years imprisonment, that is to say,\n(a) On the 18th day of January, 1936, in the Magistrate\u2019s Court for the City of Toronto in the County of York, you were convicted for that you did on the 30th day of December, 1935, at the City of Toronto in the County of York, unlawfully did steal one carton containing thirty pounds of tea the property of the Toronto St. Catharines Transport, value under $25.00, contrary to the Criminal Code, and that you were sentenced to imprisonment for 60 days.\n(b) On the 11th day of May in the year 1936, in the County of York Magistrate\u2019s Court, you were convicted for that on the 28th day of April in the year 1936, at the Township of Scarboro in the County of York, you unlawfully did steal four cases of beer, the property of the Brewery Corporation, value under $25.00, contrary to Section 386 of the Criminal Code, and you were sentenced to a definite term of 6 months.\n(c) On the 15th day of May in the year 1936, in the Magistrate\u2019s Court for the City of Toronto in the County of York, you were convicted for that in the month of April in the year 1936, at the City of Toronto in the County of York, you unlawfully did receive in your possession eighteen cartons of beer, the property of Reinhardt Brewery and theretofore stolen, then well knowing the same to have been so stolen, value over $25.00, contrary to the Criminal Code, section 399, and you were sentenced to a definite term of 6 months in the Ontario Reformatory. (d) On the 27th day of October A.D., 1937, in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court of the County of York, you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the County of York on or about the 27th day of September in the year 1937, you unlawfully stole a diamond ring, two watches, a set of dress studs, a silver ring, a silver brooch, a silver ring box and the sum of forty-five dollars ($45.00) in money, the property of Henrietta Dunn, contrary to the Criminal Code, and you were sentenced on the 2nd day of November, 1937, to serve a term of one year in jail.\n(e) On the 5th day of November, A.D., 1937, in the County of York Magistrate\u2019s Court, you were convicted for that you did on the 4th day of October, A.D., 1937, at the Township of North York, in the County of York, unlawfully have, receive, or retain in your possession one cuff link, the property of W.G. Richards, 9 Brook Street, before then stolen, well knowing the same to have been stolen, contrary to Section 399 of the Criminal Code, and you were sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 months.\n(f) On the 15th day of November, A.D., 1938, in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court of the County of York, you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the County of York, on or about the 1st day of October in the year 1938, you broke and entered the shop, warehouse, store or storehouse of Dominion Stores Ltd., situate and known as number 497 Parliament Street, in the said city, and stole therein a quantity of cigarettes and other articles, the property of Dominion Stores Ltd., contrary to the Criminal Code;\n(g) And further at the time and place last above mentioned, you were also convicted for that at the City of Toronto on or about the 1st day of October in the year 1938, you robbed Benjamin Pearson of a revolver, and at the time of or immediately before or immediately after such robbery, wounded, beat, struck or used personal violence to the said Benjamin Pearson, contrary to the Criminal Code;\n(h) And further at the time and place last above mentioned, you were also convicted for that at the said City of Toronto, on or about the 9th day of October in the year 1938, you robbed one Alex Thompson of the sum of two hundred and eight dollars, ($208.00) in money, a wrist watch and a fountain pen, and at the time of or immediately before or immediately after such robbery, wounded, beat, struck or used personal violence to the said Alex Thompson, contrary to the Criminal Code.\n(i) On the 21st day of November, 1938, you were sentenced to imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary for three years for each of the offences mentioned in paragraphs f, g, and h above, the sentences to run concurrent.\n(j) On the 4th day of June, A.D., 1946, at the sittings of the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court of the County of York, you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the County of York, on or about the 9th day of June in the year 1945, you unlawfully did steal the sum of three hundred and eighteen dollars ($318.00), the property of Kenneth Adair, contrary to the Criminal Code and that you were sentenced to imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary for two years.\n(k) On the 20th day of June, A.D., 1946, at sittings of the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court of the County of York, held at the City of Toronto, you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the County of York, in or about the month of May in the year 1946, you unlawfully did steal three suitcases and two week-end bags and contents, the property of Albert Catalone, Irma Wolfe, Margaret L. Clark and Eli Van Dirlin, contrary to the Criminal Code and that you were sentenced to serve a term of three years in Kingston Penitentiary.\n(l) On the 15th day of December, A.D., 1949, at a sittings of the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court of the County of York, held at the City of Toronto you were convicted for that at the City of Toronto in the County of York, in the month of October in the year 1949, you broke and entered the dwelling house of Wilfred Deschamp, situate and known as number 338 Bloor Street East, in the said City, by night, with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, to wit, theft, contrary to the Criminal Code, and that you were sentenced to imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary for three years.\n2. That since the expiration of your last term of imprisonment you have been doing no work and you have no visible means by which to earn an honest livelihood.\n3. You are charged with being a persistent criminal because shortly after your release from Kingston Penitentiary, you committed the fresh offence that you are now charged with.\nThe convictions as set out in items (a) to (I) of para. 1 of this notice were proved at the hearing. It appears from the certificates of conviction, which were filed as exhibits, that the sentences imposed under items (b) and (c) were to run concurrently as was also the case in regard to those imposed under items (d) and (e), those imposed under items (f), (g) and (h) and those imposed under items (j) and (k).\nThere was evidence that in November 1937 the appellant had stated his age to be 19 and that in September 1945 he had stated it to be 27.\nWe were informed by counsel that the appellant was released from the penitentiary on April 4, 1952, so that exactly six months elapsed between the date of his release and that of the commission of the substantive offence of which he was convicted by His Honour Judge Lovering. The only evidence given for the prosecution as to the activities of the appellant during this period was that in July and August 1952 he was seen in the village of Belle Ewart assisting from time to time in a booth operated by his sister in which refreshments were sold.\nThe defence called William Dineen, a nephew of the appellant, who testified that the latter had helped the mother of the witness in the operation of the booth at Belle Ewart; that the appellant had tried to get employment at the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1952 but could not do so as he was not a union member; that the witness and his wife then took the appellant into their home and that he helped with digging the cellar and with some reconditioning and decorating of their house; that the appellant got some odd jobs as a stevedore; that the appellant was \u201cliving for free at home\u201d and getting some money from his sister, the mother of the witness; and that during the war years the appellant had worked at war-work but that the witness knew of this only by hearsay as he was in the armed services at that time.\nThe learned County Judge gave no reason for his finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the Court of Appeal gave no reasons for their decision that the appeal from that finding should be dismissed.\nWhile the grounds of appeal were expressed in varying terms in the memorandum filed on behalf of the appellant, the main ground argued before us was that on the evidence the Crown had failed to satisfy the onus of proving that at the time of the commission of the substantive offence the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life. We were informed by counsel that this ground was not urged in the Court of Appeal. It must be borne in mind that, leave to appeal having been granted under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, our jurisdiction is not restricted to questions of law alone: vide the judgment of this Court granting leave to appeal in Parkes v. The Queen[1].\nSection 575C(1) so far as relevant to the question now before us read as follows:\n(1) A person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge\u2026 finds on evidence,\n(a) that since attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years\u2019 imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life;\nPart X(A) of the Criminal Code, first enacted in 1947, is in its wording similar to, although not identical with, Part II of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, 8 Edw. VII, c. 59, and counsel in the course of their full and helpful arguments discussed a number of the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases arising under the last-mentioned statute.\nIn my opinion it is established by these decisions, and I would so hold on the wording of s. 575C(1) if the matter were devoid of authority, that before an accused can be found to be an habitual criminal the Crown, in addition to proving the prescribed number of previous convictions, must satisfy the onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time when he committed the indictable offence referred to in s. 575B the accused was leading persistently a criminal life. It is true that a finding that a person is an habitual criminal is not a conviction of a crime: vide Brusch v. The Queen[2] and Parkes v. The Queen[3]; but, as was said by Rand J. in Parkes v. The Queen[4] when the finding that Parkes was an habitual criminal was quashed:\nUnder such a determination a person can be detained in prison for the rest of his life with his liberty dependent on the favourable discretion of a minister of the Crown. The adjudication is a most serious step in the administration of the criminal law.\nand, in my opinion, the rule requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies to such an adjudication as fully as in the case of any criminal charge.\nIn the case at bar there is no evidence that during the six months following his release from the penitentiary in April 1952 the appellant had done anything unlawful or dishonest. Such evidence as there is goes to show that he was trying to obtain work, albeit without much success, and was doing such work as he was able to get. Ground no. 2 set out in the notice required under s. 575C(4)(b) and quoted above is not made out on the evidence but if it had been it would not have required a finding adverse to the appellant. It was said by Jelf J., giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Stewart[5],\nIt does not follow, because he is not getting an honest living, that it must be a dishonest one\u2014he may be doing nothing. and by Pickford J. giving the judgment of the Court in Rex v. Baggott[6]:\nHe refused the work of stone-breaking that had been offered him by the guardians. It is said that you can infer criminality from this. But the evidence was that the appellant was living on the charity of his relations. Therefore the choice was not stone-breaking or stealing, but stone-breaking or charity. He chose the latter.\nI agree with the view expressed in a number of cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal that the mere fact that the prisoner has done some honest work since his last release is by no means conclusive proof that he is not an habitual criminal: see, for example, Rex v. Lavender[7]; although the fact of his having done such work is an important consideration.\nIt was argued on behalf of the respondent that the appellant\u2019s criminal record coupled with the conviction of the substantive offence formed a sufficient basis for the finding that he was an habitual criminal. As to this I agree with the view expressed by Lord Reading L.C.J. giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Jones[8]:\nThe legislature never intended that a man should be convicted of being a habitual criminal merely because he had a number of previous convictions against him.\nThere have however been cases in which the Court of Criminal Appeal has upheld a finding that a prisoner was an habitual criminal on the ground that the nature of the substantive offence viewed in the light of his previous record was in itself evidence that he was leading persistently a criminal life. For example in Rex v. Keane and Watson[9], Channell J. in giving the judgment of the Court said:\nThe point is whether, at the time when he commits the offence then being dealt with, he is leading persistently a dishonest or criminal life. The verb is in the present tense. If he has done some honest work but has given it up and committed another crime, it may well be that he has returned to a life of crime and is then a habitual criminal, and the nature of the most recent crime may itself be evidence that at the time he commits it he is persistently leading a dishonest or criminal life. In Baggott\u2019s case, which was relied on for the appellants but is really an authority against them, the offence of coining was given as an illustration of such a crime. But the present case is another illustration which will do equally well. The appellants, who must have planned the crime together, broke into this dwelling-house by means of a jemmy and stole bracelets and rings and other property from the bedrooms. We think that when they were committing this offence, they must then have been leading persistently a dishonest and criminal life. In our opinion, therefore, there was sufficient evidence to support the verdicts of the jury\u2026\nI have examined all the cases of this class to which we were referred by counsel and find that in each of them the substantive offence was of such a nature as to show premeditation and careful preparation. I shall refer to only one example. In Rex v. Heard[10], Hamilton J., speaking for the Court, said:\nWhere the interval between the last known fact against the prisoner and the commission of the substantive crime is considerable\u2014and six or nine months are a considerable interval\u2014there should be additional evidence. In this case there was such evidence, for the crime was carefully planned, was committed in association with another habitual criminal, and was carried out with skill, so the jury, with the facts before them, were justified in convicting\u2026\nIn the case at bar the transcript of the evidence given at the trial on the charge of the substantive offence was not before the Court of Appeal nor was it before us at the argument. In considering the matter, after judgment had been reserved, this Court was unanimously of the opinion that this transcript should have formed part of the material in the Court of Appeal, and requested the Attorney-General to furnish it to us unless counsel should desire to make any submission that it should not be before us. No objection was made and we have now received the transcript.\nThe evidence of McCulloch whose wallet was stolen is uncontradicted. He was walking north on Jarvis Street about midnight after watching television in a hotel. There had been a collision and an argument was in progress as a result. McCulloch had stopped to observe this and was having a conversation with the appellant during the course of which he offered the appellant a cigarette. He does not say who started the conversation. He says in part:\nAnyway, we talked for about a minute or two and he said, \u201cAll right sir, you are a good sport\u201d, and gave me a pat on the shoulder and walked off across the street.\nA moment later, on putting his hand in his pocket to get his handkerchief, McCulloch noticed that his wallet which had been in his left hip pocket was gone. He ran after the appellant calling for the police and the appellant was seen to drop the wallet. The appellant did not give evidence.\nIn my opinion, the offence thus committed by the appellant is not of such a nature as to warrant the inference that he was leading persistently a criminal life. The circumstances are consistent with the view that, yielding to a sudden temptation, he availed himself of the opportunity afforded by his chance meeting with McCulloch following the collision. It may be said that the circumstances are not inconsistent with the view that the appellant had gone out that night for the express purpose of picking someone\u2019s pocket if the opportunity offered, but so to hold would be mere speculation. Bearing in mind that the appellant is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt it is my opinion that there is not sufficient evidence to support the finding of the learned County Court Judge that the appellant was an habitual criminal. As pointed out above we are not restricted to a consideration of the question of law whether there was any evidence on which such a finding could have been made and I express no final opinion upon it although it is my present view that there was no such evidence.\nI do not intend in anything I have said above to minimize the seriousness of the substantive offence of which the appellant was convicted, and for which he has been punished by two years\u2019 imprisonment; but that offence was not, in my opinion, of such a nature as, without more, to furnish evidence that he was leading persistently a criminal life.\nI would quash the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the direction that he be held in preventive detention.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John W.

About half of this land was owned by the company and the other half consisted of Crown lands in respect of which the company held two different licences, one of which would expire in the ordinary course in 11 years, while the other had only 1 year to run. The Exchequer Court determined the value of the company\u2019s freehold lands at $330,000 (to which was added 10 per cent. for compulsory taking), the value of the licences at $42,000, and the value of the freehold in the Crown lands at $344,000. Adding other allowances, and deducting the value of the timber that the company had been permitted to cut after the expropriation, the Court fixed the total compensation at $394,177 for the company and $344,000 for the Province. Both the company and the Province sought increases in the amounts awarded. Held, the company\u2019s appeal should foe allowed with costs and the Province\u2019s cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nPer curiam: The company\u2019s rights under its licences constituted an \u201cinterest\u201d in land for which it was entitled to compensation under the Expropriation Act, but only to the extent of the unexpired terms; the mere possibility of renewal in the future was not in itself an interest in land.\nPer curiam: The additional allowance of 10 per cent. for forcible taking, having been rightly given in respect of the freehold lands, should also have been given in respect of the licences.\nPer Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ.: The witness M, whose valuation of the land was accepted in the Court below, considered the matter solely from the standpoint of what a prospective purchaser might be willing to pay for the lands, and did not at all consider the value to the company or whether an informed owner would have agreed to sell at any such figure. He simply expressed his opinion as to the amount the lands would realize if the owner was under compulsion to sell for what they would bring on the open market. In determining the value to the owner all advantages, present or future, that the land possessed in his hands were to be taken into consideration, and he was entitled to have the price assessed in reference to those advantages that would give the land the greatest value. These lands, in the circumstances, clearly had a value to the appellant company that they would not have had to someone who did not have like facilities for converting the logs into lumber, and a long-established business designed and effective for disposing of the lumber at a profit. Applying these principles, the award to the company in respect of the freehold properties should be increased by $55,000. There was nothing in the record that would support a higher valuation than had been made of the Crown lands as freehold in the hands of the Province. The award in respect of the licences should be increased by $35,000, and there should be a reduction of $10,426.50 in the credit to be given for timber cut after the expropriation.\nPer Rand J.: The value of the property to the owner, as a measure of compensation, had two aspects: (1) the present value of all the land\u2019s possibilities to the owner, as opposed to the value to the taker, with which the owner was not concerned; and (2) the value to the owner as a prudent man in a situation affected by conditions or relations from which buyers generally on the market would be free, representing the sum total of detriment suffered by reason of the disruption, over and above what the market price would take into account. Market value, i.e., the price on which a prudent and willing vendor and a similar purchaser would agree, might or might not be the sole determinant of compensation. Where the position of the owner vis-\u00e0-vis the land was not different from that of any purchaser, that value would be the measure; where the owner was in special relations to the land, as in the case of an established business, the measure was the value to him as a prudent man\u2014what he would pay rather than be dispossessed, that value thereafter representing the capital cost of the business to which the profits would be related. But the value of these special relations must be established by the claimant. Considered on this basis, and on the evidence adduced, the final valuations of the lands arrived at by the Court below were liberal and should not be disturbed. Evidence of settlements for lands taken from other owners in the area in the same expropriation proceedings was rightly rejected by the Court below. Evidence of sales to the Crown might be admissible if the Court found that they were the result of genuinely free negotiations, influenced only by the desire of the parties to reach agreement on a figure deemed to be the fair value of the property, and not by extraneous considerations, but here the act of expropriation covered all the land required for the project and what remained was settlement of the claims for compensation, which involved elements different in degree, if not in nature, from those in sales to the Crown, and of such a character as to exclude the necessary freedom. Amory et al. v. Commonwealth (1947), 321 Mass. 240 at 255, quoted with approval.\nOn all the evidence, the company was entitled to an increase of $15,750 in the amount awarded for the licences, a reduction of $10,587 in the amount deducted in respect of the timber cut after the expropriation, and half the cost of marking boundary-lines shortly before, making a total increase of $30,039.\nPer Abbott J.: The valuations for both the freehold lands and the Crown lands in the hands of the Province were liberal, and should not be disturbed. The economic value of the licences could not exceed their profit potential after taxes, during the terms that they still had to run. Applying the evidence as to the prices at which licences for timber lands in New Brunswick were bought and sold, and the other matters considered in the judgment appealed from, the valuation of the licences should not be disturbed. There should, however, be an allowance of $4,200 for compulsory taking in respect of the licences, $3,702 in respect of the survey costs, and a reduction of $10,567 in the credit for wood cut after the expropriation.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Thorson P., of the Exchequer Court of Canada, fixing the compensation to be paid on lands expropriated by the Crown in right of Canada. Appeal allowed in part.\nA. B. Gilbert, Q.C., and D. M. Gillis, for the appellant.\nA. McF. Limerick, Q.C., C. J. A. Hughes, Q.C., and K. E. Eaton, for Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada, respondent.\nJ. F. H. Teed, Q.C., for the Attorney General for New Brunswick, respondent and cross-appellant.\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal arises out of an expropriation of approximately 28,000 acres of land in New Brunswick. Part was freehold, 13,413 acres, and part Crown lands under licences to cut, 14,424. The latter were embraced within two types of licence to the company by the Crown, one called a sawmill licence covering 9,027 acres and the other a timber licence for 5,397 acres. Of these 1935 and 1950, 2,586 acres of the freehold and 1,818 acres of the licensed, lands had been burnt over. The freehold had 151 acres of non-productive and 76 acres cleared; the licensed lands, 579 acres of non-productive and 2 cleared. The sawmill licence was sustained by legislation which , was to expire in 1963 and the timber licence in 1953, and at the time of the expropriation, August 6, 1952, their terms were accordingly limited to 11 years and 1 year respectively. In each, where the conditions of the licences had been complied with, an annual renewal was stipulated. It was shown that, although they were so limited in time, the policy of the legislature by periodic authorizing enactments for the last 40 years had been to permit continued renewal.\nThe main claim made by both the company and the Province was on a basis of some simplicity of conception though of complexity in computation. The total quantities of wood, as at the moment of expropriation, from sapling to mature tree, classified by species and in categories of sawlogs, pulpwood, firewood and other uses, were estimated ; from the market prices for products received in 1952 by the company and in other cases, estimated, operating costs of the company for the same year, operations extending over lands in another section of the Province, in corresponding units, were deducted; and the balances, the net returns, with minor adjustments, multiplied by the quantities produced the total value of the growth. To this was added that of the land related to its capacity to yield growth. The price, for example, of white pine in sawn lumber at shipping point (Saint John) was $94.16 per M (f.b.m.), and for spruce and fir, $75.15; the production costs, to that point, exclusive of stumpage fees payable to the Province, deducted from the selling-prices, left balances of $41.08 and $22.07 respectively. These amounts, embracing an unspecified element of profit, were said to represent the unit-value of the standing trees, although the actual figures used in the calculation of the claim were, for spruce and fir $20, and for white pine $25.\nThe total value was reduced to an acreage figure for the several categories. For sawlogs on the forested area of the Crown lands, $14.02; for growth of 5 inches and over available for sale in cords for pulpwood, firewood, spoolwood, etc., $53.18; for undersized trees, less than 5 inches in diameter, dealt with on a maturity basis and the 1952 market price discounted at 4 per cent. compounded for the appropriate number of years for each species to obtain the present value, $12.02; the land\u2019s capacity for producing a crop of trees over a period of 64 years, $6.15: a total of $85.37. A similar calculation for the freehold lands yielded a total of $84.66 an acre. In each case $5 was allowed for reproducing burned and cleared land, and 5 per cent. deducted for inoperable growth. The grand total claimed before us was, for Crown lands, to the Province $451,551.54, to the company $555,011.92 (less an amount for cutting after the expropriation which is dealt with hereafter); and for the freehold, $877,911.50 (also less an amount for subsequent cutting).\nThis theoretical computation was argued to represent the value to an owner whose utilization of his property was by way of treating the annual growth of the trees as a crop in an indefinite continuity, as the most profitable mode of the exploitation on a large scale of woodlands; but as can be seen, it virtually ignores present market or exchange value and the element of profit which that involves.\nIt may be assumed that the general range of market values for freehold and for licensed lands in a Province where lumbering has played and now plays so large a part in the economy as in New Brunswick must long since have been established; and that in the case of licences the probability of indefinite renewal would, in some degree, have been a factor. But the expropriation, here, of the estate of the Province excludes that possibility, and the interest of the company as licensee must be taken as confined to the strict rights under the licences, including the limits of size for cutting, but not excluding the value, if any, placed by the market on the chance of being able to obtain leave under the regulations to cut undersized growth. The compensation for this interest must accordingly be referred to the periods in 1952 remaining unexpired of the licences.\nIt is, I think, beyond question that no sales and purchases of timber lands or licences have ever been carried out on the basis outlined. It was in fact rejected by Mr. Reid, an officer of the company; in speaking of the price at which licences would be bought or sold, the President, examining the figure of $20 per M (f.b.m.) claimed for the standing spruce on the licensed lands, put this question:\nIs there any way of finding out how much would you pay to licence holders\u2014will you pay them $12 and then pay the province $8 [the stumpage rate] ? Is that how it would work out?\nHis answer was:\nI would not buy it on that basis; he would expect as much as he could from his lease \u2026 He might [expect to get $12] just according to how hard a bargain he could drive \u2026 He has the lease and wants to sell his licence to you, that is part of a dicker between the two parties.\nThe unexpressed element here which is concealed by the answer is the profit over the stumpage value which the purchaser would have in view, largely the determinant of the market price, the failure to face which is the serious defect in the argument presented.\nMr. Gilbert\u2019s exclusive concern with this basis results from an underlying misconception of the meaning of the form in which the principle of compensation is put, that the value of the property to the owner is the measure of compensation. Properly understood, that language is accurate but the meaning is not precisely what the appellant has in mind. It has two aspects, one that it is the present value of all the land\u2019s possibilities to the owner in contradistinction to the value to the taker, for with the latter the owner is not concerned; and the second, the value to the owner as a prudent man in a situation affected by conditions or relations from which buyers generally on the market would be free, as, for example, the special features involved in the ejection of an established business from possession of land. They represent the sum total of detriment suffered by reason of the disruption, over and above what the market price would take into account. The claim confuses the present exchange value of the land with the present value of the total return of its present growth ; in substance it attributes to the land a value equal to the present value of what the owner would be able to realize from the existing growth over a growth cycle of say 64 years plus the residual or capacity value of the land. The mere recognition of some undetermined element of profit does not alter the basic structure of the claim. The defect of this formulation was long ago pointed out by the Exchequer Court in The King v. Thompson 1 and The King v. Griffin 2.\nThe conception so advanced conceals other vital items involved in exchange value: the multiple risks of the future, risks of fire\u2014of which there is significant evidence here, the infestation of pests, fungi, etc., market variations, changes in operating-costs, seasonal conditions, the effect of competitive substitutes and other factors and uncertainties. In the broader sense, it disregards the price for re-establishing the owner in business, the price at which he could purchase comparable lands and continue his business.\nThose variables and uncertainties, some in more or less vague appreciation, are the unexpressed factors operating on the minds of persons habituated to lumber dealings. Opinions, varying, of course, with the individual, are given weight roughly according to the experience and standing in the business of those who give them; and they may require modification in the application to the facts on which they are based of the principles governing compensation. From this point of view, we have little or no help from what was adduced on behalf of the company; what, instead, is given us is the ideal realization of an equally ideal body of values, reduced by 5 per cent. and an unestimated profit.\nThe confusion of the appellant\u2019s case may arise from the manner in which the rule in a number of cases has been examined and treated, and, distasteful as it is, a brief restatement appears to be called for. The task of the tribunal is primarily to determine compensation, not market or other values: these are items or elements that enter into or make up compensation. And it is compensation for the taking of land. By definition 3, \u201cland\u201d includes damages and these are not to be confined to the exercise of powers other than that of taking land. In developing the scope of compensation, such as, for example, the effects on remaining lands of the operation as distinguished from the construction of works placed upon the lands taken, and in injurious affection, we have followed the interpretation given to the early English statutes granting, in more or less similar language, like powers. But, both by the express language of the statute and that interpretation, the compensation here is wrapped up in and is in respect of that act of appropriation, the taking.\nMarket value, that is, the price on which a prudent and willing vendor and a similar purchaser would agree, may be the sole determinant, exhausting compensation, but it may not be. Where the position of the owner vis-\u00e0-vis the land is not different from that of any purchaser, that value is the measure; where the owner is in special relations to the land, as in the case of an established business, the measure is the value to him as a prudent man, what he would pay, as the price of the land, rather than be dispossessed, that price thereafter, in effect, representing the capital cost of the business to which the profits would be related. But evidence of those relations issuing in special injury upon extrusion and their value in terms of money must be adduced. It is in this comprehensive view that in Woods Manufacturing Company Limited v. The King 4, by a unanimous judgment, the rule for compensation under the existing law was laid down definitively by this Court.\nThe President relied largely on the opinions of two experienced lumbermen, Mr. R. G. MacFarlane and Mr. Ashley Colter. The former is associated, in an executive position, with the largest pulp and paper organization in the Province, and the latter is engaged in large scale lumbering and contracting. Both show long and successful careers and their opinions, as the President held, are entitled to high respect.\nMr. MacFarlane, on the footing of an operation stripping the land in 3 years, and taking certain market prices of white pine, red pine, spruce, fir and hemlock in f.b.m. and cords, computed the net return from sawn lumber of 9 inches and over and from trees down to 5 inches available for pulpwood. From this he deducted 15 per cent. as representing inoperable growth. On that total net return he then considered a price which a prudent purchaser from a willing seller would risk in an operating venture. With interest of 10 per cent. on the price for the 3 years, and allowances for annual charges, taxes, warden service, etc., he sought a figure that would permit also an inducing profit. On this, his valuation of the freehold was $230,000 and the Crown lands, as freehold, $274,000. Mr. Colter used a somewhat different method. He estimated, in the light of his experience, the stumpage value of each class of product and using the same quantities but deducting 20 per cent. for inoperable growth he reached a price for the freehold of $251,978 and for the Crown lands, $284,276, including in each case $3 an acre for the land with its undersized growth.\nThe selling prices based on information received from what Mr. MacFarlane considered a reliable shipping source, were, in his judgment, warranted for a 3-year period from 1952. They were less than the highest prices obtained in that year by the company, peak prices in a period of abnormal demand, and it is objected that they were, as presented, hearsay. By Mr. MacFarlane\u2019s use of them, they carried the support of his own general opinion; it is obvious that the appellant\u2019s prices could not themselves be taken; lower figures must have been used and in the circumstances, including other evidence, and what was omitted from as well as adduced in that submitted on behalf of the claimants, I cannot say that the President was unwarranted in accepting generally Mr. MacFarlane\u2019s estimate and the unit figures on which it was based.\nThe values for stumpage used by the company were arbitrary. For example, that for spruce and fir sawn lumber was $20 per M (f.b.m.); the officers of the company, with no actual experience in New Brunswick, had \u201cthought\u201d that amount to be the going rate, but they could furnish no evidence in support of it. Drawn out of the void, it was observed to be 2\u00bd times the Government stumpage of $8: that factor was then applied to white pine which carried a Government stumpage of $9, making $22.50, but because of a greater return from pine it was increased to $25. Similarly the other figures were reached. But between the $8 and the $20 for spruce, as is seen by Mr. Reid\u2019s \u201cdickering\u201d view of purchases, an element of profit is hidden. The final estimates of the freehold forested land at $84.66 an acre and the licensed land at $85.37 an acre, as well as those of $92.69 and $98.29 urged at the trial, fully justify their description by the President as unrealistic. They are to be contrasted with the estimates of $17.15 and $19 by Mr. MacFarlane and $20 and $20.54 respectively by Mr. Colter.\nTo Mr. MacFarlane\u2019s totals, the President made certain increased allowances. For the freehold lands they were, for pulpwood $31,939, residual value $40,239, and reductions in operating expense $27,829: for the licensed lands, pulp-wood, $37,728, residual value $43,272, and expense reduction $31,003. The additions to the net operating returns would have affected the purchase-prices at which Mr. MacFarlane arrived but they would not wholly have been added to them. The final valuations so reached were, in my opinion, liberal and should not be disturbed.\nThe valuation of the interest of the company as licensee of the Crown lands remains. Mr. MacFarlane proceeded on the same general basis as for the freehold using as the individual net unit returns from each class of product those of the latter less the Government stumpage. Considerable evidence was given of prices paid for licences, the highest figure being $2,000 a square mile. Using that as the standard appplicable, the President awarded $42,000 on the basis of 21 square miles, or at the rate of $2.91 an acre for the actual acreage of 14,424. The balance of the total valuation enured to the Province. This resulted in an award to the latter of $344,000 or $23.85 an acre.\nIt would have been of some benefit to have had a theoretical estimate of the market value of the Provincial Government\u2019s interest on the footing of a continuing operation by licensees. The amount allowed to the Province considered in the light of its stumpage revenue from this area appears to be in sharp contrast to what those returns could justify and what the market would be prepared to pay. For the years 1934-1952 inclusive the total cut under the sawmill licence was 1018M: and from 1942-1952 under the timber licence 52M. At the prescribed stumpage rates this represents a negligible return.\nIn a table prepared by the forestry experts it is shown that the time required to bring the undersized trees, that is, trees 5 inches D.B.H. (diameter at breast height), to an increase of 4 inches D.B.H., ranged from 26 to 46 years. By 1963 on the sawmill-licensed land there would be 3722M spruce and fir sawlogs: 1212M red pine sawlogs: 1097M white pine sawlogs and 742M hemlock sawlogs. On the timber-licensed lands the quantities available for cutting in 1953 were : spruce and fir sawlogs 364M, red pine 45M, white pine 140M, and hemlock 28M. These quantities are of sizes within the regulations for cutting. The stumpage on spruce, fir and red pine in 1952 was $8 per M : on white pine $9 per M ; and on hemlock $7 per M. At those rates the return would be less than $60,000. The difference between the acreage allowance to the Crown of $23.85 and to the company, $2.91, lies in the value attributed to the growth between 5 inches and the 12 inches for spruce and 16 inches for white pine at the stump to which the regulations limit cutting by the licensee, the value for the undersized growth and the land, and that stumpage.\nAlthough the interests of ownership and licence in a settled relation are complementary in indefinite time, that of a specific licensee is of right limited strictly to the terms of his licence and the regulations: he enjoys it for only the fixed period of time and the prescribed modes and sizes for cutting. The Government may allow additional cutting but is not bound to; new legislation authorizing renewal licences to past licensees may or may not be passed; on neither consideration can a direct claim be rested. The market value of the licence, to be reached by ordinary bargaining, may, to some extent, take both into account; but only in that form can they be contemplated as factors.\nFor the price of $2,000 a square mile we know nothing of the growth which it purchased. Mr. MacFarlane reached a value of $2,800 a square mile, but this involved the cutting of smaller sizes than allowed by the regulations. Having in mind the total value reached and the other considerations mentioned, general prices over the years can properly be related to each situation. For these reasons I should think $2,500 a square mile would be more proportionate to the total value than the sum allowed. To this I would add 10 per cent. for the forcible taking. The President conceded that allowance on the freehold and I am unable to see how it can be withheld from the value of the licences. Mr. Colter did not essay an estimate on the latter and I cannot think the abstention to have been wholly divorced from the difficulty of making it; but that circumstance is a reason for such an allowance.\nThe amount for 21 square miles at $2,500 plus 10 per cent. is $57,750, an increase over the amount allowed of $15,750. As the Dominion has not appealed, the award to the Province stands notwithstanding it was based on a total compensation as for a freehold minus the value attributed to the licences. As that total has been found to have been adequate, there is no ground for a supplementary percentage allowance to the Province.\nEvidence of settlements for lands taken in the Gagetown area under the same expropriation proceedings was offered and rejected. Mr. Gilbert contended that the rejection was wrong and prejudicial to the proof of his claim. The respondents support the ruling; and as the question is involved with that of sales to the Crown or other expropriating authority for the purposes of a public or semi-public work before expropriation, an examination of both seems desirable.\nSales of land to the Crown prior to expropriation have, in a number of cases, been admitted in the Exchequer Court: The King v. Condon 5; The King v. Hayes 6 ; The King v. Murphy 7; The King v. La Compagnie des Carri\u00e8res de Beauport Limit\u00e9e 8; The King v. King 9; The King v. Bowles 10. Of these both The King v. King and The King v. Bowles were affirmed in this Court on December 11, 1916, but it should be said that in them no objection to the evidence seems to have been taken. The matter has been considered in innumerable instances by Courts in the United States, and as shown in Orgel on Valuation under Eminent Domain, 2nd ed. 1953, pp. 581 et seq., much diversity of opinion is exhibited. The objection to admission is that the power on the one side to take and the necessity on the other ultimately to yield introduce factors that destroy freedom of action between the parties. But the ideal conception of a free vendor and a free purchaser is in many transactions infringed by factors personal or peculiar to the parties or their purposes and irrelevant to pure economic or market value. This is elaborated in a decision of the New Jersey Court of Appeals in Curley et al v. Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey City 11. The rule of admissibility is well stated in Amory et al. v. Commonwealth 12:\nIf it is made to appear that the water rights taken from the petitioners are substantially similar to those taken from the other riparian owners, save only in the extent of the rights taken, and that the taking from them was not too far distant in space and time from the taking in question, then it is to be reasonably expected that the judge in the exercise of a sound discretion will find that the value of those rights will furnish a fair standard of the value of the petitioners\u2019 rights, provided it is shown by those having knowledge of the details involved, including the basis upon which the payments were in fact computed, that the transactions between the Commonwealth and these other riparian owners amounted in reality to a purchase and sale of water rights and nothing more, irrespective of the form in which these transactions were clothed and, finally, provided it is shown that these sales were voluntarily and freely made between these riparian owners and the Commonwealth.\nAs Holmes C.J. of the same Court, in the case of O\u2019Malley v. Commonwealth 13, said:\nWe cannot say merely because of the name of the purchaser that the sale was not a fair transaction in the market rather than a compulsory settlement.\nThe primary question is of freedom in the negotiation as a fact, and it is for the tribunal, in the light of the circumstances, to say whether the price was influenced by extraneous elements, or whether the parties were concerned only to reach agreement on a figure deemed to be the fair value of the property. This rule is in effect what appears to have been followed in the cases in this and the Exchequer Court cited.\nBut, as Mr. Teed pointed out, that is not the question here. The act of expropriation in this case covered all the land required for the project and what remained was settlement of the claims for compensation. This has been deemed generally to involve elements different if not wholly in nature at least in degree from those in sales to the Crown, and of such a character as likely to exclude the requisite freedom: O\u2019Malley v. Commonwealth, supra. It was on this view that the President acted in this case, and in my opinion his ruling should not be disturbed. Some minor items remain. A sum of $25,000 was awarded for disturbance. No evidence was given sufficient \u2018 to enable an estimate to be made with any degree of accuracy and the amount allowed cannot be said to be inadequate.\nFollowing the expropriation, the company was permitted through the season 1952-1953 to carry on lumber operations on both tracts. In deducting the value of the stumpage to be charged for this, the President took the figures on which the claim had been presented but which he rejected. Mr. MacFarlane did not deal directly with stumpage value; Mr. Colter did, taking, for example, spruce logs for sawn lumber at $10 per M (f.b.m.), and white pine at $15. He allowed also $3 an acre for the land and residual growth for which there was no corresponding item on the MacFarlane calculation. The Colter total for the freehold was $251,978, including $37,728 for residue; the MacFarlane valuation, $230,000. For the Crown lands, the former found $284,276 with $41,520 for the land, and the latter $274,000. Mr. Colter deducted 20 per cent. for inoperable growth against Mr. MacFarlane\u2019s 15 per cent. Applying the latter to the Colter figures after deducting the allowances for land, the estimates are: freehold, Colter $227,641 against $230,000; Crown lands, $257,929 against $274,000. Assuming a similar element of profit, the stumpage rates thus appear to be, roughly, the same, and those used by Mr. Colter, with one-half of the additional amounts allowed by the President, i.e., $1 a cord in addition to the return on spruce and fir pulpwood, and $1 per M (f.b.m.) for sawn lumber and 50c. a cord for pulpwood, from revised operating costs, can be used for the purpose here.\nThere was cut on the freehold 180,518 f.b.m. of spruce, 23,000 of fir, 10,000 of red pine, 47,379 of white pine and 24,000 of hemlock; on the Crown lands, the corresponding production was 1,501,918, 39,981, 621,909, 585,106 and 11,892. The pulpwood removed from the freehold was, spruce and fir 193 cords, red pine 66 and white pine 6. These quantities at the rates mentioned yield stumpage for the freehold, $4,531.65 and the Crown lands, $32,204.35, a total of $36,736 against $47,323 found by the President. A small item related to the cost of marking boundary-lines which had been done shortly before the expropriation, $7,404. This was disallowed on the ground that it had been taken into account in the estimates. I see nothing in the case to show that; and since its value to the lands is unquestioned some allowance should be made. Although not all the lands of the company so bounded were taken, new boundaries have been created. We do not know the cost represented by what was taken but at least 50 per cent. of the outlay should be allowed.\nA final item concerned the value of a siding and appurtenant property owned by the company and used in connection with a sawmill at which the logs were sawn. The item was considered in detail by the President and the amounts awarded appear to be reasonable.\nThe question, whether the company has an \u201cinterest\u201d in the land, within the\u2019 meaning of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106, was raised. On this I have no doubt: the licensee is in substantial possession; he may bring trespass or replevin in respect of standing trees or cut logs; he is vitally affected by any loss or damage to the growth in respect of not only the future operations but past payments to the Province both at the time of purchasing the licence and annually thereafter as bonus, mileage, fire fees, minimum stumpage, etc. A profit \u00e0 prendre is admittedly an interest within the statute and the distinction in substance between the two, if any, is extremely fine. In this I am in agreement with the President.\nThe appeal of the company will therefore be allowed with costs and the judgment modified by adding to the amount awarded the company the sum of $30,039 ; in other respects it is affirmed. The cross-appeal of the Province will be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court settling the compensation to be paid to the appellant as the owner of certain timber lands and as the licensee of other such lands held under licences from the Province of New Brunswick issued under the provisions of The Crown Lands Act, R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 30, title to which was taken under the provisions of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106, on August 7, 1952. The lands so taken were part of a much larger area taken by the Crown in right of Canada for military purposes. By the judgment from which the appeal is taken, the compensation payable to Her Majesty in right of the Province of New Brunswick, in respect of the lands subject to the licences granted to the appellant, was determined and the Province has cross-appealed against the amount of that award.\nDifferent considerations apply in arriving at the value to the owner of the lands of the appellant, 13,413 acres in extent, of which it was the owner in fee simple, and the lands of the Province subject to the licences, 14,267 acres in extent, and to the interest of the appellant in those lands under the licences referred to.\nThe freehold lands of the appellant had been acquired by it and its predecessors in title over a period of some 50 years prior to the expropriation. They had been purchased mainly by a partnership carrying on business under the name of Reid Brothers, of which firm Richard R. Reid, who gave evidence at the trial, was a member. The appellant company was incorporated in the year 1948 to take over the lumber business theretofore carried on by this firm, and the freehold lands and the existing licences were thereafter transferred to it. Reid Brothers had built a lumber mill on the Saint John River at Gagetown in 1917 and, adjoining the mill, had established a lumber yard supplied with railway facilities by a spur line connecting with the Canadian National Railways Valley Line. The business was mainly the manufacture and export of lumber to the United States and Great Britain and was a successful and profitable undertaking.\nThe timber limits in question, including both the freehold and licensed lands, lay generally to the west of Gage-town. The nearest of these was distant about 1\u00bd miles from the mill and none was more than 15 miles away. According to Reid and to the witness Allingham, a brother-in-law of his who had been a member of the firm of Reid Brothers for many years and is the vice-president of the appellant, these limits had been obtained as a source of log supply for the mill at Gagetown. The mill itself, as distinct from the lumber yard and its facilities, had not been acquired by the appellant company but remained the property of the partnership and manufactured lumber for the appellant on a custom basis. As the evidence showed, comparatively little cutting was done upon either the freehold or the licensed lands up to the time of the expropriation. These witnesses said, and there is no contradiction of their evidence or doubt expressed as to their veracity, that the appellant\u2019s intention in respect of these limits was to utilize them as a yearly and permanent source of supply of logs. Neither Reid Brothers nor the appellant had ever engaged in the production of pulpwood and there was no intention on the part of the appellant to cut any of the trees which were not sufficiently large to be logged for use as lumber for that purpose, but rather to allow them to mature.\nThe learned President arrived at his conclusion as to the quantum of the compensation in reliance mainly upon the evidence of the witness R. G. MacFarlane, an experienced lumberman employed by Fraser Companies, Limited, in New Brunswick in an executive capacity. MacFarlane was, I think, well qualified to express an opinion as to the value of these properties to a company such as the appellant having a well-established export lumber business at Gage-town, closely adjacent to these limits, with the information as to the timber standing on the properties afforded by the cruises which had been made. He, however, refrained from doing so.\nThough this witness had said at the outset of his evidence that his instructions from the Department of National Defence had been to compile data as to what, in his opinion, a prudent and informed buyer would pay to an informed and willing seller, he apparently interpreted this as requiring him to express an opinion only as to what a prospective purchaser might be agreeable to pay for the lands. In a written report prepared several months prior to the trial and which was put in evidence, MacFarlane submitted an opinion to the Department which, he said, reflected \u201cthe value that in my opinion a prospective purchaser might place on the freehold lands and the Crown lands treated as freehold lands as of August 7, 1952\u201d. That \u2018 his opinion was based entirely upon what he thought his \u201cprudent purchaser\u201d would pay was made clear by his evidence. When asked by the learned trial judge if his figure of $230,000 for the freehold lands was his estimate of their value as of the date of expropriation, he answered:\nI would not say that. I would say I estimate that is the price that a prudent purchaser might pay.\nIn answer to a question put to him in cross-examination as to whether he had taken into consideration at all the value to the owner, he acknowledged that he had not and said:\nI am not in a position to assess what value the Gagetown Lumber Company might put on these lands over [sic] a long-termed project.\nIn the reasons for judgment delivered by the learned President, he approved this method of valuation, saying that he considered it to be basically sound. With respect, I disagree. Without using the term, MacFarlane, repudiating any idea that he had either considered its value to the owner or whether an informed owner in the position of the appellant would have agreed to sell at any such figure, simply expressed his opinion as to what was the market value of the property, meaning by that expression the amount it would realize if the owner was under compulsion to sell for what it would bring on the open market. He expressed no opinion as to the amount which would be agreed upon if the owner, willing but not obliged to sell, bargained with a purchaser, desirous but not required to purchase. This, in some of the decided cases, is referred to as a method of determining the market value and if it be assumed, as I think it should be, that in these circumstances the owner would not part with his property for less than its worth to him, the amount agreed upon might well be taken as the true value. Nothing of that kind was attempted by this witness, as his evidence made abundantly clear.\nThe witness Colter, also an experienced lumberman, called as a witness by the Crown, who valued the freehold limits at $251,978 was not asked and did not assume to express any opinion as to the value of these properties to the owner. According to him, his instructions were limited to being told by a representative of the Department that \u201che would like to have from me an idea of what I thought the property was worth\u201d. It is unnecessary to repeat what was said in the judgment of this Court delivered by the Chief Justice of Canada in Woods Manufacturing Company Limited v. The King 14, where the principles to be applied in these matters, stated many times theretofore in this Court, were restated. In determining the value to the owner, all advantages which the land possesses, present or future, in his hands are to be taken into consideration, and he is entitled to have the price assessed in reference to those advantages which will give the land the greatest value. These timber limits, well served by roads situate so closely to the mill at Gagetown, had obviously a value to the appellant which they would not have to someone who did not have like facilities for converting the logs into lumber, and a long-established business designed and effective for disposing of the lumber at a profit. Other than the evidence of these two witnesses and some evidence as to the sales of other properties in the vicinity, no evidence was adduced by the Crown directed to the real question to be decided. On the other hand, the opinion as to value given by Roberts and other supporting witnesses called by the appellant, based on the assumption that over the years all the trees growing upon the properties would mature and might be cut into lumber and sold at profits similar to those which might have been realized from the sale of lumber at the time of the expropriation, cannot be accepted. Too many assumptions of fact as to matters which are, of necessity, uncertain were made, such as the future prices which may be realized for lumber and the cost of producing it, to make the resulting figure of value in arriving at a conclusion. The risk of damage or destruction of the timber by any of the perils to which it is subject appears also to have been ignored.\nI have read and reread this extensive record in order to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to enable us to determine the compensation which should have been awarded, rather than to send this matter back for a new trial. In the Woods case, where the Court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for this purpose, that course was followed and I have come to the conclusion that it-may properly be done in the present case. A most thorough cruise of both the freehold and licensed properties was made by the witness E. W. Roberts at the instance of the appellant and a detailed report was put in evidence. Unlike the ordinary timber cruise intended to ascertain only the merchantable timber upon the limit, Roberts made what was in effect an inventory of the trees growing upon the properties 5 inches in diameter and over. With a minor change due to the fact that, in error, he had not cruised a small area of the properties, the parties agreed on the accuracy of his figures. It was by the use of the information thus disclosed, and not by an independent examination, that the witness MacFarlane formed his opinion as to the value of the properties. He did this by assuming that his proposed purchaser, paying the amount of his estimate of the value of the property, would want to recover his money and realize his profit within 3 years. On this footing, he estimated the amount that would be realized from the logging of the trees suitable for manufacture into lumber and the subsequent sale of the lumber and from cutting the other trees too small to be used for lumber which were of sufficient size for sale as pulpwood. In forming his conclusion as to what such a purchaser would be prepared to pay, he made a calculation as to the costs of these operations, of necessity estimating the average prices which would be realized over the 3-year period for the lumber and pulp-wood produced. According to him, if such a purchaser paid $230,000 for the freehold properties, he could expect to realize a profit of something more than $37,000 in the operation.\nAn examination of MacFarlane\u2019s figures in relation to the freehold property shows that he estimated a net profit from the sale of pulpwood of something more than $246,000 and from the sale of lumber approximately $110,000. The learned President considered that MacFarlane\u2019s estimate of the profit which would be realized on spruce pulpwood was too low and that the expenses which would be incurred in the operations on the property were in some respects too high. MacFarlane had valued the land itself after being completely logged and all the pulpwood cut at $2 an acre, and this, the learned President considered, should be increased to $3 an acre. He, however, accepted Mac- Farlane\u2019s figure as to the prospective realization from the lumber produced. In the result, he added $100,000 to his estimate of the value of the freehold lands at the date of the expropriation.\nIn my opinion, MacFarlane\u2019s figure as to the amount which, it might be expected, would be realized from the sale of lumber was too low. The witness was not himself engaged in the lumber business and did not, of his own knowledge, know the average prices realized from the sale of lumber exported to the United Kingdom and the United States, in either the year 1951 or 1952. As to this, he was permitted to say that he had requested a lumber sales manager of Fraser Companies Limited to ask one of the oldest brokers in New Brunswick shipping to the United Kingdom market, and used the information thus obtained in estimating the realization from the lumber. He did not say what year the price related to or say what prices were realized on lumber exported to the United States or give any further information on the subject. The broker was one Colin MacKay of Saint John but he was not called as a witness. Relying upon this information, he estimated the price which would be realized by a purchaser for spruce, fir and red pine lumber at $62.50 per M f.o.b. St. John: for white pine $66 per M, for hemlock $57.50 per M. He estimated the overall cost of producing and delivering the lumber f.o.b. Saint John at $47.25 per M. Using these figures, he arrived at a prospective profit on 5,247,294 feet of spruce, fir and red pine lumber of $80,021.23: on 1,394,291 feet of white pine of $26,142.96 and on 362,752 feet of hemlock of $3,718.21.\nAs opposed to these figures the appellant called a chartered accountant, Clifford Warner, employed by the firm of MacDonald, Currie and Company, who had compiled from the books of the company a record of the actual sales and production costs of the company for the year 1952. This showed the average price being received for pine lumber at the time of the expropriation at $94.16 per M and for fir and spruce $75.15 per M. This was f.o.b. the mill. The actual cost of production per M was $53.08, which showed a profit for pine lumber of $41.08 per M and for fir and spruce of $22.07. Allingham, who was also the assistant secretary of the company, with the assistance of the auditors, prepared a statement from the books of the company showing the average price realized per M of lumber of all grades, including spruce, pine and culls, for the year 1951 of $75.86: for 1952 $75.99 and for 1953 $76.96.\nNo question of credibility is involved and the complete accuracy of these figures was not questioned by anyone and, in a computation which is to be used in an endeavour to ascertain the value of the realization to the owner, this, in my opinion, should be accepted in preference to the price used by MacFarlane, obtained in the manner above indicated and relating only to sales for export to the United Kingdom. A very large part of the lumber produced was exported to the United States. It must, of course, be borne in mind that MacFarlane\u2019s estimate was as to the lumber, prices which would be realized in the 3-year period commencing in August 1952. In making such calculation, however, the actual figures for the 3-year period given by the appellant are to be preferred to those given by MacFarlane. As representing prices realized in the years 1951, 1952 and 1953 by a lumber company operating at Gagetown, they were proved to be inaccurate.\nIt is to be noted that the actual-costs of the appellant in 1952 for lumber produced at Gagetown exceeded MacFarlane\u2019s estimate of the total cost of the lumber f.o.b. Saint John by $5.83 per M. While the prices realized over the 3-year period for all species was $76.24, accepting as accurate the costs of the appellant in 1952 as disclosed by its books, rather than MacFarlane\u2019s computation, this would show an average profit per thousand feet of all grades of $23.16.\nSubstituting this figure for those used by MacFarlane, this would show a net profit from sales of lumber of $162,212.64 as opposed to MacFarlane\u2019s figure of $109,881. MacFarlane deducted 15 per cent. from his, estimate of a profit on lumber as well as upon pulpwood, on the theory that at least 15 per cent. of the timber would be inoperable, due to the low stand per acre. I am not satisfied on the evidence that this is justified but, if this be accepted and this percentage deducted from the profit on lumber as estimated by him and the profit that would be realized accepting the average figure realized by the appellant, the difference is $44,474. MacFarlane\u2019s estimate of $230,000 as what a prospective purchaser would pay for the freehold property was the amount which, he considered, a purchaser would be prepared to pay, on the assumption that the resulting profit from the production of lumber would be the lesser amount estimated by him. The increase of $100,000 made by the learned trial judge was simply added to the amount of MacFarlane\u2019s estimate and no attempt was made to determine what the prospective purchaser might be expected to pay on the footing that the profits to be realized would be $100,000 in excess of MacFarlane\u2019s estimate. With respect, if the basis adopted by MacFarlane was to be accepted as correct, this manner of dealing with the matter was inaccurate. I mention this as the fact that while, in my opinion, the amount to be realized from the 3-year operation contemplated by MacFarlane in making his estimate should be increased by $44,474, it does not follow that the prospective purchaser would pay this added amount for the property. Clearly,. however, both additions would have substantially increased MacFarlane\u2019s estimate of the price to be obtained in this way.\nWhile no one suggests (least of all MacFarlane) that the appellant, with its long-established lumber business, would have stripped its land in this manner, depriving itself of the annual log supply which, the evidence shows, the land would have afforded, MacFarlane\u2019s estimate is of some value in determining the value of the property to the owner. The estimate, with the additions made by the learned trial judge and, with the addition that should be made in regard to the realization from lumber, can, I think, properly be accepted as showing what the owner could have realized had he stripped the property in this manner. It may be said that it had at least a value of the amount that a prudent person in the position of the appellant would have paid rather than be dispossessed and deprived of the property.\nThe appellant, proceeding, in my opinion, on a proper basis, undertook to show the value of the properties to it by having a most accurate cruise made and by evidence as to the prospective annual cut of logs suitable for the manufacture of lumber which might be expected from the property. Roberts, whose competency on this aspect of the matter no one would question, estimated that the owners could expect to cut annually, commencing in 1952, approximately 2,000,000 feet b.m. of logs from the freehold and licensed lands combined. Reid had estimated the annual cut would be between 1\u00bd and 2\u00bd million feet and Allingham agreed with this figure. Their evidence on this point stands wholly uncontradicted. They did not, however, estimate the amount to be expected from the freehold property as distinguished from the licensed lands. As to this, the most favourable view that can be put upon the matter from the standpoint of the appellant is that one-half of an anticipated annual cut of 2,000,000 feet might be expected from the freehold lands. Other than the figures which I have quoted as to the profits realized from the operations in 1951, 1952 and 1953, the appellant gave no evidence from which any accurate estimate might be made of the worth to it of such a source of supply. The cut at the Gagetown mill apparently averaged 5,000,000 feet and, on the assumption above stated, the freehold lands would have supplied 20 per cent. of these requirements for an indefinite period of time. As the evidence indicates, the source of supply of logs from farmers in the vicinity of Gagetown was progressively dwindling, which increased the value of this property to the company.\nIf it were to be assumed that the appellant might have obtained annually a million feet from these freehold properties and that a net profit equal to the average in the years 1951-1953 would be realized from the sale of the lumber, this would produce a net income of roughly $23,000 a year. There is a method of estimating compensation to an owner in possession by multiplying the highest annual value which he might expect to obtain from the land by the number of years\u2019 purchase which the special circumstances require. As stated by Cripps on Compensation, 8th ed. 1938, p. 187, the number of years\u2019 purchase depends upon the interest which the property should yield to a purchaser and should be taken from the recognized tables. Thus, if a property should yield to a purchaser 4 per cent., the number of years\u2019 purchase would be 25. If this principle were applied in the present matter and the return to be expected from these lands fixed at 4 per cent. and the annual return to be $23,000, the value of such a prospective income as of the date of the expropriation would greatly exceed the compensation that has been awarded. I am, however, of the opinion that this method is not to be adopted in connection with the earnings of an enterprise such as this, subject to so many fluctuations that it is impossible to determine with accuracy what return may be depended upon.\nAs stated in Pastoral Finance Association, Limited v. The Minister 15, the problem is to determine what amount a prudent man in the position of the owner would have been willing to pay for this property sooner than fail to obtain it. This principle, as pointed out in the judgment of this Court in Woods Manufacturing Company Limited v. The King 16, has been adopted and consistently followed in this Court. Applying it in the present matter, the question is as to what amount a prudent person in the position of the appellant company, with its long-established lumber export business, its facilities at Gagetown for the manufacture and shipping of lumber situated so close to the property, with access to it by good roads, being in possession of the property but without title to it, would be willing to pay sooner than fail to obtain it.\nThat the property was of peculiar value to the appellant is too clear for argument. In the absence, however, of sufficient evidence to determine its value to the appellant as a permanent source of logs for its mill, if a rehearing is to be avoided the matter can only be dealt with by utilizing the available evidence as to what would be realized from marketing the timber and pulpwood on the property. Taking MacFarlane\u2019s estimate of the profit which could be realized over a period of 3 years from the sale of lumber and pulpwood, which was $302,951.03, and adding to this $100,000, being the increase made in the judgment at the trial, and the further sum of $44,474 as the increased profit which could be realized from the lumber, this shows an aggregate profit of $447,425. As the evidence shows, there was an ample supply of labour available and, with the facilities at the disposal of the appellant company, all of the timber suitable for the manufacture of lumber could have been cut and manufactured within a year from the date of expropriation. Upon an operation carried out in this manner, the appellant could, as shown by the evidence as to the price realized by it on lumber for the years 1952 and 1953, have realized a profit in the amount above stated, while incurring only one year\u2019s taxes on the property and , only one year\u2019s interest on the investment entering into the computation of net profits. In my opinion, a purchaser in the position of the appellant would be prepared to pay not less than $380,000, a figure which, it will be noted, would show a net profit on the realization from the lumber and pulpwood in excess of $65,000.\nI would, accordingly, increase the amount of the award in respect of the freehold properties to $380,000.\nThe judgment appealed from determined the amount of compensation to be paid to the Province of New Brunswick for the lands subject to the licences at the sum of $344,000 and to the appellant as compensation for the loss of its interest in the lands under the licences at the sum of $42,000.\nThe licences held by the appellant were of two kinds. Under a sawmill licence which had been in force for many years and which was renewed for a further year on August 1, 1952, the appellant was licensed to cut all grades of timber, lumber and wood as permitted by the regulations relating to Crown lands in an area of 58\u00bd square miles. Of this area, approximately 13 square miles were expropriated. This licence, on its face, was stated to be subject to renewal annually by yearly renewals to August 1, 1963. By the regulations made under the provisions of The Crown Lands Act, the licensee was required to operate a sawmill and to cut on the limits in each year such quantity of timber as might be fixed by the Minister and, in any event, not less than 10,000 feet b.m. from each square mile covered by the licence. Except with permission which might be granted upon application, no trees were to be cut of less than a specified diameter. The regulations effective as of August 1, 1952, fixed the stumpage payable in respect of spruce, fir, cedar and red pine logs at $8 per thousand, for hemlock at $7 and white pine at $9 per thousand. The timber licence issued to the appellant on August 1, 1953, covered an area of 35\u00bd square miles, of which approximately 8 were expropriated. This licence was for a year certain, there being no contractual right of renewal as was the case with the sawmill licence. As in the case of the other licence, the rights granted were to be exercised subject to the regulations made under The Crown Lands Act.\nMacFarlane expressed the opinion that the value as freehold to a prospective purchaser of these lands \u201chad the Province offered these lands for sale free of all encumbrances on August 7, 1952\u201d was $274,000. By s. 78 of The Crown Lands Act such sales must be made at public auction and the lands or the interest sold to the highest bidder. His method of arriving at that figure was similar to that employed in arriving at his conclusion as to the freehold lands of the appellant. Asked to make a separate valuation of the licensee\u2019s interest to a prospective purchaser, he estimated there would be a profit of $113,092.95 from sales of pulpwood and lumber and that a prospective purchaser might pay $64,000 for the licensee\u2019s interest. This figure did not contemplate a sale at auction. The learned trial judge, apparently considering this to be excessive, allowed $42,000, being approximately $2,000 per square mile.\nBy the judgment at the trial, a sum of $112,000 was added to MacFarlane\u2019s figure for the Crown lands as freehold, the addition being in relation to the same matters for which the addition of $100,000 was made for the freehold lands. From this, the amount of $42,000 fixed as the value of the licensee\u2019s interest was deducted, resulting in the allowance to the Crown in right of the Province of the amount of $344,000. The Crown in right of the Dominion has not appealed from this finding. By the cross-appeal, the Province asks that the amount should be increased substantially and that the amount allowed to the appellant be reduced.\nTo deal first with the cross-appeal, it is clear from the evidence, and indeed it is the argument advanced by counsel for the Province, that its policy has been for a very long time and still is to license the timber lands owned by the Crown and to regulate the cutting of timber on them in a manner calculated to derive a perpetual annual income. Stumpage rates which were $1 per thousand feet b.m. in 1932 had increased to $8 in 1952 for spruce, fir and red pine logs. The stumpage on white pine logs was in the same period increased from $2 to $9 and on hemlock from $1 to $7. Thus, the Province could look forward to receiving substantial annual payments from the lands in question in the years to come. It is true that the amounts received as stumpage during the 10 years preceding the expropriation , had been negligible but this, it is apparent, would not have continued. It is, I think, proper to assume that, of the 2,000,000 feet estimated by Roberts, Reid and Allingham as the probable annual cut on the freehold and licensed lands combined, half of this should be assigned to the licensed lands. Assuming an average stumpage rate of $8, this would produce an annual income to the Province of $8,000 and, if further substantial increases in these rates which are fixed by the Province should be thought justifiable in the future, that amount might be largely exceeded.\nMacFarlane was apparently not instructed and did not attempt to express an opinion as to the value of these lands to the Province of New Brunswick. While profuse details were given by him as to the manner in which he arrived at his conclusion as to the amount which a prospective purchaser who intended to strip the freehold lands during a 3-year period could realize, none such were given in regard to the licensed lands. The witness, however, apparently proceeded in the same manner as he had in connection with the freehold land by estimating the realization from stripping the land of both timber and pulpwood and, from that, estimating what his prospective purchaser would offer for the property. The learned trial judge added $112,000 to MacFarlane\u2019s figure in respect of the same matters as to which he had made the addition of $100,000 in the case of the freehold property.\nThe same principle is to be applied in deciding upon the value of this property as freehold in the hands of the Province, as in the case of the freehold lands of the appellant. No one would seriously suggest, I think, that those having the responsibility of administering the timber lands of the Province would think that the most favourable use to which these lands could be put was to cut all the merchantable timber and pulpwood, an operation which, according to the witness MacFarlane, would mean that nothing could be derived from the property for approximately 30 years. Unlike the appellant, the Province was not engaged in the manufacture of lumber and, accordingly, did not have the facilities of the appellant to profitably operate the property, either as a source of log supply or in the conversion of the merchantable timber into lumber within a comparatively short period of time.\nI am unable to find in this record any evidence to support a higher valuation than that placed by the learned President on these lands as freehold in the hands of the Province. It is to be remembered that I refer to their value as freehold unaffected by the rights of the licensee which, I agree, must be considered separately. As to the licences, I agree with the learned President that they gave the appellant an interest in the land for which it is entitled to compensation. In the case of the sawmill licence, the appellant was entitled, upon compliance with the regulations, to renewals for a period of substantially 11 years from the date of the expropriation. The timber licence, current at the time of the expropriation, expired on August 1, 1953, and renewing it was merely a matter of grace on the part of the Province. I also agree that the prospect that the Province would have continued to renew the licence from year to year is not in itself an interest in land for which compensation can be awarded.\nMacFarlane followed the same method in coming to his conclusion as to the value of the licences to a prospective purchaser as he had adopted in regard to the freehold lands. Estimating that cutting all the logs suitable for lumber and for pulpwood over a 3-year period, a profit of $113,092.95 could be realized, he was of the opinion that such a purchaser would offer $64,000 for the licences. He made no attempt to estimate their value in the hands of the appellant and expressed no opinion as to whether or not the appellant, in bargaining with a prospective purchaser and being under no obligation to sell, would have agreed to any such amount.\nIn arriving at his conclusion as to the profit that would be realized, MacFarlane included an amount of $74,543.30 for the sale of 37,728 cords of spruce and fir pulpwood. In valuing the interest of the licensee, this must be omitted since the licences did not permit cutting any of the trees for this purpose and it is not to be assumed that the Province would grant a special permit to cut growing timber of a size suitable only for pulpwood when the stumpage rate was only a fraction of that payable for sawlogs. Upon 6,023,258 feet of spruce, fir and red pine lumber, he estimated a profit of $7.25 per thousand, making $43,668.20. This profit was the estimate he had made in regard to the freehold property, less $8 stumpage payable on the licensed lands. Upon 1,426,362 feet of white pine lumber, he estimated a profit of $9.75 per thousand and on 286,744 feet of hemlock lumber $3.25 per thousand, in both cases deducting the appropriate stumpage from his previous estimate. From these two last-mentioned species, he estimated a profit of $14,848.95. As in the case of the lumber from the freehold lands, he deducted 15 per cent. from all of these figures in respect of timber growing upon lands which, he considered, would prove inoperable.\nIn making this computation, as I have said, MacFarlane used the price of lumber delivered at Saint John which he had used in his other calculation, relating only to export sales to the United Kingdom, and which was shown to be inaccurate, being roughly from $10 to $19 per thousand, according to the species, less than the average for all grades of lumber, including culls, realized by the appellant at Gagetown over the 3-year period 1951 to 1953. The error substantially decreased the anticipated realization from lumber. His computation contained a further error in that the figures used in estimating the profit on the lumber included logs from the land subject to the timber licence which, according to the evidence of the witness Brown, an official in the employ of the Department of Lands in the Province, were smaller than the size permitted to be cut by the regulations. According to him, the quantities of saw-logs larger than the diameter limits specified by the Timber regulations on these lands, as shown in the Roberts cruise, were 364 M spruce and fir, 45 M red pine, 140 M white pine and 28 M hemlock, a total of 577,000 feet. The figures of quantities used by MacFarlane in estimating the realization included 1,089 M of spruce, fir and red pine logs, 329 M of white pine and 286 M of hemlock logs, these figures omitting fractions of thousands. It cannot be assumed, in my opinion, that the Province would have permitted the cutting of these undersized logs during the year the timber licence was to run and I think it is only timber of the size which might have been cut under its terms which should be included in the calculation. As to that part of the remainder of these quantities attributable to the sawmill licence, part at least was less than the permitted size but, as to this, since the licence had 11 years to run and since these figures are advanced on behalf of the Crown, it is proper to assume, in my opinion, that the quantities shown would be of a size which it was permissible to cut within a 3-year period.\nWith these alterations and estimating the profit which, it might be anticipated, would result by applying the costs and the average realization of the appellant over the above-mentioned 3-year period, MacFarlane\u2019s proposed operation would show a profit, after making the same 15 per cent. deduction, of $89,632.78. This figure does not exhaust the profit which the appellant might reasonably have expected to realize from the sawmill limits. Unlike the freehold land, these figures represent only realization upon the merchantable timber of sufficient size to be cut under the Timber Regulations and do not include pulpwood. As shown by Brown\u2019s computation, within a further period of 10 years at least 3,000,000 feet additional would mature sufficiently to permit the logging of the timber. I am, however, unable to find evidence in this regard sufficient to enable me to estimate the value that should be assigned to this timber in the hands of the appellant.\nAs pointed out by the learned President, very little other evidence was given which is of any assistance in valuing these licences. In 1942 Reid Brothers had purchased licences from another company for 11 square miles for $10,000 and approximately 2\u00bd square miles from another person for $3,054. As at that time stumpage rates and, I must assume, the value of manufactured lumber were so very much less than they were in 1952, this evidence is of no value. As shown by Brown, there had been other sales for considerably less than the $2,000 per square mile allowed in the judgment appealed from but, as there was no information as to the nature of the timber upon these licences, the evidence is of no assistance.\nIn these circumstances, I consider that the compensation should be determined on the available evidence and, in my opinion, a purchaser in the position of the appellant would have been prepared to pay not less than $70,000 for these licences, at which price the operation would realize a net profit in excess of $19,000 in addition to such amounts as might thereafter be realized during the life of the licence as the timber matured, which undoubtedly added very substantially to this value.\nBy arrangement with the Crown the appellant company, following the expropriation, entered upon the freehold and licensed lands and cut substantial quantities of logs and a smaller quantity of pulpwood. Details of the quantities cut were given in the exhibit Z5 which was introduced into evidence by the witness Allingham. In addition to stating the quantities cut, the appellant estimated the stumpage to be paid to the Crown, in the absence of any agreement on the point, at the figures which it claimed in computing its claim to compensation from the Crown. The estimate of value made by Roberts in which these figures were used was rejected by the learned trial judge as exorbitant but, in computing the amount of credit that the Crown was entitled to for the logs and pulpwood so cut, the appellant was charged at these rates. In my opinion, since the evidence of MacFarlane and Colter as to the value of the timber and pulpwood, with the additions made by the learned trial judge to which I have referred, was accepted, a stumpage rate based on these figures should be accepted rather than the rate found to be so excessive. In computing the amount payable, I would apply a stumpage rate of $10 per thousand for spruce, fir and red pine, $15 for white pine and $7 for hemlock. With an addition of $1 per thousand for fir, red pine and hemlock, these are Colter\u2019s figures as shown in ex. 15 prepared by him. As to the pulpwood, I would add $1 per cord to Colter\u2019s figure. Upon this basis the amount of credit to be applied on the appellant\u2019s claim is the sum of $36,896.50 in lieu of the credit of $47,323 allowed in the judgment appealed from.\nAs to the claim of the appellant for the cost of the survey made prior to the expropriation which consisted of running and painting lines around the defendant\u2019s freehold and licensed lands, I agree with the learned President that this was simply one of the factors to be taken into consideration in valuing the lands and should not be allowed. I find nothing in the evidence to indicate that their value was increased by this work. I can see no ground for interference in the amount of the award made for the loss on mill-yard equipment or for disturbance.\nThe learned President, while allowing 10 per cent. for compulsory taking in respect of the compensation fixed for the freehold lands, refused such allowance in respect of the interest of the appellant under the licences. I am unable to perceive any logical reason why it should be allowed as to the one and refused as to the other. In accordance with the decisions of this Court the allowance should, in my opinion, be made. I may add that I am far from being satisfied that the increased compensation I would allow in respect of these licences is the full measure of their value to the owner but, on the evidence in this record, I do not consider any larger sum should be awarded.\nThe amount awarded to the appellant at the trial in respect of the licences was deducted from the amount found to be the value of the lands as freehold in the hands of the Province. There has been no appeal from the award made to the Province and, accordingly, that matter being res judicata as between the Dominion and the Province, we are without jurisdiction to reduce the amount. Had the Dominion appealed, I would have directed that the amount of $77,000 rather than $42,000 be deducted from the value attributed to the land itself. Since, however, the litigation is between Her Majesty in right of Canada and Her Majesty in right of the Province of New Brunswick, I would assume that the matter would be adjusted between the two Governments by arrangement.\nIn the result, I would allow this appeal with costs and increase the amount of the award in respect of the freehold lands by $50,000 and a further sum of $5,000 for the 10 per cent. allowance for compulsory taking, in respect of the licences by the sum of $28,000 and a further sum of $7,000 for compulsory taking, and by the reduction of credit to be given on the material cut after the expropriation by $10,426.50, these amounts totalling $100,426.50. I would allow interest upon the award, amended to this extent, from the dates fixed in the judgment of the Exchequer Court.\nI would dismiss the cross-appeal of the Province with costs. Abbott J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of considering the reasons of my brother Rand and I share his view that the final valuations reached by the learned President, for both the freehold lands and the Crown lands, were liberal and should not be disturbed. With respect, however, I differ from him as to the amount by which the valuation of appellant\u2019s interest as a licensee of Crown lands should be increased.\nThe economic value to the owner, of timber and sawmill licences such as those held by appellant, cannot exceed the profit potential of such licences after taxes, during the term which the licences still have to run. Difficult though it may be to determine accurately such an amount in advance, it seems clear that the maximum benefit which the holder of such a licence can derive from his licence, is the profit he is able to keep, as a result of cutting and selling the permitted grades of timber during the term of the licence.\nI have used the phrase \u201cprofit potential after taxes\u201d because in capitalizing the profit possibilities during the remainder of the term of the licence, which must be done for the purpose of fixing compensation, a Court cannot, in my opinion, ignore the fact that such profits are subject to tax and that the only benefit the owner gets from the exploitation of his licensed timber limits is his profit after tax.\nIt is in evidence that these timber licences are put up for sale at public auction by the Province and are also bought and sold by private holders. It would seem obvious that the price at which these licences are traded in, must reflect, to a large extent, the value of this profit potential after tax. That being so, evidence as to such prices is clearly of assistance in determining the value of these licences to the owner, in order to fix compensation for compulsory taking.\nEvidence was given as to the price at which licences for timber lands in New Brunswick were bought and sold, and this evidence established that such prices varied a great deal. Mr. Colter, who stated he held some 500 square miles of timber lands under licence, testified that the highest price he had ever paid was $2,000 per square mile. No evidence was given of any higher price ever having been paid although there was evidence of substantially lower prices. Mr. MacFarlane estimated the amount which a prospective purchaser would pay to appellant for its licensed lands at $64,000 or some $2,800 per square mile, but as has been pointed out by the learned President and by my brothers Rand and Locke, in arriving at this estimate he included the value of timber which appellant was not permitted to cut under the terms of its licence. This portion of Mr. MacFarlane\u2019s evidence was given during cross-examination by appellant, the witness stated he had not expected to be called upon to make such an estimate, and that the statement filed as an exhibit to support it, had been prepared by him only the night before. Moreover, I can find no indication in his testimony that, in making his estimate, Mr. MacFarlane took into account any tax payable on profits derived from the exploitation of the licences.\nThe learned President reviewed in detail all the evidence adduced as to the value of appellant\u2019s interest as licensee, and after doing so stated that he could find no justification in this evidence for valuing such interest at a figure higher than the highest amount established as having been paid for similar interests. He therefore fixed the compensation at $42,000. I am unable to say that he was wrong in so doing, and I do not think his finding should be disturbed.\nThe 10 per cent. allowance for a forcible taking was granted on the freehold and I agree with my brothers Rand and Locke that it should be allowed on the value of the licences. On the other matters raised on the appeal and the cross-appeal, I am in agreement with the conclusions of my brother Rand.\nI would allow the appeal with costs; modify the judgment by adding to the amount of the award, (1) $4,200 allowance for compulsory taking in respect of the licensed lands; (2) $3,702, being 50 per cent. of the survey costs, and (3) $10,567 as a reduction in the credit for wood cut after expropriation: a total of $18,469, with interest from. the dates fixed in the judgment of the Exchequer Court. The cross-appeal of the Province should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gilbert, McGloan & Gillis, Fredericton.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: A.

When a property has thereafter continued to be adversely occupied following the making of such a contract, the Courts cannot supply such agreement and determine the consideration; but, since obviously the parties did not intend that one should give and the other receive free occupation, an indemnity, based on the prejudice suffered, should be awarded.\nIn 1922, the plaintiff sold his pharmaceutical stock to the defendant. The contract provided, inter alia, that the defendant would have the right to occupy part of a building owned by the plaintiff \u201cpour toute p\u00e9riode de temps durant laquelle il exploitera le commerce de la Pharmacie \u2026 aux conditions de soixante dollars par mois. Ce prix pourra \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s cinq ans\u201d. After 7 years the rental was raised to \u00a790. The following year, the plaintiff tried unsuccessfully to have it raised to $125. Finally, in May 1949, the plaintiff notified the defendant that the \u201clease\u201d would expire in September of that year unless the defendant agreed to a rental of $225 per month. No agree- ment was reached, and the defendant did not leave the premises. In August 1950, the plaintiff sued for, inter alia, an order of eviction and damages of $225 a month.\nHeld: The defendant\u2019s right to occupy the premises expired in September 1949, as no agreement was reached respecting the consideration to be paid after that date; the plaintiff was entitled to recover S200 per month as a fair indemnity for the occupation since that date.\nPer Taschereau J.: The convention between the parties constituted a lease rather than the ancient and seldom used contract of use and habitation which, like antichresis, is rarely found to-day. All the elements of a lease were present in this case : the plaintiff granted to the defendant the enjoyment of part of his building, during a certain time, for a rent or price of $60 a month, which the latter obligated himself to pay and which could be modified, after 5 years, but only by mutual agreement.\nContracts\u2014Interpretation\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1013 et seq.\nBy virtue of art. 1019 of the Civil Code, a contract, in case of doubt, will be interpreted in favour of the party who contracted the obligation, but only if a doubt still remains after the Courts have tried to determine the common intention of the parties under arts 1013 et seq.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, affirming the judgment at trial and dismissing the action.

Il est en preuve qu\u2019au mois de septembre 1922, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pris possession des lieux, et jusqu\u2019au mois de septembre 1929, il a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant la somme de $60 par mois, montant stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 la convention. A cette derni\u00e8re date, d\u2019un commun accord, le prix d\u2019occupation fut port\u00e9 \u00e0 $90 par mois. Subs\u00e9quemment, soit le 21 mars 1930, l\u2019appelant par lettre ecommand\u00e9e, a inform\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 partir du ler mai 1930, le prix d\u2019occupation serait de $125 par mois. Sur le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer cette somme, le demandeur-appelant a pris une premi\u00e8re action contre le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 pour lui r\u00e9clamer la somme de $500, mais M. le juge Walsh de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avis \u00e9tait insuffisant et a en cons\u00e9quence rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action. Le 13 mai 1949, l\u2019appelant a de nouveau fait parvenir \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un avis lui signifiant que le \u201cbail\u201d de septembre 1922, affectant la pharmacie et le logement, se terminerait le ler septembre 1949. Il lui a aussi fait savoir que s\u2019il continuait \u00e0 occuper les lieux apr\u00e8s cette date, le \u201cloyer\u201d serait de $225 par mois. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait le bail toujours en vigueur, et qu\u2019il d\u00e9sirait s\u2019en tenir exclusivement aux conditions qui y sont contenues. C\u2019est alors qu\u2019au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1950, l\u2019appelant a institu\u00e9 les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures.\nC\u2019est la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une convention qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 entre les parties des relations de locateur et de locataire, et que les dispositions du Code Civil relatives \u00e0 ce contrat doivent s\u2019appliquer. L\u2019appelant soutient aussi que les mots \u201cce prix pourra \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s cinq ans\u201d permettent non pas seulement une unique modification du prix, comme la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en 1929, mais justifient aussi des modifications que des conditions changeantes et al\u00e9atoires peuvent exiger.\nLa conclusion de l\u2019appelant est que le bail a pris fin \u00e0 l\u2019expiration des cinq premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, soit en 1927, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu subs\u00e9quemment qu\u2019une occupation par tol\u00e9rance, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence justifi\u00e9, ayant donn\u00e9 les avis n\u00e9cessaires, devant avoir effet le ler septembre 1949, de r\u00e9clamer comme il le fait, depuis cette date, la somme de $225 par mois, soit la valeur de l\u2019occupation des lieux.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019agit non pas d\u2019un contrat de louage, mais bien d\u2019un contrat d\u2019usage et d\u2019habitation, o\u00f9 les r\u00e8gles du louage ne trouvent pas leur application; que les mots \u201cce prix pourra \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s cinq ans\u201d ne peuvent justifier qu\u2019une seule modification, ce qui d\u2019ailleurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait quand, en 1929, de consentement mutuel, le prix de $90 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9. Ce prix serait donc final tant que le d\u00e9fendeur exploitera le commerce de pharmacie, et sa pr\u00e9tention est donc que le contrat n\u2019a pas pris fin et qu\u2019il subsiste toujours moyennant le paiement de cette mensualit\u00e9.\nJe suis clairement d\u2019opinion que dans l\u2019occurrence, il s\u2019agit bien d\u2019un bail, et que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs de l\u2019usage et de l\u2019habitation ne se rencontrent nullement dans la convention intervenue. L\u2019usage en effet est une sorte d\u2019usufruit restreint, un d\u00e9membrement de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est un droit r\u00e9el temporaire et viager, qui se termine comme se termine l\u2019usufruit. Il donne \u00e0 l\u2019usager la facult\u00e9 de se servir de la chose d\u2019autrui et aussi celle d\u2019en percevoir les fruits, mais jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence seulement de ses besoins et de ceux de sa famille. Ce droit d\u2019usage prend le nom de droit d\u2019habitation lorsqu\u2019il est appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la jouissance totale ou partielle d\u2019une maison d\u2019habitation. Le droit d\u2019habitation se restreint \u00e0 ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u2019habitation de celui \u00e0 qui ce droit est accord\u00e9 et de sa famille. Comme le droit d\u2019usage, il ne peut \u00eatre ni c\u00e9d\u00e9 ni lou\u00e9: Code Civil, arts. 487, 496 et 497.\nComme l\u2019antichr\u00e8se, l\u2019usage et l\u2019habitation sont des vestiges d\u2019un droit antique et surann\u00e9 dont l\u2019application se rencontre rarement de nos jours.\nQuand le commerce de pharmacie a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour la somme de $6,000, et que par convention accessoire, l\u2019intim\u00e9, moyennant paiement, a obtenu un droit d\u2019occupation de certaines parties de l\u2019immeuble, il s\u2019agissait bien d\u2019un bail. Le louage des choses en effet est un contrat par lequel l\u2019une des patries appel\u00e9e locateur, accorde \u00e0 l\u2019autre, appel\u00e9e locataire, la jouissance d\u2019une chose pendant un certain temps, moyennant un loyer ou prix que celle-ci s\u2019oblige de lui payer.\nTous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments se rencontrent dans le pr\u00e9sent cas. L\u2019appelant en effet a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la jouissance de partie de son immeuble, pour un certain temps, en consid\u00e9ration du paiement de $60 par mois, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019obligation de payer. Le prix stipul\u00e9 est de $60 par mois pour les cinq premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es seulement. Apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, le prix peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9, mais seulement comme r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une entente, d\u2019un consentement mutuel. Aucune des parties ne peut arbitrairement et unilat\u00e9ralement augmenter ou diminuer le prix de location. Il n\u2019appartient pas en effet au locateur, et ce serait futile de le soutenir, d\u2019en augmenter le prix, ni au locataire d\u2019exiger une diminution. Il faut une entente, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019entente, le locataire n\u2019est plus tenu de rester dans les lieux, et le locateur est donc lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de ses obligations, et de nouvelles relations prennent alors naissance entre les parties.\nLe prix de location a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9 en 1929 \u00e0 $90 par mois, et ceci comme r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une commune volont\u00e9. Mais \u00e0 mon sens, cette premi\u00e8re augmentation n\u2019\u00e9puise nullement le droit des parties de demander des r\u00e9visions additionnelles de ce loyer, qui cependant, devra \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par entente, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi le prix cesse d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9.\nComme cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019accord intervenu en 1929, alors que le loyer a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 $90 par mois, il me semble indiscutable que les deux parties ont maintenu leurs relations l\u00e9gales de locateur et de locataire jusqu\u2019en 1949, alors que le 13 mai 1949, l\u2019appelant a fait signifier un nouvel avis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il s\u2019autorisait \u00e9videmment de la clause de la convention, relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision du montant du loyer, et adressa alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u00e0 lettre suivante:\nGranby le 13 mai 1949.\nMonsieur SIMON GUIMOND,\nGranby, Que.\nMonsieur,\nVotre bail pour le local de la pharmacie et du logis priv\u00e9, lesquels portaient respectivement, autrefois, les num\u00e9ros 123 et 119, et qui portent, maintenant, les num\u00e9ros 145 et 141 de la rue Principale \u00e0 Granby, se terminera le ler septembre 1949.\nJe vous donne, par les pr\u00e9sentes, avis que si vous entendez occuper lesdits lieux, votre bail sera au mois et le loyer mensuel en sera $225, chauffage et taxe d\u2019eau compris, payable tous les mois, d\u2019avance, le premier de chaque mois.\nVeuillez me dire par la malle, d\u2019ici cinq jours, si vous acceptez ces conditions, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par vous de ce faire, vous aurez \u00e0 quitter lesdits lieux, le ou vers le premier septembre 1949, votre bail devant \u00eatre, alors, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme termin\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit.\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\nDR. WILFRID LORD A cause du refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de se rendre \u00e0 cette demande, l\u2019appelant lui adressa, le 2 septembre, la, lettre suivante:\nGranby, 2 septembre 1949.\nMonsieur Simon Guimond,\nGranby, P.Q.\nMonsieur,\nPour faire suite \u00e0 l\u2019avis qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 le 13 mai 1949, concernant le logement et le magasin que vous occupez en vertu d\u2019un bail qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti le ler septembre 1922, et afin d\u2019\u00e9viter tout malentendu, je d\u00e9sire vous aviser de nouveau, par les pr\u00e9sentes, que je m\u2019oppose au renouvellement de ce bail par tacite reconduction.\nJe veux qu\u2019il soit, bien compris entre nous que si vous entendez continuer d\u2019occuper les lieux lou\u00e9s ce sera pour le loyer mentionn\u00e9 dans la lettre que je vous adressais le 13 mai 1949, et cela \u00e0 partir du ler septembre 1949.\nJe vous donne donc le pr\u00e9sent avis conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions des articles 1609 et 1610 du code civil.\nVotre d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\nWILFRID LORD, M.D.\nA partir de la date que porte cette lettre, je crois que les relations de locateur et de locataire entre l\u2019appelant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont pris fin. Comme cons\u00e9quence des dispositions des arts. 1609 et 1610 du Code Civil, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut invoquer la tacite reconduction, et quoiqu\u2019il ait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper les lieux, le bail ne s\u2019est pas renouvel\u00e9. L\u2019occupation s\u2019est faite contre le gr\u00e9 du locateur et nullement par tol\u00e9rance. Il s\u2019ensuit donc, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019entente quant au loyer apr\u00e8s l\u2019avis donn\u00e9 le 13 mai 1949, que le demandeur avait droit de mettre fin au bail comme il l\u2019a fait, de faire constater par le tribunal cette r\u00e9siliation, et de demander l\u2019expulsion de l\u2019intim\u00e9 des lieux lou\u00e9s. A mon sens, c\u2019est \u00e0 tort que ces recours lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9s.\nVoici ce que dit Planiol et Ripert, Droit Civil, 2e \u00e9d. 1952, Vol. 10, p. 602:\n470. Caract\u00e8re d\u00e9terminable du prix.\u2014Le prix du bail doit \u00eatre non seulement s\u00e9rieux, mais certain, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u00e9termin\u00e9 ou tout au moins d\u00e9terminable. Par suite, si les parties, apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre mises d\u2019accord sur le principe de la conclusion d\u2019un bail, oublient d\u2019en fixer le prix ou n\u2019arrivent pas \u00e0 se mettre d\u2019accord \u00e0 son sujet, le pr\u00e9tendu bail sera frapp\u00e9 d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 absolue, faute de prix. C\u2019est ainsi que sera nul le contrat pr\u00e9voyant que les parties se mettront amiablement d\u2019accord sur le prix, si cet accord n\u2019intervient pas. Si le preneur s\u2019\u00e9tait en fait mis en possession du bien, il ne devra au bailleur aucun loyer, mais une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019occupation repr\u00e9sentative du pr\u00e9judice subi. Il reste la question du montant que peut r\u00e9clamer l\u2019appelant. Il a sans doute droit \u00e0 une compensation raisonnable pour l\u2019occupation des lieux par l\u2019intim\u00e9 depuis le ler septembre 1949, jusqu\u2019au mois de janvier 1951 inclusivement, soit une p\u00e9riode de 17 mois. Comme r\u00e9sultat de la terminaison du bail, cette compensation ne sera pas bas\u00e9e sur le prix fix\u00e9 par consentement en 1929, mais doit \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la valeur locative des lieux occup\u00e9s. La preuve, et particuli\u00e8rement le t\u00e9moignage de monsieur Meunier, \u00e9valuateur en chef de la Cit\u00e9 de Granby, me convainc que les fins de la justice seront bien servies en fixant cette valeur locative \u00e0 $200 par mois, ce qui fait un total de $3,400. De cette somme, cependant, il faudra d\u00e9duire le montant consign\u00e9 avec le plaidoyer \u00e0 la demande principale, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la demande incidente, soit $1,620, laissant une balance de $1,780.\nL\u2019appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu. Le bail intervenu entre les parties est r\u00e9sili\u00e9, \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit; ordre est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de quitter les lieux lou\u00e9s dans un d\u00e9lai de trente jours de la date du pr\u00e9sent jugement. Les offres et consignations au montant de $1,620 que l\u2019appelant est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 retirer, sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es insuffisantes, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra payer la balance de $1,780, plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux de 5 pour cent, depuis la date du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Tous les droits de l\u2019appelant pour les montants \u00e9chus depuis le mois de janvier 1951 sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 paiera \u00e9galement les frais de toutes les Cours.\nThe judgment of Locke, Fauteux and Nolan JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Le ler septembre 1922, l\u2019appelant, qui est m\u00e9decin, reconnaissait avoir vendu les marchandises et fixtures d\u2019une pharmacie par lui exploit\u00e9e au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e d\u2019un immeuble lui appartenant, \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, son beaufr\u00e8re, \u00e0 qui il conc\u00e9dait, \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux, le droit d\u2019occuper, tant qu\u2019il y poursuivrait cette exploitation, le local de cette pharmacie et un logement y attenant; le tout aux termes et conditions apparaissant \u00e0 un \u00e9crit r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par lui, sign\u00e9 par les deux parties et se lisant comme suit:\nGranby, le ler septembre\/22\nJe reconnais par les pr\u00e9sentes avoir vendu \u00e0 Simon Guimond mon stock de Pharmacie et fixtures, le tout situ\u00e9 dans l\u2019immeuble N\u00b0 121 rue Principale \u00e0 Granb.

Toutefois ce droit ne sera pas exclusif, mais raisonnable et bas\u00e9 sur bonne entente avec le propri\u00e9taire ou locataire de l\u2019immeuble en partie lou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur.

Il a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant $60 par mois jusqu\u2019au ler d\u00e9cembre 1929, alors que, d\u2019un commun accord, la consid\u00e9ration mensuelle fut port\u00e9e \u00e0 $90. Les quelques tentatives faites par l\u2019appelant depuis lors, pour obtenir de l\u2019intim\u00e9 un autre accord sur le prix, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s. Eventuellement, et par une lettre en date du 13 mai 1949, l\u2019appelant avise l\u2019intim\u00e9 que \u201cle bail\u201d ayant pour objet la pharmacie et le logement prendra fin le ler septembre suivant. Il pr\u00e9cise les conditions et le prix auxquels l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourra, s\u2019il le d\u00e9sire, continuer l\u2019occupation des lieux et l\u2019avise qu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9faut d\u2019accepter ces conditions fixant le prix mensuel \u00e0 $225, il devra, le ler septembre 1949, \u00e9vacuer les lieux. Dans une r\u00e9ponse dont le laconisme manifeste la profonde division entre les parties, l\u2019intim\u00e9 informe l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il ne consent pas \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019annulation du bail\u201d et qu\u2019il s\u2019en \u201crapporte \u00e0 ces termes et conditions\u201d. Advenant le 2 septembre 1949, l\u2019appelant avise l\u2019intim\u00e9 que s\u2019il continue d\u2019occuper les lieux, ce sera, \u00e0 compter du ler septembre 1949, au prix mentionn\u00e9 dans sa lettre du 13 mai 1949. A ceci l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais consenti. Le 25 ao\u00fbt 1950, l\u2019appelant prend une action en expulsion et en dommages contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, joignant subs\u00e9quemment une demande incidente \u00e0 sa demande principale. Le tout est rejet\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dont le jugement est maintenu par la Cour d\u2019Appel 3. D\u2019o\u00f9 le pourvoi devant cette Cour.\nC\u2019est la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 que l\u2019accord du ler d\u00e9cembre 1929, portant le prix initial \u00e0 $90, est et demeure depuis cette date la loi des parties; en stipulant, dit-on, Ce prix pourra \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s cinq ans, les parties n\u2019ont envisag\u00e9 qu\u2019une seule modification et celle faite le ler d\u00e9cembre 1929 est d\u00e9finitive. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019appelant soumet qu\u2019en raison de leurs relations, du caract\u00e8re et des termes de leur convention, les parties n\u2019ont voulu d\u00e9terminer le prix d\u2019occupation que pour une p\u00e9riode de cinq ann\u00e9es, entendant que, par la suite, ce prix initial pr\u00e9vaudrait jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019une des parties en rechercherait la modification alors qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019amiable les parties devaient s\u2019entendre sur la question, i.e. le prix et le terme pour lequel il pr\u00e9vaudrait.\nLa disposition de ce litige d\u00e9pend donc (i) de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la convention et (ii) des cons\u00e9quences juridiques en r\u00e9sultant.\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\u2014Comme en a jug\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019Appel, il ne para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider, \u00e0 l\u2019instar du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, si le droit d\u2019occupation conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 est, de sa nature, un droit d\u2019habitation ou un droit r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une location. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et dans les deux cas, ce droit d\u2019occupation r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une convention dans laquelle les parties se sont oblig\u00e9es r\u00e9ciproquement l\u2019une envers l\u2019autre, la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 fournir les lieux, la seconde \u00e0 en payer le prix; c\u2019est cette derni\u00e8re obligation qui fait l\u2019objet du litige et qui. requiert, en cons\u00e9quence, d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e en interpr\u00e9tant la convention \u00ab sur le point litigieux.\nLa commune intention des parties lorsque douteuse doit, suivant les directives donn\u00e9es aux juges, \u00eatre recherch\u00e9e et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par une interpr\u00e9tation plut\u00f4t que par le sens litt\u00e9ral des termes du contrat, dont toutes les clauses doivent s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les unes par les autres en donnant \u00e0 chacune le sens qui r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019acte entier; et ce n\u2019est que si le doute survit \u00e0 cet examen qu\u2019il y a lieu de le r\u00e9soudre en faveur du d\u00e9biteur de l\u2019obligation dont le cr\u00e9ancier recherche l\u2019ex\u00e9cution: Code Civil, arts. 1013 et seq.\nEn stipulant Ce prix pourra \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s cinq ans, les parties ont pr\u00e9vu, vu la long\u00e9vit\u00e9 possible de leurs relations, l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours d\u2019icelles, l\u2019une d\u2019elles pourrait se croire l\u00e9s\u00e9e par le maintien d\u2019un prix immuable ; aussi bien, et anim\u00e9es par cet esprit de bonne entente manifest\u00e9 dans d\u2019autres dispositions de la convention, elles n\u2019ont voulu se lier que pour cinq ans, entendant que si, par la suite, cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 se pr\u00e9sentait, elle devait \u00eatre r\u00e9solue par accord \u00e0 l\u2019amiable. Voil\u00e0, je crois, ce qui r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019acte entier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne nie pas que l\u2019accord du ler d\u00e9cembre 1929, portant la mensualit\u00e9 \u00e0 $90, eut lieu en ex\u00e9cution de la convention, mais pour pr\u00e9tendre que cet accord \u00e9puise la stipulation, il s\u2019appuie en substance sur les deux raisons motivant le jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel, soit:\u2014(i) Sur le fait que la stipulation commence par les mots \u201cCe prix\u201d et non \u201cLe prix.\u201d et qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas suivie des mots \u201cde temps \u00e0 autre\u201d ou autres au m\u00eame effet; et (ii) sur l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de concilier \u201cl\u2019obligation de l\u2019appelant de fournir une sorte d\u2019usage perp\u00e9tuel des lieux\u201d avec \u201cle pouvoir exclusif et discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019exiger d\u2019ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e une augmentation du prix\u201d.\nEn tout respect, je ne puis partager ces vues. Le premier motif s\u2019inspire en partie d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation strictement litt\u00e9rale et par ailleurs non concluante. Si la stipulation n\u2019est pas qualifi\u00e9e par les mots \u201cde temps \u00e0 autre\u201d, elle ne l\u2019est pas davantage par les mots \u201cune seule fois\u201d. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, elle n\u2019est qualifi\u00e9e que par le texte de la convention dans laquelle elle se trouve et rien n\u2019y indique qu\u2019elle doive recevoir la limitation qu\u2019on lui donne en m\u00e9connaissant, je crois, l\u2019esprit conciliant qui pr\u00e9side \u00e0 toute la convention et sur lequel on a cru sage de miser pour son maintien. Quant au second motif, il se fonde sur un caract\u00e8re de permanence qu\u2019on pr\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de l\u2019appelant de fournir l\u2019usage des lieux \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. D\u00e8s apr\u00e8s cinq ans, rien ne devenait plus pr\u00e9caire que la dur\u00e9e de cette obligation. Pour s\u2019en convaincre, on n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 consid\u00e9rer ce qui serait arriv\u00e9 de la convention si les n\u00e9gociations conduisant \u00e0 l\u2019accord de 1929 eussent pris fin sans qu\u2019une entente intervienne. Faute d\u2019entente sur la consid\u00e9ration de l\u2019obligation, l\u2019obligation elle-m\u00eame eut disparu. Voil\u00e0 pourtant ce dont les parties avaient convenu. Elles ont conditionn\u00e9 la survivance de leurs relations contractuelles \u00e0 celle de leur esprit de conciliation. L\u2019intim\u00e9, d\u2019ailleurs, bien qu\u2019invit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce faire, n\u2019a pu sugg\u00e9rer aucune raison supportant la proposition que les parties aient voulu \u00e9carter ce principe \u00e0 la base de leur convention d\u00e8s l\u2019av\u00e8nement d\u2019une premi\u00e8re modification du prix pour que, d\u00e8s lors, ce dernier devienne d\u00e9finitif, que ce soit pour 10, 20 ou 30 ans \u00e0 venir.\nCons\u00e9quences de la convention ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e.\u2014La mensualit\u00e9 de $90 a pr\u00e9valu, par entente, jusqu\u2019au ler septembre 1949; depuis lors, aucun accord n\u2019est intervenu sur un prix. C\u2019est \u00e0 cette date qu\u2019a pris fin la convention. C\u2019est l\u00e0, je crois, la cons\u00e9quence de ce contrat en lequel les parties ont assujetti le maintien, apr\u00e8s 5 ans, de leurs obligations r\u00e9ciproques \u00e0 une condition purement potestative, soit celle de donner ou refuser un acquiescement \u00e0 un prix modifi\u00e9: Code Civil, art. 1081. Et c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que l\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 l\u2019expulsion de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et recherch\u00e9 contre lui, par son action, la condamnation au paiement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour cette occupation adverse des lieux depuis le ler septembre 1949.\nPlaniol et Ripert, Droit civil, 2e \u00e9d. 1952, vol. 10, p. 602, n\u00b0470:\nC\u2019est ainsi que sera nul le contrat pr\u00e9voyant que les parties se mettront amiablement d\u2019accord sur le prix, si cet accord n\u2019intervient pas. Si le preneur s\u2019\u00e9tait en fait mis en possession du bien, il ne devra au bailleur aucun loyer, mais une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019occupation repr\u00e9sentative du pr\u00e9judice subi.\nGuillouard, Trait\u00e9 du contrat de louage, 3e \u00e9d. 1891, tome 1, p. 80, n\u00b0 66:\nSi aucun prix n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas convention valable de louage, celui qui aurait joui de l\u2019immeuble pendant un certain temps, en vertu de cette convention imparfaite, devrait payer au propri\u00e9taire une indemnit\u00e9 qui serait fix\u00e9e par les tribunaux. Il est certain que les parties n\u2019ont pas entendu l\u2019une conc\u00e9der, et l\u2019autre recevoir une jouissance gratuite, et s\u2019il est impossible de suppl\u00e9er \u00e0 leur volont\u00e9 en fixant le prix pour l\u2019avenir, il est possible et l\u00e9gitime de fixer le taux de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 due pour le pass\u00e9 au propri\u00e9taire, d\u00e9pouill\u00e9 de la jouissance de son immeuble. L\u2019appelant mesure son pr\u00e9judice sur la valeur locative des lieux qu\u2019il estime \u00e0 $225 par mois, chauffage et taxe d\u2019eau y compris. Une revue de la preuve et, en particulier, du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019\u00e9valuateur Meunier, justifie de r\u00e9duire ce chiffre \u00e0 $200. La p\u00e9riode totale d\u2019occupation adverse pour laquelle il a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 en son action est de 17 mois. Sur cette base, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant s\u2019\u00e9tablit \u00e0 $3,400. Il touchera $1,620, somme des montants consign\u00e9s en Cour par l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui devra lui payer, en outre, la diff\u00e9rence, soit $1,780. Le dossier ne permet pas d\u2019accorder \u00e0 l\u2019appelant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 additionnelle de $225 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e pour perte anticip\u00e9e de revenus durant le mois suivant l\u2019\u00e9vacuation des lieux.\nJe maintiendrais l\u2019appel et, r\u00e9servant les droits de l\u2019appelant, d\u00e9clarerais que: (i) la convention du ler septembre 1929 a pris fin le ler septembre 1949 et, par la suite, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a occup\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement les lieux y mentionn\u00e9s; (ii) l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 est fix\u00e9e \u00e0 $3,400 et l\u2019offre de la somme de $1,620, que l\u2019appelant aura droit de retirer, est insuffisante; j\u2019ordonnerais \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de quitter les lieux dans les 30 jours du jugement et le condamnerais en outre \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant la somme de $1,780, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis le 19 d\u00e9cembre 1951, date du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.

Barry and Dame Mina Gene Delany (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1956: March 7, 8; 1956: December 21.\nPresent: Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OP QUEEN\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nLiability to account\u2014Trusts and trustees\u2014Loan of company shares to be used as collateral and returned\u2014Shares sold by borrower\u2014Nature of recourse\u2014Administration of, property as foundation of liability to account\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1763, 1765, 1766, 1777\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 566 et seq.\nA testatrix left all her property to her daughter M.J.B., \u201cto be used for herself and daughter (M.G.D.) \u2026 and at the death of my daughter, what may remain is to go to her daughter (M.G.D.)\u201d. She appointed M.J.B., the defendant (her cousin) and the defendant\u2019s husband to be trustees under the will. Included in the succession were shares in two companies, and these shares were registered in the names of the three trustees and delivered to M.J.B. Subsequently M.J.B. lent the certificates to the defendant for the express purpose of being pledged with the defendant\u2019s broker, but with the understanding that M.J.B. would receive the revenue from the shares, and that the certificates would be returned to her at any time she wanted them. Some 18 years later M.J.B. learned that the shares had been sold and, with M.G.D., brought an action against the defendant for an accounting. The action was dismissed by the trial judge on the ground that the only appropriate remedy was a direct action for possession of the shares and their fruits, if any, or for their value. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Rand and Kellock JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the action should be dismissed, since the circumstances did not give rise to an action en reddition de compte. The account that could be claimed in such an action as this was an account of the administration of property on behalf of another, and the existence of such an administration was an essential foundation of the liability to account. Here the agreement between the parties constituted a loan rather than a mandate to administer the shares either for the estate or for the plaintiffs. The defendant was not a trustee, but a mere borrower. Even if she was liable to account for the dividends (which was doubtful), they had all been paid to M.J.B. It was not necessary to decide whether the loan was a pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, where the lender retained both the ownership and the legal possession of the thing lent, or a pr\u00eat de consommation, where the property in the thing passed to the borrower, whose obligation was to return an equivalent. In either case the sanction if the borrower did not perform his obligation to return was a condemnation in money, and this was not what was claimed in this action. Per Rand J., dissenting: The transaction between the parties was that of a pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, where the lender retains the ownership and the legal possession of the property and where the borrower assumes vis-\u00e0-vis the lender duties of a mandatary. As borrower, the defendant was under a duty to conserve and restore the shares, together with all their fruits and accessories, and this obligation could be enforced only after its extent was ascertained by an accounting. The shares were to be held for the double purpose of benefiting both the plaintiff and the defendant, the borrower as mandatary assuming a relation to the plaintiff\u2019s interest which carried with it an accounting responsibility.\nThe same result followed on another view of the facts : the persons named by the will as trustees did actually take the legal title to the shares and by their dealings with each other set up at least a de facto trust in which each assumed toward M.J.\u2019B. and M.G.D. the obligation that the law would have imputed to them, that of fiduciaries.\nAs to M.G.D., her contingent interest in the substitution was sufficient to entitle her to take this conservatory measure. The dealing in the shares took place in the face of the fiduciary duty toward her, and it was beyond controversy that such a duty called for an accounting.\nThe rule observed in this Court that on a matter of procedure the opinion, here unanimous, of the highest Court of the Province should be accorded the greatest respect, helped to fortify the conclusion reached on the case as a whole.\nPer Kellock J., dissenting: It was well settled that this Court would not interfere with the decisions of provincial Courts in. a matter of procedure where no injustice had been suffered; and it could not be said that there could be any injustice to the defendant in upholding right of action requiring her to account for her dealings with the shares, rather than an action for damages in respect of those same dealings.\nThe loan of the shares constituted a pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, which is not inconsistent with the right given here to pledge them. Any intention that the property in the shares would pass to the defendant was excluded in the contract. The only significant difference, for the purposes of this case, between a pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage and a contract of d\u00e9pot, is that the borrower can use the thing loaned whereas the depositary cannot do so without specific permission. But both the borrower and the depositary are bound to restore the identical thing received and, in the case of a chose frugif\u00e8re, as here, to render to the owner all fruits and accessories, whether obtained as a result of their illicit act or not. They are, therefore, both accountable.\nSince the shares ceased by reason of the wrongful sale on the part of the defendant to be in her possession and could not therefore be returned, the plaintiff became entitled to get the equivalent from the defendant and the purpose of the accounting demanded in this action was to establish that equivalent. Apart from the dividends, which might be taken to have been received, the defendant was liable to account for the original shares, for all the shares. into which they were converted or for which other shares were substituted, and for the proceeds. It is well settled in the jurisprudence of the Province that where a defendant not only refuses to give an accounting but refrains from furnishing any information either before the action or during the proceedings, the Court may condemn the defendant to pay a liquidated sum.\nAssuming that the will did not make the defendant a trustee of the shares and that they became the absolute property of the plaintiff, they were in fact conveyed by her to the three trustees, and the trust thus established was accepted by the trustees. On this point of view also the defendant must account.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1, reversing the judgment at trial and ordering an accounting.

Delany, tant personnellement qu\u2019en sa qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire de la succession de Christina Ross Barry, et Mina Gene Delany, ont institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures l\u00e9gales contre Dame Minette Racine, de la Cit\u00e9 de Westmount, tant en sa qualit\u00e9 personnelle qu\u2019en sa qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire de la m\u00eame succession\nLes conclusions de l\u2019action sont \u00e0 l\u2019effet que Minette Racine soit destitu\u00e9e de ses fonctions de fiduciaire, qu\u2019elle soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 rendre compte de tout l\u2019actif de la succession de Christina Ross Barry dont elle aurait eu la possession, ou qu\u2019elle aurait administr\u00e9, et qu\u2019elle soit \u00e9galement condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer tout reliquat de compte, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9f\u00e8re payer \u00e0 la demanderesse Mina J. Barry, la somme de $40,500, et que dans le cas de d\u00e9faut de rendre compte, elle soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer ladite somme de $40,500.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. le Juge J. Archambault a rejet\u00e9 cette action avec d\u00e9pens, mais la Cour d\u2019Appel 2 l\u2019a maintenue en partie. Elle a infirm\u00e9 le jugement et a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e devait rendre compte aux demandeurs de tous les biens de la succession de feu Dame Christina Ross Barry dont elle a eu la gestion ou la possession, et en particulier du produit de la vente des actions de Steel Company of Canada Limited et de Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated, et de tous les dividendes, boni ou actions suppl\u00e9mentaires. qu\u2019elle aurait pu recevoir, le tout sous un d\u00e9lai de trente jours de la date du jugement, \u00e0 moins que la d\u00e9fendresse ne pr\u00e9f\u00e8re payer, sous le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai, la somme de $21,812.80 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat. A d\u00e9faut par la d\u00e9fenderesse de rendre compte sous le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, la Cour a condamn\u00e9 la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer aux appelants, sous un d\u00e9lai de quinze jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour la reddition de compte, la somme de $21,812.80 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter de la date du 7 novembre 1947. La d\u00e9fenderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer les d\u00e9pens et en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour d\u2019Appel.\nLes faits qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 ce litige sont assez simples. Christina Ross Barry, cousine de la d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante, a fait un testament olographe le 29 octobre 1927, et elle a ainsi dispos\u00e9 de ses biens:\nTo my daughter Mina Jane, wife of E. E. Delany, I leave & bequeath all I possess, to be used by her for herself and daughter (Mina Gene Delany) and not to be used, or disposed of, to her husband, or for him, or for any debt of his, and at the death of my daughter, what may remain is to go to her daughter (Mina Gene Delany), the trustees to be Mina Jane Delany, Yvon Dupr\u00e9 and his wife Minette Dupr\u00e9. My remains to be cremated, and the least possible expense to be incurred for funeral.\n(Signed) Christina Ross Barry.\nAlso I do not wish Mina ever to go West again, or her money to be used in any business scheme where Ernest is concerned.\n(Signed) C. R. Barry.\n(Les italiques sont de moi.)\nLa testatrice est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le 6 janvier 1928, et ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi.\nOn voit donc que deux des \u201ctrustees\u201d, Minette Racine Dupr\u00e9, la d\u00e9fenderesse, et Mina Jane Delany sont en cause. Le troisi\u00e8me \u201ctrustee\u201d Yvon Dupr\u00e9, mari de Minette Racine Dupr\u00e9, est maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.\nQuelque temps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la testatrice, le Notaire Joron, qui apparemment s\u2019occupait du r\u00e8glement des affaires de la succession, a, le 16 mai 1928, remis \u00e0 l\u2019un des \u201ctrustees\u201d, M. Yvon Dupr\u00e9, certaines valeurs mobili\u00e8res, dont un certificat pour 119 actions de la Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated, et un autre certificat pour 71 actions ordinaires de Steel Company of Canada Limited. Ces deux certificats \u00e9taient enregistr\u00e9s au nom des \u201ctrustees de la succession C. Ross Barry\u201d et M. Dupr\u00e9 en a accus\u00e9 r\u00e9ception sous sa signature. Peu apr\u00e8s, M. Dupr\u00e9 a remis ces certificats \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui les a gard\u00e9s dans son coffret de s\u00fbret\u00e9. C\u2019\u00e9tait bien une reconnaissance des droits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 sa possession personnelle de ces valeurs suivant les termes m\u00eames du testament, o\u00f9 les mots significatifs \u201cto be used by her\u201d sont employ\u00e9s.\nCe sont les seules valeurs dont il soit question dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Subs\u00e9quemment, Mina Jane Barry (Delany), la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, remit ces deux certificats \u00e0 l\u2019appelante qui s\u2019en servit comme garantie collat\u00e9rale de son compte au bureau de courtage de Shearson Hammill & Co. \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Il est bon de noter que les actions de Steel Company of Canada Limited furent subs\u00e9quemment subdivis\u00e9es en quatre, ce qui faisait que les h\u00e9ritiers d\u00e9tenaient en tout 284 actions de cette compagnie.\nAucun document bilat\u00e9ral constate la nature de la transaction intervenue entre Mina Jane Delany et l\u2019appelante Minette Racine Dupr\u00e9. Deux exhibits importants ont, \u00e9t\u00e9 produits au dossier. Le premier, en date de juillet 1928, se lit ainsi:\nWestmount, 210 Edgehill Road,\nJuly 28\nThis is a note to my estate in case of death.\nThere is in Shearson, Hammill & Co. at their Montreal office (184 St. James Street) deposited as collateral, a certificate of seventy one shares of Steel Company of Canada, and one, of one hundred and nineteen shares of Montreal, Light Heat & Power Consolidated against account Yvon Dupre # 592 # 2. These certificates belong to the Estate of the late Mrs. C. R. Barry & should be returned to her heir Mrs. Mina J. Delany who lent them to me and to whom they belong.\n(sgd) M. R. Dupre\n\u201c Yvon Dupre\nLe second, en date du 24 janvier 1929, est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\nWestmount, 210 Edgehill Road\nJanuary 24th, 1929.\nThis is to certify that I have in my possession certificates of one hundred & nineteen (119) shares of Montreal Light Heat & Power Consolidated, two hundred and eighty-four (284) shares of Steel Company of Canada belonging to the Estate of the late Mrs. C. R. Barry which are deposited as collateral security at the office of Shearson Hammill & Co. Montreal (184 St. James Street).\nThese shares were lent to me by the heir of the late Mrs. Barry, Mrs. Mina J. Delany; to be used as such, and I agree to return same to her at any time she wants them back.\n(sgd) M. R: Dupre\n\u201d Yvon Dupre\nDans le cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932, ces actions furent vendues sans doute pour combler le d\u00e9ficit du compte de l\u2019appelante chez le courtier, et celle-ci fut en cons\u00e9quence dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de retourner ces valeurs \u00e0 leur propri\u00e9taire, et de remplir l\u2019obligation \u00e0 laquelle elle s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e. C\u2019est en 1946 seulement que suivit l\u2019action en reddition de compte. Cependant, avant que cette action ne fut intent\u00e9e, l\u2019appelante versa, comme elle s\u2019y \u00e9tait d\u2019ailleurs oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la transaction, tous les dividendes d\u00e9clar\u00e9s par les deux compagnies, et un certain acompte sur le capital.\nLe plaidoyer de la d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante est \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas comptable envers la demanderesse, et elle a en outre soutenu qu\u2019il s\u2019agit en l\u2019occurrence d\u2019un pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, et que si les certificats de valeurs mobili\u00e8res qui font l\u2019objet de ce pr\u00eat ne peuvent \u00eatre remis, parce qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus, le seul recours de la cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re n\u2019est pas une action en reddition de compte, mais bien une r\u00e9clamation personnelle en argent pour la valeur des choses pr\u00eat\u00e9es.\nIl est certain que s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un pr\u00eat, la transaction intervenue peut avoir le caract\u00e8re d\u2019un pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage ou d\u2019un pr\u00eat de consommation. Le pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage est en effet un contrat par lequel l\u2019une des parties livre une chose \u00e0 une autre personne, qui peut s\u2019en servir gratuitement pendant un temps, mais qui doit ensuite la rendre au pr\u00eateur: Code Civil, art. 1763. Dans ce cas, le pr\u00eateur entend conserver la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose et a droit d\u2019en exiger la restitution. Si la restitution devient une impossibilit\u00e9,, parce que l\u2019emprunteur a dispos\u00e9 de la chose pr\u00eat\u00e9e, le recours du cr\u00e9ancier-pr\u00eateur est de r\u00e9clamer la valeur de la chose qui a fait l\u2019objet du contrat.\nAu contraire, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un pr\u00eat de consommation, le pr\u00eateur livre \u00e0 l\u2019emprunteur une certaine chose qui se consomme par l\u2019usage, \u00e0 la charge par ce dernier de lui rendre une autre chose de m\u00eame esp\u00e8ce et de m\u00eame qualit\u00e9 : Code Civil, art. 1777.\nDes opinions diverses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises concernant la nature du pr\u00eat de valeurs mobili\u00e8res. Ainsi, certains auteurs soutiennent que le pr\u00eat de valeurs mobili\u00e8res constitue un pr\u00eat de consommation, vu qu\u2019elles sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre vendues, et particuli\u00e8rement, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe. Dans le premier cas, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 demeure au pr\u00eateur; dans le second, vu qu\u2019il y a consommation, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019emprunteur: Dalloz, Petit Dictionnaire de Droit, p. 997; Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, vol. 3, p. 529; Dalloz, Encyclop\u00e9die, Droit Civil, vol. 4, p. 90, No 225; Ripert, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, vol. 2, 3e ed. 1949, p. 881.\nJe ne crois pas, pour la d\u00e9termination de cette cause, qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir cette distinction, car, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage ou d\u2019un pr\u00eat de consommation, la sanction \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par l\u2019emprunteur de remplir son obligation, doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre une condamnation p\u00e9cuniaire.\nMais, ce n\u2019est pas ce qui est r\u00e9clam\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente action. La demanderesse-intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame une reddition de compte. Le compte, au sens de la reddition du compte, est l\u2019expos\u00e9 d\u2019une gestion faite dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019autrui. C\u2019est la pr\u00e9sentation \u00e0 celui pour qui on a g\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019on a re\u00e7u et de ce qu\u2019on a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 pour lui, \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019arriver \u00e0 la fixation du reliquat, si la recette exc\u00e8de la d\u00e9pense, ou de l\u2019avance, si la d\u00e9pense exc\u00e8de la recette. La reddition de compte est due par ceux qui ont administr\u00e9 le bien d\u2019autrui, \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit. Ainsi doivent des comptes, tout mandataire ou g\u00e9rant, le tuteur, l\u2019h\u00e9ritier b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, le curateur \u00e0 une succession vacante, l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, le s\u00e9questre, les associ\u00e9s, le fiduciaire, etc. Il est essentiel, pour donner naissance au droit de l\u2019oyant de r\u00e9clamer un compte, que le rendant compte ait eu la d\u00e9tention de certains biens, et en ait eu l\u2019administration: Dalloz, Petit Dictionnaire de Droit, p. 292.\nL\u2019action en reddition de compte est une action particuli\u00e8re que peut intenter celui dont les biens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9r\u00e9s par un autre. Les r\u00e8gles qui en d\u00e9terminent la nature sont prescrites par les arts. 566 et suivants du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile. La premi\u00e8re question qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9terminer est de savoir si le d\u00e9fendeur doit un compte; s\u2019il n\u2019en doit pas parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas comptable, l\u2019action doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. S\u2019il en doit un, il doit \u00eatre rendu \u00e0 la personne qui y a droit, et doit contenir dans des chapitres distincts la recette et\u201d] la d\u00e9pense, et \u00e9tablir la balance qui peut exister. L\u2019oyant compte est tenu de prendre connaissance du compte et des pi\u00e8ces justificatives au greffe et de produire ses d\u00e9bats de compte, s\u2019il le conteste, dans un d\u00e9lai de quinze jours qui peut \u00eatre prolong\u00e9 par le juge sur requ\u00eate. A d\u00e9faut par le d\u00e9fendeur de rendre compte, le demandeur peut lui-m\u00eame proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablir tel que pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 568 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il doit \u00e9tablir la recette et la d\u00e9pense et d\u00e9terminer la balance qui lui est due.\nCependant, la jurisprudence a accord\u00e9 certains temp\u00e9raments \u00e0 la rigueur des articles du Code, lorsque les parties ont transform\u00e9 l\u2019action en reddition de compte en un v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9bat de compte et qu\u2019elles ont mis devant le tribunal toutes les pi\u00e8ces justificatives. Les cours ont prononc\u00e9 que les r\u00e8gles du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile n\u2019\u00e9taient pas imp\u00e9ratives, et que l\u2019obligation ult\u00e9rieure de rendre compte apr\u00e8s l\u2019institution de l\u2019action, devenait inutile lorsque par le d\u00e9bat engag\u00e9 par le consentement des parties, on en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une solution imm\u00e9diate et d\u00e9finitive: Cousineau v. Cousineau 3.\nC\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019Appel dans cette m\u00eame cause de Cousineau v. Cousineau (non rapport\u00e9e). Dans cette cause, M. le Juge Bissonnette exprimait son opinion de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\nMais comme les intim\u00e9s ont laiss\u00e9 d\u00e9vier la contestation de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 transformer leur propre action en un d\u00e9bat de comptes et que les appelants en ont fait autant en mettant, devant le tribunal, livres et pi\u00e8ces justificatives et en produisant tous les t\u00e9moins aptes \u00e0 d\u00e9poser sur cette gestion sur laquelle n\u2019existe aucun livre de comptabilit\u00e9, il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident qu\u2019il faut, dans cette esp\u00e8ce particuli\u00e8re, statuer que la gestion des appelants ne comporte aucun reliquat de comptes et les affranchir ainsi d\u2019une obligation ult\u00e9rieure de rendre compte, puisqu\u2019un nouveau d\u00e9bat serait inutile.\n(Les italiques sont de moi.)\nMais encore faut-il que les parties aient transform\u00e9 l\u2019action en un d\u00e9bat de compte. La demanderesse-intim\u00e9e a bien tent\u00e9 de le faire, mais non pas la d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante qui n\u2019a pas offert de preuve, n\u2019a produit aucun compte, et qui a ni\u00e9 \u00e0 la demanderesse le droit d\u2019en r\u00e9clamer un. La d\u00e9fenderesse a clairement limit\u00e9 le d\u00e9bat \u00e0 la question de savoir si oui ou non elle \u00e9tait comptable.\nA mon sens, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019il s\u2019agit purement et simplement d\u2019un pr\u00eat consenti par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, et non pas d\u2019un mandat de g\u00e9rer ni pour la succession ni pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e les valeurs mobili\u00e8res qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9es. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas comptable au sens de la loi vis-\u00e0-vis la succession, ni vis-\u00e0-vis l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle n\u2019a rien eu \u00e0 administrer pour personne. Elle n\u2019a pas eu la possession de ces valeurs comme fiduciaire, mais bien comme emprunteuse, et c\u2019est en cette qualit\u00e9 seule que sa responsabilit\u00e9 est engag\u00e9e si la dette n\u2019est pas encore pay\u00e9e.\nOn a soutenu \u00e0 l\u2019audience que si l\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas comptable du capital emprunt\u00e9, elle l\u2019est du moins en ce qui concerne les dividendes qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7us. Je ne puis accueillir cette pr\u00e9tention, car m\u00eame si l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait comptable des dividendes, ce qui est fort douteux, ils ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s de l\u2019avis m\u00eame de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ainsi qu\u2019une substantielle partie du capital.\nJe me vois donc \u00e0 regret dans l\u2019obligation de maintenir cet appel et de rejeter l\u2019action. Le recours de la demanderesse n\u2019\u00e9tait pas par action en reddition de compte, mais bien en remboursement du pr\u00eat consenti. C\u2019est une application de la loi \u201cdans toute sa rigueur, et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 n\u2019y peut apporter aucun temp\u00e9rament.\nDans une cause de Bouchard v. Perron 4 o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un d\u00e9p\u00f4t, M. le Juge Pr\u00e9vost dit ce qui suit:\nEn pareil cas, le recours appropri\u00e9 serait une action afin d\u2019obtenir remboursement du d\u00e9p\u00f4t et non pas une action en reddition de compte.\nVide \u00e9galement Savard v. Charette 5 ; Boivin v. Rock Shoe Manufacturing Co. 6; Dallaire v. Doyon 7.\nDans la cause de Donoghue v. Lefebvre 8, M. le Juge en chef Lamothe s\u2019exprimait de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nDans l\u2019action en reddition de compte, il faut prouver que le d\u00e9fendeur a administr\u00e9 des biens pour le demandeur (comme tuteur, curateur, ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, etc.) et qu\u2019il est comptable de cette administration. \u2026 le jugement doit \u00eatre bas\u00e9 sur le fait que le d\u00e9fendeur a administr\u00e9 des biens pour le demandeur.\nDans un cas de pr\u00eat non rembours\u00e9, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, l\u2019action en reddition de compte n\u2019est pas le rem\u00e8de appropri\u00e9 et ne peut \u00eatre sanctionn\u00e9e-par les tribunaux. Cette obligation de rendre compte pr\u00e9suppose une administration. Sans doute, il est certain qu\u2019il peut se pr\u00e9senter des cas, o\u00f9 l\u2019emprunteur ou m\u00eame le d\u00e9positaire, peut \u00eatre tenu de restituer les fruits produits par la chose emprunt\u00e9e ou d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, et m\u00eame en rendre compte; mais dans le cas actuel, toute id\u00e9e d\u2019administration est exclue par la nature m\u00eame de la convention intervenue. L\u2019obligation contract\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 uniquement de remettre les actions et les dividendes, et ces derniers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gralement transmis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu, l\u2019action rejet\u00e9e, et le jugement du juge de premi\u00e8re instance r\u00e9tabli. L\u2019appelante aura droit \u00e0 ses frais devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine et devant cette Cour.\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014The ground taken on this appeal is essentially one of procedure. The facts are not seriously disputed and the documents which establish the primary allegations are given in the reasons of my brother Taschereau. The litigation, before the courts since 1946, has been befogged by irrelevant topics and the observation made by Bissonnette J. in the opening sentence of his reasons 9:\nCette cause a pris une ampleur, dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du fait et du droit, que le fond du litige, s\u2019il est circonscrit \u00e0 la seule question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre, ne justifiait pas.\nis highly appropriate. I should add that the affirmative defence to the effect that the proceeds of the shares were applied to speculation debts of the respondent Mina Barry is, on the evidence, without the slightest foundation. The issue, then, is whether the appellant, admitting that in 1929 she received the shares of stock from the respondent Mina Barry for the purpose of tiding over her own account with brokers during the market debacle of that period, is bound to furnish an account of the securities and their fruits or that these proceedings disclosing all the facts are to be dismissed as abortive.\nBissonnette J., disregarding the question of a trust between the parties arising under the will, treated the controversy as concerned with a pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage for which the conclusion of the declaration for an account to be rendered, was, in the circumstances, proper; and on this footing I will first consider it.\nAs between the respondent Mina Barry and the appellant the oral evidence and the letters of acknowledgment by the latter prove all the elements of a pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage. The shares of stock were lent gratuitously for a special purpose; and the borrower agreed to return \u201cthese certificates\u201d, the individual things in specie, to the respondent when the latter should call for them.\nThat a share of stock can be the subject of such a transaction is evident both under the old law and the article of the Code. Pothier, vol. 5 at p. 7, art. 2, para. 14 says:\n14. Toutes les choses qui sont dans le commerce, et qui ne se consomment point par l\u2019usage qu\u2019on en fait, peuvent \u00eatre l\u2019objet de ce contrat.\nand the Civil Code:\n1765. Everything may be loaned for use which may be the object of the contract of lease or hire.\nIn his description of the uses to which the property may be put, Pothier gives a number of examples to distinguish the pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage from that of mutuum, from which it is clear that the same property may be the subject of the one or other, depending on the character of the use authorized. Here, where the actual certificates were to be returned, the terms contemplated their preservation; there was no right to use them otherwise than as a continuing security for so long only as the lender would not call for their return; but physically and as representing a share interest in a company, they were to remain intact.\nThe lender, in such a situation, retains both the ownership and the legal possession of the property: Pothier, supra, art. 3, para. 9, p. 6:\n9. \u2026 au lieu que dans le pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, ce n\u2019est pas la chose m\u00eame que le pr\u00eateur donne, il n\u2019en donne que l\u2019usage; il conserve la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose qu\u2019il pr\u00eate: il en conserve m\u00eame la possession, comme nous l\u2019avons vu supra, n\u00b0 5, et l\u2019emprunteur s\u2019oblige de la lui rendre. and vis-\u00e0-vis the lender the borrower assumes duties at least of a mandataire. The significance of continuing to retain property \u201c\u00e0 titre d\u2019emprunt\u201d is that, in the absence of a statute, prescription does not run while the property remains in the hands of the borrower.\nAs borrower the appellant was under a duty to conserve and to restore to the lender the shares, together with all their fruits and accessories. Pothier, supra, at p. 31, art. 3, para. 73, deals with fruits:\nUn troisi\u00e8me objet accessoire de cette action, est la restitution des fruits qui sont n\u00e9s chez l\u2019emprunteur, lorsque la chose pr\u00eat\u00e9e \u00e9tait une chose frugif\u00e8re.\nand in para. 74 with accessories :\n74. Enfin, on doit mettre au rang des objets de l\u2019action commodati, la restitution de toutes les autres choses accessoires de la chose pr\u00eat\u00e9e;\nDalloz, Encyclop\u00e9die, vol. 4, p. 83, item 55, uses the following language:\n55. Ainsi, lorsque des pi\u00e8ces de monnaie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat\u00e9es \u00e0 un changeur pour les exposer dans sa vitrine. Ou encore, lorsque les objets qui font l\u2019objet du pr\u00eat n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis que pour que l\u2019emprunteur puisse les donner en gage \u00e0 un tiers, \u00e0 charge de les rendre en nature. (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Wahl, n\u00b0 801).\nApplying these conceptions to a share of stock, it is obvious that dividends, in cash or stock, share warrants, new shares representing the subdivision of prior issues, the sum received for an unauthorized sale, intervening profits made out of moneys received, would, apart from damages, all come into consideration. These fruits and accessories must, in Pothier\u2019s language, be \u201crendered\u201d to the lender and being, as here, by their nature expressed in terms of money or money\u2019s worth, they are \u201crendered\u201d only as they may be ascertained by an account and paid over.\nThe authorities support this view. Garsonnet, ed. 1888, vol. 3, pp. 140-1-2, summarizes the persons liable to be charged with administration of another\u2019s property as follows :\nQuiconque est charg\u00e9 ou se charge volontairement d\u2019administrer tout ou partie du bien d\u2019autrui doit rendre un compte d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de sa recette et de sa d\u00e9pense. Tels sont, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils n\u2019aient prescrit, transig\u00e9 ou obtenu dispense de rendre compte, les mandataires, tuteurs, associ\u00e9s, copartageants, h\u00e9ritiers b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, d\u00e9positaires, s\u00e9questres, cr\u00e9anciers-gagistes et antichr\u00e9sistes, envoy\u00e9s en possession provisoire de biens d\u2019absent, curateurs aux successions vacantes et aux immeubles d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par hypoth\u00e8que, g\u00e9rants d\u2019affaires, possesseurs de bonne ou de mauvaise foi, comptables de deniers publics; tels sont aussi le p\u00e8re administrateur l\u00e9gal, et l\u2019\u00e9poux survivant commun en biens qui n\u2019a pas fait inventaire; tels sont, enfin, les conseils judiciaires et curateurs aux mineurs \u00e9mancip\u00e9s qui se sont immisc\u00e9s dans l\u2019administration qui ne leur \u00e9tait pas confi\u00e9e, ou qu\u2019ils avaient pour unique mission de surveiller.\nand in J.-Cl. Proc., art. 529, p. 3, para. 12, as a general indication of the class, most of these items are reproduced with a reference to Garsonnet et C\u00e9zar-Bru, Proc. civ. 3e ed. 1913, t. III, n\u00b0 815, p. 607 et suiv. My brother Kellock, whose reasons I have had the advantage of reading, has traced the treatment of a d\u00e9positaire by the courts of Quebec to a demonstration of their agreement with the view of Garsonnet approved in the volume cited of Juris-Classeur.\nIn Whitney v. Kerr 10, one who had agreed to buy shares of stock in a company was upheld by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in an action brought to compel the seller, in order to determine the price agreed upon, to render an account of what the shares had cost him. The latter did not hold any property of the purchaser ; but he had agreed to sell his own property which in equity and good faith he was bound to keep for the purposes of performing his obligation; and that interest furnished the foundation for the proceeding.\nA similar view was taken by Archibald J. in Brunet v. Banque Nationale 11, in which the plaintiff, alleging that he was employed to assist in the collection of certain moneys to a percentage of which he was entitled for commission, claimed an accounting by the principal to determine the amount received.\nSeveral decisions in actions brought by commercial travellers for commission for an account by the principal of goods sold have been dismissed; but it is plainly evident that in that relation no semblance of interest in property of the agent is to be found in the possession of the principal, and the cases have no bearing on the situation before us. To the same effect is La Corporation du Village d\u2019Yamaska v. Sigefroy Lauzi\u00e8re 12, in which the person called upon for an account was \u201cun simple surveillant\u201d of works carried out by the corporation. This category of pr\u00eat is seen to be characterized by the circumstance that a person is charged with the conservation of a principal thing and the administration of its fruits and accessories, coupled with the right to use the thing for a benefit which does not impair its individuality. The shares were to be held for the double purpose of benefits to both the respondents and the appellant, examples of which in Roman law are mentioned in Buckland\u2019s Text-Book of Roman Law (1921), p. 471. Toward the interests of the respondents the borrower as mandataire sustained a relation which carried with it an accounting responsibility. That was the view of Bissonnette J. and I am in entire agreement with it.\nBut in another view of the facts here the same result follows. Whatever may be the proper interpretation of the will as to the vesting of the property in the beneficiaries or the trustees, the persons named as \u201ctrustees\u201d did actually take upon themselves the legal title to the shares. It appears that the deceased husband of the appellant as one of the trustees obtained the certificates for these shares as well as others from a notary and they were registered on the books of the companies in the three names as \u201cTrustees of the estate of the late Mrs. C. R. Barry\u201d. This was done undoubtedly in the belief that it was in accordance with the provisions of the will and from a reference in a receipt given to the notary to a legal opinion on the will, dated February 7, 1928, about a month after the testatrix\u2019s death, under legal advice.\nThe dividends for 1930 and the first two quarters in 1931 were paid by cheques made out to all three, sent to the deceased husband, endorsed by him and the appellant, and handed over to the respondent, Mina Barry, who cashed them as her own funds. Although the shares were sold in 1931 without the knowledge or consent of the respondent Mina, an account introduced on behalf of the respondents purports to indicate that the appellant remitted personal cheques in favour of the respondent on the shares of the Steel Company of Canada, in 1932 for the amount of $496.80, which represents a rate of $1.75 on 280 shares, and in 1933 and each year following until 1946 for the amount of $337.80 representing a rate of $1.20 on the 284 shares less $3. Since the institution of the action, these shares have been split on the basis of five for one. A rate of $1.75 appears to have been declared by the Steel Company for 1931 and 1932, $1.20 in 1933, $1.75 in 1934, $3.17\u00bd in 1935, $3.75 from 1931 to 1940 inclusive, and $3 from 1940 to 1946. A list of similar remittances is shown to represent the dividends from the Montreal Light, Heat & Power Company in the sum of $360 in each year from 1931 to 1946 inclusive; there were 238 shares and the rate $1.50, an annual dividend of $357. From 1937 to 1946 additional sums in even dollar amounts ranging from $200 to $2,550 are shown to have been received in each year, but their appropriation to the principal of either stock or to a contra-loan account is not indicated. The statements were not to show with precise accuracy the accounting result but a prima facie proof of the substance of the dealings between the parties and the justification for claiming an account to be rendered by the appellant. The respondent was a novice in business matters and although for some time she had entertained suspicions that the shares had been sold, it was not until 1947 that she learned definitely of that fact.\nBy and between the parties, therefore, there was set up at least a de facto trust in which each assumed towards the beneficiaries, the respondents, the obligation that the law would have imputed to them, that of fiduciaries. The mention of trustees by the testatrix was in all likelihood for the purpose of placing her daughter and granddaughter under a protection in particular against interference with the property by the daughter\u2019s husband. Whatever may be said of the ability of the respondent Mina to act for herself, what the testatrix had in mind and what the other two trustees voluntarily undertook was that they should use the wider business understanding especially of the appellant\u2019s husband to safeguard the interests of both beneficiaries.\nBut the respondent Gene, the granddaughter, is in a different and stronger position. She had a contingent interest in the substitution sufficient, in the words of Bissonnette J. \u201cpour prendre cette sorte de mesure conservatoire, afin de pr\u00e9server les biens qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e recueillir\u201d. At the death of her grandmother she was an infant of six or seven years and the dealing in this stock took place in the face of the fiduciary duty toward her; and that that relationship is within the class enumerated by Garsonnet is, in my opinion, beyond controversy.\nIn this conclusion on the case as a whole I am fortified by the rule observed in this Court that on a matter of procedure the opinion, here unanimous, of the highest Court of the Province should be accorded the greatest respect.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J. (dissenting):\u2014This action was dismissed by the learned trial judge on the ground that the respondent Mina J. Barry was not entitled to bring an action for reddition de compte against the appellant but that her sole right of action was \u201ca direct action to be given possession of the thing loaned and the fruits of thing if any\u201d. He also held that the respondent Mina Gene Delany had no right of action at all. The Court of Appeal 13 set aside this judgment, holding that the respondents were entitled to bring such an action.\nThe evidence established that the shares here in question were the subject of a loan to the appellant and her husband to be returned to the respondent Mina J. Barry at any time she might ask for them, and that instead of being returned, they were sold by the appellant. The sole issue in the appeal is as to whether the said respondent was entitled to bring an action for reddition de compte or whether her only right was some other form of action.\nIt is well settled that this Court, although having jurisdiction, will not interfere with the decision of the provincial Courts in a matter of procedure where no injustice has been suffered: Roessel v. Perlo, Feb. 10, 1921, cited in Cameron, 3rd ed. 1924, p. 86; Finnie v. City of Montreal 14. In the latter case this Court refused to interfere although the matter brought before the Court was \u201ca demande almost different from the matter actually in controversy\u201d. It cannot be said that there could be any injustice to the appellant involved in upholding a right of action requiring her to account for her dealings with the shares here in question as against an action for damages in respect of those same dealings. It is therefore clear, in my opinion, that the appeal ought to be dismissed on this ground alone. I am, however, also of opinion that the appeal ought to be dismissed on other grounds.\nLeaving aside for the moment the question of trust, it is, in my opinion, clear that the loan of shares by the respondent, Mina J. Barry, to the appellant and her husband constituted a pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, the property loaned to be returned to the said respondent \u201cat any time she wants them back\u201d. There is no question that demands for its return were made but never complied with. The obligation of the borrowers was not to return merely \u201ca like quantity of things of the same kind and quality\u201d, which would have been the case had the loan been one for consumption within art. 1777 of the Civil Code. That it was the specific certificates loaned which were to be returned was expressly acknowledged in writing by the appellant and her husband. Accordingly, arts. 1763 et seq. are the relevant articles on the facts of this case. The distinction between the two kinds of contract is clearly stated in Dalloz, Petit Dictionnaire de Droit, p. 998, para. 9, as follows:\nTout pr\u00eat de consommation, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence du pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, suppose l\u2019ali\u00e9nation de la chose au profit de l\u2019emprunteur.\nAs the contract here in question did not permit of a sale, any intention that the property in the shares should ever pass to the borrowers was excluded.\nEt toutes les fois que les juges ne peuvent d\u00e9celer cette intention de transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les risques, ils doivent d\u00e9cider qu\u2019il y a pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, et non pr\u00eat de consommation.\nDalloz, Encyclop\u00e9die de Droit Civil, vol. IV, p. 90, para. 216. Again, Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, vol. III, p. 529, para. 5 :\nLe pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage diff\u00e8re du pr\u00eat de consommation en ce que le pr\u00eateur conserve la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose pr\u00eat\u00e9e (art. 1877) (C.C. 1784), donc le droit de la revendiquer, \u00e0 condition de respecter l\u2019usage consenti \u00e0 l\u2019emprunteur. La distinction des deux sortes de pr\u00eat est parfois difficile; ainsi, lorsque le contrat porte sur des titres au porteur. Pour la r\u00e9soudre, il convient de rechercher si le pr\u00eateur a entendu, lors du contrat, conserver la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses titres et en exiger la restitution \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Ainsi, ne constitue pas un pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, mais bien un pr\u00eat de consommation, le pr\u00eat de titres au porteur qui n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rev\u00eatus d\u2019aucune marque particuli\u00e8re permettant de les individualiser.\nUnquestionably the certificates in the case at bar were numbered certificates.\nIt has been held by La Cour de Cassation, 11 May 1901, D.P. 1902.2.415, that the fact that the borrower of specific shares has the right under the contract to pledge them with a creditor of the latter is entirely consistent with a contract of pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage. Similarly, Huc, Commentaire du Code Civil, vol. XI, p. 207; S. 1895, 1.160; S. 1906, 1.430.\nThere is therefore, in my opinion, no question but that the case at bar is one of pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, as the learned judge of first instance found.\nThere is no evidence, as the learned trial judge seems to have thought, that the shares were sold by the pledgees, although it may be assumed the latter would not have accepted the certificates from their clients, the appellant and her husband, without the endorsement of the registered shareholders. The only evidence as to why the certificates were not returned to the respondent is that of the latter, who testified that the appellant had told her, some years after the certificates had been loaned, that she had sold them, but no information was then or at any time given as to when the sale had taken place nor as to the amount of the proceeds.\nIn the course of his judgment dismissing the action, the learned judge of first instance said:\n\u2026 if Plaintiffs have any recourse against Defendant, they can exercise that recourse by direct action, they can sue her as their debtor, asking the Court to condemn Defendant to give back to Plaintiffs the shares that she loaned them or the value of the said shares at the market price with the dividends that were distributed on those shares and that she did not receive, the whole with interest, but she cannot take an action for accounting ;\nThe learned judge does not state his view as to the time as of which the \u201cmarket price\u201d is to be determined, whether at the date when the shares ought to have been returned or the date of their sale by the appellant or the date of the judgment; vide Pothier 5, p. 29, paras. 68, 72; S. 1850, 1.455; S. 1933, 1.87. As already mentioned, the only person with knowledge of the date of sale is the appellant, who has not only refused the information but, by her pleading, denied any sale. Moreover, should it be held that the market price on any date other than the date of sale is the relevant date for the purpose of assessing the value by way of damages, the appellant would be enabled, if the price on that date should turn out to be less than the price actually realized by the sale, to put herself, by her own wrongful act, in a position of making a profit, while depriving the owner of the proceeds of her own property.\nIf such were considered to be a permissible result under the civil law of the Province, it would seem that an owner of property would be in a considerably less favourable position under the regime of that law than would be the case in similar circumstances in other jurisdictions where he may, at his option, sue for damages for the wrongful conversion of his property or for an accounting and recovery of the actual proceeds of sale : United Australia, Limited v. Barclay\u2019s Bank, Limited 15; Trusts & Guarantee Co. v. Brenner 16. Viscount Simon in the case first above mentioned refers, at p. 12, to the case of Lamine v. Dorrell 17, decided in the year 1705, where certain Irish debentures had been wrongfully sold, and where Powell J. said :\nBut the plaintiff may dispense with the wrong, and suppose the sale made by his consent, and bring an action for the money they were sold for, as money received to his use.\nAny suggestion that another result would be permissible under the civil law would seem to be negatived by the principle of unjust enrichment firmly embedded in that law to a much greater extent than in the common law. An interesting example of its application in circumstances not too remote in principle from the case at bar is the decision of the Cour de Cassation; Gaz. Pal. 1927.1.426.\nIt is of interest also, in this connection to observe that Bioche, in the second volume of his Dictionnaire de Procedure, under the head of \u201cCompte de Fruits\u201d, in treating of fruits required to be rendered in specie, says, at p. 551, para. 45:\n45. Si. le d\u00e9biteur ne poss\u00e8de pas de fruits, mais qu\u2019il lui soit possible de s\u2019en procurer, m\u00eame \u00e0 des prix plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que le prix commun au moment de la demande, il doit \u00eatre forc\u00e9 \u00e0 la restitution en nature : l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de payer en nature doit \u00eatre r\u00e9elle et absolue, elle ne peut \u00eatre un pr\u00e9texte pour enrichir un d\u00e9biteur de mauvaise foi, au pr\u00e9judice de son cr\u00e9ancier. Toullier, 7, n\u00b0 63.\nComing to the ground upon which the learned judge of first instance proceeded, it may be that where the subject-matter of loan is a shovel or a machine or similar object, the result reached by the learned judge might be proper but where, as here, the property loaned consists of \u201cune chose frugif\u00e8re\u201d, other considerations apply.\nFor reasons which will appear, it is useful to compare the pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage with the contract of d\u00e9p\u00f4t. In the one the borrower is entitled to the use of the thing loaned for the purpose \u201cintended by its nature or by agreement\u201d (art. 1766), while in the other, the depositary \u201chas no right to use the thing deposited without the permission of the depositor\u201d (art. 1803). For present purposes there is no other significant difference between the two. Both the borrower and the depositary are bound to restore the identical thing received and to render to the owner all fruits and \u201caccessories\u201d. Title remains, in both cases, vested in the owner. Pothier, in speaking of the pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, refers, in vol. 4, p. 3, para. 5; p. 5, para. 9; and p. 9, para. 20, note (1), to the fact that even the legal possession resides in the lender, the borrower having nothing more than physical possession. See also Mignault, vol. 2, p. 482.\nWith respect to the remedy by way of an action for reddition de compte, Dalloz, in his R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vol. 3, p. 406, defines \u201cLa reddition de compte\u201d as:\nla pr\u00e9sentation, \u00e0 celui pour qui l\u2019on a g\u00e9r\u00e9, d\u2019un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019on a re\u00e7u et de ce qu\u2019on a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 pour lui, \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019arriver \u00e0 la fixation d\u00e9finitive de la situation des parties.\nAt p. 407, under the heading \u201cCas o\u00f9 il est d\u00fb un compte\u201d, Dalloz says, in para. 9 :\n9. 1. En principe, tous ceux qui ont administr\u00e9 la fortune d\u2019autrui, \u00e0, quelque titre que ce soit, avec ou sans mandat, sont oblig\u00e9s de rendre compte de leur gestion.

In Quebec the law is stated in the same sense by Sir F.-X. Lemieux C.J., in Boivin v. Rock Shoe Manufacturing Co. 18:\nSont donc comptables, toute personne qui accepte un mandat contractuel, toute personne qui prend spontan\u00e9ment une gestion d\u2019affaires, le tuteur, le curateur, le d\u00e9positaire, le s\u00e9questre, le curateur au d\u00e9laissement, \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que de l\u2019immeuble, etc. C\u2019est l\u00e0 le langage des auteurs.\nThe learned Chief Justice founds himself on a number of authors, including Fuzier-Herman, v\u00b0 Compte, Nos. 11, 13 and 14. The last mentioned paragraph I have reproduced above.\nIn Bouchard v. Perron 19, Pr\u00e9vost J., without any discussion of doctrine or jurisprudence, purported to found a contrary opinion upon, inter alia, the Boivin case, overlooking that that case was decided by Chief Justice Lemieux on a view of the law to the direct contrary. Savard v. Charette 20, also referred to by Pr\u00e9vost J., contains no discussion of the law and does not advance matters. The other two cases referred to by Pr\u00e9vost J., namely Donoghue v. Lefebvre 21 and Dallaire v. Doyon 22, are, neither of them, authority for his view.\nThe point under discussion is expressly covered in the case of a d\u00e9p\u00f4t by Pothier, vol. 5, p. 141, para. 47, as follows :\n47. Les fruits de la chose donn\u00e9e en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, que le d\u00e9positaire a per\u00e7us, sont aussi un des objets de la restitution du d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Soit qu\u2019il ait encore par devers lui la chose qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, soit qu\u2019il ne T\u2019ait plus, il doit tenir compte des fruits qu\u2019il en a per\u00e7us, \u00e0 celui qui la lui a donn\u00e9e en d\u00e9p\u00f4t; car un d\u00e9positaire ne doit profiter en rien du d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nPar exemple, lorsqu\u2019on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un des vaches en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, le d\u00e9positaire doit tenir compte \u00e0 celui qui les lui a donn\u00e9es en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, du lait et des veaux, sous la d\u00e9duction des frais qu\u2019il a faits pour la nourriture et la garde\nLe d\u00e9positaire, tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en demeure de rendre la chose qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, n\u2019est tenu de rendre que les fruits qu\u2019il a per\u00e7us: il n\u2019est pas tenu de ceux qu\u2019on e\u00fbt pu percevoir, et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas per\u00e7us: mais depuis qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en demeure, il est tenu de tenir compte de tous ceux qu\u2019on a pu percevoir, quoiqu\u2019il ne les ait pas per\u00e7us; c\u2019est un effet de la demeure, suivant les principes \u00e9tablis en notre Trait\u00e9 des Obligations, n\u00b0 143. Glasson in his \u201cProc\u00e9dure Civile\u201d, vol. 1, p. 542, para. 503, points out that:\nIl y a un certain nombre de cas dans lesquels la loi ordonne une restitution de fruits, et cette restitution peut \u00eatre accessoire \u00e0 une demande principale ou faire, elle-m\u00eame, l\u2019objet exclusif du proc\u00e8s; dans les deux cas, le syst\u00e8me de la loi est le m\u00eame.\nAnd further:\nTout jugement qui condamne \u00e0 une restitution de fruits n\u00e9cessite trois op\u00e9rations: 1\u00b0 il faut d\u2019abord fixer la quantit\u00e9 de fruits recueillis et qui doivent \u00eatre restitu\u00e9s. Le jugement qui ordonne la restitution n\u2019en op\u00e8re pas en principe la liquidation; il ordonne de s\u2019engager pour cette liquidation dans la proc\u00e9dure de reddition de compte (art. 526 \u2018C. pr.) ; mais cette proc\u00e9dure n\u2019est pas prescrite \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9, et les juges pourraient, sans recourir \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de reddition de compte, op\u00e9rer cette liquidation par le jugement, s\u2019ils en trouvaient les \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans les pi\u00e8ces du proc\u00e8s (Req., 23 f\u00e9vrier 1859, D.P. 59. 1. 386; req., 12 d\u00e9cembre 1882, D.P. 83. 1. 188) ; 2\u00b0 une fois connue la quantit\u00e9 des fruits \u00e0 rendre, il faut d\u00e9terminer la valeur de ces fruits; 3o ensuite on en d\u00e9duit la d\u00e9pense; c\u2019est ce qui fait l\u2019objet de la seconde et de la troisi\u00e8me op\u00e9ration (art. 129 C. pr.).\nSuch being the position with regard to fruits and accessories coming into the hands of a borrower or depositary, is the situation any different where the fruits or accessories come into existence as the result of an illicit act on the part of the borrower or depositary? As one might expect, the law is that the obligation is to render all fruits howsoever obtained.\nPothier, in vol. 5, p. 31, para. 73, in discussing the obligation of the borrower, says :\nPareillement, si celui \u00e0 qui j\u2019avais pr\u00eat\u00e9 une chose afin qu\u2019il s\u2019en serv\u00eet pour son usage, l\u2019a lou\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre et en a retir\u00e9 un loyer, ce loyer qu\u2019il en a retir\u00e9 est un fruit civil de ma chose, qui doit m\u2019appartenir et qu\u2019il doit me rendre \u2026\nTo the same effect Trudel in his \u201cTrait\u00e9 de Droit Civil du Qu\u00e9bec\u201d by Herv\u00e9 Roch, vol. 13, p. 171 :\nDans le cas, toutefois, o\u00f9 l\u2019emprunteur tire un profit de l\u2019usage illicite de la chose, ce profit appartient au pr\u00eateur.\nAs put by Story on Bailments, 9th ed. 1878, p. 240, para. 269:\nIf, by any improper use of the thing loaned, the borrower has made a profit, that profit also belongs to the lender.\nThe position is the same in the case of a wrongful sale.\nPothier, in treating of d\u00e9p\u00f4t, vol. 5, p. 140, para. 43, says:\nN\u00e9anmoins, si c\u2019\u00e9tait par son dol qu\u2019il ne l\u2019e\u00fbt plus, ou par quelque faute, de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de celles dont il est tenu; en ce cas, il ne serait pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de son obligation de rendre la chose. Faute d\u2019y pouvoir satisfaire, il serait tenu d\u2019en rendre le prix; et m\u00eame, selon les circonstances, il pourrait \u00eatre, en outre, tenu des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats de celui qui la lui a donn\u00e9e en d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nLe d\u00e9positaire qui a vendu de mauvaise foi la chose qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, n\u2019est pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de la rendre, quoiqu\u2019il ait rachet\u00e9 la chose pour la garder comme auparavant, et qu\u2019elle soit depuis p\u00e9rie chez lui sans sa faute.\nPothier distinguishes the case of the person who has innocently sold the thing deposited. At the foot of the same page he says:\nUn autre exemple, c\u2019est lorsque l\u2019h\u00e9ritier du d\u00e9positaire, ignorant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, a vendu la chose donn\u00e9e en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, qu\u2019il croyait \u00eatre de la succession du d\u00e9funt: cet h\u00e9ritier qui l\u2019a vendue de bonne foi, n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9, \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, de rendre la chose \u00e0 celui qui l\u2019a donn\u00e9e en d\u00e9p\u00f4t au d\u00e9funt; mais il est oblig\u00e9 de lui rendre la somme qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ue pour le prix de cette chose; \u00e0 moins que celui qui avait donn\u00e9 la chose en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, n\u2019aim\u00e2t mieux la revendiquer sur l\u2019acheteur par devers qui elle est; auquel cas ce serait \u00e0 cet acheteur que l\u2019argent devrait \u00eatre rendu.\nIt could not be suggested that the right of action of the depositor is on any lower footing as against the depositary who fraudulently sells the subject-matter of the deposit. The liability of the innocent vendor for the price of the thing sold received by him is embodied in art. 1806 of the Civil Code. With respect to all of the articles dealing with the obligations of the depositary, namely, arts. 1802 to 1811, the Codifiers, in their sixth report, say, at p. 20:\nThe contract which forms the subject of this title, like that of the preceding one, (loan) is founded upon principles derived from the Roman law. The ancient law of France as expressed by Pothier in his treatise upon d\u00e9p\u00f4t and s\u00e9questre, following that of Rome with little or no deviation, affords a clear and complete system of rules; these have been, for the most part, adopted in the modern code, \u2026\nAs the property loaned in the case at bar was company shares, the use of which was granted to the appellant for the limited purpose of pledging with the appellant\u2019s broker but with the duty of preventing any sale, the appellant was charged with the receipt and rendering to the lender of all \u201cfruits\u201d and \u201caccessories\u201d, including dividends and shares to which the shareholder might become entitled by way of bonus or conversion of the existing shares, in a word, any profit whatever which might accrue to the shareholder as such during the currency of the loan. In support of their action in the case at bar, the respondents have pro- duced evidence under the hand of the appellant that there was a substitution or conversion of the Steel Company shares.\nIn view of the clear obligation to account described by Pothier, as above set out, it is not necessary to say more but it may be asked how a depositor or lender may ascertain what have been the fruits and accessories while the subject-matter of the loan or deposit was in the custody of the borrower or depositary unless he can call for an account. Without such a remedy he could never put himself in a position to claim or even to give evidence that there had been fruits or accessories, whether properly or illicitly acquired, where the only knowledge of their having come into existence resides with the defendant. As stated by Rinfret J., as he then was, in Johnston v. Channell 23:\nThe purpose of the accounting is to ascertain whether the monies and securities are still in the appellants\u2019 possession, in which case the respondent would be authorized to take possession of them, as her property, in the hands of the appellants. And the alternative purpose of the accounting, if the monies and securities have ceased to be in the possession of the appellants, is to establish what is the equivalent that they should pay to the respondent in lieu of her property.\nIt is, moreover, provided by art. 406 of the Civil Code that\nOwnership is the right of enjoying and of disposing of things in the most absolute manner\u2026 .\nand by art. 408 of the Civil Code:\nOwnership in a thing whether moveable or immoveable gives the right to all it produces, and to all that is joined to it as an accessory whether naturally or artificially. This right is called the right of accession.\nIt cannot be said that the obligation to return the thing loaned rested, for example, upon a borrower by art. 1763 of the Code, places the lender in any inferior position to that of an owner whose property is in the possession of a mere possessor similarly obliged by art. 411 to return to the owner the thing and, subject to the terms of that article and art. 412, its fruits.\nIn Johnston v. Channell, supra, the action was brought by the respondent, a married woman, against a firm of brokers, who had received certain moneys and securities from her as security for a brokerage account she was operating with them without her husband\u2019s consent. The respondent had asked for an account of all moneys and securities delivered to the appellants and, in default, that they be condemned to pay the respondent the sum of $162,000. It was held that the appellants were under obligation to render an accounting, the double purpose of which was as already stated in the passage above quoted. Rinfret J., as he then was, had said earlier in his judgment 24:\nHer right to repossess herself of these monies and securities is strictly based on her title of ownership. It is the undisputed right of every proprietor to hold and to possess his property in the most absolute way (art. 406 C.C.). If, on account of the fact that the monies and securities are no longer in the appellants\u2019 possession, it has become impossible to return them to the respondent, then she is entitled to get the equivalent from the appellants; and that is the nature of the prayer in the conclusion of the respondent\u2019s declaration.\nIn the case at bar, the securities which were the subject-matter of the loan were the property of the respondent. They ceased by reason of the wrongful sale on the part of the appellant to be in her possession and thus it became impossible for her to return them. The respondent, therefore, became \u201centitled to get the equivalent from the appellant\u201d and the purpose of the accounting demanded in this action is to establish that equivalent.\nLeaving out of consideration the matter of dividends, which the respondent may be taken to have received in full, the appellant is accordingly liable to account for original shares, for all shares into which they were converted or for which other shares were substituted and for the proceeds. She has not only refused to give an accounting but has refrained from furnishing any information to the respondent either before action or in these proceedings as to the amount which she received on the sale. It is well settled in the jurisprudence of the Province that in such case the Court may condemn the defendant to pay a liquidated sum. The authorities are reviewed and followed in Whitney v. Kerr 25; Bird v. Canadian Car & Foundry Co. Ltd. 25. With respect to the question of trust, the learned trial judge considered that there was no conveyance by the will of any property to the \u201cso-called trustees\u201d as required by art. 981(a) of the Civil Code, and that accordingly the appellant was never a trustee of the shares in question.\nAssuming, but without deciding, such to be the proper construction of the will, that does not end the matter. If, as the learned trial judge determined, the shares and other assets disposed of by the will became \u201cthe absolute property\u201d of the respondent Mina J. Barry under the will, those shares were in fact conveyed by her to the three trustees. The simple fact is that the shares which, at the date of death stood in the name of the deceased Christina Ross and which devolved upon the respondent Mina J. Barry as her property, with substitution in favour of the latter\u2019s daughter, were transferred to the three trustees by the respondent Barry, and the trust thus established, of which the beneficiaries were the respondents or one of them, was accepted by the trustees. There is no question therefore, in my opinion, that from this point of view also, the appellant must account.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Rand and Kellock JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Brais, Campbell, Mercier & Leduc, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Hackett, Mulvena, Laverty, Drummond, Willis & Hackett, Montreal.\n1 [1956] Que.
