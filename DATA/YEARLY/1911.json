Held, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (21 Ont. L.R. 201) that this clause in the contract must be construed as a donatio inter vivos creating a present debt in favour of the future wife, payment of which was deferred; that, in the absence of proof of fraud, such a contract could not be attacked by subsequent creditors; and that the wife was entitled to rank on the estate for the amount of said gift.\nHeld, per Girouard J., that the donation was one \u201ca titre on\u00e9reux.\u201d\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of a Divisional Court which sustained the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe only question to be decided on this appeal was the construction of the clause of Edward O\u2019Reilly\u2019s will which is set out in the above head-note. The plaintiff, Mrs. O\u2019Reilly, had judgment in her favour in all the courts below.\nCasgrain K.C. for the appellants.\nLafleur K.C. and Chrysler K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is a claim for $25,000 filed by a wife on the estate of her deceased husband to whom she was married at Aylmer, in the Province of Quebec, on the 26th of June, 1889. The marriage contract produced in support of the claim was made at the same place on the twenty-second of the same month. The husband died on the 30th of December, 1907, leaving children issue of the marriage. The widow\u2019s claim to rank pari pass\u00fb with them is contested by the appellants on behalf of themselves and all other creditors of the deceased. The claims of all these contesting creditors arose after the marriage contract was made and registered in the proper registry office. It was found by the trial judge: First, that O\u2019Reilly, the husband, was insolvent at the time of his marriage and at his death; secondly, that when the contract was made there existed no intent to defraud either existing or future creditors.\nOn these facts two questions have been argued before us; one of law depending upon the construction of that clause in the marriage contract upon which the claimant relies; the other a mixed question of law and fact which involves the status of the contesting parties to impugn the validity of the gift made by the deceased to his wife. The clause in the marriage contract runs as follows:\nFourthly.\u2014And in the future view of the said intended marriage, he, the said Edward O\u2019Reilly, for and in consideration of the love and affection and esteem which he hath for and beareth to the said Miss Eliza Petrie, hath given, granted and confirmed, and by these presents doth give, grant and confirm unto the said Miss Eliza Petrie, accepting thereof: 1st, the household furniture now owned by the said Edward O\u2019Reilly and that which may be hereafter acquired by him by any title whatsoever, to be, the said household furniture, held, used and enjoyed by the said Miss Eliza Petrie as her own absolute property for ever. 2ndly, the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, currency of Canada, payable unto the said Miss Eliza Petrie by the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns of him, the said Edward O\u2019Reilly, the payment whereof shall become due and demandable after the death of him, the said Edward O\u2019Reilly; and, in the event of the said Miss Eliza Petrie departing this life before the said Edward O\u2019Reilly, but there being children issue of the said intended marriage at the death of the said Miss Eliza Petrie, the said sum of money shall be held in trust by the said Edward O\u2019Reilly, or his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns for the sole benefit of all the children issue of the said intended marriage and shall be paid unto them share and share alike as they shall attain the age of majority; it being expressly understood that should she, the said Miss Eliza Petrie, depart this life before him, the said Edward O\u2019Reilly, and should there be no children issue of the said intended marriage at the death of the said Miss Eliza Petrie, then the said gift shall become null and void as if it had not been made; and provided further, that the said sum of money (said gift), or any portion thereof shall not be liable for the debts of the said Miss Eliza Petrie, nor in any way liable to seizure therefor. The effect of such a clause in a marriage contract made under the civil law of the Province of Quebec is the first question to be determined. The widow contends that it is to be construed as a gift of present property (donatio inter vivos), and that as a result of her subsequent marriage she became forthwith her husband\u2019s creditor for the sum of $25,000, the payment of the debt only being deferred to the date of his death, if he should predecease her. (It is not necessary to consider the rights of the children.) The creditors contesting say, on the other hand, that in terms this clause purports to be merely a gift of future property\u2014a gift made in contemplation of death, or, as it is sometimes called in the civil law, an institution contractuelle, translated by Mr. Justice Anglin in the court below, very happily, I think, as \u201ca contractual institution of heirship.\u201d If this latter construction of the clause prevails, then all further consideration of the second question is unnecessary for the very obvious reason that a gift of future property carries with it, in the absence of any stipulation, the obligation on the part of the donee to pay the debts due by the donor at the time of his death; and, as the deceased was then insolvent, the claim of the widow to rank pari pass\u00fb with the other creditors must be dismissed. Rambaud, Code Civil (9 ed.), vol. 2, page 270, says:\nDans la donation des biens \u00e0 venir le donateur ne fait que disposer des biens qu\u2019il laissera \u00e0 son d\u00e9ces, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 ils se trouveront; et par suite il ne se dessaisit pas actuellement et irr\u00e9vocablement des biens donn\u00e9s. Il reste, au contraire, propri\u00e9taire de ces biens; il peut les grever de servitudes et d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques; les ali\u00e9ner a titre on\u00e9reux; il peut aussi contracter de nouvelles dettes qui, si elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9es par lui, resteront \u00e0 la charge du donataire. Mais il ne peut pas faire de nouvelles dispositions \u00e0 titre gratuit, qui puisse pr\u00e9judicier aux droits de celui-ci. La loi ne lui permet que des dons ou legs de sommes modiques, \u00e0 titre r\u00e9muneratoire.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que le donataire ne devient pas propri\u00e9taire des biens donn\u00e9s, ni m\u00eame cr\u00e9ancier sous une condition suspensive; sa situation est celle d\u2019un h\u00e9ritier futur.\nThe question was very ably argued for the appellants and is most interesting; but, in the last analysis, our obvious duty is to ascertain the common intention of the parties to the contract, giving to the particular words they used for the purpose of expressing that intention their natural meaning. Rambaud, vol. 2, pages 269 and 270, defines a gift of present property and a gift made in contemplation of death in these words:\nLa donation des biens pr\u00e9sents est celle qui se rapproche le plus des donations ordinaires. Ainsi le donateur se dessaisit actuellement et irr\u00e9vocablement des biens donn\u00e9s au profit du donataire; il ne peut plus les grever de servitudes et d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques, les ali\u00e9ner \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux ou \u00e0 titre gratuit; en un mot, le donataire en acquiert la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 actuel et irr\u00e9vocable, d\u2019o\u00f9 le nom de donation de biens pr\u00e9sents qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e.\n* * * * * *\nLa donation de biens \u00e0 venir est celle par laquelle la donateur s\u2019oblige \u00e0 transmettre au donataire tout ou partie des biens qu\u2019il laissera \u00e0 son d\u00e9ces, en se depouillant du droit d\u2019en disposer pour l\u2019avenir \u00e0 titre gratuit, en faveur d\u2019autres personnes.\nLa donation de biens \u00e0 venir est aussi appel\u00e9e institution contractuelle. Institution, parce qu\u2019elle se rapproche du testament, en conferant au donataire un droit sur la succession; contractuelle, parce qu\u2019elle se rapproche du contrat, par le concours de volont\u00e9 qu\u2019elle suppose chez les deux parties.\nApplying to the clause under consideration these definitions which set out very accurately and plainly the distinctive character and legal effect of each of these two dispositions in a marriage contract, we are, in my opinion, driven irresistibly to the conclusion that it must be construed in favour of the claimant. The terms used express as clearly as possible the intention on the part of the donor to create a present obligation. The future husband declares that in view of the intended marriage he hath given, granted and confirmed and by these presents doth give, grant and confirm unto his future wife, who accepts: 1. The household furniture; 2. The sum of $25,000. Language could not be found to express more clearly the intention to create a debitum in presenti, and that intention is not in any way qualified by the following words which fix the death of the donor as the time when the payment of the sum given is to become due and demandable. Taken altogether the words used clearly create an unconditional obligation to pay at a determinable future time fixed by the occurring of an event which is certain to happen. Rambaud, vol. 2, at page 158, says, after enumerating the essential elements of a donation inter vivos:\nPeu importe, sous ce rapport, que la donation soit pure et simple, ou que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution en a\u00eet \u00e9t\u00e9 recul\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une epoque d\u00e9terminee, et m\u00eame, \u00e0 la mort du donateur. En effet, le terme ne met obstacle ni \u00e0 la translation imm\u00e9diate de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ni \u00e0 la naissance imm\u00e9diate de l\u2019obligation; il ne fait que retarder l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du droit.\nIf I have given to this provision of the marriage contract its proper legal construction the widow by reason of the marriage contract and her subsequent marriage became a creditor of her late husband and is entitled prim\u00e2 facie to be collocated pari pass\u00fb with the other creditors on his estate. The validity of the gift as against the contesting creditors now remains to be considered. The nature of the contract with respect to its gratuitous or onerous character was much discussed here and in the courts below where there has been on this point some difference of judicial opinion. There is much to be said on both sides. It might be argued, possibly, that, on a true construction of all the provisions of the marriage contract, the gift of $25,000 should be held to constitute a conventional dower which is not in law deemed gra- tuitous; but it is not necessary for me to decide this difficult question now as, in my opinion, the appellants have no status on the facts to impugn the validity of the gift. They are subsequent creditors and the trial judge found that, although the deceased O\u2019Reilly was insolvent at the time of his marriage and at the time of his death, no intention to defraud existed when the marriage contract was entered into. Under such circumstances on what ground can the appellants ask that the contract be set aside? If we take the measure of the claimants\u2019 rights as fixed by the Quebec Code, we find that the avoidance of a contract may be asked for when it is made by the debtor with intent to defraud his creditors and that actual injury results to that creditor. (Art. 1033, C.C.) There must be the animus and the eventus as in the revocatory action (action Paulienne) of the Roman law. The right to attack such a contract is limited, however, by the Code to those creditors whose claims arose previous to the transaction impugned, art. 1039, C.C., and the reason for the limitation is obvious. Whoever incurs an obligation renders all his property, present and future, liable for its fulfilment (art. 1980, C.C.), and the property of a debtor is the common pledge of his creditors. The common pledge of the creditors is the property which their debtor has at the time he incurs his obligations towards them, and that which he acquires during their currency. If, having contracted with his creditor on the faith of his possessions, the debtor subsequently diminishes that creditor\u2019s security by fraudulently dealing with his estate, the creditor is injured and to that extent can complain. Subsequent creditors are not in the same position. The estate of their debtor was when the claim arose dimin- ished to the extent of all the obligations lawfully contracted by him before that time. Rambaud, ibidem, page 336; Langelier, vol. III., page 436; and Mignault, vol. V., page 294.\nIt must be remembered that there is no article in the French Code which corresponds with our article 1039. As Planiol says, commenting upon article 1167 C.N., in vol. II. (5 ed.), at page 109:\nCet article, qui est un des plus importants et des plus pratiques du Code, \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une simple mention de l\u2019action; la loi nous avertit que l\u2019action Paulienne existe toujours; elle ne nous en donne point la r\u00e9glementation. Pour toutes les questions que cette action soul\u00e8ve, nous en sommes donc r\u00e9duits \u00e0 la tradition, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire presque uniquement aux textes romains.\nIt was to supply this omission in the French Code and to provide rules for the protection of the rights of creditors that articles 1033-1034 of the Quebec Code were originally enacted. (First Report of Codifiers, page 14.) The Commissioners say:\nThese rules are of obvious necessity; for imputed fraud against third persons is a fruitful source of litigation and there is no class of rights upon which well defined rules are more required.\nAnd they add:\nThere are but three of the articles in which a deviation has been made from the acknowledged law.\nAnd article 1039, C.C., is not one of the three. That article expressly declares that no contract can be avoided by reason of anything contained in section VI. of the Civil Code at the suit of a subsequent creditor.\nI have carefully examined the cases to which we have been referred, and Ivers v. Lemieux[2] is the only one in which the effect of article 1039 of the Civil Code was considered. In that case the deed was set aside not because the effect of it would be to prejudice subsequent creditors generally, but because the object of the parties at the time they made their contract was to defraud the particular creditor who attacked the deed. Casault J., speaking for the court of review, composed of Meredith C.J., Stuart J., and himself, a very strong court, says, at page 131:\nLa preuve \u00e9tablit que l\u2019acte attaqu\u00e9 par le demandeur avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour objet de d\u00e9pouiller le d\u00e9fendeur de ses biens afin d\u2019emp\u00e8cher le demandeur d\u2019exercer un recours contre eux, ou, pour employer le langage de la m\u00e8re de l\u2019opposant, pour permettre au d\u00e9fendeur de plaider et de soutenir un proc\u00e8s sans gaspiller son butin.\nThe same observation applies to Perreault v. La Parroise de la Malbaie[3], which is referred to by Langelier. I do not wish, of course, to be understood as holding that if an intent to defraud the particular creditors attacking the deed is proved that the principle fraus omnia corrumpit would not apply. In any event the positive finding of the trial judge, concurred in by the provincial courts of appeal, that, on the facts, there was no intent to defraud rebuts the presumption created by article 1034, C.C.\nOn the whole I would dismiss with costs.\nFor the rule laid down by the French commentators, I refer to Beaudry, vol. I., \u201cObligations,\u201d no. 689; Planiol, vol. II. nos. 312 and 313; Dalloz, \u201991, 1, 331; Dalloz, \u201993, 2, 470; Dalloz, Code Annot\u00e9, art. 1167, nos. 131 et seq., and specially no. 138.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014On the 22nd day of June, 1889, in the Village of Aylmer, in the Province of Quebec, before Dumouchel, notary, the respondent, Eliza Petrie, and Edward O\u2019Reilly, both domiciled in Aylmer, made a marriage contract, which was followed by the celebration of their marriage; and, in that marriage contract the parties stipulated separation as to property, and the future wife renounced to the community of property and also all dower; and, finally, the future husband made a gift to his intended wife in the following terms:\nFourthly. And in the future view of the said intended marriage, he, the said Edward O\u2019Reilly, for and in consideration of the love and affection and esteem which he hath for and beareth to the said Miss Eliza Petrie, hath given, granted and confirmed and by these presents doth give, grant and confirm unto the said Miss Eliza Petrie, accepting hereof: First, the household furniture now owned by the said Edward O\u2019Reilly and that which may be hereafter acquired by him by any title whatsoever, to be, the said household furniture, held, used and enjoyed by the said Miss Eliza Petrie as her own absolute property forever. Secondly, the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, currency of Canada, payable unto the said Miss Eliza Petrie by the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns of him, the said Edward O\u2019Reilly, the payment whereof shall become due and demandable after the death of him, the said Edward O\u2019Reilly.\nIt is contended that this stipulation constitutes only an institution d\u2019h\u00e9ritier to take effect after the payment of the debts of the donor, if any, and only after his death, and, also, subject to the condition that the wife survived him.\nIn this case the wife has survived the husband; but he has not left sufficient property to pay his debts in full and the above mentioned sum of twenty-five thousand dollars. Therefore she claims the right to rank on his estate as a creditor.\nIt is difficult to understand how this agreement can be considered otherwise than as a donation. The marriage contract calls it a \u201cgift\u201d; and, should the wife die before her husband, he agrees to keep the said sum of money \u201cin trust\u201d for their children, to be paid unto them as they shall attain the age of majority. It seems to me that this stipulation is not only a donation, but a donation \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux. The deed must be read as a whole, each clause being duly weighed, to carry out the intention of the parties. The gift is made not only \u201cin consideration of the love and affection and esteem,\u201d but also \u201cin the future view of the said intended marriage\u201d which is to be celebrated after the wife has renounced the advantages of community of property and of dower (art. 1038, C.C.); and for that reason article 1034 of the Civil Code does not apply. Finally, the creditors contesting the claim of Mrs. O\u2019Reilly are all creditors posterior to the said marriage contract and, therefore, are not in a position to contest the validity of her claim; art. 1039, C.C.\nDuring the lifetime of the husband no claim could be made; but, after his death, it becomes exigible, \u201cdue and demandable,\u201d as expressed in the said marriage contract.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES, IDINGTON and DUFF JJ. concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacCraken, Henderson, McDougall & Greene.\nSolicitors for the respondent Eliza O\u2019Reilly: Christie, Greene & Hill.\nSolicitor for the respondents, Executors: M.J. Gorman.\n[1] 21 Ont. L.R. 201, sub nom. O'Reilly v. O'Reilly.\n[2] 5 Q.L.R. 128.\n[3] 14 R.L. 338.\n"

Wallberg, (1911) 44 S.C.R. 208\nDate: 1911-04-03\nHis Majesty The King (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nEmil Andrew Wallberg (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1910: November 25, 28; 1911: April 3.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nContract\u2014Public work\u2014Work dehors contract\u2014Acceptance by Crown \u2014Payment\u2014Fair value.\nW. was contractor with the Crown for constructing a car and locomotive repair plant at Moncton, N.B., and was subject to the orders of the government engineer. By order of the engineer and with no contract in writing therefor he constructed sewers and a water system in connection with said works, and on completion of his contract the Crown accepted the additional work and agreed to pay its fair value, but not the amount claimed, which was deemed excessive. The Department of Railways referred the claim to the Exchequer Court and, by consent, it was referred to the Registrar of the court to have the damages assessed, the order of reference providing that \"the amount to be ascertained shall be the fair value or price thereof allowed on a quantum meruit\" The Registrar fixed the amount at $53,205, as the fair value of the work reasonably executed on a somewhat different plan. The judge of the Exchequer Court added $39,000 to this amount, holding that the Crown had admitted the authority of the engineer to order the work to be done, and that W. was entitled to the actual cost plus a percentage for profit. On appeal by the Crown:\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that the judgment appealed against (13 Ex. C.R. 246) was not warranted; that the Crown had not admitted the authority of the engineer, but expressly denied it by pleadings and otherwise; that all W. was entitled to be paid was the fair value of the work to the Crown and the amount allowed by the referee substantially represented such value. APPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] varying the report of the registrar on a reference to ascertain the amount due to the plaintiff for work done by him and accepted by the Crown.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nTilley and Friel for the appellant.\nNesbitt K.C. and Harold Fisher for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff. No contractual relation existed between the parties when the works in question were executed and there was no liability in the Crown to pay for them when completed.\nThe power, except in certain cases, to make contracts which are binding upon the Crown is limited by section 36 of the \"Public Works Act\" (R.S.C. ch. 39), to such as are executed under the direction of the Governor in Council and it is not contended that any such contract was ever entered into between the parties, or that this case comes within the enumerated exceptions. The authority of the engineer to contract for the works, or any part of them, is expressly denied in the second paragraph of the statement of defence. It does not even appear that the Minister, or the Deputy Minister, sanctioned or was aware of the instructions given by the engineer.\nThe Crown, having profited by the work which was done upon property belonging to the Crown, the Minister of Railways agreed to refer the claim to the Exchequer Court under the powers conferred upon him by 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 23, and the important question we are asked to determine upon this appeal is: Assuming that the Crown avails itself of the statutory provision in question for the purpose of ascertaining what it is fair the Crown should pay for work done without its authority upon its property, and of which it has received the benefit, is it competent for the Court of Exchequer to measure the moral voluntary obligation of the Crown, without its consent, by what the work in question, proceeding by extravagant and unreasonable methods, has cost the person who did it, plus a profit thereon to that person, ignoring altogether the value of the work to the Crown, and declining to apply any measure which requires the reasonable and economical performance of the works? To this question there can be but one answer. The Crown was under no legal liability, on the facts as proved, to pay for the work; and the measure of the voluntary obligation assumed by the reference to the Exchequer Court under the statute must be the value of the work to the Crown.\nIt has been argued that the scope of the inquiry was widened by the order of reference made by the judge to the registrar, and that the duty of the latter was under that order to ascertain the fair value or price of the works in question allowed on a quantum meruit basis. This contention cannot be maintained, I say it with all deference. The Minister referred the claim to the Exchequer Court for adjudication but without the admission contained in paragraph five of the statement of defence there would be no liability whatever on the part of the Crown and there should have been no reference to the registrar. The liability of the Crown is to be measured and the power of the judge to refer the claim is limited, therefore, by the scope of the admission which is to the effect that, the Minister of Railways, having accepted and taken over the works on behalf of His Majesty, is willing to pay the fair value of the same; and it is not to be presumed that the judge intended to exceed his authority or to add to the moral, voluntary obligation of the Crown without its consent. The registrar, giving to the terms of the reference their plain meaning when read with the defence, reported the fair value of the works to the Crown, if proceeded with economically and reasonably. Reversing this decision, the judgment appealed from[2] allows to the respondent the cost of the work, plus a profit, without regard to its value to the Crown. If the language used in the order referring the matter to the registrar was susceptible of the construction put upon it by the judgment of the Exchequer Court on appeal, then I am of the opinion that the learned judge, in making such an order, exceeded his jurisdiction, which was limited expressly by the reference under the statute and the defence and could not be extended by counsel for the Crown. To permit the basis of liability in cases referred by the Minister under the statute, 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 23, to be extended by consent of counsel would lead to abuses, which it is not difficult to foresee. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff, I do not think that it was intended by the order of reference to substitute for the fair value to the Crown the amount expended by the respondent, plus a surplus to him.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014It seems to me this appeal must be disposed of largely, if not altogether, upon the construction put upon the order of reference made herein by the Court of Exchequer to the registrar of that court. The action was brought by the plaintiff, respondent, for payment of certain works carried out by him in connection with the Intercolonial Railway property at Moncton.\nThese works comprised a main sewer, branch sewers, a water-system, all connected with certain buildings which the plaintiff, respondent, had contracted with the Crown to build for the railway.\nNo contract had been entered into or authorized by the Crown for the construction of the works in dispute, but the plaintiff claimed that they became necessary in connection with the construction of the buildings which he had contracts for, and that the chief engineer, Mackenzie, of the Intercolonial Railway, who had been appointed to supervise and control these contracted-for works on behalf of the Crown, had authorized him to construct the sewer and water system in question.\nThe plaintiff contended that the works as completed by him had been accepted and taken over by the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada, and he claimed payment for the same either as extra work done by him under his contracts with the Crown, or, in the alternative, for work and labour done and materials supplied by him at the request of the Minister of Railways and Canals.\nIt seems quite clear that the claim for payment as extra work under the contracts could not be maintained, and no question arises on this appeal on that ground.\nIt was also equally clear under the evidence that the only authority which the plaintiff had for doing the work sued for was that of the chief engineer. The Crown, in its statement of defence, denied having entered into any written or other contract with the claimant for the execution of the work sued for; and also denied having authorized the chief engineer, Mackenzie, to contract for the same.\nThe fifth paragraph of the defence reads as follows:\nThe Minister of Railways has accepted and taken over the said works on behalf of His Majesty and is willing to pay the fair value of the same, but not the amount claimed, which is considered excessive.\nAfter issue was joined on these defences, an order was made by consent of counsel for both parties,\nthat it be referred to the registrar of this court for inquiry and report to ascertain the value of the works executed by the plaintiff referred to in the statement of claim, and in respect of which this action is brought.\nAnd,\nthat the amount to be ascertained shall be the fair value or price thereof on a quantum meruit.\nThe registrar entered upon the inquiry and took an immense mass of evidence. In reaching his conclusion he stated in his report that\nthe only question now to be determined, the Crown having accepted and taken over the works, is the fair and reasonable value so to speak of the said works.\nAfter a very full and careful review of the evidence, the registrar reported in favour of allowing the plaintiff $53,205.65, which he held was\nnot only a fair and reasonable value, but a very liberal price to any ordinary contractor.\nOn appeal to the Exchequer Court from the report of the referee, the learned judge held that the registrar had proceeded upon a wrong principle in reaching his findings. The learned judge held as follows;\nThere being no written contract making Mackenzie the sole judge, the Crown is not bound by his report as to the amount due. But the Crown does admit his authority in ordering the works. To my mind it would be manifestly unfair to the contractor in the face of what has taken place and in the face of this judgment to act on the evidence of other engineers who endeavour to shew that Mackenzie might, have adopted a. different plan which would have cost less. It seems to me the case must be viewed from the standpoint of the works being executed on the plans of Mr. Mackenzie and accepting his plans then a quantum meruit.\nNow, if I could reach the conclusion that the reference meant an admission of Mackenzie's authority to order the works and an acceptance of his plans, I should have no hesitation in agreeing with the learned judge's conclusions. The plaintiff, once he proved that he had obeyed the orders of a person authorized by the Crown to give them, and had, in doing so, expended a certain amount of money in the completion of the works, would be entitled to rely upon those facts as the best evidence of what he was entitled to receive, namely, the full amount of his expenditure plus 15 per cent. for his contractor's profit in terms of Mackenzie's orders to him. .\nThere might, of course, be some deduction from this for improvidence or recklessness or extravagance in carrying out the orders if such were clearly proved, but apart from that, nothing remained for the referee to do but ascertain what the works Mackenzie ordered the plaintiff to do cost him and report that as the amount he should recover, plus 15 per cent, contractor's profit.\nThe finding of the learned judge was the logical outcome of his construction of the order of reference. He says, p. 282:\nI think on the evidence as a. whole the plaintiff should be paid the amount found as due by Mr. Mackenzie.\nI am not able, however, to agree in his construction of this order of reference. It places the Crown in the position of \"admitting Mackenzie's authority in ordering the works,\" that is, of admitting that which upon the record the Crown distinctly denied, and on which denial the Crown's claim to reduce the plaintiff's demand largely depended.\nThe Crown in its pleadings denied that the works were done under any written or other contract with the plaintiff, or that Mackenzie had authority to order them to be done.\nBut the Crown went further and said in its fifth plea, that, as the Minister of Railways had accepted and taken over the works, the Crown was\nwilling to pay the fair value of the same, but not the excessive claim of the plaintiff.\nIt was under this plea that I take it the consent to the reference was given, and it is with respect to the admitted willingness of the Crown to pay the fair value of the works because of their acceptance and because of that only, that the terms of the reference must be construed.\nIn construing the order of reference I do not think we should either ignore the plea of the Crown consenting to the payment of the fair value of the work because the Crown had accepted it and taken it over, or the plea specifically denying Mackenzie's authority to order the works to be done. Nor are we justified in ignoring the fact that the works in question were constructed by the plaintiff in direct defiance of the provisions of the statute relating to public works. The sole and only ground upon which the Crown in its plea consented to pay the fair value of the works was that they had been accepted and taken over. To read into the order of reference an admission of Mackenzie's authority to order the works is really to give away the Crown's defence altogether and reduce the reference down to one of mere form.\nThe work sued for was done without any contract and in fact in direct violation of the provisions of the statute law. That fact must have been perfectly well known to such an experienced contractor as the plaintiff, and he was equally responsible with Mackenzie for the illegality of the entire proceedings and construction of the works. He knew there was no tender and that not even the sanction of the Department of Public Works had been obtained for these works.\nThe Crown did not agree to a reference because the contractor had carried out works which its chief engineer had authority to order. In fact it denied explicitly any such authority, and on the record before us it must be taken that Mackenzie had not any such authority.\nThe Crown agreed to the reference because, as said in its plea, it had accepted and taken over the work, and was willing to pay the fair value of the same. It was this fair value of the works which was intended to be referred and nothing else.\nIt was certainly not such fair value estimated on the assumption that Mackenzie had authority to order them and to direct the manner and mode in which they should be constructed.\nI can quite understand the equity of position taken by the defence in saying, it is true the Crown did not order or authorize these works for which you claim payment to be constructed, and it is equally true that their construction has taken place in direct violation of the provisions of the statute requiring tenders to be called for, but the Crown is in the position of a person who finds his property improved by works which he did not order, and for which he did not agree to pay. The Crown, under the circumstances, however, has accepted the work. It might be said that the Crown had hardly an alternative choice between acceptance and rejection. It was under the circumstances almost obliged to accept. But having so accepted and taken the benefit, it was just that payment should be made of the fair value of the work. But such a consent cannot involve an obligation to pay more for the unordered work than its fair value to the Crown so accepting. The reference was not to find out what, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, the works did cost the contractor, but what their fair value was if they had been constructed as they should have been.\nDisagreeing, therefore, as I do, with the basic principle upon which the learned judge reached his conclusions, and agreeing substantially with that on which the Registrar proceeded and made his report and valuation of the work, I am unable to find anything in the record to justify interference with his findings of fact, and would allow the appeal with costs and confirm the report of the referee.\nIdington J.\u2014The conflicting points of view taken by Mr. Justice Cassels and the Registrar of the Exchequer Court require us in this appeal to solve the question of which is right in the construction of the order of reference.\nIt is not pretended now, though it once was, that the appellant ever in fact authorized the works for which the respondent claims to be paid.\nIn the course of carrying out contracts, let to respondent for the erection of shops at Moncton for the Intercolonial Railway service, he and the chief engineer of that road conceived that a sewer and branches leading thereto and also water-pipes, might become serviceable for said shops.\nInstead of bringing this under the notice of the Minister responsible for such expenditure as the execution of. such works would involve, the chief engineer improperly and illegally took it upon himself to direct respondent to carry out the execution of such works. The contractor, from what we are told of him by his counsel relative to his knowledge, intelligence and wide experience, must have known of the need for, and entire absence of, authority to give such an order.\nThis proceeding attracted public attention before the unauthorized work was quite finished. Yet respondent never presented his claim till some months after these works were finished. This action is the result.\nIn answer to the statement of claim making a case for extras under said original contracts, the appellant pleaded denying any contract or authority in any one to direct such works and that they were not extras under said contracts.\nThereafter is the following plea:\n5. The Minister of Railways has accepted and taken over the said works on behalf of His Majesty and is willing to pay the fair value of the same, but not the amount claimed, which is considered excessive.\nUpon this plea issue was joined and an order of reference was made by consent as follows:\n2. This court doth order that it be referred to the registrar of this court for inquiry and report and to ascertain the value of the works executed by the plaintiff referred to in the statement of claim, and in respect of which this action is brought.\n3. And this court doth further order that the amount to be ascertained shall be the fair value or price thereof allowed on a quantum meruit. The costs were also left to the disposal of the registrar. The registrar has reported and therein: said as follows:\nThe Crown having accepted and taken over the works, stands in the position of a person who employs another to do work for him without any agreement as to his compensation, and in such a case the law implies a promise from the employer to the workman that he will pay him for his services as much as he may deserve or merit\u2014 quantum meruit.\nIn the result he has refused to allow for more than he has found as fact these works could have been executed in the place and within the time necessary for their construction and fixed the sum due on that basis at $ 53,205.65.\nOn appeal Mr. Justice Cassels has reached the conclusion, although as already stated absolutely and specifically denied in the pleading, that \"the Crown does admit his\" (i.e., the engineer's) \"authority in ordering the works.\" And as a consequence thereof he arrives at the conclusion that the engineer having directed, as he himself avows, that to be done which would comprehend each step taken, no matter how fruitless in value to the appellant, everything paid by respondent as part of such proceedings must be repaid him with fifteen per cent, profit added thereto, and has substituted the sum of $92,305.48 for that allowed by the registrar.\nWith great respect I am quite unable to accept any such conclusion.\nI am unable to see how, when a party, as explicitly as is done here, denies authority, he can be held to have admitted it.\nI am unable to draw any such admission by way of inference from the enforced or almost enforced occupation or possession by him of the works built without authority and an expressed willingness to pay for their fair value. Nor am I able to see how when he has agreed to refer the question of value to any judicial officer to determine that value, he can be presumed to have, by adopting the language used here, implied in such adoption some technical meaning not necessarily involved in the language and which the attendant circumstances so clearly excluded.\nIf the Crown intended to pay for these works not what they are or were worth, but what they cost, I see no need for a reference.\nI cannot impute to the law officers of the Crown on the motion for reference or at the trial of such an issue, such an obvious absurdity, or the bad faith it must imply towards the Crown entitled to be guarded against making any such admissions, lest doing so might lead to just such conclusions as reached by the learned judge.\nIn other words, the language is just that used where excess of authority may have happened, yet the proprietor ought to pay that which justice demands from him, thus driven by force of circumstances to accept results and use them.\nThe only implication of authority is that which the law implies in order that the fair value of that used, and only so far as used, may be paid for, but never extends to or reaches any abortive efforts in producing the thing used.\nIn this particular case, the paragraph, in addition to the preceding words, relative to ascertaining value, was clearly to express this idea, and to shew that no such refinement of meaning, as might in its absence be contended for, was to be implied. For example, on the one hand, the works when disconnected from the building, might be held to be of little value, and on the other hand, their value when used in connection with the appellant's buildings might be almost inestimable, apart altogether from what it might have cost to have them properly constructed.\nTo deduce from the authority so plainly denied such consequences as appear in this case seems an absolute denial of justice.\nTwo illustrations may be given here of how far the learned judge's construction of the order of reference carries him.\nProceeding in a reckless way, indeed quite in keeping with the recklessness characteristic of the proceedings throughout, the chief engineer instructed the contractor to begin the main sewer through property neither had a right to enter upon, or so far as I can see either ever could have supposed he had a right to enter upon. The contractor says he spent thereon something over seven hundred dollars ($700) when one of the owners drove them off. Forced from that place the engineer and contractor abandoned that work and proceeding, and turned their attention elsewhere to the locality where the sewer was finally placed.\nThe expenses of this unwarranted work are included in the sum allowed in the learned judge's judgment.\nAgain the work was delayed in a most unwarranted manner if to be ended in 1906, as it might have been done.\nThe contractor having delayed beyond his instructions, began in September with a force entirely inadequate for the purpose of completing even a substantial part of the work before the winter frosts set in, which everybody is agreed forbid the prudent continuation of such work.\nThis feeble force dug out unevenly along the entire line of the proposed main sewer, leaving deep holes likely to catch water and produce cavings in here and there.\nThe contractor's own foreman speaks of this as follows:\nQ. How much of the main sewer was done when you took hold? A. How much had been done?\nQ. Yes? A. Well, they had done that much that if I had been taking the contract I would have taken it for less money than when I commenced.\nQ. Try that again? A. If you want to understand it more thoroughly, all the work they had done I considered a detriment at that time.\nThe Registrar: Q. In what way? A. In this way, that as the stuff where they had scooped it out in holes had filled in with soft stuff off the banks, and slid right in there, there was no chance for the water to get away from that hard pan or get through it; it was in sort of basins.\nMr. Friel: Q. You mean by using the teams? A. It had not kept it level.\nThe Registrar: Q. By leaving a knoll? A. Yes, where they would go up over and down; that run in and was filled up with stuff, and you could not shovel it or do anything with it.\nQ. You would not have done it in that way? A. No, sir, I would not; I would have kept it so that it would have drained.\nCounsel for respondent quite properly points out that all this 1906 expenditure in the proper place did not much exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000). And according to the lordly way in which it seems government engineers and contractors are entitled to look at things, that is a mere trifle. He forgets that it is not only the direct expenditure which is involved, but the wretched condition in which it left the entire work when spring came and the work had to be done over again. Counsel overlooks the direct expenses of excavation and removal of this earth that is shewn elsewhere in the evidence to have caved in, and but for the condition created by bungling, would never have needed removal. Exactly how much that was, no one in the evidence in this case tells. He omits also to measure how much the results of this bungling hindered next year the prosecution of the work. No one can accurately tell that either.\nIt is, on the other hand, evident that a portion of the work done in 1906 could not have been rendered useless by the winter frosts. The best I can do is to say the amount of loss direct and indirect to cover this bungling far exceeds what counsel suggests and the problem is, if accuracy is to be reached, almost insoluble on the evidence before us. The respondent made no effort to solve it. Why should he if he has only to shew how much money he paid out and become thereby entitled to be repaid so long as the chief engineer says \"yes\"?\nThe rule laid down in the judgment appealed from relative to the quantum meruit to be applied, simplifies things and measures that by what the chief engineer may be supposed to have tolerated even though not specifically directed. It is, that whatever expenditure the chief engineer chooses to pass as in his opinion proper to be paid, must be paid, unless it is shewn he fraudulently passed it.\nRespondent's counsel very prudently receded apparently from this position so far as to say that anything improvidently done could not be claimed.\nHis concession was more apparent than real, for he strenuously contended for the entire amount allowed and a good deal more including every dollar of all I have so far referred to. It conies back to this, that this improvident expenditure so severely condemned, by respondent's own witness and foreman, has been allowed on the supposition that the chief engineer's orders, conduct and opportunity to object, yet not doing so, have to be taken just as if he were substituted for the appellant or His Minister. The result reached is quite logical if the learned judge's construction of the order of reference is correct.\nThese illustrations shew the absurd consequences of such interpretation. That, of course, can have no place if the order clearly means what the learned judge puts on it. But we are face to face with the fact that no one during the reference took that position. It is one thing to say that the evidence of value given by the engineer is well worth considering in estimating a quantum meruit. It is entirely another thing to say that the order means an admission of his authority. In the latter case there was no need for expert evidence or the long expensive inquiry joined in by both sides. I cannot think this would have ensued if the parties conceived that the order meant what the learned judge holds.\nNor can I accept such construction. I must, therefore, examine the whole case so far as to see if the referee's findings are or are not correct.\nRoughly speaking the total discrepancy between the results arrived at by the learned judge and the referee amounts to thirty-nine thousand dollars ($39,000) and that, speaking again in the rough, is distributable over the several works as follows: Twenty-three thousand dollars on the main sewer. Three thousand five hundred dollars on the branch sewers, and twelve thousand seven hundred dollars on the putting in of the water pipes, which were supplied or paid for by the appellant besides.\nIn other words, the branch sewers have had added to their estimated actual value, nearly thirty per cent., the main sewer seventy per cent., and the putting in of the water pipes nearly one hundred and fifty per cent.\nIt is to be remarked that the greatest discrepancy exists just where the greatest blundering or worse, according to the evidence, was made most apparent. These I will revert to in detail before concluding.\nThe water-works were over a mile long, and the main sewer over half a mile, according to respondent's evidence. The length of the branch sewers I am unable to fix as definitely.\nThis great excess of alleged cost over value in regard to a commonplace job of constructing a sewer only 2,880 feet long, of which eighty feet was a cedar box pipe at the outlet, is something so striking that I have been led to read and carefully consider every bit of evidence given by respondent or on his behalf, as well as the greater part of that given on behalf of appellant, to see if I could find any reasonable explanation for such results other than gross mismanagement or probable error on the part of all or some of those concerned in the execution of the work.\nQ. I think you said the excavation was hard pan; is that correct? A. The excavation on top of the soil was a layer of peat, pretty nearly black, and that went down a foot or a foot and a half or two feet deep. Then below that was a clay for a few inches or so, a clay that seemed to be a little softer, and we got below that and got into a harder clay, and a large number of small pebbles and boulders; and you got deeper, and as you got deeper right straight along to the extreme depth, it grew harder, and the boulders grew larger, and more of them, and the soil grew harder to handle, harder to pick. Nothing very extraordinary one would say if permitted to use common knowledge.\nAnd to make clear what is involved in the word \u201cboulders\" we find the foreman engaged in 1906 speaks as. follows:\nThe Registrar: Q. What sized boulders would they be, varying from what size to what size? A. Well, now, the boulders would be \u2014I do not know as I\u2014I never managed one, but there were some there that we chained out, and a great many the men took into the scrapers, and they would be quite a size.\nQ. Those that you chained out could be drawn by one team of horses? A. Yes, sir, any of them could be drawn by one team.\nNext year's foreman speaks of sometimes four horses being used to pull one out, but he fails to say how often.\nSome witnesses who never saw the work in its execution dwell on veins of sand, and others who worked at it, speak of occasional veins of sand, or pockets of sand, but are very indefinite as to the extent of all that.\nI suspect respondent knows a great deal more of the subject than all these other witnesses put together, yet he fails to put the stress they try to do upon that point of nature of soil.\nAnd when any of those knowing better than he by reason of having done the work, come to speak definitely or as definitely as they could be induced to, we find one serious spot 1,100 to 1,200 feet from the lower end of the sewer.\nWhen this point was reached the banks by reason, it is said, of this sand and gravel, began to give way and induced the men to try shoring, in which they failed. Regarding that question of shoring I will deal later on.\nI am only now trying to describe the character of the soil as the evidence gives it. In addition to what I have stated there are a good many general allusions to sand mixed with clay forming a part of the soil, but definite or exact statement is hard to find save that when water touched the mixed soil it was difficult to handle, and to this I will refer when I come to speak of the water question.\nI desire first to call attention to the proofs of cost.\nAs to whether these entire works actually cost what the respondent claims, I have the gravest doubt.\nThe main works executed under the contracts were going on at the same time (save in winter, when much of the water-system was done) and some six hundred men were employed thereon at times.\nThe men on these works now in question were liable from time to time to be called off to parts of the contract works. There was no time-keeper specially detailed for these works. There was no superintending staff of any kind, specially set apart to look after them. The division of time and material was, by reason of the want of system that prevailed, liable to become at many stages badly done. I do not say it was with one common staff impossible, but there occur at many stages of the doing so with this staff many chances for gross mistakes.\nWhen we are told there never was an account opened in the ledger for these works during the two years they were in progress, and that the accounts which afterwards were made up and are now submitted were of such tracing as could be done from the invoices as marked at the time and the time sheets, it is impossible not to feel it was a most unbusinesslike way for handling the expenditure of so much money.\nWhen we find the original slips on which the time was entered were kept until after each pay-day, and then destroyed, how can we have implicit confidence in what was done? If it was necessary to keep a check of that kind on file to meet the labourer and any of his possible objections, surely it was quite as important to have done so to satisfy the final paymaster.\nAgain as to the method, sometimes we find an alleged checking over with the foreman from day to day, yet we have not all the foremen called.\nWe have a foreman saying he kept a book and returned it into the office. Why so, if the time-keeper had taken it?\nAnd when we find the respondent claiming one-fifth or one-fourth of the salary of his superintendent as against these works, though they only formed of the whole a twelfth part or less; claiming to be paid 20 per cent. of profit in face of a bargain with the chief engineer for 15 per cent, profit; claiming for weather wear on a concrete mixer standing over two years for works that should not have taken more than six months, at the outside; claiming for work done in Winter at rates involved in so doing it in excess of what it would have cost in Summer, according to an overwhelming weight of testimony, when there existed no necessity for doing it in the Winter time at all, and we find so doing it might have been for his indirect advantage in keeping men there, although work ceased on the contracts, I am not disposed to place unbounded confidence in the loose methods I have referred to as sure to result in the greatest attention having been paid by all concerned to save the pockets of the ultimate paymaster.\nThere were three time-keepers, of whom the first is said to have since died. The two others were examined. Jones, the next, says he came in June, 1907, and his evidence is very unsatisfactory. He hesitates and seems not to understand many questions so simple that if the man had been doing the work for months he should easily have answered. He does not strike me as dishonest, but as just the sort of man to make a bad bungle of his work of keeping and distributing time so kept in the way we are asked to believe it was kept and distributed. His self-contradictions in this regard do not tend to my putting implicit confidence either in what he is got finally to say or results derived from such a source. Yet it must have been he who kept time if it was kept during the summer of 1907, in which the greater part of the main sewer-work was done.\nGass, the next in order, came on the 11th of November of that year. He seems to have been, though inexperienced and a lad of only nineteen at the time he entered, of a brighter stamp than Jones. He had to depend in a way not quite clear upon one Manuel, who also kept time of some Italians employed. And Manuel is not called.\nThe whole system, if it can be called so, was at the mercy of the honesty of the foremen, and we have only the evidence of some of these engaged on the main sewer, but none of those on the other work.\nWe have that of Kitchen, under whose handling of the work in 1906 we have seen something.\nThen we have the evidence of Godfrey, who was in charge of the main sewer-work in 1907, until the 20th of October of that year, when he left.\nWe have the evidence of a stable boss and a carpenter on the same work, all of which is not very important.\nOn such evidence and such methods I could not give with confidence I was right, any such award as the judgment appealed from if I were to adopt the cost to the contractor as the basis for payment.\nBut it is said the chief engineer is honest and he approves.\nIt is not necessary to enter upon this issue further than to point out that he is human, that he made a tremendous mistake in so far forgetting his duty and loyalty to those he served as to presume to make a bargain he had no authority or colour of right to make. If he by any possibility could have supposed this was an extra within the ambit of the execution of the contracts he had the supervision of, then the schedule prices ought to have governed him.\nIf the schedule prices were hot appropriate he had no right to substitute anything else. The moment he made a bargain he had no authority to make, he placed himself in a situation where his duty and his interest conflicted.\nWhether from that cause or from other causes he certainly was mistaken either in his former evidence with which he was confronted, or in what appears herein.\nHe is not to be taken as a disinterested witness in this case.\nHe no doubt is a busy man and liable to err through want of time to investigate details. And I am quite sure, on the evidence, he never had personal knowledge of all these details, or investigated them.\nHe assumed and erroneously supposed till a late period some one on behalf of appellant kept time, and then suggested it being done with results not very clear, or at all to be relied upon.\nThen we are asked to take the evidence of other experts, because eminent in their profession, who are called by respondent and say these expenses are reasonable.\nFor myself an expert has no more weight when speaking of matters within the range of ordinary human reason and apprehension as the subject-matter here is, than any other man when he fails to bring home to my mind as probably correct the reasons he gives and the explanation he offers relative to the matter he speaks of.\nI need not enter into detail why such evidence as referred to, given on respondent's behalf, does not appeal to me herein, further than to say a close examination of the grounds therefor and reasons given for it fails to convince me that they are right or ever got seized of the actual facts in detail of which they spoke, or from which they pretended to make the deductions they presented.\nIf they had confined themselves to saying it was possible or even probable such expenditure might be reasonably made, I could understand their position, though it might not have been very definite in its results.\nAnd we have this further crucial test that when called in rebuttal after hearing Mr. Chipman and Mr. Ker, Mr. Holgate did not condescend to tell the court wherein the plan or method of construction these gentlemen suggested was impossible of execution, though he admitted it an ideal method under some conditions or circumstances. And when he says the work was impossible of construction by such methods, I prefer to believe Mr. Chipman, whose experience in this class of work vastly exceeded anything he seems able to pretend to. He has chosen another field for his professional ability. Mr. St. George did give a reason and only one reason relative to the main part of the work, and that was that the ground was wet. And on a minor point as to the putting in of the concrete, he suggests the width of the trench rendered Mr. Chipman's plan impossible to put it in without frames.\nIn this he overlooked Mr. Chipman's theory that the trench should never have been so wide. The referee has allowed for the excavation to a greater width than Mr. Chipman deemed necessary, and assuming he has allowed the work for frames used, that part of this expert's evidence is thereby answered so far as bearing on the issue of quantum before us.\nIt seems to me the entire issue as between the experts is thus reduced to a question of the wetness of the ground where the main sewer was constructed.\nThe difficulty from this cause of handling the work is what all the witnesses dwell upon.\nMr. Chipman explained that if there was water it had to be taken care of. He told how. He explained why it did not seem difficult.\nThe railway embankment cut off the water from the large area of lowland on which the shops were being erected and it could not get across till reaching a certain culvert at a distance from the main sewer.\nThe chief part of the sewer was thus out of reach of water from that source. It seems highly improbable (I infer from what he says), that any underground condition so existed as a conductor under the railway track. It would, I suppose, affect its stability. At least his explanation of the situation is unchallenged.\nThen, if water came from other sources it had to be drained away, and if need be pumped away. He did not seem to expect this, but properly assumed the possibility, though improbable, of need for much pumping.\nNot a word from either of these experts of respondent to shew that was impossible unless at an expense of say twenty thousand dollars, which this work cost beyond what it is said to be worth.\nThey deal in generalities. Face to face with this simple, or at least apparently simple, problem, they give no reason to shew why it was insurmountable at a moderate cost.\nI find, further, on this subject of water the following from the report of the referee:\nAt page 338 witness Godfrey further states he would not let the water go down the ditch. And Mr. Peter Archibald, a well-known civil engineer of great experience, heard on behalf of the plaintiff, tells us also at page 256:\nThe surface drainage was not kept out of the trench, and the water came in, and you could not expect anything else but slurry when you left the surface water in.\nMr. Mackenzie tells us, at page 256, that \"the first thing that had to be done in doing that work was to get the water off from the vicinity of the buildings.\" And that seems to explain a great deal.\nThen as to the shoring of the ditch, when dried by proper drainage, however provided, they fail utterly to shew why shoring could not have succeeded. The evidence shews it was only tried at one place, although a witness who could tell little about it says two places.\nAt this one place already referred to as 1,100 to 1,200 feet from the lower end of the sewer it was tried when, I infer, evidently too late, as the bank had shewn signs of breaking. It was done by men without experience. The problem does not seem to have engaged the attention of respondent or the chief engineer or others of experience.\nThe foreman, who tells of this attempt, says:\nQ. During the work were any of the railway officials there? A. I think Mr. Mackenzie was there occasionally.\nThe truth seems to be that the best plan never was considered by any one of experience.\nThere is not one of the entire outfit employed directly to do so and who had the execution of the work in charge that had experience of the kind necessary to do it economically.\nRespondent and the chief engineer do not seem to have turned their minds in that direction.\nMr. Chipman is a man evidently of that wide experience in this class of work that lends weight to his evidence. It reads as that of one who knows whereof he speaks, and who is perfectly candid. It appeals to one's reason and common sense in a way that the evidence of some others does not.\nThe referee saw and heard all these men giving their evidence, and I think he evinced the experience needed to appreciate it correctly. And I think he has done so.\nAs to the other work there was evidence relative to the cost of sewer building in Moncton, and of excavating for and laying water-works pipes that shews the cost thereof in that locality does not exceed what Mr. Chipman estimates it should, and is well within what the referee has allowed.\nRespondent's own contract there for the city confirms this.\nThe doing of the work in winter was inexcusable on all the evidence, To allow for that increased cost is what there can be no excuse for unless we substitute Mr. Mackenzie for the Minister who is responsible therefor.\nThe evidence of Mr. Edington, the local engineer for Moncton, relative to the cost of executing work there for either water-pipes or sewers, is that of a man who knew the local conditions better than any one else unless respondent, and probably than he also. Compare what he states and Mr. Chipman and others say as to necessary cost of such work, and it seems impossible to accept as reasonable the gross extravagance, to put it mildly, involved in the enormous price by which respondent's charges exceed every estimate given upon or in relation to a common every day sort of work.\nAs the referee says the evidence bearing on the branch sewers work is most meagre.\nThere occur to me only two possible things the referee may not have allowed for. One is the question of interest during the execution of the work. Interest after its execution he has dealt with on a proper legal basis, and the learned judge agrees therein. But in executing any such work as this no doubt the contractor is usually paid by progress estimates which save him some outlay of interest. Mr. Chipman's figures probably proceeded on such conditions.\nAgain, the carpenter work involved in making frames for cement or putting in shoring according to Mr. Chipman's plan may have been overlooked. I am in doubt whether these elements of cost are covered by his allowances or by Mr. Chipman's estimates if the nature of the soil needed heavier timbers than under usual conditions.\nThe strength of timber needed for shoring a small part of the main sewer might have exceeded the usual thing. If the experts had directed their minds to this point one could have understood them. To say it was impossible is entirely another story.\nI incline to think what the referee allowed beyond Mr. Chipman's estimates would cover all these minor things I refer to.\nIf there has been any oversight of them I have no doubt they will be readily rectified. If not respondent's case is to blame.\nThe evidence maintains the referee's findings and should not now be disturbed for any such doubts as I may have.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014On the proper construction of the order of reference I think the question referred for investigation was the \"fair value\" of the completed sewerage and water-systems mentioned in the pleadings. By that I think is meant the value to the Crown, but the value estimated with regard to the circumstance that the construction of these systems was a necessary work; in such circumstances the completed work would be worth to the Crown just what it would cost to reproduce them in the usual way, that is to say, to have them constructed under a contract entered into after a proper opportunity had been given for the presentation of competitive tenders. I do not know any other way of ascertaining such cost than estimating the reasonable cost of such works when executed in a provident way.\nI disagree with the learned trial judge's construction of the order, for several reasons. In the first place the statement of defence shews that the Crown disputes liability, and denies that the works were executed under its authority. It then proceeds (par. 5) as follows:\n5. The Minister of Railways has accepted and taken over the said works on behalf of His Majesty and is willing to pay the fair value of the same, but not the amount claimed, which is considered excessive.\nIt is under this paragraph, and this paragraph alone, that the reference was directed. It is, of course, clear that what the Minister declares his willingness to pay for, is the works \"accepted and taken over,\" What were the works \"accepted and taken over\"? Surely the completed sewerage and water-systems. I do not think any other meaning can fairly be attributed to the paragraph. Then turning to the order of reference; paragraphs 2 and 3 are as follows:\n2. This court doth order that it be referred to the registrar of this court for inquiry and report and to ascertain the value of the works executed by the plaintiff referred to in the statement of claim, and in respect of which this action is brought.\n3. And this court doth further order that the amount to be ascertained shall be the fair value or price thereof allowed on a quantum meruit.\nWhat are the \"works executed by the plaintiff referred to in the statement of claim\"? Can there be any doubt that these works are the \"sewerage and water-system\" referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6, in which the foundation of the claim is set forth? Then the \"works\" of which the value is to be ascertained being the sewerage and water-systems as completed by the respondent and taken over by the Minister, it appears to me that quantum meruit must be construed as applied to this finished production, and not necessarily to the energy expended and materials used wastefully or otherwise in attaining the result. If I am right in these views the judgment of the learned trial judge cannot be sustained on the ground upon which he has placed it, and it is necessary, therefore, to consider the question whether the conclusions of the registrar are supported by the evidence before him.\nIt is, of course, undeniable that it would be a circumstance of great importance if it appeared that the work done was really done under the direction of Mr. Mackenzie, the chief engineer of the Intercolonial Railway. Neither Mr. Mackenzie's general competence nor his good faith has been directly impugned; and we may take it that both Mr. Mackenzie and the respondent are for the purposes of this case free from any imputation of dishonest collusion. No such charge was directly made, and for my part I decline to give any countenance to the motion that litigants may get the benefit of suggestions of indirect dealing without taking the responsibility of making their charges in plain, unmistakable terms. I was strongly impressed on the argument with the idea that the learned registrar had failed to give due weight to the contrast between an opinion attested by actual approval of the work as done on the ground by an engineer in a position of responsibility and opinions given by experts necessarily resting upon an assumed state of facts which they could not in the nature of things verify for themselves. A careful examination of the whole evidence has, however, convinced me that there are many circumstances detracting from the importance which might normally be attached to Mackenzie's connection with this work. The arrangement between Mackenzie and the respondent was according to the both of them that Wallberg was to be paid his actual expenditure plus 15 per cent. as profit. This arrangement was not only unauthorized, but in direct contravention of a public statute as Mackenzie knew. No specifications were prepared and no plan (except one of grades) until after the completion of the works. No provision was made for checking expenditures. No accounts were given or asked until the work was complete. The respondent was left entirely with regard to all these matters to his own devices and no information of the arrangement was given to the Department until the respondent's account was sent in. The supposed supervision by Mackenzie indeed as regards everything required to safeguard the interests of the Department becomes\u2014when one examines the evidence\u2014a myth. In face of these facts I do not think Mackenzie's approval of the respondent's methods mainly given ex post facto can be regarded as carrying that weight to which in happier circumstances it might have been entitled. I repeat, I suggest no dishonesty or conscious wrongdoing, but I cannot credit him with such an appreciation of his responsibilities arising out of the transaction with the respondent as might have been expected.\nThe learned registrar is, I think, fully justified in his conclusion that there was quite sufficient evidence of mismanagement to lead to the conclusion that the actual expenditures as presented by the respondent could not be accepted as reliable evidence of the fair cost of the work executed according to proper methods. The respondent's foreman, Godfrey, says that when he came to the work in June, 1907, what had already been done was in such a state that it was actually a detriment. The chief difficulty to be encountered was the presence of water in the excavations; and the evidence is overwhelming that the course adopted was obviously calculated to aggravate, as it did aggravate, that difficulty; and there was, moreover, ample evidence to shew that the methods of construction were needlessly expensive.\nAs to the amount allowed by the registrar, although on some particular points one might, if one were treating the question as res nova have taken a different view, I am not satisfied that on the whole or in any important particular he has failed to do justice to the respondents claims.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The principal question for determination in this appeal is whether the basis on which the learned judge of the Exchequer Court has dealt with the plaintiff's claim, or that adopted by the registrar upon the reference to him, is correct. Having regard to the fact that the plaintiff's rights rest entirely upon the consent of the Crown, that question must, in my opinion, be determined by a proper interpretation of the terms in which that consent is couched. It is contained in two documents\u2014the plea of the Attorney-General, and the order of reference. The material paragraph of the statement of defence is as follows:\n5. The Minister of Railways has accepted and taken over the said works on behalf of His Majesty, and is willing to pay the fair value of the same, but, not the amount claimed, which is considered excessive.\nThe order of reference contained these provisions:\n2. This court doth order that it be referred to the registrar of this court for inquiry and report, and to ascertain the value of the works executed by the plaintiff referred to in the statement of claim and in respect of which this action is brought.\n3. And this court doth further order that the amount to be ascertained shall be the fair value or price thereof allowed on a quantum meruit.\nAs the latter document defines with some particularity the basis on which \"the fair value\" is to be ascertained, for which in the former the Crown expressed its willingness to pay, I think that, if there be a difference between them, the basis on which the plaintiff's claim is now to be dealt with must be sought in the terms of the order of reference, rather than in those of the plea. As a consent order, the order of reference is binding on the Crown as a party defendant. No step has been taken to set it aside. No attack has been made upon it as having been procured by fraud or misrepresentation, or as the result of mistake, nor has there been any repudiation of the authority of counsel for the Crown to consent to it in the very terms in which it issued. As I view it, the only question open on this appeal is\u2014under the order of reference on what basis should the registrar have disposed of the plaintiff's claim.\nThe Crown, seeking to uphold the finding of the registrar, maintains that the actual value of the completed work in situ, constructed in the most economical method feasible, is the basis of compensation contemplated; the plaintiff contends that the fair cost of the works in the circumstances in which they were in fact executed, plus a reasonable profit, is what the order of reference required the registrar to ascertain. If the former view be correct, I am quite unable to understand why the clause of the order numbered 3 was inserted. Its presence in the order, in my opinion, renders the position taken by the learned counsel for the Crown quite untenable, and fully supports the view of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that \"the fair value or price\" should be determined on the basis of the fair cost of the works as executed (excluding extra expense incurred through any negligence or fault of the contractor), plus a reasonable profit to him. I agree in the learned judge's appreciation of the relative value of the evidence of experienced men \"who were present on the ground and saw the actual state of affairs,\" and that of expert \"witnesses testifying after the completion of the work.\" In the absence of any evidence of fraud or collusion on his part with the contractor, the testimony of an engineer occupying Mr. Mackenzie's position is certainly entitled to the greatest weight, and it would require strong proof against it to justify putting it aside. The registrar has expressly found that there was neither fraud nor collusion on the part of Mr. Mackenzie; and the fact that he is still retained as chief government engineer adds not a little to the value of his evidence.\nSo far as the course taken by the contractor was determined by the plans furnished him by the engineer, or by his directions, no fault or negligence should, in my opinion, be attributed to him. So far as the manner of carrying on the work was left to his own judgment and discretion, the contractor must be answerable for any excess in cost owing to the adoption of improper or extravagant methods.\nAn attempt was made in argument to impugn the reliability of the evidence as to the time-keeping upon the work. I think that attempt failed.\nIt was also contended that the respondent should be disallowed the sum of $708.76 \"expended for the work on the so-called false start.\" This work was done by the contractor under the instructions of Mr. Mackenzie, but was discontinued and abandoned under similar instructions, because the Crown's title to the land upon which it was done was challenged. It forms no part of the works \"accepted and taken over\" on behalf of His Majesty, and if the plaintiff's right were dependent upon that fact, this item must be disallowed. But although it is not separately and specifically mentioned in the statement of claim, the cost of it is included in the expenditure for labour and materials which go to make up the sum of $ 105,940.15 claimed by the plaintiff. As one \"of the works executed by the plaintiff referred to in the statement of claim and in respect of which this action is brought,\" I agree with the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that the work on this false start is covered by the order of reference.\nMuch stress was laid in argument upon the extravagant cost of the work done by the plaintiff. On the evidence in the record, and especially that of Mr. Mackenzie, the responsibility for any excess in the cost of the work properly done under his directions\u2014if there be any\u2014must rest with him and not upon the contractor. I agree with the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that it would be manifestly unfair to the latter to hold that he must suffer for having carried out plans and followed the instructions of the government engineer. This consideration, I think, having regard to the terms of the order of reference, determines in the plaintiff's favour the claims made on behalf of the Crown for deductions from the cost of the works on account of an alleged excessive width of the excavations.\nAs to the prices per yard to be allowed for the various portions of the works, I find myself unable to say that the view of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court is erroneous.\nBut the evidence of Godfrey, a witness for the plaintiff and his own foreman, discloses a somewhat serious mistake made by the plaintiff in opening up too great a length of excavation at once instead of excavating in short sections. This appears to have much increased the difficulties in handling the surface water \u2014serious enough under most favourable conditions\u2014 and to have resulted in some work being rendered useless and in the subsequent taking out of material being made more troublesome and costly. The method of excavating was apparently left entirely to the judgment of the contractor. For this mistake responsibility cannot be placed on Mr. Mackenzie's shoulders. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court appears to have overlooked this matter; at all events he does not seem to have taken it into account.\nFrom the report of the registrar it is not possible to gather what would be a fair deduction to make from the amount allowed to the plaintiff by the learned judge, to cover the cost of labour of which the benefit was actually lost because of the plaintiff's mistake in excavating for too great a length of sewer at once, and the increase in the cost of subsequent work due to the same cause. I think it would not be satisfactory to attempt to fix this amount by a study of the voluminous evidence before us without the assistance of argument. Unless the parties can agree upon the amount by which the sum fixed in the judgment of the Exchequer Court should be reduced in respect of these matters, the case should go back to the registrar in order that he may inquire and report upon it. If the parties can agree, the finding of the Exchequer Court may be varied accordingly; if not, it should be varied by deducting from it the amount which shall be ascertained to be proper upon the reference to the registrar. Having regard to the 5th paragraph of the statement of defence, to the order of reference, and to the terms of the memorandum of the Minister of Railways under which the claim of the plaintiff was referred to the Exchequer Court \"for adjudication,\" I cannot accede to the contention of counsel for the appellant that the learned judge erred in directing a judgment declaratory of the plaintiff's right to recover from the Crown the amount which the Crown had formally expressed it's readiness to pay and had asked to have determined. With the effect of this adjudication we are not concerned.\nNeither can I accept the view of the appellant's counsel that the registrar's report was not appealable.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Jas. Friel.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Harold Fisher.\n[1] 13 Ex. C.R. 246.\n[2] 13 Ex. C.R. 246.\n"

The deed under which S. claimed contained the following as part of the description: \u201cThen running in an eastwardly direction along the said highway until it comes to a. crossway in the public highway and running in a southerly direction until it comes to the waters of Broad Cove.\u201d There were two crossways in the highway and S. contended that the first one reached on the course was indicated and R. that it was the second lying a little farther west.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (44 N.S. Rep. 332), Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that to run the course to the first crossway would take it over land not owned by the grantor; that there were other difficulties in the way of taking that course; that S. had apparently for many years treated the second crossway as the boundary; and what evidence there was favoured that view. The construction should, therefore, be that the crossway mentioned in the description was the second of the two.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe question at issue on the appeal is stated in the above head-note. Newcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nGregory K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree with Sir Louis Davies; the appeal should be allowed.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with the reasoning and conclusions of Justices Graham and Longley in the court below, and would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe case turns largely upon the construction to be given to the language of the description in defendant Strople\u2019s deed dated February, 1886. That deed was from the widow and heirs of the late James Reddy and conveyed to the defendant \u201ctwelve acres more or less\u201d of fifteen acres owned in his lifetime by James Reddy. A triangular piece of 23\/4 acres at the northeast corner was omitted, and it is contended on the part of the plaintiff that the little piece of land in dispute about made up the balance of the 15 acres. I think it clear beyond reasonable doubt that the person who drew the description in defendant\u2019s deed had before him the description in the late James Reddy\u2019s deed, and that the changes made in the language used in the defendant\u2019s deed were made to exclude that triangular 23\/4 acres and the disputed land.\nThe description in James Reddy\u2019s deed of the land in dispute read,\nthence eastwardly on the margin of the said public highway until it conies to a stake standing in a heap of stones; thence due south nine rods crossing the said highway to the head of Broad Cove aforesaid at its N.W. angle.\nIn defendant\u2019s deed that was changed to read\nthen running in an eastwardly direction along the said highway until it comes to a crossway in the public highway and running in a southerly direction until it comes to the waters of Broad Cove. The change made in the line was clear. The old description ran along the highway to a \u201cstake standing in a heap of stones\u201d and thence to the head of Broad Cove at its N.W. angle. The description in defendant\u2019s deed ran along the highway eastwardly until it came to a crossway and then not to the N.W. angle of Broad Cove, but simply to the waters of the Cove.\nAs a fact there were two \u201ccrossways\u201d in the highway and this fact has given rise to the dispute. The heap of stones up to which the line ran in James Reddy\u2019s deed lay, it is said, about midway between the two crossways.\nThe majority of the court below held that by the true construction of the description in Strople\u2019s deed the line ran along the highway past the first crossway to this heap of stones and then to the waters of the bay. The reason for so continuing this line past the first crossway and on to the heap of stones was that such a course did not do violence to the description as it was a \u201csoutherly direction\u201d and that unless such a construction was adopted the line from the first cross-way to the waters of the Bay would necessarily run through another man\u2019s land and embrace part of that land in the lands conveyed to Strople. But such a construction ignores altogether the limiting word \u201cuntil\u201d in the description. The line is to run\nin an easterly direction along the highway until it comes to a cross-way,\nand then in a southerly direction to the waters of the bay. That seems clearly to shew that it was not to run along the highway past the \u201ccross-way\u201d intended as the natural boundary mark to another natural mark not referred to, but apparently deliberately omitted from the description.\nAll these difficulties are avoided by construing the \u201ccrossway\u201d mentioned in the description to refer to the second crossway lying a little further south.\nSuch a construction accords with that put upon it by the parties themselves just after Strople got his deed when the boundary fence was put up by Strople with the consent of the Reddys. It avoids any difficulty such as holding that the parties intended the line from the highway to the waters of the Bay to run across and include within the land conveyed part of another man\u2019s land, and it gives Strople the full area professed to be conveyed to him.\nI do not wish to be understood as saying that the mere fact of the line crossing another man\u2019s land would be conclusive against adopting it if the language of the description was clear and certain that such line was intended. But where, as in this case, there were two crossways and it is uncertain which is meant, if the adoption of one leads to such difficulties and anomalies as I have referred to, and that of the other leads to no difficulties at all, but accords with the construction the parties themselves seem soon after the deed to have adopted, I have no difficulty in concluding that the latter construction is the true one.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014One James Reddy died intestate. His heirs either had disposed of all but the land sold to respondent, or thought they had done so, thirty years or more before this contest arose.\nOne Michael Reddy, who knew, I infer, a great deal more about what he on behalf of the heirs had to sell and intended to sell than we ever can know, sold re- spondent a piece of land which was supposed to be the last that the heirs had.\nHenry Reddy pretends he shewed the now disputed line to Strople, but does not pretend to have bought the disputed land. He seems rather in the position of the man who had removed his neighbour\u2019s land marks, as it were, taken possession of his lands for nothing and for long years refused to recognize anybody\u2019s rights therein. And if I had to choose between his story and that of the others, I should not be too hasty in implicitly relying upon him. His evidence shews how dangerous it is to depart lightly from the express language in a deed.\nI infer from what appears in the description that one Henry Reddy had before this grant to Strople, got two and three-quarter acres of what James Reddy left.\nAfter payment of the price by Strople a deed pursuant to such sale was made on the 27th of February, 1886, by said heirs to him.\nThe description in that deed shews, by its reference to the course which cuts off two and three-quarter acres of the block which formerly belonged to James Reddy and runs along the lands of Henry Reddy for nine and a half chains, what the parties were doing. Taking several successive courses not disputed, it runs till, using the words,\nand then running in an eastwardly direction along the said highway until it comes to a crossway in the public highway, and running in a southerly direction until it comes to the waters of Broad Cove, etc.\nThe appellant contends there is another crossway on the same highway further on and that this southerly divergence whatever it implies must be from the second instead of the first crossway. But why so? What right to carry the course being run along the highway, any further than the express language permits?\nOne argument says: Oh, if you turned out suddenly at that first crossway and tried to reach Broad Cove you would cross another man\u2019s land and include part of that in the deed.\nSuppose it did, was that the first time another\u2019s land has been mistakenly included in a description? We have imported herein a good deal of evidence inadmissible on any theory but that of ambiguity in the deed. How can it be pretended there is any ambiguity? If \u201csoutherly\u201d must be held to mean due south, as some contend (but I do not admit, and the surveyor\u2019s evidence says it does not mean), the line will reach Broad Cove and following the remaining course along that cove to place of beginning, the description is complete and no ambiguity exists.\nThe deed thereby covers and purports to convey land that is now believed to have belonged to another. But this very deed by its description includes in any way it is read, the public highway just as much as it does this other man\u2019s land.\nThe deed may cover error, but not ambiguity. The ambiguity is created by those who import into the express language that which it does not permit of, by carrying the course along the highway beyond the point at which that course ceases.\nAny possible ambiguity arises from the use of the word \u201csoutherly\u201d and is confined to that course alone from the point where the preceding course ended.\nNow let us try to bear in mind and see if we can understand what the people framing this deed were about. James Reddy\u2019s heirs when represented by Michael Reddy in this transaction, had no other land there to sell but what admittedly is covered by the deed, and this quarter of an acre of beach of no particular value, but forming beyond doubt part of the same inheritance.\nAre we to suppose it was designed to exclude from the sale this worthless bit? For what purpose was it to be excluded?\nA southerly course from the first crossway to the point on Broad Cove to which the land belonging to James Reddy\u2019s heirs extended, is undoubtedly what the parties had in view.\nThe surrounding circumstances all point to that as the meaning of \u201csoutherly.\u201d And such a line may, if intended to be a straight line, erroneously include a few feet of another man\u2019s land.\nFor reasons I have already assigned, how can that affect the matter?\nGiving effect to the evident purpose of the parties as gathered from the surrounding circumstances, no doubt can exist that it effectuated their purpose by connecting the first crossway and the extreme southwesterly point of the Reddy land touching the cove.\nBut is it absolutely necessary in view of these circumstances to say that \u201csoutherly\u201d must be taken in an absolutely straight line?\nI think there is, if I may be permitted to say so, great good sense in the view that Chief Justice Town-send in the court below holds as to this course deviating slightly to avoid the inclusion of another man\u2019s land.\nAgain what is to be said when we find that for twenty-three years after the deed to respondent these heirs never appeared to imagine they had any land there.\nIn the case of Van Dieman\u2019s Land Co. v. Marine Board of Table Cape[2], at page 98, Lord Chancellor Halsbury:\nThe contemporaneous exposition is not confined to user under the deed. All circumstances which can tend to shew the intentions of the parties whether before or after the execution of the deed itself may be relevant, and in this case their Lordships think are very relevant to the questions in debate.\nIf ever parties granting manifested their intention the heirs of James Reddy did in this case. They assumed for over thirty years partly before this deed and chiefly after that they had no concern in this land.\nIf we turn to respondent\u2019s intention, we find he cropped for some years beyond the line he is now sought to be restricted to, and when he fenced gives reasons for placing it where he did and then kept bars in it for access to the land in question and used the land in question from time to time for purposes of hauling in sea-weed and drift wood and is corroborated in these regards.\nThe next neighbour never interfered, and when his acts seemed to indicate a purpose to interfere, like a man of sense he said it made no difference to him and he made no contention.\nI need not follow at length the manifest absurdities in giving way to the second crossway contention.\nIt is easy to see how the error in description arose if respondent is to be believed, and such evidence is for this purpose admissible.\nClearly his evidence is admissible as fixing the point of the first crossway as point of the southerly divergence. And if believed I do not see how that point can be departed from.\nBut he goes further and tells that Michael Reddy shewing the boundaries of what he sold said there was a corner stake, near that point, of a pile of stones and a stake in it. Being unable to find the pile of stones they took the crossway as substantially at the point from which to run southerly to the cove.\nWhen this dispute arose then a surveyor took the most westwardly point of land Reddy\u2019s heirs had on the cove and sighted a line from there that led to the discovery of this very pile of stones and a stake.\nI do not use this to shew that it is to govern, but confirmatory of what respondent says did happen and misled the parties at the time.\nI cannot think there ever was a conventional line. Much contradiction exists as to that agreement. One side professes it settled everything, and the other that it settled it only if found to be correct. This latter condition is denied. A few questions and answers from the evidence of appellant near the close of the case settles that to my mind. He was recalled and says:\nQ. Referring to that agreement you signed in the house, you did not see any sketch of the surveyor? A. No.\nQ. Did you know he had a sketch? A. No.\nQ. Did you know he was going to make a sketch? A. He said he was going to make a plan, that is what he said.\nQ. \u201cReference may be had to the plan,\u201d that was the plan you had in mind that he was to make after he went home? A. All that I know is that he said he was going to make a plan. I supposed the plan would be a plan of the land.\nQ. It was the particular plan that he was to make when he went home that agreement was referring to? A. He did not say when he was going to make it. He said he was going to make a plan.\nQ. That was the one referred to in the agreement was the one he was going to make? A. I supposed it would be a plan of all the land he was going to make.\nQ. At all events you knew there was to be a plan made in connection with that agreement? A. He said that he was going to make a plan.\nQ. Did you understand there was to be a plan made or not in connection with that agreement? A. I supposed when he said he was going to make a plan that he would make one.\nQ. In connection with that agreement? A. I could not say.\nWhat was this plan for if all was ended? Who was to pay for it? What does he mean? It seems to me this evidence is inconsistent with the theory of a fence existent and a fence to be so many feet from it as a finality of a dispute.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The controversy in the action out of which this appeal arises turns upon the true construction of a conveyance dated 27th February, 1886, made between the heirs of one James Reddy and G. R. Strople, the respondent, of a parcel of land described therein in these words:\nA certain lot or parcel of land, situate and being on the north side of Broad Cove, in the Township of Manchester, in the County of Guysborough, aforesaid, and being part of Lot number one, in Hallowell\u2019s Grant. Bounded as follows: Beginning at a white birch tree on the north side of Broad Cove, aforesaid, and near a small brook, from thence crossing the public highway and running a due course north until it comes to a stake in a heap of stones, against Henry Reddy\u2019s line, a distance of eleven chains, and from thence in a northwesterly direction along Henry Reddy\u2019s, until it comes to a stake in a stone pile, a distance of nine and one-half chains, and from thence in a west, southwesterly direction until it comes to a maple tree, and continuing on from that until it comes to the public highway, and then running in an eastwardly direction along the said highway until it comes to a crossway in the public highway, and running in a southerly direction until, it comes to the waters of Broad Cove, and thence in an eastwardly direction along the waters of Broad Cove, until it comes to the place of beginning, containing by estimation 12 acres, more or less.\nThis description may be conveniently followed by referring to the subjoined sketch.\nThe property in dispute lies between the main road and the shore of Broad Cove and is bounded on the east by the line AB, and on the west by the line XY. The respondent alleges that this piece of land is included in the tract embraced on the above description and this the appellant denies.\nAt each of the points marked 6 and B there is a \u201ccrossway\u201d \u2014 by which term is designated a small bridge carrying the travelled road across a narrow stream or ditch; and the crucial point in the controversy is whether the first or second of these bridges is that which is referred to as the \u201ccrossway\u201d in the description quoted. If the first, then it is hardly disputed that the parcel in question is included in the description, but if not then that parcel is clearly excluded.\nApplying the accepted canons of construction I do not think there is any difficulty in construing this deed. The difficulty, if I may say so, appears to have arisen from overlooking the rule\u2014which, it may be observed, is a rule of law \u2014 that where parties have reduced their transaction to writing (and especially where the law requires the transaction to be expressed in writing) the words of the written instrument themselves construed with such aid as may be legitimately obtained from extrinsic circumstances are conclusively taken to express their intention.\nThere is a further rule which must be applied in this case, and that is, (I state it in the words of Coleridge J., in Shore v. Wilson[3], at page 525), that where the language used in the deed in its primary meaning is unambiguous, and that meaning is not excluded by the context, and is sensible with reference to the extrinsic circumstances, then such primary meaning must be taken conclusively as that in which the words are used.\nThere can, I think, be no doubt about the primary meaning of the words used in this description in so far as they affect the point in dispute. The deed directs you to trace your boundary in an \u201ceasterly direction along\u201d the public highway\nuntil it comes to a cross way in the public highway and running in a southerly direction until it comes to the waters of Broad Cove.\nI agree with the appellant that prima facie this description requires you to change your direction when you come to the crossway; and I think that \u201crunning in a southerly direction until it comes to the waters of Broad Cove\u201d prim\u00e0 facie means that the line is to be run in the same direction until the destination is reached and that the direction is south. On these points I agree, I say, with the appellant\u2019s contention and with the view of the learned dissenting judges in the court below. The effect of the description then is this: In laying out the boundary you are to go along the highway in an easterly direction until you come to a \u201ccrossway\u201d and then you are to turn south. There is no ambiguity about that as it stands. It means as plainly as words can express it that when you come to a \u201ccrossway\u201d you are to change your direction and turn south. Can it affect your course in the least that having come to a \u201ccrossway\u201d you are told that there is another crossway further on? Obviously it cannot; because you are to turn south when you come to a crossway, and you have come to a crossway. It is quite clear then that here there is nothing in the nature of an equivocation. It is quite clear, I mean, when one remembers that the essential feature of an equivocation is, as Lord Chancellor Cairns said in Charter v. Charter[4], at page 377, that the description shall be \u201cequally applicable in all its parts\u201d to two persons or two things. The suggestion is that a boundary traced by turning south at the first crossway and a boundary traced by turning south at the second cross-way are things to which this description is equally applicable. That is obviously not so because it is plain that the deed having directed you to turn south when in passing along the highway you meet a crossway, you are departing from the plain terms of the direction when having met a crossway you, instead of turning south, proceed easterly until you meet a second \u201ccross-way.\u201d Nobody intending you to go on to the second crossway would think of giving the direction contained in this description. There is, therefore, nothing in the nature of equivocation.\nAre then the words of this description according to which the boundary proceeds southwards from the first crossway \u201csensible with reference to the extrinsic circumstances,\u201d The only difficulty suggested is that a boundary so traced encloses property which at the date of the conveyance was not the property of the grantor. It is said that there is a presumption that the grantor did not intend to convey what he did not own and that this is sufficient to justify a departure from the primary meaning of this perfectly unambiguous description and the adoption of the second \u201ccrossway\u201d as the point of divergence. The contention necessarily involves this that within the meaning of the rule of construction I have stated the words of an unambiguous description in a conveyance are not in the primary meaning \u201csensible with reference to extrinsic circumstances\u201d when it appears that the parcel described includes some property to which the grantor had no title. That is a proposition for which no authority was cited for the reason, no doubt, that no authority giving it the slightest countenance can be discovered; it is a proposition quite irreconcilable with principle.\nNo conveyance by a vendor without title can, of course, pass a title. But at common law certain conveyances operated as it was said to convey an estate \u201cby wrong\u201d; and in such cases, speaking broadly, if the person making the conveyance afterwards acquired the property the title passed, as it was said, by estoppel; that is to say, the vendor was by his conveyance estopped from denying that he had a title at the time it was made. A statutory grant, it is true, has not the same effect; but in such grants there is usually, or, at all events, frequently, a covenant for further assurance or an unqualified covenant for title which if the grant were for valuable consideration would in the absence of some countervailing equity be equally effective to prevent the grantor from retaining the property as against the grantee if he should afterwards acquire it. What is the purpose of unqualified covenants for title? Of covenants for further assurance? To hold upon some such presumption as that suggested that a description otherwise perfectly clear is to be altered to exclude property to which the grantor had no title is simply to tear up the deed. But I need not pursue the argument into its details; the point is quite settled by the authority of a decision of this court. As Strong C.J. said delivering the judgment of the majority of the court in Barthel v. Scotten[5], at page 370:\nit matters nothing in a case of this kind whether the grantor had or had not title to all he assumed to convey; we are to construe the description according to the language of the instrument abstracted from all considerations as to title. The result, however, seems equally clear if we seek to gather the intention of the parties not (as the law requires) from the language of the deed, but as if the question of intention were at large \u2014 to be ascertained from an examination of all the facts in evidence. One thing the evidence establishes, I think, is that Strople understood he was getting the property which then belonged to the estate of James Reddy, a small part of the estate having previously passed to Henry Reddy.\nThe evidence of Henry Reddy is relied upon by the appellants, but two circumstances corroborate Strople in my view conclusively. First, there is no suggestion of any reason why this small disputed piece of land was omitted from the sale to Strople, and secondly, it is hardly conceivable that rational people intending to make the second crossway the point of departure would have used the language we find in the deed.\nThe claim to a conventional boundary clearly fails. The evidence establishes that no concluded agreement was reached.\nAnglin J.\u2014With respect I would allow this appeal and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Graham and Mr. Justice Longley. I should not have thought it necessary to add anything to what they have said had a different view not been taken by some of my learned brothers. On this account I shall refer briefly to the evidence.\nThe words of the description in the Strople deed,\nrunning in an easterly direction along the said highway until it conies to a crossway in the public highway, prim\u00e0 facie refer to the first crossway met with in the highway, and only serious difficulties in the application of the description as a whole, if the reference be so taken, can justify their being referred to any other crossway. But when the evidence discloses that the next line of the boundary as described in the deed will, if run from this first crossway, necessarily include a considerable piece of land which the grantor did not own, the presumption against an intention thus to deal with a neighbour\u2019s property necessarily puts one upon inquiry whether the first crossway was really the point of departure from the line of the highway which the parties intended. When it is found that a little farther on there is a second crossway\u2014if anything more marked and noticeable than the first\u2014and that a line run from it in the designated direction will without any difficulty reach the place indicated in the description as its terminus, the doubt becomes very grave and a case at least of equivocation or latent ambiguity is well established. We then properly look to the circumstances to solve the doubt thus raised. On the one hand the defendant swears that it was all the land owned by Jas. Reddy which he bought (a triangular piece of the property, 23\/4 acres, he admittedly did not buy), and that, at the time he was purchasing, Michael Reddy, since deceased, pointed out to him the first or western crossway as the point where the boundary would cross the highway and turn southerly. On the other hand Henry Reddy swears that it was he who put the defendant in possession of his property, and that in doing so he indicated to him the second or eastern crossway as the point at which his boundary turned southerly from the highway to the water. He also says that the heirs of James Reddy retained, between the highway and the beach, a piece of the land owned by James Reddy which had been fenced in with his, Henry Reddy\u2019s, adjoining property. In this conflict of testimony the acts of the parties must be looked to in the hope that they may aid in ascertaining where the truth lies.\nThe defendant admits that since he bought it his land has been separated by a fence from the property occupied by Henry Reddy, and later by Samuel Pyle. This fence, put up by the defendant, was never at all near the line which he now asserts to be the boundary. It was first placed\u2014Henry Reddy says by his permission\u2014about 50 feet west of the second crossway; some fifteen years ago it was moved back by the defendant \u2014 Henry Reddy says upon his instructions \u2014 to the line of the brook at the second crossway. After he moved the fence back to the brook Strople ceased \u201ccropping\u201d the 50 feet of land immediately west of it. While admitting these facts Strople denies having received the permission and instructions of Henry Reddy to which the latter deposed.\nSamuel Pyle partly corroborates Henry Reddy as to the reservation of a piece of land by the heirs of Jas. Reddy. More cogent corroboration is given by the departure in the description in the Strople deed from that in the deed to Jas. Reddy, the earlier part of which was obviously followed in Strople\u2019s deed. Strople\u2019s deed names a new point of departure from the highway and it does not fix the point at which the boundary strikes the waters of the cove as it was fixed in Jas. Reddy\u2019s deed. It is very difficult to explain these changes on the hypothesis that Strople\u2019s agreement was to buy the whole of Jas. Reddy\u2019s land, except the 23\/4 acre triangular piece in the northwest corner\u2014 no more and no less. Strople\u2019s explanation of them \u2014that when Michael Reddy indicated the boundary to him they could not find the pile of stones and stakes beside the highway mentioned in Jas. Reddy\u2019s deed \u2014 is certainly inadequate in view of the ease with which this monument appears to have been discovered when the surveyor, Mr. Taylor, was brought down 23 years later \u201cto run the line.\u201d Strople\u2019s explanations as to the placing of his boundary fence at and near the second crossway are equally unsatisfactory.\nMr. Taylor, who gave evidence for the defendant, says that when he was called in to run the line there appeared to be \u201cdoubt\u201d in Strople\u2019s mind whether the second crossway \u201cwas not the right bridge.\u201d Taylor does not say that Strople then pointed out the first crossway to him as that mentioned in his deed or shewn to him by Michael Reddy when he was purchasing as the point of departure of the boundary line from the highway. On the other hand Strople says he did, on this occasion, shew the first crossway to Taylor, Henry Reddy, John Reddy, Samuel Pyle and Stephen Pyle, as the crossway mentioned in his deed. Yet he admits that after he had done this he signed a memorandum accepting the fence at the second crossway as his boundary, \u201cif it was the correct line.\u201d\nAll this evidence, in my opinion, affords substantial proof that for many years the defendant treated the second crossway as the true point of departure of his boundary from the line of the highway. His certainty, when giving evidence at the trial, that it was from the first crossway that his boundary turned southerly, would seem to have been a mere doubt when Mr. Taylor was called in \u2014 a doubt so slight that he signed an agreement placing the point from which his boundary turned southerly, at least conditionally, at the second crossway. While he may not be bound by this agreement to the line of the second crossway as a conventional boundary, his execution of it is not the act of a man who was certain that he had, when purchasing, been shewn the first crossway as the point where his boundary left the highway. George Strople\u2019s conduct at and since the time of his purchase, in my opinion, affords evidence more reliable than his testimony at the trial as to what were shewn him as, and what he really understood to be, the boundaries of the land he bought. It is, I think, reasonably clear that, until the dispute which precipitated the present litigation arose, all the parties interested acted on the assumption that the defendant\u2019s boundary followed the highway easterly until it reached the second crossway, when it turned southerly to the waters of the cove.\nIn view of these facts and of the difficulties involved in running a line southerly from the first cross-way to the waters of the cove, I resolve the equivocation in the description in the Strople deed by determining that it was the second crossway and not the first which was intended by the words, \u201cuntil it comes to a crossway.\u201d The person who prepared the Strople deed probably had not in mind the existence of the first crossway. This sufficiently accounts for his use of the words, \u201cuntil it comes to a crossway,\u201d to indicate the second crossway and affords an explanation much simpler than, and quite free from such difficulties as are involved in, that suggested on behalf of the defendant, who, in order to avoid carrying his boundary line across the lands of a stranger, would continue it easterly along the highway beyond the first crossway until it reaches the stake and pile of stones mentioned in James Reddy\u2019s deed, situate about midway between the first crossway and the second, and would then turn it southerly to the waters of the cove along the line defined in the James Reddy deed \u2014 thus reverting to the description from which a distinct departure was made, apparently deliberately, in preparing the description of the land he purchased. Instead of turning southerly from the first crossway, to which it runs in a southeasterly direction, the boundary, as now proposed by the defendant would continue to follow the line of the highway, deflecting more to the east, and, after running in this direction about 100 feet, turning abruptly to the south. That the words of the description in Strople\u2019s deed \u2014 \u201cand running in a southerly direction until it comes to the waters of Broad Cove\u201d \u2014 designate a single straight line, I think, admits of no dispute. The device to which the respondent is driven, to obviate including part of Pyle\u2019s property in his deed, is not only inconsistent with the departure which that deed makes from the description in the James Reddy deed, but involves changing the single straight line defined in his own deed as running southerly from the first crossway to the cove, into two lines, one almost at right angles to the other, and the first of them running easterly, not southerly, the deflection at the first crossway being northward rather than southward as the call of the deed requires.\nThe only admissible solution of the equivocation or latent ambiguity raised by the evidence of the actual conditions on the ground appears to me to be to take the second crossway as the point of departure from the highway.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court en banc, and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

He was thrown violently forward on the back of the seat in front of him, but was able to leave the car and walk a short distance towards his place of business when he collapsed and was taken home in a cab. He was laid up for several weeks and never recovered his former state of health. On the trial of an action against the Railway Co. one medical witness gave as his opinion that the physical shock received by T. was the exciting cause of his condition, while others ascribed it to a disturbed nervous system. Negligence on the part of the company was not denied, but the trial judge was asked to direct the jury to distinguish, in assessing damages, between the physical and nervous injuries, which he refused to do.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (22 Ont. L.R. 204), that the trial judge properly refused to direct the jury as requested; that the injuries to T.\u2019s nervous system were as much the direct result of the negligence of the company as those to his physical system, and he could recover compensation for both; and that in any case it was impossible for the jury to sever the damages. Victorian Railway Commissioners v. Coultas (13 App. Cas. 222) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The facts of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nGlyn Osler, for the appellants, referred to Victorian Railway Commissioners v. Coultas[2].\nMasten K.C. for the respondent was not called upon.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This case is distinguishable from Victorian Railway Commissioners v. Coultas2. In that case the condition from which the complainant was suffering was due to fright alone. Here there was impact resulting in some physical injury, however slight, to the respondent. The question at issue between the parties at the trial, as I understand it, was whether the jury should be directed to apportion the compensation allowed so as to distinguish between that which was attributable to injuries resulting from nervous shock and that properly attributable to physical contact. I would have thought it too clear for argument that where a person suffers physical injury, however slight, damages might also be claimed for the fright occasioned thereby. It would appear somewhat difficult to distinguish between the injury caused to the human frame by the impact and that resulting to the nervous system in consequence of the shock, the shock and the physical injury being both the result of the same accident. The nature of the mysterious relation which exists between the nervous system and the passive tissues of the human body has been the subject of much learned speculation, but I am not aware that the extent to which the one acts and reacts upon the other has yet been definitely ascertained. Those who are interested will find a learned discussion of the whole subject by Paul Bert in his book where he discusses the role played in the human system by what he calls \u201cla grande sensitive.\u201d I do not think that many of the jurors who usually try damage cases have had their attention directed to this abstract subject which, as Bert says, has baffled the scientists for ages. For my part it is difficult to understand how a person should not be allowed to recover for an injury to the nervous system resulting from fright which frequently alone produces physical injuries of the most serious character. But we are not concerned with that question now. Here the fact of physical injury is established beyond all doubt, and, that fact once admitted, I cannot find the line of demarcation between the damage resulting to the human being by reason of the fracture of a limb or the rupture of an artery and that which may flow from the disturbance of the nervous system caused by the same accident. The latter may well be the result of a derangement of the relation existing between the bones, the sinews, the arteries and the nerves. In any event the resultant effect is the same. The victim is incapacitated and in consequence suffers damages, whether the incapacity results from the physical injury alone or the physical injury with the nervous shock superadded.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014After hearing counsel for the appellant we did not deem it necessary to call upon respondent\u2019s counsel to sustain the judgment appealed from.\nThe respondent sued the railway company for damages arising out of injuries he claimed to have been caused to him while being carried as a passenger on one of their street cars which, through the negligence of their servants, came into collision with a railway train.\nThe shock of the collision threw the respondent, as he stated in his evidence, from where he was sitting \u201cright over to the back of the next seat,\u201d which would be the seat facing him.\nNo physical result of the collision upon the respondent was noticed by him until he had left the scene of the accident and was proceeding towards his employer\u2019s office. He then, however, \u201csuddenly collapsed,\u201d was conveyed to his home in a cab and for many weeks was unable to resume with any continuity his usual employment.\nThere were some slight apparent bruises on respondent\u2019s body, but none apparently serious.\nThe opinion of Dr. McPhedran, who was called on respondent\u2019s behalf, reached from listening to the evidence and accepting the history of the case as given to him by the respondent, was \u201cthat the physical shock that he suffered excited the condition that he was suffering from,\u201d that he did not think he was suffering \u201cpurely from a mental effect created on his mind,\u201d but thought \u201cthe physical effect was the exciting cause,\u201d and he described the respondent\u2019s condition as traumatic neurasthenia.\nSome medical evidence was given by the defendants which did not agree with that of Dr. McPhedran, and the trial judge was requested when leaving the case to the jury, to ask them to separate the plaintiff\u2019s injuries \u201cas between the physical injuries and the nervous ones.\u201d\nThe learned Chief Justice who tried the case, in my opinion very properly refused to impose upon the jury what under the evidence was an almost, if not altogether, impossible task. He said:\nI was requested to put a question to you to separate the injuries as between the physical and the nervous injury. I declined to do that for one reason\u2014a very sufficient one\u2014amongst others that that question of physical injury is one of very doubtful meaning. There was not any great physical injury in the sense that there were any bones broken, or any great bruising or abrasion of the surface; but there may be a physical injury of a serious nature which is not indicated by any external mark. So, therefore, I leave the whole question to you to say what damages he ought to recover for the injury, if you think he has sustained any.\nAn attempt to divide the damages in the manner suggested would, it seems to me, have involved the merest speculation.\nThe demand at the trial to have the damages so assessed and divided was pressed at the trial and afterwards in the Court of Appeal and in this court on the assumed application to this case of the principle supposed to have been determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Victorian Railway Commissioners v. Coultas[3]. The head-note of the case as reported seems correctly to state what was really decided:\nDamages in a case of negligent collision must be the natural and reasonable result of the defendants\u2019 act; damages for a nervous shock or mental injury caused by fright at an impending collision are too remote.\nIn delivering the judgment, their Lordships say:\nDamages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual physical injury, but occasioning a nervous or mental shock, cannot. under such circumstances, their Lordships think, be considered a consequence which, in the ordinary course of things, would flow from the negligence of the gate-keeper. If it were held that they can, it appears to their Lordships that it would be extending the liability for negligence much beyond what that liability has hitherto been held to be. Not only in such a case as the present, but in every case where an accident caused by negligence had given a person a serious nervous shock, there might be a claim for damages on account of mental injury. The difficulty which now often exists in case of alleged physical injuries of determining whether they were caused by the negligent act would be greatly increased, and a wide field opened for imaginary claims.\nThe rule laid down by their Lordships as to the proper measure of damages to be allowed has not been called in question so far as I have seen, but the legal proposition stated that\ndamages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual physical injury, but occasioning a nervous or mental shock,\ncannot under such circumstances as their Lordships were considering\nbe considered a consequence which in the ordinary course of things would flow from the negligence of the gate-keeper,\ncomplained of in that case, has been the subject of much comment and adverse criticism alike in subsequent judicial decisions of the English and Irish courts, as also of those of Australia and of many text writers of recognized authority.\nIn the case of Dulieu v. White & Sons[4], at page 676, Mr. Justice Kennedy thus refers to this decision of the Privy Council:\nIn that case the principal circumstances were that the appellants\u2019 gate-keeper negligently invited the male plaintiff and his wife, who were driving in a buggy, to enter the gate at a crossing when a train was approaching, and, though there was no actual collision with the train, the escape was so narrow and the danger so alarming that the lady fainted and suffered a severe nervous shock, which produced illness and a miscarriage. The Colonial Court had entered judgment for the plaintiff for the amount found by the jury at the trial of the action brought against the appellants for negligence. The Privy Council reversed this decision. The principal ground of their judgment is formulated in the following sentence: \u201cDamages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual physical injury, but occasioning a nervous or mental shock cannot under such circumstances, their Lordships think, be considered a consequence which, in the ordinary course of things, would flow from the negligence of the gate-keeper.\u201d A judgment of the Privy Council ought, of course, to be treated by this court as entitled to very great weight indeed; but it is not binding upon us, and, in venturing most respectfully not to follow it in the present case, I am fortified by the fact that its correctness was treated by Lord Esher M.R. in his judgment in Pugh v. London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co.[5] as open to question; that it was disapproved by the Exchequer Division in Ireland in Bell v. Great Northern Railway Co. of Ireland[6], where, in the course of his judgment, Palles C.B. gives a reasoned criticism of the Privy Council judgment, which, with all respect, I entirely adopt; and, lastly, by the fact that I find that the judgment has been unfavourably reviewed by legal authors of recognized weight, such as Mr. Sedgwick (on Damages (8th ed.), p. 861), Sir Frederick Pollock (The Law of Torts (6th ed.), pp. 50-52), and Mr. Beven (Negligence in Law (2nd ed.), pp. 76-83).\nThis court would possibly feel itself bound, notwithstanding all this adverse criticism, in a case where the facts were strictly analogous to those under consideration in Victorian Railway Commissioners v. Coultas[7], to follow that decision. But I do not think they would be disposed to in any sense enlarge the principle underlying that decision or apply it to facts so essentially differing from those there considered as the facts do in the case now before us. Here there was a violent collision brought about by the negligence of the defendant railway company and occasioning injuries to a passenger being carried by that company.\nThere was sufficient medical and other evidence to justify the jury, properly directed as in my judgment they were, in holding that the plaintiff had sustained injuries arising from the shock or collision. Unless the trial judge should have directed the jury to \u201cdivide the physical damages from the mental shock,\u201d there was no misdirection and could be no complaint as to the damages assessed.\nI do not think any such direction would, under the circumstances, have been proper, nor am I able to see how any such division could have been made by the jury without entering into the domain of absolute conjecture.\nIf the railway company by the negligence of its servants causes a collision between two trains or cars which results in injuries to one of its passengers, they are admittedly liable for all such damages as are the reasonable and natural result of their negligent acts. I am quite unable to understand why injuries to the nervous system should be excluded from consideration in assessing such damages. Such injuries are as much the reasonable and natural results of the negligence which causes or is responsible for a railway collision or accident as physical injuries, such as broken bones, crushed or bruised or lost limbs, or loss of sight or hearing or other physical sense. The nervous system is just as much a part of man\u2019s physical being as the muscular or other parts and equally, if not more, important. In all cases the question of material injury having been caused the passenger or injured one must be a question of fact. Bodily injuries are not necessarily observable and cannot always be diagnosed or defined with legal accuracy or precision. But the results or effects may be perfectly well known and describable. Many of what are called physical injuries are altogether internal and not even to modern medical science observable. Indeed, the worst injuries are too often such. Injuries may consist of broken bones, crushed or torn muscles or sinews, injured or ruined eye-sight, hearing or memory. These can, with some approach to certainty, be observed and described. But injuries may, as we all know, be not physically observable, and may result in a complete or partial collapse of the nervous system. In the latter cases, the results are frequently more deplorable and injurious to the unfortunate man than are the injuries physically observable or ascertainable with medical certainty. Medical men may call the results by what scientific term they please. But if they are such as incapacitate the injured one from earning his living or enjoying life as he was accustomed to, or subject him to constant or intermittent attacks of pain or incapacity, is the negligent carrier to be excused from liability because it may be successfully contended that the injurious results are wholly or partially to the nervous system and are not observable on the physical system? True, it is, there is danger of simulation, and in some cases of possible self-deception, resulting in imaginary ailments and claims. But in any and all cases they must in the last analysis be reduced to questions of fact for the court and jury to determine. The danger from simulation or imaginary claims may call for the closest and most exhaustive examination, but would not justify the court, in cases where the liability of the company for damages was established, in exonerating the negligent company from liability.\nAll I am contending for is that actionable negligence on a carrier\u2019s part resulting in injuries arising out of a collision or impact extends as well to those injuries which may be classed under the head of, or as the result of, nervous collapse or prostration, as to those of a strictly physical character. It is, of course, essential that the injuries, whether nervous or physical, should be the natural and reasonable result of the carrier\u2019s negligence, but the mere fact of these injuries being physical or nervous cannot affect the liability. The ease with which in the one case the damages are capable of being ascertained, and the difficulty which in the other case may frequently arise, cannot be made the test of liability. That test must be based upon the negligence causing the collision or accident, and the proof of the alleged injuries being a natural and reasonable result from such negligence.\nWe are not obliged in such a case as the one before us to apply the rule as to remoteness of damages adopted in the Coultas Case[8] to the facts the Judicial Committee had before them. I do not think we would be justified in doing so, as the cases can be so easily and satisfactorily distinguished. In yielding to the defendant\u2019s contention we would be giving a dangerous and improper extension to the rule there laid down, which, as I understand the decision, was confined to \u201cdamages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual physical injury.\u201d I have no hesitation in holding that the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were right, and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The respondent was a passenger on a car on the appellant company\u2019s railway when it came into collision at a level crossing with a locomotive en- gine of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. The only point in controversy at the trial related to the question of damages. The respondent\u2019s evidence, which in this respect was not contradicted or seriously attacked, was to the effect that when the collision occurred he was seated and in the seat nearest the motorman, but facing the rear end of the car; that having noticed people hurriedly leaving the car he was turning to look forward to see the cause of the disturbance when the collision occurred as the result of which he was thrown violently forward and across the back of the seat opposite to that in which he was sitting. He further said that, without assistance, he got off the car and after walking some distance, to use his own words, \u201che simply collapsed\u201d and could go no further. He took another car to the office, where he was engaged as bookkeeper, but feeling he was unfit to work went home and called in a physician. He was unable to return to his duties for five weeks and between the time of the accident (October, 1908) and the trial (March, 1910), there were 37 weeks during which he was unable to work. He said that immediately after the accident he suffered \u201cpains all over his body,\u201d and that he then\u2014at the trial\u2014\u201cwas a wreck.\u201d He had pains all over his limbs.\nMy shoulders, my legs, my feet and up to the knees as a rule are like in cold water. I have no energy or will-power to do anything scarcely.\nPrior to the accident the respondent, who was 68 years of age, had, according to his own statement, enjoyed the normal health of a man of his years.\nThe medical testimony was given by two witnesses, one called by the respondent and one by the appellants. The effect of the evidence of Dr. McPhedran, called by the respondent, was that he was suffering from neurasthenia, the result of a nervous shock which might have been due, and in his opinion was due, to the physical jar described by the respondent as received in the collision. There was no express testimony that the respondent had experienced any fright. When asked at the trial what his sensations were, he said: \u201cI thought I was going to be smashed up.\u201d Then in answer to a question from the learned trial judge, \u201cI suppose you had not much time for sensations?\u201d he said: \u201cThere was no time to think.\u201d On his examination for discovery the respondent stated that his illness was due to \u201cnervous shock\u201d; and at the trial he admitted that \u201cso far as he knew\u201d his answers given on that examination were \u201cpractically true.\u201d\nDr. Johnson, the medical witness called by the appellant, did not dispute the opinion of Dr. McPhedran that the same neurasthenic condition might arise from the physical shock to the system caused by such a jar as that experienced by the respondent, but stated that when examined by him some time before the examination made by Dr. McPhedran, the respondent was not suffering from neurasthenia and there were no signs of any injury to his nervous system.\nThe learned trial judge was asked to direct the jury in estimating the damages to distinguish between the injury suffered by the respondent in consequence of the shock to his nervous system in so far as it arose from fright and the injury due to the physical jar; and the appeal is based on the refusal of the learned Chief Justice to give such a direction.\nI think that the learned Chief Justice was right in this refusal. The only evidence on the point, the uncontradicted evidence of Dr. McPhedran, was quite positive to the effect that it would be quite impossible to distinguish a neurasthenic condition caused by fright from such a condition caused by physical jar. The same condition might be produced by either cause. That being the case\u2014assuming there was evidence of fright sufficient to entitle the jury to say that the respondent\u2019s condition might in some degree be due to mental disturbance\u2014it is quite clear that the jury would have no means whatever of apportioning the consequences as between the two concurring causes and to direct them to do so would simply be directing them to go through a process which as a tribunal, acting judicially and therefore reasonably, they would be incapable of doing. There was, however, in my judgment no evidence which would justify the jury in attributing the respondent\u2019s condition to the direct effect of mental disturbance. The respondent himself is unable to give (and quite naturally) any very accurate account of his mental experiences during the critical moment. His statement that his illness was due to \u201cnervous shock\u201d is quite consistent with the notion that its exciting cause was purely physical; and his statement that he \u201cexpected to be smashed up\u201d does not seem necessarily to imply any such mental disturbance as would affect his physical condition.\nThe medical witness for the company did not say, and it is clear that on such vague evidence he could not say, that mental shock experienced by the plaintiff arising from an expectation of being injured would account in any degree for the injury his nervous system sustained. It is obvious that having another circumstance, the physical jar, which would definitely account for that condition it was impossible to say that a state of mind so indefinitely described had anything whatever to do with it.\nIn these circumstances it is quite clear that the learned trial judge would have erred if he had suggested to the jury that they should attempt to ascertain and designate some definite proportion of the damages suffered as attributable to the plaintiff\u2019s state of mind.\nIn this view of the case it is quite unnecessary to analyze closely the decision of the Privy Council in the Coultas Case[9].\nI do not think there is anything in that case remotely countenancing the contention that where there is a physical blow sufficient to account for nervous conditions which might also have been produced by fright, if there was fright, accompanying the blow\u2014that in such a case the jury must attempt the absolutely impossible task of separating the results arising on the one hand from the physical impact from those arising from mental disturbance on the other.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In view of the manner in which the Coultas Case9, and the doctrine for which it is supposed to stand have been dealt with in recent English and Irish decisions, it should, I think, be followed only in cases in which the facts are indistinguishable from those there considered by the Judicial Committee. We are not bound by the views expressed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Henderson v. Canada Atlantic Railway Co.[10], and if they imply any extended application of the principle of the Coultas Case9, I must, with deference, decline to adopt them. The decision of this court in the Henderson Case[11], does not at all affect the question now before us. I respectfully concur in the statement of Palles C.B. in Bell v. Great Northern Railway Co.[12], at p. 442:\nI am of the opinion that as the relation between fright and injury to the nerve and brain structure of the body is a matter which depends entirely upon scientific and medical testimony it is impossible for any court to lay down as a matter of law that if negligence causes fright and such fright in its turn so affects such structures as to cause injury to health, such injury cannot be a consequence which in the ordinary course of things would flow from the negligence unless such injury accompany such negligence in point of time.\nI agree with Garrow J.A. that\nno one can object to the general principle enunciated at p. 225 (of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Coultas Case[13]) that the \u201cdamages must be the natural and reasonable result of the defendant\u2019s act; such a consequence as in the ordinary course of things would flow from the act;\u201d\nbut I am unable to understand the argument for the appellants that the damages sought to be recovered in the present case are not a natural and reasonable result of the negligence charged against the defendants. The Coultas Case13 should not, in my opinion, be held to preclude recovery where there has been actual impact to which a jury might not unreasonably ascribe the injuries complained of, or where, without actual impact, a passenger being carried by a common carrier has, through the negligence of such carrier, sustained a serious mental or nervous shock due to fear of immediate personal injury to himself from such negligence (Dulieu v. White[14]), the injurious physical consequences of which have been established and have been sufficiently shewn to be the result of that negligence. There was in the present case no evidence upon which the jury could be asked to distinguish between damages sustained by the plaintiff because of purely mental injury, and damages which he sustained from physical injury due to mental or nervous shock. The right to recover for injury of this latter class is established by many English and American authorities, and, in the circumstances of the present case, it is not precluded by the decision of the Privy Council in the Coultas Case13.\nThere certainly was evidence that the plaintiff had suffered and was suffering actual physical injury, whether its cause was mental or physical shock, and there was also evidence, as pointed out by Garrow J.A., that his condition was due in part at least to actual physical shock. In either aspect he was entitled to recover, and the learned Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench was, in my opinion, fully justified in declining to ask the jury to refine between mere mental injury and physical injury due to mental shock, or between the latter and physical injury due to physical shock. Indeed, since physical injury, whether due to mental or to physical shock, would entitle the plaintiff to damages, there could be no object in drawing the latter distinction.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Masten, Starr, Spence & Cameron.\n[1] 22 Ont.

The facts of the case as disclosed by the appeal book in the Court of Appeal are as follows: On the 27th March, 1909, the respondent, Goodall, caused to be issued a writ of summons out of the High Court of Justice at Toronto against the defendant, indorsed as follows:\n\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claim is to have it declared that the plaintiff is entitled to receive from the defendant 20,000 shares fully paid up and non-assessable of the capital stock of the Lawson Mine, Limited, and for an injunction to restrain the defendant from selling, assigning, transferring, encumbering, or otherwise disposing of or dealing with his shares of the capital stock of the said company until he shall have transferred said 20,000 shares to the plaintiff, and from selling, assigning, transferring, encumbering or otherwise disposing of or dealing with the certificate for 371,094 of said shares in his favour now deposited with the accountant of the Supreme Court of Judicature in pursuance of the judgment entered in the action now or lately pending in this court wherein Murdock McLeod and others are plaintiffs and Thomas Crawford and the said defendants and others are defendants.\u201d\nOn this writ an interim injunction was granted until the 10th May next by the Hon. Mr. Justice MacMahon, on the 29th March, restraining the defendant from disposing of the shares of stock in question. On the 2nd April, 1909, a consent order was obtained dissolving the injunction upon payment into court to the credit of the cause of the sum of $5,000 to stand as security to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim. On the 4th May, the statement of claim was filed, which alleged that an agreement had been entered into on the 14th December, 1908, between the plaintiff and defendant by which the defendant, in consideration of an advance to the amount of $5,549.12, upon which there was interest due, bringing the claim up to $6,500, agreed to pay $1,500 in cash and deliver 20,000 shares of stock in the Lawson Mine, Limited. Plaintiff then alleged that defendant, in fraud of the plaintiff, attempted to sell his stock in the Lawson Mine without first setting apart the 20,000 shares belonging to the plaintiff, and in the 15th and 16th paragraphs stated as follows:\n\u201c15. The defendant having conceived the design of cheating the plaintiff out of his 20,000 shares of stock in the Lawson Mine, Limited, falsely and fraudulently made claim that under the said agreement of 14th December, 1908, the plaintiff was to hold the aforesaid 20,000 shares of stock in said company only as a security for the repayment of the sum of $5,000, and interest, and not as the absolute owner thereof.\n\u201c16. In order to carry out his said fraudulent design in breach of his said agreement with the plaintiff, the defendant paid to the plaintiff the sum of $5,100 in alleged settlement of his indebtedness to the plaintiff and endeavoured to transfer and to make a good title to the said 20,000 shares of stock to some one else and to deprive the plaintiff of his right, title and interest therein and thereto.\u201d\nThe pleading concluded by the plaintiff claiming \u201cthat it be declared that under the agreement of the 14th day of December, 1908, the plaintiff was entitled to receive from the defendant, 20,000 non-assessable shares of stock of the Lawson Mine, Limited, or a 250th interest in the Lawson Mine, as the absolute purchaser and owner thereof.\n\u201c2. That it may be declared that the plaintiff is entitled to receive payment out of court of the said sum of $5,000 and accrued interest and that the said sum with accrued interest may be paid out to him.\u201d\nTo this the defendant pleaded, amongst other things, that the agreement above mentioned was given on the understanding on the part of both that it should only become operative when assented to by one Thomas Crawford, and that the said Thomas Crawford never assented to the agreement, and the same thereby became inoperative.\nUpon this issue the action went down for trial before the Hon. Mr. Justice Riddell, who gave judgmen on the 26th October, 1909, whereby he declared the agreement valid and subsisting and referred the cause to the official referee of the court to assess the damages which the plaintiff had sustained by reason of the breach of the contract, and reserved further directions and costs until the referee should have made his report. The referee made his report on the 8th April, 1910, assessing the damages at $8,000. From this an appeal was taken by the defendant before the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who reduced the damages from $8,000 to $5,200. The plaintiff then appealed to the Divisional Court where the damages were increased to $6,700, and subject to this variation the report was confirmed. The judgment of the Divisional Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, and the defendant now proposes to appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe nature of this action as disclosed by the statement of claim which asks for a declaration of the rights of the parties under the agreement in question, the circumstance that the relief asked for by the writ is an injunction, and the form of the judgment itself, which reserved further directions and costs, a provision under the old practice only found in decrees of a court of chancery, all in my mind abundantly establish the fact that this is a case which, under the old distinction which obtained between actions in law and equity, could only have been brought by bill in chancery; and if I am right in the view as to this preliminary point, the determination of the present application does not, in my judgment, afford any difficulty.\nPractically the sole question discussed before me was whether or not the judgment proposed to be appealed from is a final judgment, the assumption being that if not a final judgment, no appeal would lie. But this view overlooks the provisions of section 38, sub-section (c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court in cases, whether the judgment was final or not, where it is given \u201cin any action, suit, cause, matter or judicial proceeding in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity originally instituted in any Superior Court, in any province of Canada other than the Province of Quebec.\u201d The section of the statute uses the word \u201cjudgment,\u201d not \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d and the expression \u201cjudgment\u201d is interpreted in section 2 of the Act as including any judgment, rule, order, decision, decree, decretal order or sentence thereof, when used with reference to the court appealed from.\nThe present case is not one in which an appeal to the Supreme Court is excluded by virtue of section 48, because the judgment below, as above pointed out, exceeds the sum of $1,000, and in my opinion therefore this is undoubtedly a case in which the court has jurisdiction by virtue of section 38, sub-section (c) of the Act.\nThe case of Booth v. Ratt\u00e9[1] is a decision of this court, the nearest in character to the present application that I have been able to find. The action was in- stituted in the chancery division of the High Court of Justice, plaintiff claiming damages against several mill owners for obstructing the Ottawa River by throwing sawdust and refuse into it from their mills; and also a mandatory injunction restraining the defendants from continuing their unlawful acts. The judgment at the trial was in favour of the defendants; but on a re-hearing, judgment was given for the plaintiff, declaring that the defendants were guilty, and the plaintiff entitled to recover damages for the wrongful acts in the pleadings mentioned, with a reference to the Master to inquire and state the amount of damages. The original judgment declaring the plaintiff entitled to damages from the defendants was appealed through the Ontario courts, and finally confirmed by the Privy Council. The reference then went on before the Master. An appeal taken from his report was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, and a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed.\nIt is true that in this case no question of the jurisdiction of the court seems to have been raised, but the reason for this is obvious, in that the relief claimed for in the action was one which originally could only have been given in a court of equity, and therefore it was considered that the appeal would lie whether the judgment was final or not.\nIn addition to Booth v. Ratt\u00e9[2] there have been some other cases in the Supreme Court where the judgment or order complained of was from an officer of the court to whom a reference was made at the trial. These are Doull v. McIlreith[3]; McDougall v. Cameron[4]; Grant v. Maclaren[5] and Bell v. Wright[6]. The motion to affirm the jurisdiction is therefore granted. Costs in the cause.\nOwen Ritchie, for the appellant. This is not a case in equity. In such a case damages could only be awarded if an injunction issued or specific performance was decreed. See Ferguson v. Wilson[7]; Lewers v. Earl of Shaftesbury[8]; Patch v. Wyld[9].\nThe judgment appealed against is not a final judgment. Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[10]; McDonald v. Belcher[11].\nG.F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent. That the case is one in equity appears from Bozson v. Altrincham Urban District Council[12].\nAs to final judgment see Rural Municipality of Morris v. London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[13]; Baptist v. Baptist[14].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow the appeal from the registrar with costs; the motion to affirm jurisdiction is dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Section 38, sub-section (c), of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d is relied upon as giving jurisdiction to hear this appeal.\nAs the appeal proposed is from Ontario, it is upon the latter part of said sub-section alone that the question raised must turn.\nIt reads as follows:\nfrom any judgment in any action, suit, cause, matter or judicial proceeding, in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity, originally instituted in any superior court, etc.\nWe must avoid confusing the subject-matter of equitable jurisdiction with the proceedings in a purely common law action, by means of forms borrowed from courts of equity.\nIt is not the incident of any form or procedure which originally was a feature of a suit in equity, and which by reason of the progress or development of legal procedure has become a common mode of furnishing common law relief that is to determine what is here meant.\nWe must find the cause existent upon which a bill in equity might have been founded to invoke the equitable jurisdiction.\nNow have we that presented in this case as launched?\nIt seems, in this branch of it which has been followed, to be an action purely and simply for breach of contract, and we have a judgment upon that contract awarding damages for breach of it and a reference to assess same.\nIt is to be observed, and not for an instant overlooked, that there was nothing else thenceforward in these proceedings than that which happens daily in many such actions as are purely of common law origin.\nIt matters not that there were used in executing this judgment many of the forms of procedure borrowed from the practice of the courts of equity. That does not change the nature of the suit, action or proceeding. The process of adopting the chancery forms of procedure for common law actions, began with the tentative adoption by the \u201cCommon Law Procedure Act\u201d of mandatory orders, was enlarged by the \u201cAdministration of Justice Act\u201d and thereafter by the passage of the judicature Acts. When the process first began it did not enlarge the jurisdiction of the Courts of Chancery.\nWhat took place was the mere adoption and application of some of its methods of justice without driving the suitor to that court.\nIt was in the early stages of this development in Ontario that this court was created, and it was probably relative thereto and anticipatory of its outcome, as well as to the condition of things in other provinces, that the peculiar phraseology of this section was adopted.\nI have no manner of doubt that the words \u201csuit, action or proceeding\u201d were used relative to the enforcing of some right or giving of relief which could only have been at one time got in courts of equity.\nIt, therefore, seems to me clear the word \u201cproceeding\u201d was not intended any more than the word \u201caction\u201d to extend the jurisdiction given by this part of the sub-section, beyond giving appeals in those cases arising out of an equitable cause or ground of suit in equity.\nI do not overlook the fact that mixed up with this common law action there appears another cause in the statement of claim setting forth threatened fraud needing equitable relief by way of injunction.\nThis branch of the case, however, seems to have dropped out of sight and no longer to have been pursued. It is a case of common law cause of action and a cause for a suit in equity joined in the same statement of claim of which one seems to have been by mutual understanding dropped, and the other retained and followed by steps which are of an interlocutory character, and so remain until the final judgment is entered up, and unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, for the would-be appellant that entry must take place in a court from which no appeal lies here.\nI think the motion must be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The registrar has upheld the jurisdiction of the court to entertain this appeal upon the ground that the judgment appealed from is a judgment in a suit or proceeding in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity within section 38(c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d The words of the section are these:\n(c) In an action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding originally instituted in any superior court of equity in any province of Canada other than the Province of Quebec, and from any judgment in any action, suit, cause, matter of judicial proceeding, in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity, originally instituted in any superior court in any province of Canada other than the Province of Quebec.\nIt is, I think, indisputable that this enactment contemplates two distinct classes of equitable proceedings; that is to say, proceedings which fall within the category of suits or actions and proceedings which are not suits or actions, but which are comprehended within the phrase, \u201ccause, matter or proceeding.\u201d\nI do not think it was intended to give a right of appeal in respect of any judgment upon an application for an injunction or receiver, for example, in a purely common law action. The judgment, to be ap- pealable must be given either in an action or suit in the nature of an action or suit in equity or in a proceeding (not in an action) of the same nature. The right of appeal can consequently be sustained under this provision only if the action out of which the appeal arises was in the nature of a suit in equity. The test of that appears to me to be not the character of the pleadings as originally delivered still less the nature of the claim as indorsed on the writ of summons, but rather the character of the action as actually tried. It is a common experience that the pleadings being moulded to suit the evidence or rather assumed to be so moulded an action may at the trial undergo a complete transformation under the practice as established by the Judicature Acts. It is to the nature of the action as it is in substance finally tried that we must look to ascertain its character for the purpose of applying this section.\nThe action we are concerned with was treated by the learned trial judge as an action for damages for breach of a contract to deliver shares, and it is clear that although an injunction was claimed the circumstances at the commencement and at the close of the action were such that there was no equity upon which a claim for an injunction or other distinctively equitable relief could properly be founded. In such circumstances a court of equity would, of course, have had no jurisdiction to award damages.\nThere was, it is true, a declaration of the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the contract upon which the action was founded; but such a declaration where it would not have been within the power of the court to award consequential relief would never have been made by a court of equity any more than by a court of common law. In such circumstances relief of that character can now be given under the statutory authority conferred by the Judicature Acts, but it can be given in all classes of actions and does not fall within the category of equitable relief. Chapman v. Michaelson[15], at pp. 242 and 243. The action was, therefore, not an action in the nature of a suit in equity and the only question remaining is whether the judgment was a final judgment. That it was not is made perfectly clear by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Cummins v. Herron[16]. There (in an action by a riparian proprietor to restrain the pollution of a stream and for damages) at the hearing an inquiry as to damages was ordered and further consideration reserved. The chief clerk having certified to the amount of the damages a motion to vary the certificate was adjourned into court to be heard with the further consideration of the action. On further consideration the motion to vary was refused and judgment was given for the sum awarded by the chief clerk with an injunction. It was admitted that the substantial question in the action was disposed of by the chief clerk\u2019s certificate, but it was held that the judgment in so far as it dealt with the motion to vary was interlocutory.\nThere can be no doubt, Jessel M.R. observed during the argument, that such an order is interlocutory whatever its results may have been.\nIn giving judgment the Master of the Rolls said:\nThe appeal from the refusal to vary the certificate is now too late and must fail. As the whole merits of the case were decided by the chief clerk\u2019s certificate the appeal from the order on further consideration must also be dismissed. Mr. Henderson very properly called our attention to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Bozson v. Altrincham Urban District Council[17]. In that case the action was dismissed by the order appealed from; the decision has, I think, no relevancy to the question before us on this appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Registrar of this court affirming its jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, disposing of an appeal from the report of a referee to whom the assessment of damages was referred. The registrar was of the opinion that this action falls within the purview of section 38(c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d and that an appeal to this court therefore lies. Although as originally framed in the writ this was an equitable action, the statement of claim discloses merely a common law cause of action for damages for breach of contract, and the trial was proceeded with on this basis. Only common law and statutory relief is claimed. I have little doubt that in framing sections 36 and 38 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d Parliament did not contemplate that the equitable procedure of a reference to ascertain damages with a reservation of further directions might be resorted to in common law actions.\nIt is to be regretted that solely owing to the course taken at the trial of referring the question of damages and reserving further directions in this common law action a party claiming to be aggrieved should be deprived of a right of appeal to this court, against the assessment of damages, whether it is sought to attack merely the quantum of the allowance or what is probably of greater importance, the principle which formed the basis of the assessment. But as the statute stands we appear not to have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because the action is not an action in equity or in the nature of a suit in equity (section 38(c)), and the judgment a quo is not a final judgment (section 36).\nThe appeal from the registrar must be allowed with costs and the motion to affirm jurisdiction must be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Shilton, Wallbridge & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cassels, Brock, Kelly & Falconbridge.\n[1] 21 Can.

The Board of Trade then applied to Mr. Justice Anglin for leave to appeal from such decision of the Railway Board.\nCode K.C. supported the application.\nBiggar K.C. contra.\nAnglin J.\u2014Application for leave to appeal from a decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners, dismissing a complaint of the Board of Trade of Halifax against the Grand Trunk Railway Co., on the ground that the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners over the subject-matter of the complaint is ousted by section 3 of the \"Railway Act,\" which provides that\n* * * Where the provisions of this Act and of any special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada relate to the same subject-matter the provisions of the special Act shall, in so far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act be taken to override the provisions of this Act.\nIn granting leave to appeal under sub-section 2 of section 56 of the \"Railway Act\" a judge of this court should be satisfied not only that a question of the jurisdiction of the Railway Board is involved, but also that there is some reasonable doubt as to the soundness of the decision which it is sought to impugn. By an agreement entered into between Her late Majesty, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals, and the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, on the 1st of February, 1898, it is amongst other things provided that the rate over the Intercolonial from Montreal to Halifax shall be, on all classes and special classes of freight received by it from the Grand Trunk Railway, one cent per 100 pounds over the rates between Montreal and St. John over the Intercolonial Railway, or between Montreal and Portland over the Grand Trunk Railway. By the agreement the Grand Trunk Railway Company bound itself to route via the Intercolonial Railway all traffic received by it west of Montreal and billed for points reached by the Intercolonial Railway. This agreement was confirmed by statute of the Dominion of Canada, 62 & 63 Vict. ch. 5. By section 2 it is provided that\nIt shall be lawful for. Her Majesty and for the company to do whatever is necessary to the carrying out on Her part, and on its part, of all the provisions contained in the main agreement to the true intent and meaning thereof.\nIn order \"to give effect\" to this \"special\" legislation, which is enacted with special reference to the Grand Trunk Railway and its operation[1], it is necessary to treat it as overriding pro tanto the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" against discrimination in rates, assuming that upon the merits, but for the provisions of the agreement and the statute ratifying them, a case of unjust discrimination might be established. \"Railway Act,\" section 315, sub-section 4. I think this case is readily distinguishable from Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[2]. The subject-matter of the special legislation in this case is the rates of tolls between different localities \u2014 precisely the subject-matter dealt with by section 315, sub-section 4 of the \"Railway Act.\" If, but for the special legislation, the extra charge of one cent per 100 pounds for carriage to Halifax would amount to an unjust discrimination, it is obvious that the special legislation is inconsistent with the general provision of the \"Railway Act.\" Both may not stand together; both may not operate without either interfering with the other. Tabernacle Permanent Building Society v. Knight[3], at page 302. In order to give effect to the complainant's contention the Railway Board must either compel the Grand Trunk Railway Company to charge for freight destined for Halifax from any point on its line west of Montreal one cent less per 100 pounds for its transport to Montreal than it charges for carrying the same freight from the same point to Montreal if billed to St. John, or it must override the special Act of Parliament and compel the Intercolonial Railway to accept for freight received at Montreal from the Grand Trunk Railway billed to Halifax the same tolls as it charges for freight received from the Grand Trunk Railway billed to St. John. The Board certainly would not have jurisdiction to make the latter order against the Intercolonial Railway, which is excluded from the operation of the \"Railway Act\"[4]. To make the former order against the Grand Trunk Railway Company would not only be unfair to that railway company\u2014a consideration to which I should perhaps not now attach weight\u2014but would involve a breach of the provisions of section 315 of the \"Railway Act\" as to equality of tolls.\nI entertain no doubt whatever that the decision of the Railway Board, that it was without jurisdiction to entertain the complaint of the Halifax Board of Trade was correct. I am, therefore, of opinion that their application for leave to appeal should be refused with costs.\nLeave refused with costs.\n[1] \"Railway Act,\" sec. 2(28).\n[2] 42 Can.

Hamelin v. Bannerman (31 Can. S.C.R. 534) followed.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014An action, brought in 1908, for recovery of damages in respect of injuries occasioned by improvements executed in 1904, upon works constructed many years before that time, is not subject to the prescription of thirty years; nor can the prescription provided by article 2261 of the Civil Code be applied where the action has been commenced within two years from the time the injuries complained of were sustained. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Saint Francis, by which the plaintiff's action was, in part, maintained with costs.\nThe appellant (defendant) was the owner of mills and factories, at Waterville, Que., in connection with which he also owned a dam, which had been erected in the Coaticook River about the year 1856, and, in 1904, he made improvements to the dam and placed flash-boards upon it which slightly increased its height and had the effect of penning back the waters of the stream so as to flood the lands of the plaintiff and cause the destruction of his bridge and the drowning of some of his cattle during the Spring and Summer of the year 1907. In the year 1908, instead of availing himself of the method provided by article 5536, R.S.Q., 1888, for ascertaining the amount of damage and abating the nuisance, the plaintiff brought an action in the Superior Court for the District of \"Saint Francis to recover compensation for the injuries he had thus sustained, in consequence of the raising of the dam, which was maintained, in part, by the trial judge who refused, however, to make an assessment of the damages resulting from the works once for all, en bloc, allowed only compensation for the injuries sustained up to the time of the action and reserved to the plaintiff any recourse which he might have for future damages arising from the same cause. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench which also held, on the appeal by the defendant, that he had acquired no prescriptive rights in respect of the dam by user for a period of over thirty years. The defence had not set up the provisions of the statutes respecting the improvement of watercourses, but, on his appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the defendant took the objection that the right of action for damages sustained as the result of the works in question had been taken away by the effect of articles 5535 and 5536, R.S.Q., 1888.\nThe questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and C. D. White for the appellant.\nPanneton K.C. and LeBlanc for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014From time immemorial, under the French civil law, the proprietor whose land borders on or is crossed by a running stream had the right subject to certain restrictions, to use the waters of that stream for certain limited purposes. By statute 19 & 20 Vict. ch. 104, consolidated, in 1861, as chapter 51, C.S.L.C, and, in 1888, as article 5535, R.S.Q., and, in 1909, as article 7295, R.S.Q., those proprietors were authorized to improve such watercourses for industrial purposes subject to the payment of such damages as might result from these improvements to other persons, to be ascertained by experts. That the plaintiff (respondent) suffered damage by reason of the construction of the defendant's (appellant's) dam must, I presume, be admitted here in view of the concurring judgments below. Nor is it open to us, for the same reason, to reconsider the amount of such damages, if they were properly assessed. The only question we are now called upon to decide is with respect to the mode of assessing those damages. They were not assessed by experts as provided by the statute, and the question is: Should we hold that, if the regulations or formalities fixed by the statute for the purpose of ascertaining the damages resulting from the exercise of the right to make improvements are not observed, the party injured is without a remedy in the courts on the assumption that such was the intention of the legislature? This question arose for the first time in the Quebec courts, as far as I have been able to ascertain, in 1869, in the case of Nesbitt v. Bolduc[1], 1 Loranger, Civil Code, p. 140, No. 25, and it was then held that the recourse given by the statute is not exclusive, and the remedy by direct action in a competent court is not taken away. That case was followed in Emond v. Gauthier[2]; in Breakey v. Carter[3]; in Cie. de Pulp de M\u00e9gantic v. Village d'Agn\u00e8s[4]; and in Leclerc v. Dufault[5]. It would seem rather a hazardous undertaking to interfere with such a well settled jurisprudence, especially as there is no provision in the Quebec Municipal Code for the appointment of experts by the warden of the county, as the statute requires, if the parties should fail to agree. It may be also that the damage to be recovered arises with respect to property situate within the limits of a town or city municipality where there would be no warden, the municipal organization of Quebec differing in this respect from that which, I understand, exists in other provinces. The warden in the Province of Quebec is the head of the county council which is composed of the mayors in office of the local municipalities subject to the provisions of the Municipal Code (arts. 246, 247 M.C.) ; and that code does not apply to cities and towns; (art. 1). To reverse, therefore, on the ground that the damages were not ascertained by experts, as the statute provides, might mean that the injured party would be without any recourse. The effect of the reservation in the judgment of the right to the plaintiff to claim damages which may arise in the future is well understood by those familiar with Quebec procedure, but does not call for consideration on this appeal. I may, however, say that the course followed by the trial judge in limiting the damages to those found to have been actually sustained has the sanction of the highest authority. Sourdat, Nos. 110 and 132 bis.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J. agreed with Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014The Parliament of old Canada enacted what still remains part of the statute law of Quebec, as follows:\n5535. Every proprietor of land may improve any watercourse bordering upon, running along or passing across his property, and may turn the same to account by the construction of mills, manufactories, works and machinery of all descriptions, and, for this purpose, may erect and construct in and about such watercourse all the works necessary for its efficient working, such as flood-gates, canals, embankments, dams, dykes and the like.\nFollowing this clause are a number of provisions for determining by means of arbitration the amount of compensation due those damnified by exercise of said power.\nDisregarding the arbitration proceedings provided by the Act, the respondent brought an action complaining of appellants having, in A.D. 1903, raised this dam constructed, it is assumed, but not proven, in an exercise of this statutory power nearly half a century previously.\nThe appellant takes the ground now, for the first time, that the dam was constructed in the lawful exercise of said statutory power, and all he has done being, therefore, legal, no action can be founded upon acts done within the exercise of such power, and he alleges if any remedy exists it must be found in the arbitration proceedings provided in such case by the said Act.\nThe appellant will not admit, though the learned trial judge has found as a fact, that this dam was raised, as respondent's pleadings allege, still higher than when constructed.\nAssuming, however, the fact of such increased. height in the dam, the first question we would have to ask, if we had to solve all the questions raised, would be whether or not this statutory power, which does not embody any express right to exercise it from time to time, can be repeatedly exercised and added to.\nHowever that may be I am quite sure that any person thus relying upon a statute must plead it and bring himself within its protection. I cannot find anything of that sort in the appellant's pleadings to give him even a colour of right to set up now for the first time this new defence.\nThe respondent has relied upon the case of Hamelin v. Bannerman[6], as an answer to this new defence. I think the point is well taken.\nI do not think the reply of appellant's counsel trying to distinguish that case from this by reason of that turning upon an arbitration provided for in a deed and this being upon a statute, meets the point taken.\nAn arbitration, as a condition precedent, if properly framed may be as effectual an answer to an action as can well be, and yet, when so, it must be pleaded or claimed as defence before the case reaches here.\nThe principle upon which that case went was the need for this. The principle applies here just as well and is so well known it does not need authority.\nThe profuse denials in appellant's pleas might have been, as sometimes happens, forgotten, as the real issues to be tried and new ones started at the trial, threshed out there and afterwards, so that the case tried differed so much from that upon which issue was joined, as to enable us to give effect to a point tried in fact though not pleaded.\nThe pleading could be amended to conform to the actual issues really decided.\nThat is not this case. The pleading in defence is all denial or relates to original construction and in no way pretends to claim a right to increase the height. Indeed, the pleas bearing upon the right of original construction need much charity to extend them to cover rights acquired under this statutory power. And, for aught that appears, the dam may have been built before the statute.\nThe respondent has only had damages assessed up to the trial, and I hardly see how he could recover more from a defendant who seems to have inadvertently done what is complained of. The fact is the case has been ended in the only way it should, on the findings of fact and as pleaded, be ended.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The authority conferred by article 7295, R.S.Q., 1909, appears to be sufficient to justify the alterations in the appellant's dam which took place in 1904. I think it is too narrow an interpretation of that enactment to hold that such alterations are not permitted when occasion for them arises. The language itself is sufficient to create such authority and the obvious purpose of the legislation \u2014 to enable the proprietors of land to utilize waterways passing through or by it, in the operation of mills and machinery \u2014 seems to require that the words should be read without any such restriction upon their ordinary meaning.\nThe determination of the other points is ruled by the authority of Breakey v. Carter[7]. The effect of that decision (by which this court is bound) is that the right given by article 7295, in so far as it justifies the penning back the waters of a stream upon the upper riparian proprietors, is to be regarded as a right of servitude to which is attached an obligation to indemnify the proprietor who is prejudiced by the exercise of it. In that view there appears to be no reason why the exercise of this statutory right should not, from time to time, as damage thereby accrues, give rise to a right to claim the correlative indemnity.\nThe decision mentioned also meets the objection that the respondent's right to compensation is limited to that ascertained in the manner pointed out by the statute.\nThere may be difficulties in reconciling the decision on this point with the generally recognized rule, that where a right of compensation is given by a statute and by the same enactment extra-judicial machinery is provided for ascertaining the amount, the matter of compensation is not cognizable by the courts until, at all events, the amount has been fixed in accordance with the statutory method. This, however, is only a rule of construction which must, like all such rules, yield where a contrary intention appears; and it is possible that the difficulties of putting into operation the machinery provided by this statute are sufficient to support the inference that the legislature did not intend, in this case, to exclude recourse to the courts.\nAt all events, whatever view one might have been disposed to take, had the question now presented itself for the first time, the decision of this court, sanctioned moreover by the subsequent re-enactment of the statute in identical terms, is conclusive of the point on this appeal.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff, Bureau (respondent) sues to recover for the flooding of his farm, caused, he alleges, by a dam owned by the defendant and in part due to the raising, in the year 1904, of the height of this dam. His original claim was for $3,053.50\u2014 $800 in connection with a bridge, $200 for cattle destroyed, $2,000 for damages to the land once for all, and $53.50 for a surveyor's expenses in making measurements and preparing a plan shewing the flooded lands for use on the trial.\nThe Superior Court rejected the first two items as insufficiently proved, and allowed the plaintiff $100 damages for injury to his land due to the raising of the dam up to the date of the commencement of the action, and $53.50 for the expenses of the surveyor, and the cost of the plan prepared by him \u2014 refusing to assess damages once for all because the works which actually caused the damage allowed for are not permanent in character and the damages themselves are variable, but reserving to the plaintiff a right of re- course for future damages. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Review seeking to have the amount awarded to him increased and claiming assessment of damages once for all. His appeal was dismissed[8] and he has not further pursued it.\nFrom the judgment thus affirmed the defendant appealed to the Court of King's Bench on the ground that there had been no increase in the height of the dam in 1904, that he had acquired a prescriptive right to flood the plaintiff's lands by thirty years' user of the dam and that the compensation or damages, if the plaintiff is entitled to recover, should have been estimated once for all as demanded in his declaration. His appeal was dismissed, the majority of the court holding that damage by additional flooding owing to increased height of the dam was sufficiently established by the evidence; that the prescription of thirty years relied upon had no application to the claim for such damages; and that it was competent for the court, while declining to assess compensation or damages once for all as claimed by the plaintiff, to award damages in respect of injury suffered prior to the bringing of the action.\nOn his appeal to this court the defendant takes the following grounds in his factum:\nFirst.\u2014The statute provides a special way of assessing the damages, and the respondent must proceed in that way, and not by an action before the courts.\nSecondly.\u2014Even if the right of action is not taken away by the statute, it is extinguished by the prescription of 30 years.\nThirdly.\u2014The compensation or damages should have been estimated \"once for all\" as contemplated by the statute, and as prayed for by respondent in his declaration. The trial judge found that the height of the dam was slightly raised in 1904 \u2014 so much the defendant's expert almost admits\u2014and, upon conflicting evidence, he also found that the effect of this increase in height was that the lands of the defendant were flooded more extensively and for longer periods after the year 1904 than they had been theretofore. These findings of fact have been affirmed by the Court of King's Bench. Though impugned at bar, they are well supported by the evidence and should not, in my opinion, be disturbed by this court.\nThat the provisions of articles 5535 and 5536, R.S.Q. (1888), preclude any right of action for such damages as the plaintiff sustained by reason of the increase made in the height of the dam appears not to have been urged by the defendant in the provincial courts. This objection has been raised upon this appeal \u2014 probably because of a suggestion in the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Trenholme. Apart from that formidable difficulty (Hamelin v. Bannerman[9]), and whatever view might be taken upon this question were it res integra, for me it is concluded against the appellant by the decision in Breakey v. Carter[10] which, notwithstanding the observations of Taschereau J. in Jones v. Fisher[11], at page 525, for reasons fully stated in Stuart v. Bank of Montreal[12], at pages 541 et seq., I regard as not open to review in this court.\nIt is obvious that the prescription of thirty years relied upon by the appellant has no application to the plaintiff's claim in respect of injuries sustained as a result of the raising of the dam in 1904. I fully appredate Mr. Justice Lafontaine's difficulty[13] in concurring with the learned trial judge in holding article 1608 C.C., applicable, by analogy, to the plaintiff's claim. The judgment in review points out the clear distinction which exists between the facts of the present case and those upon which the claim in Breakey v. Carter[14] was held by this court to fall under article 1608 C.C. The judgment in Breakey v. Carter14 appears to be also opposed to the applicability to the present case of article 2261 of the Civil Code. But if articles 2261 and 2267 C.C., apply, and if, although these articles have not been pleaded, under article 2188 C.C., the court should of its own motion supply the defence and hold that the plaintiff's right of recovery is limited to damages sustained within two years before the date of his writ\u20143rd February, 1909, \u2014 (Breakey v. Carter14) \u2014 they do not help the defendant. The learned trial judge has in effect found that the plaintiff sustained his only real injury in 1907\u2014of course in the Spring and Summer of that year \u2014 and the allowance of $100 was no doubt in respect of that injury which occurred within two years before action. Article 2261 C.C., if pleaded would, therefore, not be an answer to that part of the plaintiff's claim in respect of which he recovered judgment.\nThe appellant contends that if the plaintiff has a right of action it can only be for an indemnity once for all, and that having brought his action in this form he should not be allowed to recover in respect of past damages only, with reservation of rights in regard to future damages. I incline to agree with the view of Mr. Justice Archambault that the court had the right to grant damages for the past and to refuse, at present, to allow or to assess them for the future. But I think we are not now concerned with that question. The plaintiff's claim was for damages once for all. He has been allowed only $153.53. He appealed unsuccessfully to have this amount increased. He is not pursuing this claim further in the present action. The dam may be lowered and the plaintiff may sustain no further actionable damages. He may never bring another action. If he does and if it be found that he has sustained further loss, as a result of the defendant's work of the year 1904, it may then be necessary to determine whether he is entitled to a second assessment of damages and to consider the value and the efficacy of the reservation of his right of recourse in respect of future damages made by the trial judge. But, at present, the plaintiff has a judgment for damages to which upon the evidence he appears to have been entitled, whether his claim should be regarded as confined to past damages or as necessarily including full indemnity for the past and future exercise of a servitude in respect of his lands by the defendant. With any future right of action which he may have we are not presently concerned.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cate, Wells, White & McFadden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Panneton & Leblanc.\n[1] 15 R.L. 513 note.\n[2] 3 Q.L.R. 360.\n[3] 7 Q.L.R. 286.\n[4] Q.R. 7 Q.B. 339.\n[5] Q.R. 16 K.B. 138.\n[6] 31 Can.

Judgment appealed from (3 Sask. L.R. 280) affirmed.\nAPPEAL per saltum from the judgment of Newlands J., in the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe appellants recovered judgment against one Fredericks, who was the owner of homestead lands, exempted from seizure under execution by the North-West Territories \"Exemptions Ordinance\" (Con. Ord., 1898, ch. 27, sec. 2, sub-sec. 9), and caused a writ of execution against the lands of their judgment debtor to be registered in the Land Titles Office under the provisions of the \"Land Titles Act\" of Saskatchewan, 6 Edw. VII. ch. 24, sec. 129, as amended by 8 Edw. VII. ch. 29, sec. 10. Subsequently, Fredericks transferred his homestead lands to his wife, the respondent, and, upon issuing the certificate of title to her, the registrar indorsed thereon a memorandum that the title to the lands was subject to a charge or incumbrance in consequence of such registered execution. The respondent, thereupon, brought the action for a declaration that the execution did not constitute any charge or incumbrance upon the lands in question and for an order that the indorsement so made by the registrar should be removed from her certificate of title. At the trial, Mr. Justice Newlands maintained the plaintiff's action, and held that the writ of execution did not charge lands exempted from seizure, that the transferee acquired the lands free from any charge thereon in consequence of the registration of the writ of execution, and directed the registrar to remove the memorandum of incumbrance from her certificate of title. The defendants obtained leave, by order of the registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada, sitting as judge in chambers, to appeal direct from the judgment of the trial judge.\nMackenzie K.C. for the appellants.\nGeorge F. Macdonell, for the respondent, was not called upon for any argument. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nIdington J.\u2014The exemption, by law, of the lands here in question freed them, and was intended to free them, from the operation of any writ of execution against the lands of the appellants' debtor. The debtor was, therefore, entitled to dispose of them as he saw fit. Hence the respondent was entitled to receive a conveyance thereof from the debtor as free from the operation of such writs of execution as he was to hold them. It follows that she became entitled to have the certificate of title cleared from any such apparent charge.\nWe are, therefore, under no necessity of passing upon the other questions raised by the appellants' counsel.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Mackenzie, Brown & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Black & Hilliar.\n[1] 3 Sask.

VII. c. 9, s. 14 (Alta.). The provisions of section 57 of \"The Liquor License Ordinance\" (Con. Ord., 1898, ch. 89), confer upon a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta power to direct the cancellation of liquor licenses which have been obtained in violation of sub-section 3, of section 37, of that ordinance as amended by section 14 of \"The Liquor License Amendment Act, 1907,\" 7 Edw. VII. ch. 9, of the Province of Alberta.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside an order by Harvey J., by which a license issued to the respondents for the sale of malt and spirituous liquors was directed to be cancelled.\nSpecial leave for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted on application[1]; the questions raised on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nC. A. Grant for the appellant.\nH. H. Parlee for the respondents. GIROUABD J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by my brother Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The sole question involved in this appeal is whether or not, under section 57 of the \"Liquor License Ordinance\" for Alberta, the judge of the Supreme Court of the province had jurisdiction to hear a complaint that the license had been obtained in violation of section 37 of the ordinance.\nThe contention on the part of the licensee, sustained by a majority of the court of appeal, was that the \"violation of any of the provisions respecting licenses\" referred to in section 57, should be read and construed as referable only to those sections of the ordinance which fall under the sub-title \"licenses,\" and that the whole of section 37, under the third subsection of which the trial judge proceeded, related to procedure only.\nI am unable to take the view of the statute which prevailed with the majority of the court of appeal, and concur in that taken by Stuart J. and by the judge who heard the complaint, now Chief Justice Harvey.\nSection 57 gives jurisdiction to the Supreme Court over complaints that a\nlicense or transfer has been obtained by fraud or in violation of any of the provisions respecting licenses.\nIt would seem, therefore, that the jurisdiction given to the court is limited to violations of any of the provisions of the ordinance with respect to obtaining licenses, and does not apply to violations subsequent to the granting of the licenses.\nSection 37 provides that a license shall not be granted to any person who has not obtained a recommendation in writing from at least twenty of the forty householders nearest in a direct line to the proposed licensed premises, and also provides for the time when it must be signed, and for verification of the signatures.\nSub-section 3 reads as follows:\n(3) No application for a new license shall be entertained in respect of any hotel or wholesale premises not situated in a city or town; or in respect of any hotel license in a village containing less than forty dwelling houses or in any place containing less than forty dwelling houses within an area not greater than 960 acres.\nThis section 37 is found in that part of the Act containing a sub-title \"Applications for Licenses,\" and it is contended, and has been held, that section 57 giving jurisdiction over complaints that the license attacked had been obtained \"in violation of any of the provisions respecting licenses,\" does not extend to this section 37, but must be confined to the sections 12 to 23 under the sub-title \"Licenses.\" It is, in my judgment, a narrow and improper construction so to limit what appears to me to be the fair and obvious meaning of section 57. That section, in my judgment, relates to fraud and violation of the provisions of the act antecedent to the granting of the license. It covers all cases where it is shewn that a license has been obtained either by fraud or in violation of any of the provisions of the ordinance, including section 37.\nThe latter section comes as well within the words \"any of the provisions respecting licenses\" as do the sections 12 to 23.\nOur attention was also called to section 48, giving the Board of License Commissioners power at any time to cancel licenses in certain specified cases. I do not see any necessary conflict between the powers of the Board under this section and that of the court under section 57. The jurisdiction of the latter is limited to the cancelling of licenses obtained either by fraud or in violation of pre-requisite provisions, compliance with which was necessary to obtain the license.\nThat of the Board seems confined to the violation, after the granting of the license, of conditions which the ordinance makes the continuous existence of, or continuous compliance with, necessary.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the court appealed from, and affirm the jurisdiction of Harvey J. to make the order in question.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It seems to me that the plain terms of section 57 of the \"Liquor License Act\" conferred upon the learned judge who acted, power to cancel as he did the license in question, issued in violation of the provisions of the Act respecting licenses.\nI am unable to follow the reasoning given for interfering with his exercise of this power.\nEven if the court below had, as I much doubt, any power to interfere with his decision, it seems to me upon the facts that the decision is not well founded.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The \"Liquor License Ordinance\" of the North-West Territories (still in force in the Province of Alberta) enacts by section 37:\nA license shall not be granted to any person to sell intoxicating liquors outside of incorporated cities or towns who has not first obtained the recommendation in writing in form B.\n(2) Such recommendation must be signed within the period of sixty days immediately prior to the day it is so received by the territorial treasurer and the justice, notary or commissioner before whom the same is signed shall certify the date upon which each person, signs such recommendation.\n(3) No application for a new license shall be entertained in respect of any hotel or wholesale premises not situated in a city or town; or in respect of any hotel license in a village containing less than forty dwelling houses or in any place containing less than forty dwelling houses within an area of not greater than 960 acres.\nAnd by section 57:\nIf within sixty days from the granting of a license or a transfer of a license any person deposits with the clerk of the Supreme Court for the judicial district wherein the licensed premises are situated $10 as security for costs, together with a complaint (verified by affidavit) that the said license or transfer has been obtained by fraud or in violation of any of the provisions respecting licenses, on application the judge may by means of an originating summons investigate and summarily hear and dispose of the complaint and may direct the cancellation of the license or dismiss the complaint and award costs in the same way as costs are awarded in proceedings in the Supreme Court.\nUpon an application to Mr. Justice Harvey under the last mentioned provision for the cancellation of a license alleged to have been obtained by the respondents \"in violation\" of section 37, sub-section 3, the learned judge directed the cancellation of the license. On appeal it was held by the full court that the authority conferred by section 57 would not support the annulment of a license for non-compliance with the requirements of section 37(3). This view is based upon two grounds. First \u2014 that the provisions of the last mentioned section are directory merely; and secondly, \u2014 that the phrase \"provisions respecting licenses\" denotes those provisions only (sections 12-23(a)) to be found under the title \"Licenses.\"\nAs to the second of these grounds the phrase \"provisions respecting licenses\" in its prima facie meaning certainly includes all such provisions and the context indicates an intentional reference to all provisions which it is ordained that an applicant shall observe as a prerequisite to procuring the grant of a license. There is nothing, moreover, in the character of the provisions found under the title mentioned as compared with those to be found, for example, under the title \"applications for licenses\" which suggests a reason for supposing that the jurisdiction given by section 57 was intended to be limited to cases of non-observance of the first mentioned provisions, and I think there is no satisfactory ground for so limiting it.\nAs to the first of the grounds upon which the court below proceeded the language appears to me to be very clear. \"No application * * * shall be entertained\" unless a certain state of facts exists \u2014 appears to be a sufficiently plain way of expressing the intention that the existence of that state of facts is to be an essential condition of the right of the applicant to have his application considered. It is not very relevant to say that the legislature has in other cases enacted that the grant of a license contrary to a particular provision shall be void. It may be that in the absence of some such provision as section 57 persons attempting to impeach the grant of a license on the ground that the conditions laid down in section 37(3) were non-existent would encounter obstacles almost if not quite insurmountable; it was probably (in part, at least,) to avoid such difficulties that section 57 was enacted.\nCounsel for the respondents relies upon section 48, suggesting that such cases as this would fall within the cognizance of the commissioners under that section. It is sufficient to say that the authority of the commissioners to act under section 48 is, by the express terms of the section, exercisable with reference to the state of affairs existing at the time of its exercise; the section confers no authority to cancel a license by reason of the fact alone that a \"violation\" of the Act has been committed in obtaining it.\nANGLIN J. agreed with Duff J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 43 Can.

Anglin J.\u2014A motion to extend the time for setting down an appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, leave to appeal having been granted by the Board on the ground that the application before it involved questions of law. The questions of law in respect of which the Board has given leave are not stated or otherwise defined in its order granting leave. The statute clearly contemplates that the Board shall, before granting leave to appeal, determine that any question upon which an appeal to this court is allowed is a question of law. This involves the idea that the leave of the Board shall be given in respect of one or more specific questions, which should be stated, or otherwise sufficiently defined, in the order granting the leave. It is not for the parties, under a general order for leave to appeal, to raise such questions as they may wish to prefer, as questions of law; neither is it for this court to decide whether any question raised upon an appeal is or is not a question of law. The statute confers this power and imposes this duty upon the Board whose decision upon it is not open to review. Because the order of the Board granting leave to appeal did not specify or define, by reference or otherwise, the question or questions of law in respect of which leave to appeal was given, this court, in June last, refused to entertain an appeal in the \"Gatineau Valley Railway Case\"* Following that judgment, the present motion\n*The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v.

If, however, on application the Board sees fit to make an order giving leave to appeal in respect of specific questions which in its opinion are questions of law, this motion may be renewed.\nApplication refused.\n"

J. A. Ritchie for the appellant.\nMcKay K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I did not intend to add anything to what I said when judgment was rendered on this appeal; but in deference to the learned opinions of my dissenting brothers I will endeavour to state the reasons for the conclusions I reached.\nThe appellant, a soldier in garrison at Victoria, B.C., was tried, at the last Autumn assizes, on the charge of murdering his captain, one Peter Elliston; and, having been found guilty, was sentenced to be hanged. Subsequently, on the application of counsel, the learned Chief Justice, who presided at the trial, reserved a case for the opinion of the provincial Court of Appeal. The point reserved is stated in these words:\nAt the said trial the accused gave evidence on his own behalf, and during his cross-examination by Mr. Aikman, the counsel for the Grown, the following occurred as appears by the transcript of the evidence hereto made by the official stenographer present at the said trial, at page 100 thereof:\u2014\nMr. Aikman: Q. You remember Corrigan giving his evidence in the Police Court, don't you?\nA. Yes, sir. Well I remember some of it, sir. Most of it was given in. a very low tone of voice, sir.\nQ. Do you remember him saying this, in answer to a question of, what did Allen say, the answer was, \"He threatened Captain Elliston, he said old Peter should be in charge of a ranch instead of a body of men.\"\nA. Well, now, sir, that is an expression that I would not be guilty of using.\nQ. That is not the question; I ask you if you remember him saying that?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. You don't remember him saying that?\nA. Oh, I remember him saying that, sir, in his evidence that morning.\nQ. Then he was asked this question: \"Did he say he was done an injustice; give his words? (A.) He said he was treated harshly by Captain Elliston; he said he had a bullet for Captain Elliston; and every bullet had its billet, and he had one that would find its mark.\" Do you remember him saying that?\nA. No, sir, I don't remember him saying that; but I can say from that, that is all nonsensical. No man of common sense * * *\nQ. We will see that later.\nMr. Davie: I object to that evidence being introduced here. The evidence of that man was taken at the preliminary inquiry, and it has not been shewn that he is absent from the country. It is only an indirect way of getting that evidence in.\nThe Court: Unless you can produce Corrigan to be cross-examined himself, why should you use this evidence here?\nMr. Aikman: I am just testing this witness's veracity and trying to test his memory.\nMr. Davie: I submit he has no right to mention those statements.\nThe Court: No, I do not see what the point is. You must test him by standard methods.\nNo further allusion was made to this matter by either the counsel or myself.\nThe Court of Appeal decided, Mr. Justice Irving dissenting, that the evidence objected to, although improperly admitted, in the opinion of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Galliher, did the accused no substantial wrong, there being abundant legal evidence of guilt. From that decision this appeal is taken.\nAll the judges below find that there was ample evidence that the prisoner killed Captain Elliston and in that opinion we concur. The question to be determined, however, is with respect to the admissibility of the testimony quoted in the reserved case and its effect upon the verdict.\nIt cannot be doubted that depositions taken at the preliminary inquiry before a magistrate are not admissible in evidence at the subsequent trial of the accused on the same charge, except in certain events; and when, on the happening of those events, such depositions are admitted they must be produced in their entirety to the court so that the accused and the Crown may have the benefit of all they contain. It is also, I submit, undoubted law that, while, in the circumstances of this case, a prisoner might be asked on cross-examination if he had made previous threats against the life of his victim, the jury cannot, under pretence of cross-examination for any purpose, be informed either directly or indirectly by the Crown prosecutor that a witness examined at the preliminary inquiry into the charge upon which the prisoner is tried swore at that investigation that the prisoner had made such threats, unless that witness is produced or his deposition given at the preliminary investigation is properly admissible as evidence. The learned Chief Justice of the provincial Court of Appeal, with whom Galliher J. concurred, describes what happened at the trial on the cross-examination of the prisoner, in these words:\nIt appears that one Corrigan was a witness and gave evidence at the preliminary investigation before the police magistrate. Corrigan was not called at the trial, nor did the Crown comply with the conditions precedent to its right to use Corrigan's evidence. Nevertheless, counsel for the Crown asked the accused man, who went into the witness box on his own behalf, whether Corrigan had not, in his evidence in the Police Court, made a statement that he (Allen) had made threats against Captain Elliston of a very serious nature. It was sought in this way to get before the jury damaging statements made by Corrigan in the Police Court. This evidence ought not to -have been permitted to reach the jury. The course pursued is not in accord with the best practice of officers of the Crown charged with the administration of justice. The argument advanced before us that counsel was entitled in this way to test the credibility of Allen, cannot, in my opinion, be accepted.\nWith all this I agree. The only question as to which a doubt existed in my mind at the argument, was whether the improper admission of this evidence was an irregularity so trivial that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned, there being other sufficient evidence of guilt. The majority in the court below thought that the irregularity was trivial, that no harm was done the prisoner and that by reason of the provisions of section 1019 of the Canada Criminal Code the appeal should be dismissed. That section is in these words:\n1019. No conviction shall be set aside or any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the court of appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial.\nMy difficulty is to say to what extent the jury, or any one of them, may have been influenced by the questions put to the prisoner on cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor. There are many reported cases in which convictions have been quashed on the ground that illegal evidence was admitted\u2014often reluctantly, in view of the clear guilt of the accused. The law on this express point was laid down quite recently in England by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Fisher[2]. Speaking for the court, Channel J. said:\nIn the circumstances of this case we cannot come to any other conclusion but that the jury may have been influenced by the evidence of the other cases, and, therefore, although there was sufficient evidence to convict the prisoner without the evidence as to the other cases, in accordance with the rule laid down in this court, the conviction cannot stand.\nThis case was subsequently formally approved in Rex v. Ellis[3], at page 760.\nThe English Act[4] is in these words:\nThe Court of Criminal Appeal on any such appeal against conviction shall allow the appeal if they think that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court before whom the appellant was convicted should be set aside . on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal;\nProvided that the court may, notwithstanding that they are of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\nThere are, obviously, verbal distinctions which can be made between the English Act and the section of our code. The English statute enacts that the appeal shall be allowed in a certain number of enumerated cases\u2014including that of a verdict which cannot be supported having regard to the evidence \u2014 and that in any others the appeal shall be dismissed. As appears by the citation from Rex v. Fisher[5], that statute has been construed by the Court of Criminal Appeals to mean that the conviction must be set aside where improper evidence has been admitted \u2014 even if having regard to the whole evidence there is sufficient to support the verdict. This is now the settled rule notwithstanding the proviso to the English Act that the appeal may be dismissed even if the point raised might be decided in favour of the appellant if the court considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. Our section 1019 is practically to the same effect. It provides that no conviction shall be set aside if it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was thereby occasioned. The underlying principle of both is that, while the court has a discretion to exercise in cases where improper evidence has been admitted, that discretion must be exercised in such a way as to do the prisoner no substantial wrong or to occasion no miscarriage of justice; and what greater wrong can be done a prisoner than to deprive him of the benefit of a trial by a jury of his peers on a question of fact so directly relevant to the issue as the one in question here \u2014 the existence of previous threats\u2014and to substitute therefor the decision of judges who have not heard the evidence and who have never seen the prisoner? It may well be that in our opinion sitting here in an atmosphere very different from that in which the case was tried the evidence was quite sufficient, taken in its entirety, to support the verdict, but can we say that the admittedly improper questions put by the Crown prosecutor and the answers which the prisoner apparently very reluctantly gave did not influence the jury in the conclusion they reached? We must not overlook the fact that it is the free unbiassed verdict of the jury that the accused was entitled to have.\nDespite all the changes made in recent years in the procedure in criminal and quasi-criminal cases, the classic saying of Lord Hardwicke still holds that\nit is the greatest consequence to the law of England and to the subject that these powers of the judge and jury are kept distinct, that the judge determines the law, and the jury the fact; and if ever they come to be confounded it will prove the confusion and destruction of the law of England.\nIn this case the Crown prosecutor first asked the prisoner if he remembered that Corrigan gave his evidence in the Police Court; and, when this was admitted, then he proceeded to ask him if he remembered that he (Corrigan) then swore that the prisoner had threatened Captain Elliston, saying:\nOld Peter should be in charge of a ranch instead of a body of men. This question being also answered in the affirmative, the prisoner was asked if he remembered that at the preliminary investigation Corrigan swore that he (the prisoner), speaking of the murdered man had used these words:\nHe (the prisoner) said he was treated harshly by Captain Elliston; he said he had a bullet for Captain Elliston; and every bullet had its billet, and he had one that would find its mark.\nThis question was not answered, counsel for the prisoner having intervened to object. In putting this question, the Crown prosecutor appears to have read from the deposition given by Corrigan before the police magistrate.\nWhat must have been the impression necessarily conveyed to the jury by those proceedings? The prisoner was pressed to admit: First, that Corrigan was examined as a witness at the preliminary investigation before the police magistrate; secondly. The Crown prosecutor stated that being so examined he, Corrigan, testified that the prisoner had made against the life of the deceased the threat quoted above. The result was that a material portion of a deposition taken before the police magistrate was given to the jury without the conditions of the Act being complied with; and that the jurors were told by the Crown prosecutor in effect that a witness not produced and whose absence was not accounted for had at the preliminary inquiry sworn to threats made by the accused against the life of his victim. In my judgment, the proceeding, objectionable as it is in this regard, is made more objectionable by the fact that only extracts from the evidence was produced and that it does not appear whether or not Corrigan was cross-examined as to the alleged threats, so that it is impossible for us to say whether all that occurred between the prisoner and Corrigan, on the occasion when the threats are said to have been made, was before the jury. On the plea of not guilty the defence was that the murder was committed under an insane impulse which was irresistible. Whether it is an inference from the McNaghten rules that irresistible impulse is a sufficient defence, I am not called upon to say, but certainly evidence of previous threats made by the prisoner against the deceased would be a most effective answer-to a plea of not guilty to a charge of murder; and I say, with all deference for the opinion expressed by my colleagues for whose long experience and wide knowledge I have the greatest respect, that to permit such threats to be proved in the way attempted here would be to adopt \"a new and arbitrary method of trial,\" and to dismiss the appeal we must ignore the well-settled rule that in a criminal case the verdict is to be founded exclusively upon such evidence as the law allows.\nIt was argued that the section of our Code, upon which the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal relied, specially provides that the appeal shall be dismissed even where illegal evidence has been admitted, if there is otherwise sufficient legal evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitce. To say that we are in this case charged with the duty of deciding the extent to which the improperly admitted evidence may have influenced some of the jurors would be to hold, as I have already said, that Parliament authorized us to deprive the accused in a capital case of the benefit of a trial by jury. The law on this express point was laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1893 in Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[6], when Lord Chancellor Herschell said:\nIt was said that if without the inadmissible evidence there were evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict and to shew that the accused was guilty, there has been no substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice. It is obvious that the construction transfers from the jury to the court the determination of the question whether the evidence\u2014that is to say, what the law regards as evidence\u2014established the guilt of the accused. The result is that, in a case where the, accused has the right to have his guilt or innocence tried by a jury, the judgment passed upon him is made to depend not on the finding of the jury, but on the decision of the court. The judges are in truth substituted for the jury, the verdict becomes theirs and theirs alone, and is arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing the evidence with the assistance which this affords.\nIt is impossible to deny that such a change of the law would be a very serious one, and the construction which their Lordships are invited to put upon the enactment would gravely affect the much-cherished right of trial by jury in criminal cases. The evidence improperly admitted might have chiefly affected the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the evidence which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction might have been reasonably disbelieved by the jury in view of the demeanour of the witnesses. Yet the court might, under such circumstances, be justified, or even consider themselves bound to let the judgment and sentence stand. These are startling consequences.\n* * * * * *\nTheir Lordships do not think it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice where, on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider, in arriving at their verdict, matters which ought not to have been submitted to them. In their Lordship's opinion, substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence.\nIn that case the enactment in question was the statute of New South Wales, 46 Vict., No. 17:\nProvided that no conviction or judgment thereon shall be reversed, arrested, or avoided on any case so stated unless for some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed, on the ground that important evidence, which, in the circumstances, was inadmissible, was put in by the Crown and this evidence may have influenced the verdict of the jury and caused the accused substantial wrong, and that is the opinion of the majority.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I am not able to agree with the conclusion reached by a majority of the court to grant a new trial in this case.\nThe ground as I understand upon which the new trial has been granted is the wrongful admission of evidence at the trial which may have occasioned substantial wrong to the prisoner, Allen.\nHe was indicted on a charge of having murdered Captain Peter Elliston, and pleaded not guilty. The fact of the killing by the prisoner was proved by the Crown, and the defence, the only one in fact which could under the evidence have been set up, was, as stated by his counsel to the jury, that at the time the prisoner\ncommitted the offence he was void of sane consciousness and was temporarily insane.\nCounsel for the prisoner frankly admitted at the argument before us that no other defence than that of temporary insanity was or could have been under the evidence advanced or sustained.\nThe jury found the prisoner guilty thus negativing his only defence and after a careful perusal of the evidence given at the trial, I am unable to see how reasonable men could have reached any other conclusion. The question comes before us whether any evidence was improperly admitted or \"something not according to law done at the trial,\" which in our opinion occasioned some substantial wrong or miscarriage to the prisoner on the trial.\nThe jurisdiction of the court acting as a court of criminal appeal is defined and limited by the Criminal Code. The 1019th section reads as follows:\n1019. No conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial: Provided that if the court of appeal is of opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted.\nThe prisoner tendered himself as a witness and gave evidence on his own behalf. In the course of his evidence replying to the question of his own counsel: \"Tell the jury what you know of this affair,\" said:\nWell, I am afraid I shall be able to tell them very little, because I am of opinion that the man who left here, that is Corrigan\u2014Corrigan came here the same as Trimby, with a manufactured statement, he was not prepared at the time, apparently, and he came along here with a rambling statement at the preliminary investigation; and I am of opinion that Corrigan deserted as a consequence of being afraid to stand the cross-examination, that he might have been subjected to.\nLater on in his evidence he said that he had\na very strong suspicion that the man Corrigan knows more about this, sir, than anybody else, and that is the reason he deserted; something tells me, sir, that that man Corrigan acted crooked on that morning.\nHaving made these broad insinuations against Corrigan, who was a deserter and supposed to be away out of the province, he was naturally cross-examined with reference to his statements, and the following appears in the case reserved by the Chief Justice who tried the case, as having occurred during the cross-examination:\nMr. Aikman: Q. You remember Corrigan giving his evidence in the Police Court, don't you?\nA. Yes, sir. Well I remember some of it, sir. Most of it was given in a very low tone of voice, sir.\nQ. Do you remember him saying this, in answer to a question of, what did Allen say, the answer was, \"He threatened Captain Elliston, he said old Peter should be in charge of a ranch instead of a body of men.\"\nA. Well, now, sir, that is an expression that I would not be guilty of using.\nQ. That is not the question; I ask you if you remember him saying that?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. You don't remember him saying that?\nA. Oh, I remember him saying that, sir, in his evidence that morning.\nQ. Then he was asked this question: \"Did he say he was done an injustice; give his words? (A.) He said he was treated harshly by Captain Elliston; he said he had a bullet for Captain Elliston; and every bullet had its billet, and he had one that would find its mark.\" Do you remember him saying that?\nA. No, sir, I don't remember him saying that; but I can say from that, that is all nonsensical. No man of common sense * * *\nAt this stage objection was taken by the prisoner's counsel to the cross-examination as being an indirect way of getting in the evidence of Corrigan given at the preliminary inquiry and the objection being sustained by the Chief Justice, the cross-examination on the point was dropped.\nI think myself the manner in which the Crown prosecutor framed his questions objectionable and that the Chief Justice was right in sustaining the objection. It is obvious, however, that the statements made by the prisoner in his examination-in-chief quoted above fully justified cross-examination, and that if there had been none legitimate comment might have been made at its absence. The substance, however, of what took place is that the prisoner admitted having heard Corrigan state that he, the prisoner, \"had threatened Captain Elliston,\" but denied that he heard him state that prisoner had made the specific threat counsel mentioned in his second question. The nature of the general threat which he admitted having heard Corrigan state he, prisoner, had made is not stated, and as to the specific threats he denied having heard Corrigan's assumed statement respecting them.\nIt cannot be successfully argued in these circumstances that any material evidence was admitted improperly or in fact that any evidence at all was admitted. The Chief Justice at once ruled against admitting the evidence.\nThe utmost that can be argued is that the incident amounted to something which was \"done at the trial not according to law,\" and which might have substantially prejudiced the prisoner.\nI have already stated that in my opinion the form of the questions was objectionable, and my concurrence in the Chief Justice's ruling with regard to them at the trial.\nThe question remains: Did the putting of such questions, in the circumstances and in view of the character of the defence raised, occasion substantial wrong or miscarriage to the prisoner?\nThe duty of determining whether the facts which happened did or did not occasion such substantial wrong rests under the statute upon the court. In my judgment unless we are able to find that some substantial wrong or miscarriage was so occasioned we are without any jurisdiction to interfere with the verdict of the jury.\nThe statute was passed for the purpose of putting an end to the judicial scandals occasioned by courts feeling themselves obliged by authorities and precedents to give effect to trivial errors or mistakes at criminal trials either with respect to the reception or rejection of evidence, the conduct of the trial or the charge or rulings of the trial judge, quite irrespective of the fact whether these errors or mistakes occasioned substantial wrong or injustice to the prisoner or not.\nUnder the code as it now stands, all this is changed, and the court is forbidden to set aside any conviction or to grant a new trial unless in its opinion some substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the alleged errors or mistakes in respect to the evidence, or the conduct of the case or the ruling or direction of the trial judge as prescribed in the section.\nIn order to discharge my duty in that regard I have, as I have stated, read most carefully the entire evidence with the result that I am unable to reach the conclusion that the occurrence or incident objected to or the manner of putting the questions objected to could have occasioned the prisoner any substantial injustice.\nI had written my reasons out more fully on this branch of the case, but in view of the fact that a majority of the court have reached the conclusion that a new trial should be had, I thought it better to state my conclusion generally, without going into the evidence in detail. We were pressed with the opinion expressed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Makin v. The Attorney-General for New South Wales[7], at pages 69 and .70, as to the proper construction of a section of the \"Criminal Law Amendment Act\" of that colony, conferring power upon the Supreme Court on a stated case to deal with convictions of prisoners, etc., and containing a proviso\nthat no conviction should be \"reversed, arrested or avoided on any\" case so stated unless for some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice.\nAlthough in view of the decision reached by them that the evidence objected to in that case was admissible, it became unnecessary for the determination of the appeal to decide upon the true construction of this proviso, their Lordships thought it right, in the special circumstances, to state their opinion that\nthe language used in the proviso was not intended to apply to circumstances such as those now (then) under consideration; that is cases of the wrongful reception of evidence. Their Lordships after giving reasons for their opinion added: \"That there is ample scope for the operation of the proviso without applying it in the manner contended for.\"' (and that) ''they desired to guard themselves against being supposed to determine that the proviso may not be relied on in cases where it is impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted can have had any influence on the verdict of the jury.\nI have already given my reasons for thinking why it is impossible to suppose that the improper manner in which the questions objected to in this case were framed and put or the answers the prisoner made to them could under the defence raised have had any influence on the verdict of the jury.\nBut what I desire to point out is the radical difference between the language of the New South Wales statute and ours. Ours expressly and explicitly refers to cases where some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or something not according to law done at the trial, and declares that in such cases unless the court is of the opinion that some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial no new trial should be directed or conviction set aside. There is no such language or anything analogous to it in the New South Wales statute upon the construction of which the Judicial Committee gave their opinion, and no room in my humble judgment for applying that opinion to our statute. Its language is so explicit, so definite, so clear, as to leave no possible doubt in my mind of its meaning.\nThe Supreme Court of British Columbia in 1897, in the case of Reg. v. Woods[8], construed this section of the code now under review in accordance with the views I have expressed. So also did the Appeal Court of Ontario in the case of Rex v. Sunfield[9], where it was held that although evidence of threats made by the prisoner in respect of another person was improperly admitted, yet in the opinion of the court no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice having been occasioned thereby, the conviction should not be set aside or a new trial directed.\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant was indicted for and convicted of murder on a trial wherein the prosecution presented against him such a mass of evidence, that the learned trial judge was constrained to describe it in his charge to the jury as overwhelming, on the first issue raised by the plea of not guilty. At the close of the case for the prosecution, the counsel for the accused opened his client's case thus:\nThe evidence I will deduce will be to shew that this man at the time he committed the offence was void of sane consciousness and was temporarily insane. In order that all the evidence may be before you enabling you to come to a proper conclusion, it is my intention to submit the prisoner to you, in order that he may be examined. That is his wish, and he will now take the box.\nThe accused was accordingly sworn on his own behalf.\nIn the course of giving his evidence he spoke of one Corrigan, a fellow soldier, in a way to cast suspicion upon him. Amongst other things he referred to this man as follows:\nQ. You might tell the jury what you know of this affair?\nA. Well, I am afraid I shall be ' able to tell them very little because I am of opinion that the man who left here, that is Corrigan\u2014Corrigan came here the same as Trimby, with a manufactured statement, he was not prepared at the time apparently, and he came along here with a rambling statement at the preliminary investigation; and I am of the opinion that Corrigan deserted as a consequence of being afraid to stand the cross-examination that he might have been subjected to. * * *\nThat is all, sir, because I had strong suspicion of Corrigan. * * that that man Corrigan. acted crooked on that morning. Because you see, sir, Corrigan was in hospital with me a few weeks previous to this in the month of July, and nobody else was in then but Corrigan and me.\nIn the cross-examination there arose an occurrence, no doubt due to these references, which appears in the reserve case submitted to the Court of Appeal in British Columbia, and by way of appeal is now before us,\nIn the reserve case the learned Chief Justice who presided at the trial, introduces his statement of the conviction by these words: 2. The fact of the killing by the prisoner was proved by the Crown, and the defence set up by the prisoner (namely, temporary insanity caused by over-indulgence in alcohol) not having been established to the satisfaction of the jury,\" etc, etc.\nIn presenting the point desired to be raised the learned Chief Justice gives the following part of the cross-examination, to which I have already alluded:\nMr. Aikman: Q. You remember Corrigan giving his evidence in the Police Court, don't you?\nA. Yes, sir. Well I remember some of it, sir. Most of it was given in a very low tone of voice, sir.\nQ. Do you remember him saying this, in answer to a question of, what did Allen say, the answer was, \"He threatened Captain Ellis-ton, he said old Peter should be in charge of a ranch instead of a body of men.\"\nA. Well, now, sir, that is an expression that I would not be guilty of using.\nQ. That is not the question; I ask if you remember him saying that?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. You don't remember him saying that?\nA. Oh, I remember him saying that, sir, in his evidence that morning.\nQ. Then he was asked this question: \"Did he say he was done an injustice; give his words? (A.) He said he was treated harshly by Captain Elliston; he said he had a bullet for Captain Elliston; and every bullet had its billet, and he had one that would find its mark.\" Do you remember him saying that?\nA. No, sir, I don't remember him saying that; but I can say from that, that is all nonsensical. No man of common sense * * *\nQ. We will see that later.\nMr. Davie: I object to that evidence being introduced here. The evidence of that man was taken at the preliminary inquiry, and it has not been shewn that he is absent from the country. It is only an indirect way of getting that evidence in.\nThe Court: Unless you can produce Corrigan to be cross-examined himself, why should you use this evidence here?\nMr. Aikman: I am just testing this witness's veracity and trying to test his memory.\nMr. Davie: I submit he has no right to mention those statements.\nThe Court: No, I do not see what the point is. You must test him by standard methods. Then the learned Chief Justice submits that with the following remark:\nNo further allusion was made to this matter by either the counsel or myself. Mr. Davie urges that this occurrence entitles the prisoner to a new trial, notwithstanding all the evidence adduced, and the question for the court is whether or not this contention is right.\nIt is somewhat difficult to understand how this can be held of any consequence in this case.\nCounsel for the appellant frankly puts it that it is not the reception of evidence he complains of, but merely the form of the questions put by the Crown officer, containing something impliedly, it is said, sworn to elsewhere.\nThe relative importance or insignificance of anything of that kind must be measured by the attendant circumstances of each case and the possible bearing it may have upon the issues that have been raised.\nIt certainly does not seem to me to be law that one accused and giving evidence on his own behalf can be permitted to use the occasion in order to traduce others and mislead a jury by such insinuations as this witness chose to introduce in his evidence, and the Crown officer be forbidden to elicit from him the motive for his conduct in making such allegations as I have quoted.\nFor that purpose the Crown officer would have been perfectly justified in order to shew the animus of the accused in making such insinuations; to have adverted to the circumstances of Corrigan appearing as against the accused in the preliminary investigation and the tenor of his evidence there, and that accused learned or knew thereof, and that this, no doubt, gave rise to such counter charge as made by the accused. He was entitled to have elicited from the witness, and did thus elicit from him, ample motive for his making the insinuations he did. The accused in cases where he creates thus the occasion for a Crown officer resorting to what might otherwise have been dangerous ground to enter upon, has no right to complain of the necessary consequences of his own acts as a witness. He has no greater right than another witness except so far as given by statute.\nThe accused did not hear, though present, the later statement, and his denial being the only evidence before the court and jury, as to whether or not such a statement ever had been made, must have been taken, and no doubt was taken, as conclusive.\nAgain, as to the first statement as to threat or fact, it was simply a repetition of what others had already sworn to on the trial herein.\nNeither statement in the case can be said to have had any effect relative to the main issue of fact as to which the defence had then practically been abandoned by this appellant's counsel.\nFor that reason it might have been as well that the matter had been avoided entirely by the Crown officer. And, unfortunately, when he was asked by the court why he pursued this line of cross-examination, he gave a reason that does not seem to me as tenable as that I have suggested as clearly available. But this reason he assigned can have no bearing upon the substantial right to shew the animus of the accused.\nIs it because a wrong reason is given or weaker ground than he might have insisted upon is taken by a Crown officer, that the accused should have his discharge, or be granted a new trial?\nThere was no objection taken to these questions as should have been by counsel for the accused if he intended to object, or ever supposed his client likely to suffer from these questions or answers thereto. And when taken a moment or two later, it was clear to the jury and every one else that the learned Chief Justice had stamped this course of inquiry as null.\nIt seems further (from the request he made at the close of his charge, for any objections thereto, and counsel for accused signifying he had none), to be clear that if he had attached the slightest importance to the circumstances now complained of, he would have asked for a direction to the jury relative thereto.\nIt may be observed that the only issue before the court and jury at this stage of the inquiry was that of the insanity of the accused.\nIn relation to that the Crown officer suggested that he had asked these questions as a means of testing the memory of the accused, and seeing that he had sworn to a complete lapse of memory of what occurred at the time of the shooting, what was amiss in this that took place shortly after being applied as a test? Beyond that the jury, if they ever thought of it again, could only reasonably apply the answers as tests of memory. And so far from militating against the accused, the result may have tended the other way.\nThe appeal in criminal cases like this where no motion was made in arrest of judgment rests upon section 1014 of the Criminal Code, sub-section 2. And that is confined to questions of law\narising either on the trial or on any of the proceedings, subsequent, or incidental thereto, or arising out of the direction of the judge.\nI doubt much if the mere statement of a question unobjected to, as here, can be said to be a question of law arising at the trial. I do not overlook the fact that in an English case where a grave miscarriage had taken place without objection, the right to have a case reserved was held not to be taken away by reason of omission to object.\nIt is one thing in the case of a grave misconception of the conduct of an entire trial, or a great part thereof, to relieve the accused from the ordinary result of a failure to object, and quite another, where the very unimportance of the error caused both court and counsel to overlook it, at the close of a two days' trial.\nBut where is the practice to end, if such trivial incidents as in question here, happening unnoticed, can warrant a new trial or discharge?\nFor example, hearsay evidence as apparent in this case, despite the efforts of the court and counsel, may creep in. Is that to be taken as a matter of law in any case, proper to reserve a case upon, and a new trial or discharge result?\nLet us turn to section 1018 of the Criminal Code, for there, coupled with section 1019, our duties herein are defined. It (section 1018) reads in such a way as to imply there had been a ruling from which an appeal has been taken. How can that be said in regard to every inadvertence that the most competent trial judge may happen to permit, and where no call has been made for a ruling?\nWhere the matter is so grave that either he must be taken to have misapprehended the entire nature of the business he was about, and hence to have erred or have permitted others to err, it may well be argued that there has been a ruling which rendered the omission to object of no consequence.\nBut what is there here? A correct interpretation of section 1019, however, is the most important thing we have to deal with herein. It reads as follows:\n1019. No conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial; provided that if the Court of Appeal is of opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted.\nTo give this section an interpretation such as to allow this appeal, is not only tantamount to an evasion or abandonment of all responsibility such as has been cast by the plain wording of the section, upon the appellate courts of Canada, but also a direction to every trial judge at a criminal trial, then or after the trial, to reserve a case in every instance of the occurrence of something of the like unimportant nature happening on a criminal trial, in order that the accused be acquitted or tried again.\nThe language of the section is of such a comprehensive and imperative character, that clearly the appellate courts were expected to be strong, and act with that strong hand that would protect the interests of society, and the due administration of justice whilst guarding the rights of the accused.\nIt is impossible in any single case to draw the exact line of duty that will reach every case, if the appellate court is to assume the responsibility and discharge the duty the section evidently contemplates.\nOf course it is not only possible, but easy, to draw the line if we are content to say in this and every other case, that it is impossible to say that any and every thing done, however insignificant, as here, may not have had some effect on a jury. The case of Makin v. The Attorney-General[10], is relied upon and has been referred to in several cases since. I will not dwell upon the curious features of that case, or the language of the judgment, but may be permitted to say that some people seem to have misinterpreted it if my reading of it is correct.\nIf we examine all the authorities from it down to the latest, neither in it nor in any other case has any court gone to the length, or nearly the length, we are asked to go herein.\nBut we have it interpreted by later authorities in a way that seems quite consistent with the due working out of this section of the Code.\nI do not attach so much importance to the difference of language in the various Acts on which cases have arisen, as some do. But I may say ours is the most restrictive of any, in permitting the setting aside of a conviction. I think we must have regard to the object of the Act, and guard alike the just rights of the accused, and the danger of reducing the administration of justice to a farce.\nExperience on this side of the Atlantic has been, from a variety of causes, so different from the experience an English judge has had in his own country, as to render it necessary to take with caution general expressions of such judges in disposing of the cases so far reached under similar legislation. Possibly they have not felt as yet in England the evil this section guards against.\nWe certainly are not expected, using the language of Lord Alverstone, C.J., in Rex v. Dyson[11], at page 457, to transfer from the jury to the court the determination of the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the accused.\nHis suggestion in the same case resting upon the construction of the \"Criminal Appeal Act, 1907\"[12], sec. 4, sub-sec. 1, is that the said\nproviso is intended to apply to a case in which the evidence is such that the jury must have found the prisoner guilty if they had been properly directed. It does not apply when the evidence leaves it in doubt whether they would have so found.\nIn the later case of Rex v. Norton[13], at page 501, the court uses the expression \"would,\" not \"might,\" instead of \"must\" relative to the jury and its possible or probable discharge of its duty.\nI am unable to say that either word, standing alone, can satisfy my mind. I assume either \"must\" or \"would\" implies the assumption that due regard be had to the discharge of their duty by the jury as really what is meant by either expression in each of these judicial opinions. In this case we ought not to have, in light of either expression, the slightest difficulty. The only issue raised is as to an occurrence at the stage of this trial when inquiry was being made relative to the insanity of the accused. It seems absurd on the evidence adduced to suppose that any sane jury could have honestly come to the conclusion that the accused was at the time in question insane. We must bear in mind the legal presumption of sanity, and that the onus of insanity at the time rested upon the accused.\nThere is not a shred of evidence that goes so far as to bring the accused within the range of any legal definition of insanity, save that the evidence bearing on the long-continued drinking of the accused, might render one suspicious of its having brought on delirium tremens or alcoholic dementia. And not only did the accused fail to prove it had, but the only expert who saw him and could speak relative thereto, and had ample opportunity to enable him to speak, is emphatic in saying he had neither.\nAn acquittal in face of such evidence and none on the other side, able to bear the test of our law relative to insanity and its relation to responsibility in law, would have shocked every sensible man who had heard this evidence.\nI have read it all to be quite sure of my ground in this case.\nOn the whole of it excluding any effect flowing from the Crown officer's statements in question, it was the bounden duty of the jury to convict.\nTo decide this case in a way to support this appeal means to my mind the imposing as a legal duty on every trial judge in a criminal case to note the most trifling irregular omission or occurrence liable to happen on any trial, and reserve a case on such foundation for an appellate court, and the imposing on such court the duty of discharging the accused or directing a new trial.\nIt would render the insanity plea very popular. For what bearing in the mind of any man could the above statement of counsel, for it is that which is here complained of, ever have had in determining the question of this man's sanity?\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSince writing the foregoing, I am surprised by the judgment of the majority of the court, placing the allowance of the appeal on the ground of the improper admission of evidence. My note on the bench was this:\nMr. Ritchie confines whole to the point of the counsel having stated in putting the questions the facts of statement having been sworn to in Police Court.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree with the Chief Justice.\nAnglin J.\u2014I think it is incontrovertible that the references made by counsel for the Crown, when cross-examining the defendant, to the Police Court depositions of the absent witness Corrigan were improper. North Australian Territory Co. v. Goldsborough, Mort and Co.[14], at page 385. Without laying a foundation under section 999 of the Criminal Code, which was not done, these depositions were inadmissible in evidence. The effect of the course taken by counsel for the Crown was to place before the jury a part of this inadmissible evidence which bears directly upon a question vital to the defence.\nThat the deceased had been killed by the defendant was practically not contested, the only serious defence set up being that, at the time the homicide was committed, the prisoner was not legally responsible because his mental condition was such, owing to the effect of intoxicants, that he was then incapable of criminal intent. If upon the evidence legally admissible the proper conclusion was that the effect upon the prisoner of liquor, though taken voluntarily, was such that, when he shot Captain Elliston,\nhis mind was so affected by the drink he had taken that he was incapable of knowing that what he was doing was dangerous, i.e., likely to inflict serious injury,\n(Rex v. Meade[15], at page 899; Rex v. Blythe[16], at page 395) \u2014 that it produced a condition, mental or physical, inconsistent with the inference that his act was intentional, intent or premeditation being of the essence of the crime ( Russell on Crimes ( 1 Can. ed. ), 88) \u2014that temporal mental derangement at the time of the commission of the offence was the result (Rex v. Baines, noted in Wood-Renton on Lunacy, p. 912) \u2014 a verdict of acquittal, or perhaps of manslaughter (Reg. v. Doherty[17], at page 308), should be the result. But if the defendant had really formed a previous determination to resent a slight affront in a barbarous manner, \"his mental state due to intoxicants might furnish no excuse:\" Rex v. Thomas[18], at page 820. Upon this question of premeditation\u2014malice aforethought\u2014which is of the essence of the crime of murder, evidence of previous threats by the accused against the deceased is most material. Proof of such threats would go far to destroy the contention that his act was excusable because the use of liquor had reduced him to such a condition that he was unable to restrain himself from committing the act, or was deprived of the power of forming any specific intention; Reg. v. Monkhouse[19], at page 56. It is obvious that such threats, if shewn, would not improbably lead a jury to discredit the only defence relied upon in this case.\nIf Corrigan's deposition had been received in evidence at the trial without compliance with the requirements of section 999 of the Criminal Code, I entertain no doubt that there would have been a mistrial. The reading of such a material extract from it as was put to the prisoner on his cross-examination by counsel for the Grown, accompanied as it was by the statement that he was reading from the testimony of Corrigan at the preliminary investigation, was quite as mischievous\u2014quite as prejudicial to the accused\u2014 as its formal reception in evidence could have been. \"Something not according to law was done at the trial.\" (Criminal Code, sec. 1019.) The learned trial judge did not, either then, or in subsequently charging the jury, tell them that they must disregard the alleged threats to which Corrigan had deposed\u2014if indeed such a direction from him would have cured the mischief. Longhead v. Collingwood Shipbuilding Co.[20].\nThe fact that in his evidence in chief the deceased had spontaneously referred to Corrigan's previous testimony, challenging its accuracy and even hinting that Corrigan himself was not free from suspicion in connection with the murder, in my opinion did not at all justify counsel for the Grown in placing before the jury, under the guise of questions in the cross-examination of the prisoner, material extracts from Corrigan's deposition. An effective cross-examination might easily have been conducted without resort being had to this indefensible practice.\nNeither can I agree with the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia that the conduct of the Crown counsel could not have prejudiced the interests of the defendant because there was no evidence proper for submission to the jury on the question of his irresponsibility at the time of the homicide. The evidence in support of this defence may have been slight. Since this case must go before another jury I refrain from discussing the question further than to say that there was in my opinion enough for submission to the jury \u2014 enough to entitle the prisoner to have the jury pass upon the issue raised by him, unaffected by matter not properly admissible in evidence.\nBut it is said on behalf of the Crown that under section 1019 of the Criminal Code the conviction should not be set aside unless the court is satisfied that the jury must have been influenced in reaching their verdict by the matter improperly put before them. There being other evidence sufficient to support the conviction, it is manifestly impossible to say that the jury must have acted upon, or were in fact influenced by, the matter which now forms the subject of the appellant's objection. On the other hand, it is equally impossible to say that the minds of the jury may not have been, or were not in fact, affected prejudicially to the appellant by matter so pertinent to the main issue before them\u2014impossible indeed to say that it may not have been this matter which with some juryman turned the scale against the defendant.\nI cannot accept the construction of section 1019 urged on behalf of the Crown. So construed, as pointed out in Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales (1), it would in effect substitute the court for the jury in\nthe determination of the question whether the evidence\u2014that is to say what the law regards as evidence \u2014 establishes the guilt of the accused.\nIf Parliament had meant to effect such a startling change in the law, language much more explicit would certainly have been employed; The Lord Chancellor in the Makin Case[21] said: In their Lordships' opinion substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence. It need scarcely be said that there is ample scope for the operation of the proviso without applying it in the manner contended for.\nAlthough the express reference to the improper admission of evidence made in section 1019 of our Code, as one of the grounds upon which a verdict may be impeached, is not found in the New South Wales statute dealt with by the Judicial Committee in the Makin Case[22], the direction of both Acts is substantially the same, viz., that the appellate court shall not set aside the verdict unless for some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. In our statute the court of appeal is required in certain specified cases not to interfere unless in its opinion some substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the error complained of; in the \"New South Wales Act\" interference is prohibited, whatever the ground of objection to the verdict, unless for some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice. I fail to find any ground of real distinction between these statutory provisions. Reg. v. Woods[23] was on this point, in my opinion, wrongly decided; and I am, with respect, unable to accept the view stated by Moss C.J.O., in Rex v. Sunfield[24], at page 258, that under section 1019 of our Code the appellate court\nis placed in a position quite different from that occupied by the court in the case before the Judicial Committee.\nThe correct construction was put upon section 1019 of our Code by Dubuc and Killam JJ., in Beg. v. Hamilton[25], the head-note to which is misleading, and by Osier J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, in Rex v. Brooks[26].\n\"A substantial wrong\" is \"occasioned thereby on the trial\" when counsel for the Crown improperly places before the jury, as having been sworn to, statements which may influence them adversely to the accused upon a material issue.\nAlthough section 4, sub-section 1, of the English \"Criminal Appeal Act of 1897\" does not so closely resemble section 1019 of our Criminal Code as does the New South Wales provision dealt with by the Privy Council, it is not dissimilar and English decisions upon it are of value because they shew that the principle of construction acted on in the Makin Case[27] should be applied in the interpretation of statutory provisions similar to that there dealt with. Rex v. Dyson[28]; Rex v. Fisher[29], at page 153; Rex v. Norton[30], at page 501; Rex v. Ellis[31], at page 764.\nIn my opinion there must be a new trial of this case.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] 16 B.C.

Judgment appealed from (Q.R. 20 K.B. 244) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought the action to recover from the defendants the amount of the taxes imposed upon their electric installations and gas-mains placed upon and under the public streets, etc., of the town in virtue of the by-law, mentioned in the head-note, enacted by the municipal corporation. The municipal corporation claimed the right to assess and levy taxes upon the property in question under the provisions of its charter of incorporation, 56 Vict. ch. 54 (Que.), amended by the Quebec statute, 58 Vict. ch. 54, whereby the name of the municipality was changed to \"The Town of Westmount.\" The action was maintained by the trial judge in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, but that judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from. The questions at issue upon the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nBeaudin K.C. and Boyer K.C. for the appellant.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and Montgomery K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a claim for taxes imposed upon certain poles, wires, transformers, gas-mains and other appliances for the transmission of light and power operated and controlled by the respondents in and through what was, at the time this action was instituted, the Town of Westmount. The respondents own no buildings of any kind within the municipality and their main plants, gas and electric, are beyond its confines. They have no property or interest in the land which they use or occupy and pay nothing for such use and occupation. They are mere licensees of parts of the streets of the town, on which they erect their poles to stretch their wires or under which they carry their gas-mains. The property in the streets, which are admittedly not liable to assessment or taxation, remains vested in the corporation.\nThe town's charter, 56 Vict. ch. 54 (Que.), authorizes the making of by-laws to impose an assessment on\nevery lot, town lot, or portion of a lot with all the buildings and erections thereon.\nThe by-law passed under the authority of this Act purports, however, to impose a tax upon \"all real estate\" (a term of wider meaning), in the municipality. It is sought to justify this departure because of the difference between the French and English texts of the statute. In the former, the word \"terrain\" is used to describe that which is to be subject to taxation; and in the English text the word used is \"lot.\" Neither term is a translation of the other; both are to be construed as if they were original expressions. Whichever word is used, whether it be \"terrain\" or \"lot,\" poles and wires and gas-mains certainly cannot be described as \"terrain\" and, according to the ordinary use of the word \"lot,\" it cannot be held to designate land in an open and public street. \"Terrain,\" according to Bescherelleain\u00e9, means\nespace de terre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par rapport soit \u00e0 l'usage qu'on en fait ou qu'on en peut faire, soit \u00e0 l'action qui s'y passe.\nThere is no \"espace de terre\" in question here. That which the by-law purports to reach, assuming merely for argument that it is intra vires, is the taxable real estate situated within the limits of the town. The respondents' property, which is alleged to be subject to taxation, is described in the municipal collection roll as \"gas-mains and equipment, poles, transformers, wires, etc.\" The poles and gas-mains may by reason of their being fixed to the soil be immovables (Beaudry I., p. 38, no. 40, in fine), but they certainly do not come within the description of any of the words used in the Act. The \"Cities and Towns Act\" now in force in the Province of Quebec, under which, however, the appellant takes no power, authorizes the councils of cities and towns to impose and levy taxes on every \"immovable\" in the municipality. Art. 5730, R.S.Q., 1909. The appellant has no such power, unless we are willing to hold that the words \"lots, town lots and parts of a lot,\" or the word \"terrain\" are the equivalent of \"immovable property.\" To justify such a conclusion it would be necessary to wipe out the distinction, well understood in the civil law, between property immovable by nature or by destination or by the object to which it is applied. Art. 375, C.C. The term used in the Municipal Code is taxable real estate. Arts. 489 and 986, Mun. C.\nCan the poles, wires and gas-mains be assessed as erections on a lot? If the street on which the poles are erected or under which the gas-mains are laid is not a lot, the taxing power does not exist. If, on the other hand, the street might accurately be described as a lot, as it is admittedly exempt from taxation, how could the poles and mains be assessed as distinct and separate from the lot on which they are erected? The statute does not provide for the assessment of the erection as something distinct and separate from the lot on which it is erected. The statute says:\nThe council may impose and levy assessment on every lot, town lot or portion of a lot, whether built upon or not, with all the buildings and erections thereon.\nHow is the assessment of the building or erection to be made distinct and separate from the lot? Finally, as I have already said, those things which are assessed are described in the collection roll as \"gas-mains and equipment, poles, transformers, wires, etc.,\" without reference to the object (the street) to which they are attached.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with the reasons for judgment given by the Chief Justice. I also agree with the reasons given by my brother Anglin for distinguishing the case of The Consumers Gas Company of Toronto v. The City of Toronto[2].\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised by this appeal is the taxability of the portions of respondents' immovable property acquired by respondents by virtue of legislation enabling such acquisition in the portions it occupies of the streets and of lands under the streets of appellant.\nThe question turns upon the meaning to be put upon section 100 of the charter of appellant, being 56 Vict. ch. 54 (Que.), with the force given it by other legislation to be referred to and by the light shed upon said section and legislation by the decision of this court in Consumers Gas Co. of Toronto v. City of Toronto (1), upon similar legislation and taxing statutes. The charter of the appellant has, by virtue of the enactments in article 4178 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, the whole of chapter one in which it is found, relative to town corporations, incorporated therein, unless so far as expressly excluded.\nThe said section 100, directly in question herein, is as follows:\n100. The council may make by-laws to impose and levy: (1) An assessment on every lot, town lot or portion of a lot, whether built upon or not, with all buildings and erections thereon, not to exceed one cent in the dollar of the actual value of such property, as entered on the assessment roll of the town, for which assessment the owner thereof shall be personally liable.\nThe difficulty in this case lies in the meaning of the words \"every lot\" used in the above English version by a legislature expressing its intention in two languages.\nA preliminary inquiry is thus started regarding the meaning of this section by reason of finding the French version as follows:\n(1). Une cotisation, dont le propri\u00e9taire est personnellement responsable, sur tout terrain, lot de ville ou portion de lot, etc., etc.\nThe words \"every lot\" can hardly be said to be a happy translation of \"tout terrain\" or the latter words a fair translation of the former as usually understood. Yet I am inclined to think the literal meaning of the one helps us to understand the sense in which the other is used.\nSpeaking with the greatest deference on the subject of the possible or probable meaning that may have become attached to the word \"lot\" common to the two languages in use, yet having in each some entirely different shades of meaning, I doubt if Mr. Beaudin's ingenious suggestion that lands becoming taxable by severance from a seigniory having originated the use of the word \"lot\" relative thereto, can be safely relied upon as furnishing a definite solution of the problem before us.\nI pass to the wider sense in which I think the solution rests. In passing I may remark I have given due consideration to article 4 of the Civil Code, and also the clause of the Act enacting the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, relative to conflict of language in the English and French copies of it, as well as the broad question of how in the case of conflict of meanings apparent in any Act of the Legislature of Quebec, between the two languages in which the statutes are expressed, the matter should be dealt with.\nThe interpretation clause I refer to has regard only to the general scope and purpose of the Acts consolidated.\nArticle 4 of the Civil Code does not, in express terms, solve the question, but implies by its inclusion of \"French and English\" copy as to what is to be held authentic, that due heed is to be given to both.\nI am inclined to think the purview of the Act itself must be kept in view, and the selection of the version to be adopted in case of conflict, ought to be that which will best effect the purpose of the Act looked at as a whole.\nFor the present I apply these suggestions, and bear in mind the possible shades of difference in the meaning of the terms \"every lot\" and \"tout terrain.\" If the French version governed it would seem to be impossible to deny the taxability of the land in question.\nReverting to the subject of other legislation bearing upon this section 100, we find there are certain classes of property specifically exempt by chapter one, I have referred to It may thus be implied that all other land is taxable, and if so this land is clearly taxable.\nThere is, I must say, a curious feature of the charter in this regard which seems to imply that article 4500, R.S.Q., giving these exemptions has been substituted by something else. I am unable to find any such substitution. I think, therefore, the force of the implication derivable from these exemptions is not derogated from as article 133 of the amended charter implies and speaks of in case of a substitutional enactment.\nIf, again, we turn to the chapter incorporated in the charter save what does not touch this, we find in article 4501, R.S.Q., a provision for railway companies reporting their \"assessable lands\" and that, in default in article 4502, R.S.Q., we find the valuators directed, if the return is not made in time, to assess\nall the immovable property belonging to the company * * * in the same manner as that of any other ratepayer.\nThere certainly is here implied that all other immovable property of other ratepayers, including respondents, is to be assessed.\nIt seems to be, therefore, that the clear implication that the express exemption carries, as well as this there found relative to railways, must mean that all immovable property other than that expressly exempted is taxable.\nAnd that this property here in question is immovable property there would seem to be no doubt, and hence in these implications assessable.\nThis quality of property acquired under statutes enabling the use of streets or lands on which they rest lies at the bottom of the question to be solved herein. I will hereafter refer to the meaning of the phrase \"every lot,\" but now proceed to a consideration of decisions by which we must be governed. They rest upon statutes creating, as the respondents' charter and concessions got thereunder do, proprietary interests in lands over which streets existed. A comparison of such cases and statutes with this case and the statutes upon which the title of the respondents rests to the property it has in the streets or ground thereunder, in question, is most instructive.\nThe technical meaning of the terms used in the respective Acts conferring upon the corporate bodies in question in said precedent cases, their respective properties in streets, in either the said English or Canadian cases, which I am about to refer to, might have warranted entirely different conclusions to have been reached.\nIt is urged in each class of such cases that the property or right of property acquired in the streets, was an easement, and hence not taxable as land.\nIt was, therefore, urged that the taxable quality of the property could not fall within the meaning of the respective taxing statutes involved.\nIt seems to me also that there was more to have been said in any of such cases for those seeking exemption so far as related to the taxable quality of the respective properties acquired by virtue of being land, than for the respondent's claim herein.\nOne of the leading cases is the Metropolitan Railway Company v. Fowler[3]. It rested upon Geo. III. ch. 5, sec. 4, enacted before railway tunnels or gas-pipes in a public street were within the range of ordinary human vision. When we have regard to these facts and the further facts that the said statute was careful to enumerate\na great variety of specific real property subject to become liable to taxation as well as to use the general terms such as \"lands and tenements\" and \"hereditaments\" and that such terms were so placed in the section as to afford an argument for restricting them to the specific subjects named, said case and other such cases in England give, what is needed herein, an illustration of how statutes may and ought to be interpreted in order that the obvious purpose thereof may be executed.\nIn the same manner following that and other authorities (of which some rest upon other taxing statutes) so well collected in the judgment of the learned Chancellor Boyd in disposing of the case of Consumers' Gas Co. of Toronto v. City of Toronto[4], in support of the right to tax plaintiff's gas-mains there in question, is it not competent for us to hold the property of respondents now in question taxable land, within the meaning of the charter of the appellant?\nIn the first place let us assume that taxable interest in the land must be something other than a mere servitude, and inquire whether or not that which the respondent has got by virtue of the powers conferred upon it, is servitude or not.\nIt does not seem to me that it falls within the definition of servitude in the Civil Code. Indeed, it did not seem to be argued that it did so.\nAnd if we look at the opinion of the late Chief Justice of this court in the Gas Consumers' Case[5], in which the majority of the court agreed, we find that opinion very pronounced in relation to the nature of the right there acquired by virtue of a similar statute declaring it could not be called an easement.\nWithout adopting servitude and easement as in every respect interchangeable terms, or on every point of operation co-extensive, the general nature of the right either term stands for is in its inherent legal quality so much like the other that for the present purpose we may assume the opinion I refer to as deciding that phase of the question.\nIn comparing the acts of incorporation of the Consumers' Gas Company and the New Gas Company of Montreal and the Montreal Gas Company, the predecessors, and so to speak the progenitors of the respondents, and the powers given them and the amendments that aid in giving the rights the respondents had conferred upon them in regard to invading the streets and taking possession of parts of the soil therein and thereunder for their own use, I am unable to distinguish the quality of property thus acquired in part of the soil in and under parts of appellant's streets, from that acquired by the other company in and under part of the soil in Toronto's streets.\nThe right of property in each case was and is derivable from the legislation which gives it in each case, subject to some slight differences in the mode of being permitted to acquire, or conditions under which it is to be acquired, but in no way affecting the essential character or quality of the property once acquired.\nSuch being the case, I must hold we are governed thus far conclusively by the judgment in the Consumers' Gas Company of Toronto v. City of Toronto[6]. The ownership of the soil in the street in either case makes little difference, save in this, that the title in the soil may or may not have been acquired by the municipality in either given case.\nArticle 4616, R.S.Q., under which appellant's rights exist, says:\nThe right to use as public highways all roads, streets and public highways is vested in the then respective municipal corporations * * * except so far as reserved, etc.\nThe Toronto streets fall under legislation that seems at first blush slightly more favourable to the idea of the title in the soil passing to the municipality.\nThe Act there vested the highway in the municipality. But after all it was only the highway and not of necessity the legal estate that vested.\nWhatever difference there may be seems against the respondents rather than otherwise.\nIt is possible in either case a title may be acquired as in opening new streets by purchase.\nWe are left here absolutely uninformed as to the facts bearing upon this point in the present case. We are referred to authority that expresses opinion on the general rule of law in municipalities in Quebec in this regard.\nThis particular municipality can, as a creature of statute, only have that given it thereby.\nWe are thus far from reaching the effect sought in the contention, set up in vague terms, that as the municipality owned the streets there was no room for other ownership in the soil thereunder or any part of it.\nBut after all, setting up the previous title, whatever it may have been, is entirely beside the question, for the real question is, whether or not the legislation acted upon had not subtracted from that ownership a part thereof, and given that part to another to have and hold in legal form liable to taxation, within the meaning of the taxing statute.\nI am, therefore, having shewn the nature of this title in part of said lands over which streets ran, as a taxable possibility, only concerned to shew that the Toronto streets as regards the taxability of gas-mains if placed under them by a company, were in that regard as remote from being subject to taxation, as it is possible to urge for these respondents.\nThe Ontario law exempted, at the time the Consumers' Gas Company's Case[7] arose, by express language \"every public road and way or public square\" from assessment.\nYet this court saw its way to tax the gas-main under such \"public roads and ways.\" In the case in hand no such distinct exemption occurs. I am not assuming from this that the appellant's roads or streets as such are any more taxable than those which were thus exempted.\nI do say, however, we have a pretty decided difference as against respondents for them to overcome in view of the decision I am referring to.\nNot only was the language which vested the highway in the municipality stronger than we have to deal with, but that was expressly exempted and the mode of levying the rate in due course of law as provided for there, seemed a barrier to interpreting the statute in the way it was.\nAnd yet that interpretation was reached by having due regard to the substance of things and disregarding the semblance of mere words that did not touch the substance.\nI am thus brought to the point of whether similar mains so placed under similar legislation having been found clearly taxable, as part of the land, the mains now in question can be held to have been covered by the language of article 100 already quoted at the outset.\nLet the words \"every lot\" be looked at in contradistinction to the words that follow, \"town lot or portion of a lot.\" What meaning have they? If we suppose \"town lot\" means the same thing, then we have no possible use for the words \"every lot.\" Therefore we have an assessment only of town lots or other lots. If we confine the assessment to what is usually designated by the term \"town lot,\" we will have one that omits the larger field spaces that no doubt exist in this suburban town.\nIn short, we have, by such an interpretation, the assessment reduced to an absurdity. We must assign some meaning to the phrase \"every lot\" if we can. If we turn to the Century Dictionary, for example, we find of the many meanings \"lot\" is capable of, this:\nA portion or parcel of land; any piece of land divided off or set apart for a particular use or purpose; as a building lot; a pasture lot; all that lot, piece or parcel of ground (a formula in legal instruments).\nOr if we turn to Murray we find substantially the same.\nIs there anything to prevent us from assigning to it the like meaning relative to the lot of land that piece of land occupied by the mains in question? Is there not intended to be expressed simply all ground, or all lands, comprising amongst others the parcel of land that the mains occupy? If it does not mean all lands, what can it mean? If we consider the French version surely that is what the words do mean, and are intended to signify.\nIf we have not the interpretation clause of the Ontario \"Assessment Act\" to assist, have we not quite as comprehensive a term to which we must, if possible, assign a meaning, and which cannot well be assigned anything but the, if possible, still more comprehensive term \"all lands.\"\nThere was a good deal said in argument as to the buildings referred to in the clause in question, which neither helps nor hinders any one here.\nBut I may be permitted to suggest that the reference to buildings is no doubt to shew that prim\u00e0 facie they are for general purposes of assessment to be taken as part of the property here defined to be so intended in contra-distinction to the provision in another place made for assessing for special purposes the land, exclusive of the buildings.\nI may, before concluding, observe, that the late Chief Justice in the Consumers' Gas Company Case[8], sets out four sections of the Ontario \"Assessment Act,\" which it may be said made his task easier than this submitted to us. Do they, or any of them contain anything to distinguish that Act and decision from this? Of these sections, 6 is but a variation of words expressing the like provision to that in the appellant's charter making all taxable property assessable. This does not help either way.\nSection 7 he relies on is but a statutory declaration of what is to be implied in legislation of this character. For all the authorities so profusely collected in respondents' factum to demonstrate that all property of the same kind must be in reason treated alike in assessing, go to shew that this property which is of the same kind or legal quality as that which beyond doubt is taxable, ought to be assessed if justice is to be done.\nThe respondents' whole effort is to escape the substantial application of the fundamental principle upon which for purposes of a mere side issue they have so elaborately relied.\nReturning to the four sections the late Chief Justice selected as helpful, section 9 cannot avail here.\nNow, does the interpretation clause, section 2, quoted by him, help or hinder in arriving at a conclusion here, and drive us to distinguish this case from that?\nI cannot see that it affects the matter at all. For the substance and the fundamental principle upon which that judgment proceeds is clearly that the kind of property the respondents have in the mains and support thereof, is real estate, in other words, the land I have found above.\nI conclude from the foregoing considerations that the mains in question are taxable.\nIs there a possibility of making a distinction in principle when we come to consider the poles set in the soil of the streets and all they carry? I think not. I am helped in this regard by the express disapproval in the Consumers Gas Company's case, of the case of The Toronto Street Railway Co. v. Fleming[9], which had held a street railway, though affixed to the land, not taxable.\nI am clearly of a different opinion, however, as to the meters, and I incline to hold the same as to the service pipes, that they, so far as laid upon private\nproperty for the temporary service thereof, cannot be looked upon as in the same class of property as the mains or the poles and wires.\nAre these possible of severance in the assessment? And if not, how does that affect the validity of the assessment?\nAs to the first year's assessment another question arises. Has there ever been for that a proper assessment? I certainly would have been glad to have had exchanged for practical considerations bearing on this kind of question, some of the elaborated learning in the respondents' factum on points hardly disputable.\nClearly respondents were called upon, if an error, to distinguish, if they could, the personal from the real estate, in the first year's assessment, and in default of there being any attention paid thereto, I think now the assessment must be taken as relative to assessable property.\nI may observe that the information to be put in the assessment roll and thus in the schedules delivered, is by article 4499, R.S.Q., to be what the council directs. No direction is shewn that would render such a brief though, I think, most unsatisfactory statement, improper much less illegal in a way leading to nullification.\nI would deduct from the amount allowed by the learned trial judge such sums as the assessing of meters produced, and if any like item can be deducted relative to the service pipes or connections, clearly only personal property, it ought to be done.\nAfter I had drafted my foregoing opinion, the parties were asked to produce a plan of the appellant city. Waiving for the moment my objection to that course as undesirable and irrelevant, especially so when the plan bears a date later than appellant's incorporation, I may say the suggestion made relative thereto induces me to say that any consideration of numbers of lots on a plan of any date must be a false guide to the meaning of this statute.\nEach of these numbered tracts of land when divided or subdivided must have new streets carved thereout. Are these new streets to become forever taxable? And existing streets might need to be closed or diverted and is the land over which the streets ran to be forever free from taxation? Certainly not any more than I hold these parts expropriated by the respondent are to be or remain so.\nSubject to the said modification I would allow the appeal, and with costs here and in the court of appeal.\nAnd if in any way a reference can be profitably directed as to the service pipes, I would direct it to be had.\nDuff J. concurred in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice.\nAnglin J.\u2014If I did not think this case, distinguishable from Consumers' Gas Co. of Toronto v. City of Toronto[10], I would apply that decision, although not satisfied that, if the question was res integra, I should reach the conclusion that the Toronto gas-pipes were assessable as land or real property under the Ontario \"Assessment Act\" of 1892. In my opinion, however, there is a clear distinction between the provisions of that statute, which were under consideration\nin the Consumers' Gas Company's Case[11], and those of the charter of the Town of Westmount, formerly C\u00f4te St. Antoine, 56 Vict. (Que.) ch. 54, which is now before the court.\nThe Ontario Act contained a provision that\nall property in this province shall be liable to taxation subject to the following exemptions:\nNone of the exemptions had any bearing on the Consumers' Gas Company's Case11. The \"Westmount Act\" contains no similar provision. It authorizes,\nan assessment on every lot, town lot, or portion of lot, whether built upon or not, with all buildings and erections thereon,\nor, according to the French version,\nune cotisation * * * sur tout terrain, lot de ville, ou partie de lot, soit qu'il y existe ou non des b\u00e2tisses, avec tous b\u00e2timents et constructions dessus \u00e9rig\u00e9s.\nThe Ontario statute enacted that\nAll municipal local or direct taxes or rates shall * * * be levied equally upon the whole ratable property real and personal of the municipality;\nand \"real property\" was thus defined:\n\"Land,\" \"real property\" and \"real estate\" respectively shall include all buildings or other things erected upon or affixed to the land, and all machinery or other things so fixed to any building as to form in law part of the realty, and all trees or underwood growing upon the land and land covered with water, and all mines, minerals, quarries, and fossils in and under the same except mines belonging to Her Majesty.\nUnder this provision it was held that the gas-pipes of the Consumers' Gas Company placed under the streets of the City of Toronto were liable to assessment as real property. I make no distinction between gas-pipes laid under the streets and poles erected in the streets to carry electric wires or lamps.\nBy the Ontario \"Assessment Act,\" the purpose of the legislature that all property not exempted should be liable to taxation was expressly declared. With the aid of the clause defining \"real property\" the court thought that the gas-pipes in question \u2014 which were undoubtedly \"property in the province\" and as such were expressly declared to be liable to taxation\u2014 should be deemed real property rather than personal property\u2014the two classes into which all property appears to have been divided by the statute for purposes of assessment.\nIn the \"Westmount Act\" the subjects of taxation are confined to \"every lot, town lot or portion of lot,\" and \"buildings or erections thereon.\" I have stated that the \"Westmount Act\" contains nothing to indicate that it was the purpose of the legislature that all property in the municipality should be assessable. There is no definition of the words \"terrain\" or \"lot\" to extend their meaning or application. This statute is upon these grounds, in my opinion, clearly distinguishable from the Ontario \"Assessment Act\" of 1892, and The Consumers' Gas Company's Case[12], therefore, does not rule the appeal now under consideration.\nUnless the land itself on or in which it is placed be a \"lot, town lot or portion of lot,\" any erection on or in it is not assessable under the provision of the Westmount charter. The land occupied by the defendants' poles is not itself assessable because it does not eoine within the descriptive words of the statute. The word \"lot\" is used in contra-distinction to \"town lot\" and probably signifies a parcel of land owned privately, but not laid out in town lots \u2014 certainly not a public highway. In construing the word \"terrain\" in the French version, we cannot overlook the use of the word \"lot\" in the English version as its equivalent. \"Terrain\" is here used in contradistinction to \"lot de ville\" and, like the word \"lot\" of the English version, means a lot or parcel of land which is not a town lot. Compare article 709 Municipal Code.\nIt may be that, as counsel for the appellant so strongly contended, the poles, etc., of the defendants are immovables. But the right to tax immovables is not conferred by the statute. Because the things which the municipality asserts the right to tax .are not, in my opinion, within the \"literal construction of the words\" of the charter defining the subjects of assessment\u2014and that is the construction upon which the taxpayer has a right to stand: Pryce v. Monmouthshire Canal and Railway Companies[13], at pages 202-3 \u2014 I have reached the conclusion that they are not taxable. Having regard to the well known rule formulated by Lord Cairns in Partington v. Attorney-General[14], at page 122, cited by Mr. Justice Carroll, the letter of this taxing Act may not be extended because the court may think it would be more equitable that the property in question should be assessable or even that the spirit of the statute requires it. See, too, Tennant v. Smith[15], at page 154; Horan v. Hayhoe[16], at page 290.\nFor these reasons I think this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nI reach this conclusion without reference to the plan of the Town of Westmount produced after argument at the request of the court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Boyer & Gosselin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] Q.R. 20 K.B. 244.\n[2] 27 Can.

Haines, Deceased (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1911: February 23; 1911: April 3.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nAccident insurance\u2014Condition of policy\u2014Notice\u2014Tender before action\u2014Waiver.\nThe condition of a policy insuring H. against death by accident required that notice of death should be given to the company within ten days thereafter, and it was provided that if the insured met his death while under the influence of intoxicating liquor the company should be liable only for one-tenth of the amount of the insurance. The insured disappeared on the 21st of November, 1908. When last seen on the evening of that day he was apparently under the influence of intoxicants, and, on 3rd April, 1909, his dead body was found in the river in an advanced state of decomposition, death having been, in all probability, caused by drowning. After the finding of the body the plaintiff gave notice of death to the company and furnished proofs as required. The company refused payment and, before action, tendered to the plaintiff one-tenth of the amount of the insurance payable under the policy as full settlement therefor. The company pleaded this tender in their defence to the action and made proof thereof at the trial.\nHeld, that the tender made by the company was a waiver of the condition requiring notice within ten days of death and also an admission of liability by the company; and, Anglin J. dissenting, that, as the company had failed to shew that the deceased came to his death while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the full amount of the insurance. Judgment appealed from (20 Man. R. 69) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of Mathers C.J., at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case appear in the head-note and the questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. for the appellants.\nW. H. Trueman for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs. See S.V., 1904, 1, note at page 388.\nDavies J.\u2014During and at the close of the argument I entertained doubts whether the finding of the trial judge, confirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the defendants, appellants, had failed to prove the defence that the deceased came to his death while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, could be sustained.\nI am not able, however, to satisfy myself that this finding of the two courts is so clearly wrong as to justify me in reversing it and in allowing the appeal on that ground.\nOn the other ground, of want of notice, I concur in holding that the proof of the tender of $ 100 before action and the payment of the amount into court amounts to an admission of the cause of action and to a waiver of the notices required by the policy before action.\nIdington J.\u2014In my opinion the finding of the learned trial judge that the appellants had not success- fully met the onus of proof resting upon them to shew that deceased came to his death through intoxication, ought not to be disturbed.\nThe evidence was far from conclusive. I might suspect much \u2014 might assume suicide \u2014 I might even suspect the deceased was thrown into the river and thus drowned. None of these are proven.\nIn my view it is unnecessary to pass any opinion upon the effect of the conditions or any of them.\nThe defendants did not merely plead as the rule relied upon provides, payment into court, but pleaded a tender before action and payment into court of the amount so tendered.\nIt could not prove such a plea by proving a conditional tender as it now says in argument was what was intended.\nA tender without prejudice is no tender. It could not be brought in evidence and ought not to have been attempted to be brought in evidence unless clearly abandoning then and there the without prejudice part.\nThe defendants clearly intended to get the benefit of an unconditional tender, and proved it for that purpose.\nIn doing so they waived the conditions relied upon.\nThey cannot now be heard to say they waived it only in part.\nIt was quite competent for the court below to have amended the pleading to conform with the evidence and if the court has not done so I think it ought now to be taken to have so intended and directed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014It is not disputed that the deceased, Frederick Lorne Haines came to his death by \"external violent and accidental means\" within the meaning of the policy on which the action was brought. The defences of the company were two: First, that notice of the death of Haines was not given within ten days after it occurred as required by the strict tenor of the sixth proviso; and, secondly, that the injuries from which he died happened while he was under the influence of intoxicating liquors. This last mentioned fact if established would bring into operation \"Part G.\" by which is provided that, in such circumstances, the sum recoverable shall be one-tenth of the maximum amount payable under the policy; and this sum ($100) was paid into court with a plea of tender accompanied by a denial of liability.\nHaines was last seen in Winnipeg (where he resided with his mother) on the 21st of November, 1908. At about 7 o'clock in the evening of that day he was in a state of deep intoxication and, at 9 o'clock, he was observed on the street by a number of people, and although manifestly under the influence of liquor he was then, as the learned trial judge expresses it, \"capable of taking care of himself.\" On 3rd April, 1909, his dead body was. taken out of the Red River at Winnipeg in an advanced state of decomposition, An autopsy disclosed no marks or indications of violence, death having been caused seemingly by suffocation from drowning. These facts do not appear to me to lead to the inference that the deceased came to his death while \"under the influence of intoxicating liquors.\" It has been said often enough that the question whether a plaintiff has acquitted himself of the burden of proof in respect of an allegation of fact is not a question to be tried by a rigorous application of the canons of scientific inference. It is not necessary that the evidence should be such as to demonstrate the conclusion. But the conclusion must have some more legitimate warrant than conjecture, surmise, guess. I agree with the learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal that, in this case, the inference the company asks us to draw can not properly be held to arise from the facts in evidence. As to the first defence I am unable, with respect, to agree to the construction of the proviso proposed by the respondent. I think the terms are unmistakable, and I do not think we can justly assume that the parties left out of contemplation a contingency so obviously possible as that of death from accident remaining undiscovered until after the lapse of the prescribed period for giving notice of it. We must, I think, take it that the parties did deliberately intend the manifest result of the language used, viz., that in certain readily conceivable events (of which the contingency which has happened was one) the policy should become an honour policy.\nBut I think the respondent is entitled to succeed upon the ground that the appellants are precluded from taking advantage of this proviso. It was proved by them at the trial that, before the action was brought, they tendered the sum of one hundred dollars as payable under the policy. This tender as mentioned was pleaded and the sum tendered was paid into court. The plea did not admit, but on the contrary was accompanied by a denial of liability. The tender, however, appears not to have been qualified by any such denial. The effect of it, in the circumstances, was, I think, an unqualified admission that the defendants were liable upon the footing that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount payable under \"Part G.,\" that is to say, the amount payable on the assumption that when his death occurred Haines was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. What then is the effect of this tender upon the rights of the parties? The sixth proviso unquestionably expresses a condition \u2014 whether a condition precedent requiring notice and proof of loss as essential elements of a cause of action based upon the policy, or a condition subsequent causing a right of action complete at the moment of death to be defeated in default of notice and proofs. It is immaterial for the purpose of this case which of these is the more accurate view of the legal effect of the clause. In either case one cannot doubt that the stipulation that the rights under the policy shall be \"void\" or \"invalidated\" is intended, in accordance with the interpretation which, by inveterate practice, has been put upon such stipulations, to declare that these rights shall be \"void\" at the election of the company. There are numerous authorities in which similar clauses in various classes of contracts, leases, charter parties, sales of lands and of goods have been held to confer on the party for whose benefit they were framed the option of treating or not treating the rights of the other party as at an end. The decision of the Court of Sessions in Donnison v. Employers' Accident and Live Stock Ins. Co.[2], is an illustration of the application of the principle to a clause declaring the giving of notice to be a condition precedent to a right of action upon an accident insurance policy.\nNow, the rule is perfectly settled that if you have a clause of that type and the event has happened upon which under the terms of the clause the one party is entitled at his option to insist that the other party's rights have lapsed \u2014and if, after that event has happened, the party in whom the right of election is vested do any act involving a recognition of the other party's rights as still subsisting and do it with a knowledge of the facts that entitle him to say that these rights have been terminated \u2014 then the doing of such an act is a conclusive election not to take advantage of the clause.\nThe offer mentioned appears to me to be such an act because it must be taken to involve a recognition of the company's liability under the policy \u2014 a liability which the company might have successfully repudiated by insisting upon the strictissimum jus under the clause in question. I should not wish to be misunderstood as holding that the company could not have made a tender which would not have involved such a recognition. I think it could. I think it is quite clear that the company could have said when making the offer \u2014 we are willing to pay this sum if you wish to take it, but we do not admit we are under any liability to pay you anything; we say that through failure to give notice you have lost any rights you might otherwise have had, but we treat the policy as an honour policy for $100. That would have been a tender and an unconditional tender because it would not have required from the claimant any admission \u2014 that is to say, the acceptance of that sum would not have involved any admission on his part \u2014 that he was not entitled to more. Greenwood v. Sutcliffe[3]; Scott v. Uxbridge and Rickmansworth Railway Co.[4]. But I think it is clear that the tender was not qualified.in this way and that as made it involved a waiver of or an election not to insist upon' the objection that no notice had been given; once made the election became, of course, irrevocable.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014While denying all liability under the insurance policy upon the life of the deceased Frederick Lorne Haines on the ground that proper notices of his death and proofs of claim were not given within the periods prescribed by the conditions of the policy, the defendants have also pleaded that the insured came to his death while under the influence of intoxicating liquors and that, by virtue of another condition of the policy, their liability, if any, is, therefore, limited to the sum of $100, one-tenth of the amount of the insurance. They have pleaded tender of this amount to the plaintiff and have given evidence in support of that plea. They have also brought the sum of $100 into court as sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's claim, if any.\nUpon the issue as to the condition of the insured at the time of his death there are no facts in dispute. Whether he was or was not then intoxicated is purely a matter of inference from the facts as deposed to and found. The learned trial judge was of opinion that the defendants had not discharged the burden of establishing that the accident causing the death of the insured occurred while he was under the influence of liquor. The learned judge dismissed the plaintiff's action on the ground of non-compliance with the conditions as to notice of death and proof of claim. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, holding that the tender made by the defendants was a waiver of the conditions as to notice of proof and, inferentially, agreeing with the trial judge on the question of the condition of the insured at the time of his death. From this judgment Richards J.A. dissented, holding that the only proper inference from the evidence is that the insured was drowned while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\nWhile very loath to disturb a finding of a trial judge upon a matter of fact such as this, though resting solely upon inference, especially when that finding has been confirmed by a majority of the judges of a provincial appellate court, a careful consideration of the actual facts found by the learned trial judge and of the evidence upon which his findings were based has satisfied me that Mr. Justice Richards drew from them the correct inference when he said that:\nEvery indication seems to me to point to the death having happened while the insured was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Unless some person could be produced who saw the happening of the death and also noticed that the insured was then intoxicated to some extent I can imagine no stronger proof than that given.\nI agree with the learned judge that the defendants have discharged the onus which lay upon them to prove their plea.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed, and the judgment for the plaintiff should be reduced to the sum of $100. The defendants should have their costs in all the courts, against which the sum of $100 awarded to the plaintiffs may be set off. The money in court should be paid out to the defendants.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Aikins, Fullerton, Coyne & Foley.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bonnar, Trueman & Thornburn.\n[1] 20 Man.

Vachon, (1911) 44 S.C.R. 395\nDate: 1911-04-03\nJames Stratton (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nThe Reverend Hercule Leandre Vachon and Russell Wilson, Executors of James Flanagan, Deceased (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1911: March 3; 1911: April 3.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\nBroker\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Commission on sale of land\u2014Introduction of purchaser\u2014Efficient cause of sale\u2014Completion of contract by owner on altered terms.\nAn agent, instructed to secure a purchaser for lands, introduced a prospective purchaser who associated himself with other persons, whose identity was unknown to the agent, to carry out the purchase of the property. The individual thus introduced and his associates subsequently carried on negotiations with the owner personally which resulted in the purchase, on altered terms, of the property in question, together with other lands, by his associates alone while he retired from the transaction. The owner refused to pay the agent any commission on the sale on the ground that he had not been the efficient cause of the sale which was finally made as above stated.\nHeld, reversing, in part, the judgment appealed from (3 Sask. L.R. 286), that as the steps taken by the agent had brought the owner into relation with the persons who finally became purchasers he was entitled to recover the customary commission upon the price at which the property in question had been sold. Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries ([1910] A.C. 614) applied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of Newlands J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained with costs and the defendant's counterclaim was dismissed.\nThe action was brought by the late James Flanagan to recover from the defendant, appellant, the sum of $5,578.33, the amount of a promissory note and interest, and was continued, after his decease, in the names of the present respondents as the executors of his last will and testament. The defendant deposited funds in court to abide the decision of the cause and also counterclaimed for the sum of $6,250, with interest, being his claim for a broker's commission on. the price of sale of certain lands belonging to the late James Flanagan, in the City of Saskatoon, Sask., in respect of which he alleged he had rendered services, as the agent of deceased, by means of which the purchasers had been secured, At the trial, Mr. Justice Newlands found that the deceased had agreed to pay a commission to the defendant on his obtaining a purchaser for the property; that defendant had offered and recommended the property to one Moore and shewn him what was known as the \"Western Hotel\" (a portion of the lands sold), and that, through Moore, negotiations had taken place which resulted in the owner selling the whole property, including the hotel property, to two persons named Millar and Robinson, who had on other occasions entered into real estate transactions with Moore, and with whom Moore had associated himself in order to effect the purchase of the property in question. Moore had retired from the transaction before the completion of the sale and the owner had dealt with the actual purchasers personally and closed with them on terms somewhat different from those which he had mentioned to the defendant when instructing him to secure a purchaser. The learned trial judge, however, considered himself bound by the decision in Beable v. Dickerson[2], and dismissed the counterclaim, holding that Moore was not an agent. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment appealed from[3] Johnstone J. dissenting.\nThe questions raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe appellant appeared in person.\nEwart K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014There can be but little doubt as to the legal principles by which the rights and obligations of the parties to the agreement declared upon are to be ascertained. If the defendant, as he alleges, was an agent to find a purchaser for the property at a price to be fixed by the plaintiff when the purchaser came forward and that he did find a purchaser who did purchase, then the defendant would undoubtedly be entitled to his commission.\nThe admitted facts are that the plaintiff, an owner of real estate in the Town of Saskatoon, when about to leave that place to take up his residence elsewhere, instructed the defendant, a land agent, to sell his immovable property at a price to be fixed by the owner and that a sale was subsequently made. The trial judge found that the property would not have been sold if the defendant had not spoken to one Moore and upon his connection with the transaction as completed the result of this appeal largely depends. The instructions to find a purchaser were given to the defendant towards the end of December, 1906, and Flanagan, the plaintiff, left Saskatoon about the 1st of January, 1907. On the 17th of the same month, Moore, of Lloydminster, who had entered into negotiations with the defendant for the purchase of other properties, was induced by defendant to consider the purchase of the plaintiff's property, which they visited together, and of these negotiations the plaintiff was informed. He was asked for his price, which was submitted to Moore, the latter, in the meantime, having told the defendant that he would either buy the property, which he considered very desirable, or find a purchaser for it. The conditions as to the cash deposit required by plaintiff being more onerous than Moore could assume, he introduced the property to two of his friends at Lloydminster, Millar and Robinson, who agreed to go into the venture with him and it was determined between them that negotiations would be opened up with Flanagan with a view to purchase. The chief object was to obtain a reduction in the amount required as a cash deposit. Moore, however, again found it impossible because of his financial situation to go on with the negotiations; which were, however, prosecuted to a successful issue\u2014the difficulty as to the deposit having been got rid of \u2014 by his associates Millar and Robinson.\nCould there be any doubt on these facts that if the sale had been made in the first instance to Moore alone, or in the second instance to Moore and his associates, that Stratton would have been entitled to his commission on the ground that he had executed his mandate to find a purchaser? And subsequently what happened to affect Stratton's claim? The disappearance of Moore as a purchaser after the purchase had been decided on could not affect any right then acquired by Stratton if some of the parties who had been introduced to the property through his medium completed the transaction as originally contemplated.\nI quite agree with the trial judge that on all the facts the conclusion is that the sale would not have been made had Stratton not spoken to Moore in the first instance. But I go further, and hold that the relation of buyer and seller between Flanagan and Millar and Robinson was brought about by Stratton, and that he was the causa causans of the sale. The property was brought by Stratton to the attention of Moore, who was instrumental in inducing Millar and Robinson to consider it with a view to a purchase on joint account. The subsequent disappearance of Moore as a purchaser before the transaction was finally completed did not operate to destroy the right acquired by Stratton through his original introduction of the property to one of the three associates, two of whom completed alone the purchase begun with and through the man to whom it was introduced originally and who had undertaken then to buy it or find a purchaser for it.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that Stratton is entitled to his commission on the sale of the hotel property and the appeal, to that extent, should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal involved the question of the appellant's right to recover from the deceased Flanagan commission upon the sale of certain of the deceased's properties in Saskatoon. The trial judge found that Flanagan\ndid agree to give defendant (appellant) a commission on his obtaining a purchaser for said property who would purchase the same at a price and on terms agreeable to him.\nThe property to which I think the above finding was intended to apply was the \"Western Hotel\" property, and, at any rate, I am clearly of opinion that it can only be sustained, on the evidence, with respect to that property, and that it is right as to that property.\nThe question which the trial judge answered against appellant was \"that he was not the direct cause of the sale.\" The learned judge was of the opinion that\nto earn his commission he (the agent) must himself bring the purchaser and vendor together and he does not earn his commission if he does this through the medium of another party who is neither his agent nor the agent of the purchaser.\nUnder the inference he drew from the evidence on this point he dismissed plaintiff's claim.\nThe majority of the court of appeal upheld this judgment on the ground, as stated by Lamont J., that when Flanagan completed the sale there was no knowledge on Flanagan's part that the defendant had been in any way instrumental in securing Millar and Robinson as purchasers and that had he been aware that such was the case he might have protected himself as to the commission in fixing his prices, and that \"the circumstances were not sufficient to put Flanagan on inquiry.\" The Chief Justice, as he says, \"after very great hesitation\" reached the same conclusion as Mr. Justice Lamont, while Johnstone J. dissented, holding that the real test to be applied in cases such as this was whether \"the agent was the real efficient cause in bringing about the sale.\" In the case of Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries Limited, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held[4], that as the appellant in that case had brought the company into relation with the actual purchaser he was entitled to recover, although the company had sold behind his back on terms which he had advised them not to accept.\nLord Atkinson, in delivering the judgment of the Board, at page 625, says:\nThe answer to the second contention (that the acts of an agent cannot be held to be the efficient cause of a sale which he has in fact opposed) is, that if an agent such as Burchell was brings a person into relation with his principal as an intending purchaser, the agent has done the most effective and, possibly, the most laborious and expensive, part of his work, and that if the principal takes advantage of that work, and behind the back of the agent and unknown to him, sells to the purchaser thus brought into touch with him on terms which the agent theretofore advised the principal next to accept, the agent's act may still well be the effective cause of the sale.\nThe knowledge on the part of the vendor that the person with whom he completes the sale was introduced by the agent is not the test of his liability to pay commission, but the fact whether the agent's acts have really been the effective cause of the sale, and if the agent's acts have brought a person or persons into relation with his principal as an intending purchaser, and the sale is effected, the agent has done what he contracted to do and is entitled to be paid.\nNow, in the case at bar there was a contract as found by the trial judge, applicable at any rate to the hotel property, which contract was still in existence at the time Flanagan sold to Millar and Robinson. I cannot doubt, under the evidence, that this sale was brought about by the negotiations which Stratton had with Bramley-Moore, to whom he shewed the property, and who was willing to buy if he could raise the necessary cash payment. Bramley-Moore found himself unable to make the cash payment Flanagan at first required, and associated himself with Millar and Robinson as co-adventurers in the proposed purchase. He had previously intimated to Stratton that if he did not buy personally he would \"place the property with friends of his.\" One of these latter saw Flanagan personally and agreed with him respecting the cash payment, but Bramley-Moore appears, for apparently private reasons of his own, to drop out and let his co-adventurers complete the purchase. But I cannot doubt that the action of these purchasers in buying was the direct result of the acts of Stratton in bringing the property to Bramley-Moore's attention and inducing him to associate himself with his friends Millar and Robinson as co-adventurers who were willing to buy if satisfactory terms could be arranged. Moore, it is true, did not give to Stratton the names of the friends with whom he intended to place the property if he himself was not able to purchase. He only spoke of them generally as persons with whom he \"could place it.\" The arrangement made by these three amongst themselves acting upon the information and facts respecting the property brought to Bramley-Moore's attention by Stratton, was that the three should become joint purchasers of the property at the price stated by Stratton to Moore if a reduction in the amount of the cash payment required by Flanagan could be secured. The first suggestion as to this reduction in the amount of the cash payment was made by Stratton to Flanagan and was agreed to by the latter when he concluded the terms of sale with Millar and Robinson. Now, surely, if Bramley-Moore had remained as one of the purchasing co-adventurers, Stratton would have been entitled to his commission, or if he had purchased without associating himself with any one else, the same result would have followed. The mere fact of his dropping out (from personal reasons of his own) from the concluded purchase, the vendees of which purchase were brought into relation with Flanagan through Stratton, cannot be a reason for depriving him of his commission. It is not so much the knowledge or absence of knowledge on Flanagan's part that Stratton had brought about the sale, as the fact itself that the sale had been effected to parties who were brought into relation with Flanagan through Stratton, that entitled the latter to commission.\nThe evidence of Bramley-Moore is clear that he told Stratton \"he thought this Western Hotel the best proposition he knew of and that \"if he could not take if himself he could place it.\" That on his return to Lloydminster he\nagreed with Millar and Robinson that they should all three go into the deal together provided the cash payment was lower,\nand that shortly afterwards \"Robinson went to Saskatoon to investigate\" (about the reduction of the cash payment I assume, as that was the only question open). That Robinson asked Moore to accompany him as he was to have been a partner, but that Moore had to go somewhere else and Robinson went by himself and completed the purchase in his own name and Millar's. Unless, therefore, the accidental fact of Moore having dropped out of the purchasing syndicate is enough to deprive Stratton of his right to recover commission, I cannot see how his claim can be dismissed.\nIt was suggested that the question of his right to recover commission was an afterthought of Stratton's consequent upon his being sued on a promissory note of his own by Flanagan. But Mr. Stratton has satisfactorily cleared that up and shewn by his evidence, repeated on his cross-examination, that when he drew the papers completing the sale he suspected the purchasers were Bramley-Moore's friends of whom he had spoken as possible purchasers and had inquired from Flanagan whether or not they were so, telling him that if they were he would claim his commission. Flanagan, it is true, successfully parried the inquiry, but when subsequently Stratton ascertained the fact to be as he suspected, he at once put forward his claim.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in all the courts on the counterclaim for commission on the price for which the \"Western Hotel\" was sold, $70,000, that being the only property the sale of which was directly brought about by the acts of Stratton and with respect to which he was the efficient cause of sale.\nIdington J.\u2014The only difficulty the courts below seem to have had in allowing a recovery was their inability to infer that deceased knew or ought to have known that the purchasers, Millar and Robinson, of Lloydminster, were two of the parties of whom appellant, without naming them, had informed deceased.\nThe learned trial judge by his findings on the disputed facts in favour of appellant has brushed aside some difficulties standing in his way up to this point, when he told deceased what he had done for him, and from which he expected a sale. It seems that Lloydminster is about two hundred miles from Saskatoon. From what we are told it seems as if the sole business the buyers had in coming from the former place to the latter was solely relative to this hotel purchase. They closed with deceased exactly on the same terms as appellant had indicated to deceased what he thought would bring about a sale. All he wanted was a reduction of the cash payment from thirty thousand dollars to ten thousand.\nMillar is described by deceased as one of his best friends, one whom he had known from childhood, but not as one that he had any reason to believe until this time of his coming to Saskatoon, at all likely to become a purchaser, nor does he suggest any other way than what appellant had told him for supposing his friend knew or might have come to know that the property was for sale.\nAlthough much stress was laid upon the alleged fact that appellant's name was never suggested as the agent who had brought about the sale, we are not told how it did come about. We are not told anything to explain the remarkable coincidence of the coming on that mission at that time and its successful issue by deceased conceding the one point at which the progress of the purchase had stuck for a while. I infer what the courts below seemed unable to infer. I infer deceased either knew or had good reason to believe just what the evidence discloses, that these buyers were of the party appellant had spoken of to deceased.\nLloydminster is not one of those large cities in which duplicate sets of operators might suddenly be seized with the same thirst for the same property at or about the same time as appellant was waiting for them. And the deceased does not seem to have been lacking in worldly knowledge relative to real estate. Indeed, it seems remarkable how skilfully old friends could have avoided stumbling upon the curious fact that they had nearly closed the deal through appellant.\nOf course the other deals made were not brought about directly by appellant, though incidentally the result of the $70,000 deal for the hotel.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and of the trial of this counterclaim \u2014 and judgment be entered for appellant for $3,500 and said costs.\nIf the judgment against appellant has not been discharged of course this, so far as that is unsatisfied, must be set off.\nDuff J.\u2014The legal rule governing this case is thus stated by Lord Atkinson delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Burchell v. Cowrie and Blockhouse Collieries[5], at page 624:\nThere was no dispute about the law applicable to the first question. It was admitted that, in the words of Erie C.J. in Green v. Bartlett (1863)[6], \"if the relation of buyer and seller is really brought about by the act of the agent, he is entitled to commission, although the actual sale has not been effected by him.\" Or in the words of the later authorities, the plaintiff must shew that some act of his was the causa causans of the sale (Tribe v. Taylor (1876)[7], at p. 510), or was an efficient cause of the sale (Millar v. Radford (1903)[8]).\nThe material facts are that the property sold was placed in the defendant's hands to find a purchaser. Terms were mentioned, but they were not looked upon by either Flanagan or the defendant as anything but a basis of negotiation. In effect the arrangement between them was that the defendant if he got a purchaser on terms satisfactory to Flanagan was to get a commission. The defendant brought the property to the attention of one Moore, who said he would take the property himself or place it with others. The defendant then communicated with Flanagan (on the subject of terms) who put the cash payment at $30,000. Moore having been informed of this communicated with two persons in Lloydminster, Millar and Robinson, (with whom he had frequently been associated in real estate transactions,) and it was decided that they with Moore would make the purchase if the cash payment were reduced to $10,000. The first plan was that one of them should go to Vancouver to see Flanagan, but the visit was postponed for some weeks when they learned that Flanagan had returned to Saskatoon and Millar and Robinson decided to open negotiations with him there; Moore by this time having become involved in other transactions which prevented him from taking part in the purchase, Millar and Robinson proceeded to Saskatoon and in a few days bought the property for themselves alone. It appears to me on those facts to be sufficiently established that\nthe relation of buyer and seller was really brought about by the act of the plaintiff.\nThe determination of Moore and his associates to purchase if suitable terms respecting the mode of payment could be obtained was the direct and normal consequence of the introduction of the property to Moore. It is impossible to maintain the position that Moore's act in associating Millar and Robinson with him in the adventure must be regarded as novus actus interveniens. That a speculator in real estate having a property offered to him and thinking it likely to be a profitable purchase should associate with him others with whom he is in the habit of acting in such transactions is quite within the ordinary course of things; almost as much, indeed, as borrowing to provide the purchase money. It was, I think, hardly contended otherwise because I think it was not seriously disputed that if Moore had not withdrawn the connection between the defendant's introduction and the purchase would have been sufficiently direct. How then is the matter affected by the withdrawal of Moore? That itself is clearly not a new and independent instrumentality. Nobody suggests that the fact of his withdrawal had any effect in forwarding the transaction. There was, of course, the question of terms. But the terms mentioned to the defendant by Flanagan were, as I have said, intended only to be a basis of negotiation. There can, I think, be no doubt that the terms which Millar and Robinson proposed were terms which Flanagan from the first was willing to accept. I cannot see, therefore, on what ground it can be maintained that the sale was not \"really brought about\" through the defendant's introduction of the property to Moore.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts are fully stated in the judgments of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, particularly in the very carefully prepared opinion of Mr. Justice Johnstone.\nIt having been found that the plaintiff's testator, James Flanagan, agreed to pay the defendant a commission if he should obtain a purchaser for his hotel property who would buy it at a price and on terms agreeable to him (Flanagan), and there being evidence to support this finding, the right of the defendant to recover on his counterclaim depends upon his having established that he did in fact procure such a purchaser.\nHad the property been bought by Moore, to whom the defendant directly introduced it, or by any syndicate in which Moore was personally interested, the defendant's right to his commission would appear to be incontrovertible. Burchell v. Gowrie Blockhouse Collieries, Limited[9]. The difficulty in the defendant's way is that, although Moore was originally interested with Millar and Robinson, he did not eventually become a co-purchaser with them. That the property was brought to their attention by Moore is not questioned; that Moore became interested in it through introduction of the defendant is equally clear: the question is whether, in bringing the property to the attention of Millar and Robinson, Moore, though in one sense actuated by a wish to subserve his own personal interests, should, nevertheless, not be held to have done so under circumstances which entitle the defendant to a commission from the vendor.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge\u2014the force of which is certainly not weakened by the fact that his judgment was adverse to the defendant\u2014was that Moore had\ntold the defendant he would either take the property himself or obtain a purchaser for him.\nThe evidence establishes that the defendant informed Flanagan of his interview with Moore and of Moore's proposal to interest friends of his from Lloydminster in the purchase. I agree with Johnstone J. that the circumstances warrant an inference, if that be necessary, that Flanagan had constructive, if not actual notice, that his purchasers were the Lloydminster friends whom the defendant told him that Moore hoped to interest in the purchase.\nHad Moore, Millar and Robinson become the purchasers \u2014 whether immediately following the defendant's introduction of the property to Moore and the latter's communication with his then undisclosed co-adventurers and upon the terms then discussed, or at a later period after a break in the negotiations and upon other terms to which the vendor was subsequently persuaded to assent \u2014 the defendant's right to a commission would have been unquestionable. It would then have been too clear for controversy that his introduction of the property to Moore would have been the \"efficient cause\" of the vendor obtaining his purchasers. I cannot see that this introduction ceased to be the efficient cause of Flanagan obtaining his purchasers and became merely a cause sine qu\u00e0 non simply because Moore, owing to other business entanglements, found himself unable to resume or proceed with the negotiations with Flanagan which resulted in Millar and Robinson buying the property.\nIn my opinion the defendant has established that his introduction was the foundation upon which the negotiations which resulted in the purchase proceeded and without which they would not have proceeded. Wilkinson v. Martin[10]. The relation of buyer and seller was really brought about by him, Green v. Bartlett[11], at page 685 \u2014 that is by his introduction, Barnet v. Isaacson[12]. But the effect of the defendant's intervention was confined to the sale of the hotel property, which brought $70,000. He was not efficiently instrumental in bringing about the sale of the adjacent lots for which Millar and Robertson paid Flanagan $55,000. On his own evidence the defendant is, in my opinion, not entitled to a commission on this part of the purchase.\nIt is not disputed that 5% is the usual commission paid in Saskatchewan and Alberta in respect of such transactions as that with which we are dealing.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the full court of Saskatchewan and judgment should be entered for the defendant on his counterclaim for $3,500 with costs to be set off against the plaintiff's judgment for debt and costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stratton & Jordan.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Acheson & Shannon.\n[1] 3 Sask.

Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall (42 Can. S.C.R. 420) followed. Judgment appealed from (15 B.C. Rep. 461) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Murphy J., at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe plaintiff was employed by the company to operate an engine used for breaking jams in a logging slide constructed on the side of a mountain. The engine was placed at the foot of the chute, near the water where the logs were to be boomed; its position was changed from time to time, upon the orders of an experienced foreman, and at the time of the accident by which the plaintiff received his injuries it was near the foot of the slide down which logs were coming with considerable speed. A log jumped the side of the chute and rolled down the mountain side breaking the plaintiff's leg and causing him other injuries while he was standing near his engine. The jury, without being asked to answer questions, found that the engine had been placed too near the chute and gave a verdict for the plaintiff, assessing damages at $4,500, for which judgment was entered at the trial. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment appealed from.\nThe questions raised on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. Travers Lewis K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This case is founded on the common law liability of an employer, for negligence in failing to take due care of his servant engaged in a highly dangerous occupation.\nThe jury under the direction of the learned trial judge, in a charge to which no objection was taken by appellant's counsel, found a verdict for plaintiff (respondent here) of $4,500 for which judgment was. entered.\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia upon appeal taken there unanimously dismissed the appeal. The jury, without being asked questions, assigned as reason for their verdict\nthat the engine was placed too near the chute by the defendant company.\nBut, is there evidence that the company placed the engine thus needlessly and hence negligently?\nThe appellant is an incorporated company and the business in question was left entirely to the superintendent and a foreman.\nThe placing of the engine, which the respondent was in charge of as engineer, was their work. It was the result of experiments in the course of working at that chute, placed where complained of.\nThe company's business was that of loggers. In course of such business this chute, some fifteen hundred feet long, was used for sliding logs down to the water's edge.\nThe placing of this engine (needed for occasional service in connection therewith) one day at one point and next day at another, would hardly seem to constitute, as a matter of course, a part of a system adopted by the company. It may have, in the language of Lord Cairns in Wilson v. Merry[2], provided \"adequate material and resources'' for the protection of the workmen under such circumstances as to render the mistake of the competent superintendent only the act of a fellow employee, and not in this regard of the company.\nAn examination of the authorities when we had to dispose of the Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. Mc-Dougall[3], relied upon by the Court of Appeal, did not satisfy me that the accidental mistake of a competent superintendent or foreman if so supplied with adequate material and resources enabling him to do better, but failing through his negligence, could be attributed as a matter of course to the company.\nIt so happened in that case that there was evidence from which it might be inferred that the company did know and direct, or acquiesce in, what was done. It was not necessary to decide the point of the company's responsibility for negligence of a competent superintendent, supplied as suggested.\nIs a company without knowing, or having the means of knowing, responsible in such a case for the negligence of the superintendent?\nIn the case at bar the failure to raise directly, at any stage, the point in question, when coupled with the general verdict given, seems to preclude, even if it had been taken here, as it was not, the consideration and passing opinion upon such a point.\nI agree in the dismissal of the appeal.\nI only refer to this question to guard myself from being taken, by tacit consent, as agreeing in the suggestion that the case cited conclusively decides the law as in the way apparently assumed in the judgment of my brother judges in that case.\nA decision is binding only so far as necessary to the decision of the case.\nWith every respect for my brother judges, I do not think the decision carries the law further than it had previously gone in modifying the law laid down in Wilson v. Merry[4].\nYet it has been relied upon here and elsewhere as having done so. Duff J.\u2014The finding of the jury whether treated as a general verdict or as a special verdict is in effect a finding that the arrangement of the works taken as a whole was faulty by reason of the fact that the engine was placed too near the chute. I agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that there was evidence to sustain this view. The questions arising are, \u2014 first; whether, in law, that is sufficient to cast a liability on the company, and \u2014 secondly; whether, on the undisputed facts, the proper conclusion is not that the proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff was his own act in unnecessarily remaining in a place of danger.\nThis last contention was pressed upon us by Mr. Ewart with his usual ingenuity, but there appears to be evidence which, if believed by the jury, might properly lead to the inference that the plaintiff himself believed, on grounds not unreasonable, that it was his duty to be where he was. The plaintiff himself expressly states that it was his duty to be at the engine; and it was stated by another witness that he had been discharged from a similar position for not remaining at his post. In face of this evidence it cannot be successfully maintained, in the absence of a finding of the jury to that effect, that the plaintiff is disqualified from recovering by reason of contributory negligence. There is evidence again shewing that the plaintiff called attention to the danger and asked for protection. This happened the day before the accident occurred. In these circumstances it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of injury arising from the position in which he was placed. In my view, therefore, this contention fails. As to the first point, the employer is responsible according to the view of the majority of the judges in Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[5], for the installation of a system of work which needlessly exposes his workmen to risk of injury.\nI do not propose to re-state the grounds on which that opinion rests; they are sufficiently explained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies. In this case as I have said, the jury have, I think, in effect found all that is necessary to establish the proposition that the system inaugurated infringed this rule.\nAnglin J.\u2014The verdict returned in this case was, in my opinion, a general verdict. But whether it should be so regarded or should be deemed special findings, there was evidence to sustain it and it supports a judgment for the plaintiff at common law. The negligence found by the jury, if it should be regarded as based solely upon the placing of the engine, which it was the plaintiff's duty to attend, in a position unnecessarily dangerous, was a defect in original installation. If the verdict should be treated as resting upon the view that adequate protection was not provided for the safety of the plaintiff, while he was rightly and in the course of his employment in this dangerous place, it is a finding of a defective system. In either case the defendants are, in my opinion, liable at common law for the injuries sustained by their employee, the duty, of a breach of which the jury have found them to have been guilty, being a duty which they could not delegate so as to substitute liability under the \"Employers' Liability Act\" for liability at common law in the event of injury resulting to an employee from failure to discharge it.

Ter. Ord., 1903 (1st sess.), c. 16, s. 2.\nThe premium on a policy of fire insurance was not paid at the time the policy was delivered but, on request, credit was given for the amount and a draft for the same by the insurance company, accepted by the insured, remained due and unpaid at the time the property insured was destroyed by fire.\nHeld, that, in an action to recover the amount of the insurance, the non-payment of the premium was not available as a defence.\nThe policy was subject to the statutory condition requiring prompt notice of loss by the insured to the company; by another condition the insured was required, in making proofs of loss, to declare how the fire originated so far as he knew or believed. Upon the occurrence of the loss, the company's local agent gave notice thereof to the company, and informed the insured that he had done so and that the company had acknowledged receipt of his notice. The insured gave no further notice to the company. Forms were then supplied by the company for making proofs of loss and they were completed by an agent of the company and signed and sworn to by the insured, the origin of the fire being therein stated to be unknown. On examination for discovery the insured stated that, at the time he signed the declaration, he entertained an opinion as to the origin of the fire, and the company's adjuster reported a similar opinion as to its origin. An adjustment of the amount of the loss was then proceeded with by the several companies carrying insurances on the property in which the defendant company took part, but, after payment by the other companies of their proportionate shares according to the adjustment, the defendants repudiated liability on the grounds of want of notice as required by the statutory condition and non-disclosure of the opinion entertained by the insured as to the origin of the fire.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (3 Sask. L.R. 219)., that, in respect of both conditions, the default was the result of mistake on the part of the insured and, in the circumstances of the case, the provisions of section 2 of \"The Fire Insurance Policy Ordinance,\" N.W. Ter. Ord., 1903, (1st sess.), chapter 16, should be applied and the insurance held not to be forfeited by reason of default of notice or imperfect compliance with the condition as to proofs of loss.

S.C.R. 40) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of Wetmore C.J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nChrysler K.C. and Travers Sweatman for the appellants.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. and W. E. Knowles for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed, but I will not dissent from the conclusion reached by the majority of the court.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Anglin. Idington J.\u2014The appellants were insured for one year by the respondent against fire injuring or destroying a stock of goods in the Province of Saskatchewan. When the year was about to expire respondent's agent induced them to apply for insurance for another year and he delivered to them a policy of insurance for such second year. The premium was $66. They were unable to pay it. The agent on the 30th of September, 1907, in reporting to the head office this fact and the delivery to the appellants of the policy, asked if settlement could be postponed till the 7th of October. On the 1st of October, 1907, the head office replied:\nYour favour of the 30th ult. is to hand. We shall be pleased to grant Messrs. Bell Bros. extension of time to Monday, Oct. 7th, which we trust will be satisfactory.\nAnd on the 15th of October the agent wrote as follows to head office:\nRe Bell Bros. No. 1024.\nMessrs. Bell have not yet paid their premium on the above. Collections are bad at present. Will you give them any further time or not? At any rate please write them and oblige.\nAnd on the 16th of October came the following reply thereto:\nRe Policy No. 1024, Bell Bros.\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 15th inst., and note same.\nWe enclose herewith draft which we have dated November 1st. Kindly take this to Messrs. Bell Bros. and have their acceptance of same and return draft to us by first mail. When the draft is paid we will send you cheque for your commission, which we trust will be satisfactory.\nAnd on the 17th October the agent returned the draft which was dated 16th October, payable November 1st, for $ 66, duly accepted in letter saying:\nRe Bell Bros. No. 1024.\nHerewith is draft accepted by Bell Bros. re the above policy. The draft was payable at the Bank of Hamilton, Moose Jaw, and was indorsed to the Union Bank at Sintaluta, where it had been made payable.\nOn the 16th of November, 1907, the company wrote the following letter to appellants:\nRe Premium Policy No. 1024, self.\nOn October 17th you gave us your accepted draft for the premium on the above policy amounting to $66. The draft was due on November 1st, but when presented for payment was not honoured. Kindly let us know why our draft was not honoured and state what disposition you wish to make of same.\nAnd got reply dated November 18th, 1907, as follows:\nYours of the 16th to hand. We regret being unable to meet the premium on the insurance before now, but money has been very scarce, but we will do our best to remit you a cheque on the 25th of this month. We are sorry we have not had it before, but your agent said it would be all right if we paid it as soon as possible, which we will do, but we think the 25th would be as soon as we can promise it.\nAnd to this the company replied as follows on the 20th of November:\nRe Policy No. 1024, self.\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 18th inst. and note what you say re payment of your draft in connection with premium on the above policy. If you cannot pay the full amount at this time we would be glad to receive a payment on account and trust the same will have your attention.\nThe policy has been outstanding for two months and we trust that you will let us bave a remittance on account and the balance on the 25th of the month, as stated in your letter.\nOn the 26th of November, as result of the fire the agent wired:\nHudson Bay Ins. Co.,\nMoose Jaw.\nBell Bros. store and contents totally destroyed by fire last night.\nAlbert Stauffer.\nThe company on the 26th of November replied as follows to the agent: Re Loss Policy No. 1024, Bell Bros.\nWe are just in receipt of your telegram advising of loss under the above policy. Kindly let us have full particulars in this connection by return mail.\nAnd on the 27th of November, 1907, the agent wrote as follows:\nRe Loss Bell Bros. No. 1024.\nThis fire occurred on Monday night and the store and contents were completely destroyed. Three other buildings in the same row were also burnt.\nThe other insurance on store and contents are as follows:\u2014\nOn stock\u2014Occidental, $2,000.\nCentral Canada, $1,000.\nOn building\u2014Central Canada, $1,700.\nLondon Mutual, $1,500.\nTo this the company replied on 29th November, 1907, as follows:\nYour letter of the 27th inst. with reference to Messrs. Bell Bros\/ loss is to hand. We are enclosing herewith Messrs. Bell Bros\/ application together with blank proof of loss form and would ask that you have the adjuster for the other companies look after our interests also.\nThe forms for proof of loss duly reached the appellants and were sworn to by one of them on the 3rd of December, 1907, and delivered then to the agent who took the oath of proof.\nAnd about the same date the acting-adjuster inquired and apportioned the shares of the insurers relative to the loss as follows:\nApportionment.\nInsures.\nPays.\nA\u20148511, Central Canada . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$1,000\n$ 863.77\n8652 and 8653, Occidental . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2,000\n1,727.54\n1024, Hudson Bay . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$2,000\n$1,727.54\n$5,000\n$4,318.85\nand added thereto the following:\nFire started in the basement and although it is not definitely known, it is supposed to have been caused by the furnace. Assured seems to have been very well thought of in Sintaluta, and judging from the remarks of the other merchants in the town and my own impression of the character of the Bell Bros., I have no hesitation in saying that the fire was purely accidental.\nThe report from which I extract these particulars was dated 24th December, 1907, and was received at the head office on the 26th December, 1907.\nOn this state of facts respondents now contend there never was any insurance effected.\nI cannot assent to such contention.\nI cannot understand why a company accepting as a settlement the accepted draft for the amount of a premium for a year can now be heard to say there was no contract. Nor do I understand how anything I might add to the force of the foregoing can convince, if the correspondence does not, and the assenting to this adjustment does not convince.\nContracts such as the delivery of the policy and the acceptance by respondent of an accepted draft either as settlement for the cash premium or an independent consideration for the insurance were clearly within the competence of the insuring company to agree to and be bound by.\nThe company's managers do not seem to have imagined then or for a long time afterwards that they had not formed such a contract as these documents clearly evidence.\nThey held on to the accepted draft and could have sued and recovered thereon beyond a doubt.\nThis is not such a case as the reports of insurance cases are full of, where the local agent had attempted to accommodate a neighbour or client by taking his note for cash.\nIt is a solemn contract made by the head office armed with plenary authority. It ought not to be frittered away by sophistries founded on the ambiguous language of the policy.\nHolding these views I need not inquire as to the legal consequence alleged to be an estoppel founded upon the conduct of the insurers in assenting to the adjudication and apportionment of loss and thereby inducing the appellants to accept from each of the others who had become co-insurers a less sum than they each, but for such adjustment, presumably must have paid.\nAs full attention to this aspect of the case does not seem to have been paid in the courts below, I will not dwell needlessly upon it or pass an opinion thereon.\nIf, contrary to my view, the accepted draft is not to be looked at as in itself good consideration, then I fully agree with Chief Justice Wetmore there was a settlement of the premium. In other words there was a final contract that covered the period of the fire and bound respondents and still binds them unless they have some other means of escape such as I am about to consider.\nThe defence is set up that the notice required by paragraph (a), section 13, of the statutory conditions, had not been complied with.\nThis might have been arguable but for the decision of this court in the case we disposed of last session (Prairie City Oil Co, v. The Standard Insurance Company[2]), wherein we held that this requirement fell under the description of proofs of loss. We held such a defective compliance therewith as this was one the court was enabled by statute to relieve against. This decision was come to after the learned judge had disposed of this case, but it must be governed thereby in this appeal.\nThe only questions relative to it now are, whether or not the insurer's agent, who took the risk and as matter of common knowledge (partly recognized in the form of application for insurance used herein) is commonly looked upon as agent of both parties in such cases, whatever may be the legal relationship, having given notice of the loss in writing evidenced by a telegram and a letter to the company and received by it, such notice can be adopted by the insured by way of ratification or the courts can under the facts and circumstances relieve under the provisions of section 2 of the ordinance, which is as follows:\n2. Where, by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, the conditions of any contract of fire insurance on property in the territories, as to the proof to be given to the insurance company after the occurrence of a fire have not been strictly complied with, or where, after a statement or proof of loss has been given in good faith, by or on behalf of the assured in pursuance of any proviso or condition of such contract, the company, through its agent or otherwise, objects to the loss upon other grounds than for imperfect compliance with such conditions, or does not within a reasonable time after receiving such statement or proof, notify the assured in writing that such statement or proof is objected to and what are the particulars in which the same is alleged to be defective and so from time to time, or where for any other reason the court or judge before whom a question relating to such insurance is tried or inquired into, considers it inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void or forfeited by reason of imperfect compliance with such conditions, no objection to . the sufficiency of such statement or proof, or amended or supplemental statement or proof, as the case may be, shall, in any of such cases, be allowed as a discharge of the liability of the company on such contract of insurance wherever entered into; but this section shall not apply where the fire has taken place before the coming into force of this ordinance.\nI am inclined to the opinion that the acts of the insured (who were informed next morning after the fire by the agent what he had done relative to notice) in adopting the methods of proof required by the insurers, and in complying with everything the agent and adjuster required on behalf of the company, might be held to have acted upon the presumption that such preliminary notice given by the agent was understood by the company to have been adopted by the assured and thereby in effect to have ratified its giving as if their act. Certainly most men informed, as these insured were, of notice having been sent and responded to as this was, would have supposed that the insurer had accepted it as sufficient.\nBut, however that may be, the circumstances are such as in the language of the enactment constitute a sufficient\nother reason the court or judge before whom a question relating to such insurance is tried or inquired into for which he or they may consider it inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void or forfeited by reason of imperfect compliance with such conditions.\nI am of opinion this court is engaged in such an inquiry as contemplated and is authorized by said section to consider and declare or hold that if such part of the conditions has not been observed there exists or may exist \"an imperfect compliance with such conditions\" and to hold it to be considered inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void by reason thereof.\nFor my part I do hold that in the circumstances it would be inequitable to deem this insurance void by reason of said imperfect compliance with such conditions.\nI may observe that it is not as suggested during argument an imperfect compliance with any single condition that is aimed at, but an \"imperfect compliance with the conditions\" of proof as a whole that the clear comprehensive language covers. It may be said the want of notice of a fire does not fall within these conditions of proof, but that is just what we have held in the Prairie City Oil Company's Case[3], as within the purview of the statute. And if omission to give that notice does so fall, clearly the omission of notice was the result of mistake arising from the insured being told when they called on the agent next morning, he had sent the notice and being confirmed in the belief of its sufficiency by the response it brought from the head office of the insurers. Either ratification already suggested or mistake seems to be the correct inference.\nAnother ground of defence taken is that, by statutory condition 13, the insured is required to make a declaration of loss and that, by sub-section 2 of said condition, he is to state\nwhen and how the fire originated so far as the declarant knows or believes,\nand that, in making this declaration, the appellants did not disclose their belief anent the origin of the fire.\nI am not disposed to treat this requirement lightly. Each case must stand on its own bottom.\nThere may be cases where it is of vital importance both to the insurers and the interests of justice to have the insured pinned down to a statement of his belief. I have considered everything adduced in this case upon the point, yet I fail to find how, in it, much importance can be attached to the omission, if such can be claimed.\nThe facts bearing upon the question are as follows. The company having, as already stated, sent the forms of proof, the declaration verifying the same was executed and sworn before the company's own agent. The form was printed with blanks to be filled in.\nThe part stating that the fire occurred, represents it as taking place at a time named, destroying the property as therein before stated, and ends by these words, \"said fire originated as follows:\u2014Origin unknown.\"\nThe first part being printed, the words \"origin unknown' are inserted, it is said and not denied, in the handwriting of the acting-adjuster who prepared the report above referred to, and from which I have already quoted the statement relative to the origin of the fire.\nSeeing that the report from which I have already quoted, as to origin of the fire, was prepared about the same time as this proof of loss by the same man who filled in these words \"origin unknown,\" I am at a loss to know why there can be much importance attached to the matter.\nFrom whom did he get the information embodied in his report? Could he, if he found the insured reluctant to state exactly what the report shews, and been driven to get it elsewhere, have reported, as he does, as to the honesty of the insured?\nSuch a circumstance should have aroused suspicion at once,\nAs stated in argument, and not denied, the performance of all I have referred to as done by the adjuster, or acting-adjuster, for the company, was all actually done by the assistant and then put in the shape it now appears and was adopted, dated and signed by his principal.\nWhat the respondents contend is that this declarant, one of the appellants, had refrained from telling his belief, till he was examined for discovery in this action. A comparison with what he says in such examination and what the report contains does not disclose to my mind any startling discrepancy. I infer the whole was told the acting-adjuster who, for brevity sake, wrote the fact in filling up the declaration and set forth the belief of fact in this report.\nThe adjuster says, as above quoted, it started in the basement, and although not definitely known it is supposed to have been caused by the furnace.\nThe other man says, in a multiplicity of words, such as the examination for discovery may have rendered necessary, the same thing with some speculative detail as to the clerk who fed the coal into the furnace having failed in care to feed the slacked coal in such a way as to avoid explosion.\nBoth are mere theories, and possibly both idle speculation.\nBut we find no such importance attached to the discovery when got as now urged; neither were the versions of belief found material or aught implied therein so. It needed no amended pleadings or change of base. Why? The fair inference is the insurers had the information from the insured. Neither said clerk to prove neglect or fact nor the acting-adjuster to say he was misled, were called.\nThe defence on this head is reduced to the narrowest sort of technicality.\nIt is alleged to be a violation of the condition working forfeiture of the policy that the belief was not inserted in the proof.\nThe respondent company receiving defective proof was in duty bound by the terms of section 2, above quoted, if the omission to state belief was thought to be of the slightest consequence, or such could be seriously attached thereto, within a reasonable time to have notified the insured in writing that such statement of proof was objected to, and in what particular it was alleged to be defective, or abide by the consequences of such neglect on their behalf as opening the way for the judicial relief the section permits against forfeiture ensuing as result of the omission.\nThe company chose to refrain from objecting and cannot now be heard to complain if the alternative is applied to the case.\nIt is suggested in the court below that it cannot now be inequitable to hold the parties to the terms of the contract.\nWith respect I submit that is a misconception of the whole enactment.\nIt was to prevent the inequities that arose from insisting upon the observance of insurance contracts and conditions contained therein, that the Ontario Legislature, by 38 Vict. ch. 65, enacted, as section 2, above quoted provided and authorized the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario to appoint a judicial commission to frame just and reasonable conditions to which insurers should be restricted, saving the right to add thereto others liable to be held void if found by court or judge to be not reasonable or just.\nThe commission appointed pursuant to that statute reported the statutory conditions which have remained substantially the same in Ontario ever since.\nThis enactment of the Ontario Legislature and those statutory conditions have been found most beneficial and have been copied in the western provinces as appears by the ordinance referred to and dealt with at the time of the trial herein and in appeal.\nThey met a then existent condition of things of which the present case and the contentions set up herein remind those who can recall that far off time; just as if old familiar faces had come up for judgment.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario in the case of Robins v. The Victoria Mutual Ins. Co.[4], in 1881, fully considered this enactment relative to proofs of loss, and applied same in a way that has been followed ever since where such or the like enactment has prevailed. I do not think, even if we have the power to overrule such a jurisprudence of such long standing, we should depart therefrom for any light reason.\nIt rendered the insurance business in Ontario more respectable. It should be acted upon just as it has hitherto been acted upon, and applied to prevent wrong and injustice from being perpetrated in the name of contract.\nIt is not by any means the only piece of modern legislation that has had to be enacted and resorted to in order to avoid the unjust forfeiture of men's equitable rights by the condition named in the bond.\nInstances of such like legislation relative to contracts both in England and in this country, were referred to in said case, and other cases in which the subject was discussed.\nThe relief we are entitled, and I think, bound, to give is to hold that it would be inequitable to permit the respondents to set up this condition as a defence after accepting, without objection, an imperfect compliance with the conditions, and adjusting the loss upon a basis that relieved other co-insurers from a part of their obligation, on the supposition that this company was bound by and agreeing to the adjustment made, and after receiving, as I infer, from appellants in another form the very information respecting which they are assuming to be aggrieved herein by appellants omitting to give.\nI think if need be the relief must be applied and hence it is unnecessary to pursue the question of whether or not there has in fact been an omission.\nThe ground for relief being, to my mind, clear, I prefer not to discuss and pass an opinion upon the other questions raised anent belief.\nIt is undesirable that expressions, however carefully framed, should be quoted to justify any possibly intentional omission on other cases that may arise.\nI do not infer such was at all the character of the omission in this case.\nAnd I should be loath to take away indirectly the right of insurers to insist in a straightforward manner on a full compliance with the conditions where deemed necessary.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the courts below, and judgment be entered for the amount of the claim as settled by the adjuster, and interest.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondent company resists the appellants' claim on three distinct grounds.\nThe first ground is that the policy never went into operation. This objection rests upon a term of the application expressed in these words:\nIf the premium is not paid as herein agreed this insurance shall be held void until such settlement is made.\nThis term, it is contended, must be treated as incorporated in the policy as a condition of the insurance contract; the contention being based upon the second of the \"statutory conditions\" which reads as follows:\nAfter application for insurance, it shall be deemed that any policy sent to the assured is intended to be in accordance with the terms of the application, unless the company points out in writing the particulars wherein the policy differs from the application.\nI do not think it is important to determine whether (if the rights of the parties were to be ascertained from a construction of the words of the application and the policy) this clause would have the effect of constituting the stipulation in question a part of the company's deed just as if it had appeared in the policy in so many words. Whether, on the construction of those documents, it ought or ought not to be regarded in that light I think the company is disabled from relying upon it. The stipulation appears, no doubt, to the lawyer's mind obscurely expressed and it cannot be denied that it lacks precision. I think, however, there is not much difficulty in penetrating to the intention beneath. The application contains an offer by Bell Bros. to enter into a contract with the company by which in consideration of a specified premium the company is to insure certain buildings against fire for the period of one year. No time is named for the payment of the premium; but in the absence of any provision upon the point I can entertain no doubt that the application must be taken to propose that the payment of the premium and the delivery of the policy shall be contemporaneous. The provision we have to consider is doubtless inserted to make it clear, and does, I think, make it clear, that should the premium not be paid at or before the delivery of the policy, the contract expressed in the application and the policy, notwithstanding the delivery of the latter, is not to go into operation until there has been payment or the equivalent of payment. In layman's phrase the \"insurance is to be void until,\" etc., means, I think, that the contract of insurance is not to arise until the event contemplated happens; and so, although it is not material, I should think in laymen's phrase, \"until such settlement is made\" when used with reference to the contingency of the payment of a sum certain means until payment or the equivalent of payment.\nIn my view, the company cannot take advantage of this stipulation whether it be regarded as a term of the policy or not. If it is not a term of the policy then it is a condition, wholly ineffective at law, but in the absence of other circumstances enforceable in equity, to which the delivery of the policy is subject. If it became a term of the policy then any defence which might be based upon it would have been as effective in the one jurisdiction as in the other. In either view it does not afford a defence for the company; because, in my opinion, there is ample evidence of an enforceable agreement by the company that it should not be relied upon. The stipulation, as I have observed, makes the payment of the premium a condition of any contract arising between the parties. Therefore, under the application and policy standing alone no obligation arose in the absence of payment or its equivalent either on the one hand to indemnify against loss or on the other to pay for such indemnity. But the correspondence demonstrates the existence of an understanding between the parties that Bell Bros. were to be under an obligation to pay \u2014 involving, of course, a correlative obligation upon the company to insure. I do not think it necessary to go through the letters in detail. They seem to me to be only compatible with the hypothesis that for a perfectly good consideration (an undertaking on the part of Bell Bros. to pay the premium) the company had waived benefit of this stipulation.\nThis view accords with what the circumstances indicate to have been the intention of the parties. The policy was a renewal of an existing contract of insurance and it is quite improbable that it was in the contemplation of the parties that the property should be uninsured during the period for which credit was given to the insured.\nThe second objection is that the statutory condition requiring notice of the loss was not observed. The recent decision of this court in Prairie City Oil Co. v. Standard Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[5], exempts us from the necessity of considering whether such a non-compliance with the conditions of the policy can be cured under the provisions of the statute. The enactment according to that decision applies to \"notice of loss\" wherever it applies to \"proofs of loss.\" Such being the effect of the statute; \u2014 Is the failure to give notice attributable, in the circumstances of this case, to \"accident or mistake\"? The evidence shews, I think, that it may properly be ascribed to a mistake on the part of the insured. The facts are that the agent through whom the insurance had been effected informed one of the appellants the morning after the fire occurred that he had forwarded notice of it to the head office of the company. I think the proper inference is that the appellants assumed this to be a sufficient compliance with the conditions of the policy either as having been done on their behalf or as being within the terms of the conditions. It is true the appellants were not asked to say whether they had acted under such a mistake, but I think the point was not really in dispute at the trial; and, since it is quite clear that the appellants never entertained the idea of allowing their claim to lapse, formal notice would unquestionably have been given had they thought it necessary.\nThe third objection is that the proofs of loss are defective as not containing a statement of the appellants' belief respecting the origin of the fire. The declaration contained a statement that the origin of the fire was unknown. The member of the appellant firm who made the declaration (on his examination for discovery) stated his belief to be that the fire had originated in an explosion of gas in the cellar furnace. It is said that this belief ought also to have been set forth in the declaration. I agree that a strict reading of the condition relied upon would require this, and I am not disposed to give any support to the suggestion that strict compliance with this condition might not be most material or that failure to state a belief actually held might not be a most substantial non-compliance with the terms of the contract. In this case, however, the non-compliance was, I think, not the fault of the appellants and the respondents have suffered no disadvantage by reason of it. The adjuster acting for this company prepared the declaration and it appears from his report that at that time or not far from that time he had become possessed of the conjecture that the fire originated as Bell thought it did. I have no doubt that Bell's failure to mention his belief in the declaration was due to the circumstance that the agent who filled in the form and presented it to him for signature treated the question as a question not of belief, but of fact. The form itself would convey the same impression. I think most people having this document presented to them would not unreasonably assume that what was required was a statement of facts bearing upon the origin of the fire. The \"belief\" of the declarant was probably nothing more than a conviction based upon the circumstance that he could find no other explanation of the occurrence. The facts bearing upon this point \u2014 the construction of the furnace, the course of the fire and so on\u2014being known, to his knowledge, to the person who prepared the declaration, it would not occur to him to mention them. It is too much to expect from the appellants an appreciation of the point of view from which a belief presents itself as included within the category of matter of fact. I repeat I do not in the least doubt that the vast majority of people signing, as the appellant Bell did, at the behest of the company's agent, this declaration prepared by him, would have done so in the full assurance that they were omitting to deal with no point which the company desired to be dealt with. I am equally without doubt that the majority of people would have assumed and reasonably assumed that this form prepared by the company was not intended as a trap; but was prepared with a view to compliance with the conditions of the insurance contract and that in making the declaration required of them they would be sufficiently complying with those conditions. In the circumstances it does not seem fair as between these signatories and the company (who appear to have been apprised of everything of which the most precise observance of the condition would have informed them) that the latter should be permitted to take advantage of this default. If unfair to the appellants it would, I think, be inequitable within the meaning of the statute. Mr. Clark quite properly pressed upon us the circumstance that the premium was not paid. That fact might, I agree, conceivably affect, and affect very materially, the question whether the company was acting unfairly in setting up technical defences such as these. In this case, however, it is not suggested that the default was due to wilfulness or gross negligence and that being the case I think such delay as occurred here is not a sufficient ground for withholding the absolution which the statute sanctions.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc, affirming the judgment of Wetmore C.J., dismissing their action to recover upon a fire insurance policy, dated the 17th of September, 1907, and issued for a term of one year.\nThree defences are made to the plaintiffs' claim:\u2014\n(1) That they omitted to give notice of loss as required by statutory condition 13(a) of the policy;\n(2) That the policy was void because the premium had not been paid when the loss occurred;\n(3) That the proofs of loss were defective because the person who made them failed to disclose a belief which he entertained as to the origin of the fire.\n(1) The circumstances of this case\u2014the demand by the company for proofs of loss, their failure to object to the proofs, (furnished in good faith) on the ground that the requisite notice of loss had not been given, coupled with the fact that the company's manager objected to the loss on other grounds than for imperfect compliance with the conditions as to proofs, the adjustment with which they subsequently proceeded, the fact that they had prompt notice from their own agent of the loss and could have suffered no prejudice from the omission of the insured also to notify them, and the fact that the agent of the company informed George Bell, one of the insured, that he had so notified the company, from which Bell's evidence warrants the inference that he concluded that personal notice from himself was not required \u2014 bring it on this point within the decision of this court in Prairie City Oil Co. v. Standard Mutual Fire Ins, Co.[6]. Section 2 of the ordinance of the North-West Territories, 1903 (1st Sess.), chapter 16, corresponds with section 2 of chapter 87 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1902, dealt with in that case. The insured certainly gave notice of the loss when they sent in their proofs. The statute enables the court to relieve them in respect of default in delivery within the prescribed time as well as against forfeiture for insufficiency in the proofs. Robins v. Victoria Mutual Ins. Co.[7], at pages 440-1, 453-4.\nAlthough they did not plead it, the plaintiffs invoked the aid of the statute at the trial. The foregoing facts were all before the learned Chief Justice and upon them he was urged to apply the statute in their favour. He refused to excuse their failure to give notice of loss, not because in his opinion the statute was inapplicable to a case of defective compliance with the statutory condition as to notice, but because he regarded the present case as one, not of imperfect compliance with the condition, but of \"no compliance at all.\" The court or judge before whom the \"questions relating to the insurance\" were \"tried or inquired into,\" therefore, had this issue before him. He dealt with it, refusing to give the plaintiffs the benefit of the statute because, in his opinion, the circumstances which warrant the granting of relief under it had not been made out. In that view I am, with great respect, unable to agree. The question of the plaintiffs' right to relief under the statute having been raised and dealt with at the trial, I see no reason why this court should not give the judgment upon it which, in its opinion, the court below should have given\u2014no necessity for, or advantage to be gained by, sending the case back in order that this question may be again canvassed in a trial court.\n(2) The court en banc, differing on this point from the trial judge, held the policy void because the insured had failed to pay the premium before the loss. When delivering the policy the company did not exact payment of the premium. Subsequently it entered into correspondence with the insured pressing for payment of it, and at their instance from time to time gave them extensions of time. On the 17th of October the insured at the company's request accepted a draft in its favour for the amount of the premium. This draft was payable on the 1st of November. It was not paid at maturity. The company, nevertheless, continued to press for payment of the full premium without extending the term of the insurance beyond the 17th September, 1908. The two last letters in the correspondence prior to the loss were as follows:\nSintaluta, Nov. 18th, 1907.\nThe Hudson Bay Insurance Co.,\nMoose Jaw.\nDear Sirs,\u2014Yours of the 16th to hand. We regret being unable to meet the premium on the insurance before now, but money has been very scarce, but we will do our best to remit you a cheque on the 25th of this month. We are sorry we have not had it before, but your agent said it would be all right if we paid it as soon as possible, which we will do, but we think the 25th would be as soon as we can promise it. Yours truly,\nBell Bros.\nC.E.B. Nov. 20th, 1907.\nK.M.\nMessrs. Bell Bros.,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nRe Policy No. 1024, self.\nGrentlemen,\u2014We are in receipt of your letter of the 18th inst., and note what you say re payment of your draft in connection with premium on the above policy. If you cannot pay the full amount at this time we would be glad to receive a payment on account and trust that same will have your attention.\nThe policy has been outstanding for two months and we trust that you will let us have a remittance on account and the balance on the 25th of the month, as stated in your letter.\nYours truly,\nHudson Bay Insurance Co., Ltd.,\nManager.\nThe loss occurred about seven o'clock in the evening of the 25th of November.\nThe defendants rely upon a clause of the plaintiff's application which reads:\nIf the premium is not paid as herein agreed this insurance shall be held void until such settlement is made.\nThe application contains no agreement as to the time at which the premium is to be paid. The quoted condition can apply only to a policy upon which the premium is payable in advance. Where the policy issues on a credit basis of whatever duration, and whether definite or indefinite, the risk must attach from the date of issue. In that event the company is protected against having to carry the risk longer than it desires without having received the premium by the provision in the policy enabling it at any time to cancel the insurance. Having regard to the implication from the provisions of the policy for termination of the risk, \"if on the cash plan,\" or \"if for cash,\" that the company did some business on other than a cash basis, and to the intention of the parties as evidenced by the delivery of the policy without exacting payment of the premium and the subsequent negotiations in regard to payment of it at a later date, I entertain little doubt that this policy issued, not on a cash basis, but on a credit basis. The fact that the company throughout asked for payment of the full year's premium, to which it would be entitled only on the assumption that the risk attached from the date of the policy, affords strong confirmation of this view. If the policy issued on a credit basis the condition cited from the application did not apply; the risk attached; and non-payment of the premium is not a defence to the plaintiffs' claim.\nBut if the policy should be held to have issued in the first instance on a cash basis, and if the condition in the application on which the respondents rely applied to the risk, the correspondence as a whole, in my opinion, sufficiently establishes a waiver of it by the company. It was not \"a condition of the policy\" and, therefore, might be waived by implication notwithstanding the provisions of condition No. 20. The taking of the draft of the insured for the full year's premium had the effect of causing the risk to attach (if it had not already attached) at all events during the currency of the draft. The condition in the application was a single condition. Once the risk attached under the policy it ceased to be effective and would not revive without an express agreement by the parties that it should revive. There is no evidence of any such agreement and it should not be inferred.\nMoreover, the policy contains nothing which incorporates the provisions of the application. The incorporating clause contained in the application itself has no reference to the proviso or condition, with which we have been dealing, against the risk attaching until payment of premium. In my opinion when the loss occurred the policy was not subject to this term whether it issued on a cash, or on a credit basis.\nFor these reasons I think that non-payment of the premium by the insured is not available as a defence to the company.\n(3) The learned trial judge found that George R. Bell, who was a member of the plaintiff firm and as such executed their proofs of loss, believed at that time that the fire was caused by an explosion in the furnace. Bell himself said he was satisfied immediately after the fire that \"\"it was owing to the dusty coal that the furnace exploded\" \u2014 that \"in my own mind I was quite positive.\" This finding I think cannot be impugned.\nThe policy, by clause (c) of the 13th condition, required the assured to furnish to the company\na statutory declaration declaring * * * (2) when and how the fire originated so far as the declarant knows or believes.\nThe form of proof furnished by the company to the insured after the fire, which he was asked to fill up and sign, contained the following paragraph:\nA fire occurred on the day of , 19 , about the hour of o'clock M., by which the property described by said policy and situate as therein named was destroyed or damaged as hereinafter set forth in detail, said fire originating as follows:\nThe agent of the company filled this in with the date and hour and at the end of the paragraph inserted the words \"origin unknown\" and George R. Bell signed and declared to it. He was probably misled by this form. But, although he gave evidence at the trial, he did not say that this was the case. An estoppel is, therefore, not established. A provision in the proofs of loss precludes the setting up of a waiver. I incline, however, to the view that there was in this respect \"an imperfect compliance\" with conditions as to proof. It does not appear that the company has been in any way prejudiced by Bell's failure to state his belief as to the origin of the fire. The omission was almost certainly due to accident or mistake. Having regard to the facts mentioned in connection with the defence as to failure to give notice of loss, the plaintiffs are, in my opinion, entitled to relief in respect of this omission also under section 2 of the ordinance, N.W.T., 1903 (1st sess.), ch. 16.\nIt further appears that, with full knowledge that notice of loss had not been given by the insured and that their premium had not been paid, the defendants proceeded to adjust with the insured the amount of the loss and with the other companies interested the proportion of it which each should bear. This adjustment was, of course, gone on with on the footing that the defendants' policy was in force. It does not appear that the insured took part in the apportionment between the companies. But on the strength of this adjustment and apportionment, as the defendants must have known and intended that they should, the plaintiffs accepted from the other companies interested cheques for smaller sums than they would have been obliged to pay if the defendants were not liable to share the loss. Up to this time the defendants had not raised any question as to their liability to pay under their policy. Their whole conduct was consistent only with such liability. It is not clear whether the plaintiffs have so dealt with the other companies interested as to have released them from further liability. But that their position in regard to these companies has been materially and seriously altered by what has taken place scarcely admits of doubt. These facts would probably suffice to establish an estoppel precluding the defendants from now setting up that they were not liable under their policy because of the plaintiffs' failure either to pay their premium or to give notice of loss. Mutchmor v. Waterloo Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[8], at page 612. But this point it is unnecessary to determine.\nFor the foregoing reasons I would, with respect, allow this appeal.\nThe plaintiffs claim to be entitled to be relieved from the provision of the defendants' policy that, in the event of loss, the company shall not be liable for an amount greater than two-thirds of the actual cash value of the property covered by the policy at the time of loss. This provision and that dealing with the apportionment of such two-thirds' value between the insurers and co-insurers is contained in the body of the policy. The policy itself restricts the liability\nas hereinafter provided to an amount not exceeding $2,000.\nThe contention of the plaintiffs is that the co-insurance clause is a variation of the conditions and is, therefore, not binding because not printed in ink different in colour from that in which the rest of the policy is printed, as is required in the case of variation of any of the statutory conditions. This objection cannot prevail. The insurance is in effect an insurance to the extent of two-thirds of the cash value of the property not exceeding $2,000. The clause making the owner a co-insurer to the extent of one-third of the value of his property is in no sense a variation of the statutory conditions and is not subject to the provisions of the statute as to variation of such conditions. The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for the sum of $1,727.54, the proportion of the loss to be borne by the defendants according to the adjustment, with interest from the date at which this amount was payable according to the terms of the policy. They are also entitled to their costs of this litigation throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Allan, Gordon, Bryant & Gordon.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Knowles & Hare.\n[1] 3 Sask.

VII. ch. 71 (D.), does not confer powers upon the Commissioners of the Transcontinental Railway in respect to the inspection and valuation of lands required for the purposes of the \"Eastern Division\" of the railway; consequently, a petition of right will not lie for the recovery of remuneration for services of that nature.\nJudgment appealed from (13 Ex. C.R. 155) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] on the argument of points of law before trial by which the suppliant's petition of right was dismissed with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nM. G. Macneil, for the appellant.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court[2] giving effect to the Crown's demurrer to the suppliant's petition of right, and dismissing the petition.\nThe petition was brought by certain valuators employed by the Commissioners of the National Transcontinental Railway to inspect and value lands and properties which the located line of the eastern division of the National Transcontinental Railway would cross through the City of St. Boniface, Manitoba, and to report on the same giving a separate valuation for each piece of land so to be crossed.\nThe determination of the rights of the suppliant to maintain the petition depends upon the powers vested in the Railway Commissioners appointed to construct and operate such eastern division of the railway.\nIf these commissioners are vested with powers over the damages for the lands located for the railway or over their settlement or adjudication, then, I think it obvious that there would be implied a power on their part to appoint valuators to report upon the proper compensation to be paid for each piece of land taken by them. It is obvious the commissioners could not do such work themselves over the thousand and more miles covered by the eastern division they were appointed to construct and operate. They would necessarily have to employ others to do the work; and, having done so, the work being within their powers, such persons would be entitled to either the agreed compensation, or, in the absence of such agreement, what would be fair and reasonable. As there is no allegation in the petition of any special authority having been given by the Govern- ment to the commissioners to do or have this work of valuation done, their powers to do so must be sought and found in the agreement for the construction of the eastern division, ratified and confirmed by 3 Edw. VII. ch. 71, or in that statute itself.\nTurning first to the agreement we find the 5th and 8th paragraphs read as follows:\n(5) The said eastern division shall be constructed by, and at the expense of, the Government, upon such location and according to such plans and specifications as it shall determine, having due regard to directness, easy gradients and favourable curves.\n(8) The construction of the said eastern division shall be commenced so soon as the Government has made the surveys and plans and determined upon the location thereof, and' shall be completed with all reasonable dispatch.\nThen the 9th section of the Act reads:\nThe construction of the eastern division and the operation thereof, until completed and leased to the company pursuant to the provisions of the agreement, shall be under the charge and control of three commissioners, to be appointed by the Governor in Council, who shall hold office during pleasure, and who, and whose successors in office, shall be a body corporate under the name of \"The (Commissioners of the Transcontinental Railway\" and are hereinafter called \"The Commissioners.\"\nSection 13 relates to the expropriation of lands and reads as follows:\nThe commissioners may enter upon and take possession of any lands required for the purposes of the eastern division, and they shall lay off such lands by metes and bounds, and deposit of record a description and plan thereof in the office for the registry of deeds, or the land titles office for the county or registration district in which such lands respectively are situate; and such deposit shall act as a dedication to the public of such lands, which shall thereupon be vested in the Crown, saving always the lawful claim to compensation of any person interested therein.\nThe scheme of the Act appears to be that construction shall be commenced so soon as the Government has made the surveys and plans and determined upon the location of the line, and not before.\nBut section 13 gives the commissioners special powers with respect to entering upon and taking possession of \"any lands required for the purposes of the eastern division\" and laying them off by metes and bounds, and depositing plans which, when deposited, are to operate as a dedication of the lands to the public, and to vest the same in the Crown. All the powers necessary or reasonably incidental to the proper exercise of these statutory directions to the commissioners are within their jurisdiction. But it will be noticed the question of \"the compensation\" to which any one interested in the lands taken may claim or be entitled to is specially reserved. Nothing whatever is said as to the assessment or determination of the compensation by the commissioners or by any one appointed by them. The words used are\nsaving always the lawful claim to compensation of any person interested therein.\nNow, of course, the Crown could authorize the commissioners, or any one else, to adjust or settle these damages with the parties interested. It is not alleged or suggested the Crown did so, and the only question which appears to me to be open in the case before us is whether or not the statutory powers given the commissioners necessarily involve a power to value the lands taken for the located road.\nSection 18 clearly relates, in my judgment, only to the work of constructing the eastern division by tender and contract as provided for in the previous sections 16 and 17. The chief engineer would have nothing whatever to do with the certifying to any such work as that of valuing of lands taken. The conclusion I have reached, however, is for the reasons stated, that the powers of the commissioners under the statute do not embrace the valuation of any lands within the located line of the eastern division of the Transcontinental Railway and that, consequently and unless and until special power for them to undertake such work was given to them by the Governor in Council, their action in respect to the same would be ultra vires.\nThis petition was one brought to recover the charges of the petitioner with respect to the valuation of the located line through the City of St. Boniface. That is the construction I put upon the language of the second paragraph of the petition, and it is the one adopted and put forward by the petitioner's counsel at bar.\nThe individuals damnified by their lands having been taken or injured have their lawful claims to compensation specially reserved to them, and they can either settle amicably with the Government or its authorized agent or enforce their rights in court.\nNo special authority having been given to the commissioners, the valuation of the lands taken is not covered by the power to construct and operate the road.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014If we interpret this petition as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council directed that in the case of McLean v. The King[3] should be, a trial must be had of the facts.\nInstead of construing, as of old, the pleading most strongly against the pleader, that court, on appeal, directed, though the case is unreported, that, if upon any reasonable construction of the petition, a cause of action could be proved, then the suppliant would be entitled to succeed on the demurrer. This petition alleges, if so treated, enough to induce a trial of the facts.\nIt is not necessary for the suppliant or plaintiff in any case to set up more than to shew a cause of action.\nIf there happens to be, as it is said exists here, a condition that liability to pay, for that sued for, must be measured by what someone else says, certified in a particular manner, then that is matter of defence of which the defendant may or may not avail himself.\nIn this case it may be a matter of inference from the nature of the services performed and the nature of the statutory powers by virtue of which the work in respect of which recovery is sought was directed, that the certificate of the commission, or some officer connected therewith, necessarily must be produced as evidence before the suppliant can succeed.\nIt does not occur to me that such a question necessarily arises upon demurrer. And it does not occur to me so absolutely clear as suggested, that the statute permits no payment for such a claim as sued for herein unless certified. Clearly contractors are, by section 18 of the Act, so tied down, but\u2014Is the appellant a contractor within the meaning of that section?\nAs the learned judge of the Exchequer Court says, in his opinion judgment, and the parties admit here, the argument below travelled beyond what strictly was raised by the demurrer and the appellant seems desirous of a decision as if this point relative to a certificate of the commission being needed had been raised on the demurrer, perhaps, in view of the peculiar nature of the case and the course it has run, it may be thought no great harm could arise by expressing an opinion.\nIt would be, I submit a bad precedent and an unsatisfactory way of disposing of \"a point in the case, when its whole story having been unrolled, it might appear in quite a different light.\nOn the question raised by the learned judge as to his jurisdiction, I cannot agree in his conclusion; and an order dismissing the petition on that ground is, I submit, not well founded.\nNo one ventured to suggest this commission was, in law, less representative of the Crown, as a statutory agent or governmental device for constructing a railway, than was that under and by means of which the Intercolonial .Railway was constructed.\nSuch cases as arose in the course of the existence of the Intercolonial Railway Commission raising analogous points, or giving opportunity therefor, in this court, do not seem to have suggested the difficulty found herein.\nIt seems to me this court, in disposing of such cases assumed, as of course, that a petition of right founded on some obligation arising in the execution of said work would, as a matter of course, be triable in the Exchequer Court.\nIndeed, I should not be at all surprised if it could be demonstrated, as a matter of fact, that the experience derived from the execution of that work was a factor in leading to the founding of the court.\nSo far as I can see the purposes of each commission are of an identical character. They differ in details of machinery furnished in the creating statute for the execution of the work. They differ also in this, that the ultimate destiny of that constructed under and by virtue of such respective bodies is somewhat different.\nBut in the chief feature of each the purpose to be attained and mode of its attainment are almost identical.\nEach was designed for the construction of a work to become a property of the Crown. In the early case the property was to be operated by the Crown. In this latter case it is to be leased by the Crown to a railway corporation. The basis for rental is to be the cost of construction. In that cost such items as that here in question are included. To preserve evidence of and determine disputes relative thereto is part of the commission's duty. Their duty in the first place is to pass upon the expenditure for certain parts of the work \u2014 but not all.\nThe members of the commission are in this case, as were those in that other, removable by the Crown.\nThere does not seem to me to be in the statute aught that necessarily constitutes this commission the proper body to sue.\nIndeed, such restrictions as appear upon the right to receive payment on contracts, without being certified to or approved of by this body, seem repugnant to the conception of the commission ever having been intended to be subject to action for aught done in the discharge of its duty.\nIt seems almost inconceivable that these functions of defendant, of superintendent or of judge, and of owner and paymaster, should be all intentionally vested in the same body. So far as the statute clearly expresses the extent of duty relative to passing upon the execution of work, it seems confined to the claim of the contractors with the Government.\nI say nothing of the liability of the commission for a departure from its duty. That might give rise to questions of another nature relative to which I refrain from passing opinion.\nIt seems to me we must observe the rule laid down by Lord Campbell and later adopted by Lord Blackburn in the Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[4], at page 118, and applied since in reaching a conclusion upon questions of a cognate character relative to the liability of corporate bodies created in like cases.\nThe expression of that learned judge, speaking, of course, relatively to liability, in only one phase of such subject, was that it must be determined upon a true interpretation of the statute under which the body is created.\nI cannot feel much doubt in regard to the liability of this commission.\nIt was not empowered to own, to control or lease this road. It was not even empowered to let the contracts for its construction.\nIt was created to meet the exigencies of a particular enterprise, of a vast and complicated character, for and in respect of specific purposes, relative thereto, and when its functions in these regards had been fulfilled its operative existence is to cease.\nIts general character is that of being for these limited purposes the agent of the Crown.\nSince I hold these views, it seems I must conclude that this appeal must be allowed with costs, and appellant be given a chance to have his case tried.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Elliott, Macneil & Deacon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Vaughan-Rhys (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1911: February 23; 1911: May 15.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nTimber license\u2014Crown lands in British Columbia\u2014Real estate\u2014Personalty\u2014Contract\u2014Sale\u2014Exchange \u2014 Consideration \u2014 Payment in joint stock shares\u2014Vendor's lien\u2014Evidence\u2014Onus of proof\u2014 Pleading and practice.\nA sale of rights under licenses to cut timber on provincial Crown lands in British Columbia is a contract for the sale of interests in real estate, and the timber berths are subject to a vendor's lien for the unpaid purchase money.\nThe doctrine of vendor's lien for unpaid purchase-money is applicable to every sale of personal property over which a court of equity assumes jurisdiction. In re Stucley ((1906) 1 Ch. 67) followed.\nIn order to protect himself against the enforcement of a vendor's lien, a defendant relying on the equitable defence of purchase for value without notice is bound to allege in his pleadings and to prove that he became purchaser of the property in question for valuable consideration and without notice of the lien. In re Nisbett and Potts' Contract ([1905] 1 Ch. 391; [1906] 1 Ch. 38-6), followed. Whitehorn Brothers v. Davison ([1911] 1 K.B. 463), distinguished.\n(Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused on the 29th of July, 1911.)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia reversing the decision of Morrison J., at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs. The action was brought against the present appellant and two other defendants for the declaration and enforcement of a vendor's lien upon certain timber limits, held under licenses from the Government of British Columbia, which had been transferred to the said appellant by the other defendants.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. and Coutl\u00e9e K.C. for the appellant.\nTravers Lewis K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. agreed in the opinion stated by Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent alleges in his amended statement of claim, and the appellant's pleading admits that he was at all the times in question herein the lawful holder of timber licenses issued by the Province of British Columbia on the 24th day of September, 1907.\nHe alleges a sale thereof to one Clarry and claims to be entitled to enforce his vendor's lien in respect of $2,500, balance of the purchase-money.\nThe agreement of sale under which the respondent claims is peculiar in this, that it sets out at first a consideration of $5,000 and then proceeds to provide conditionally that shares of the value of $2,500 in a proposed corporation to be created should be given in addition to the said sum of $5,000.\nIt provides that the amount of said shares should abate proportionally to any deficiency found as the result of cruising to exist in the specified quantity of timber.\nA question not free from doubt is raised of whether or not here can exist a vendor's lien in respect of an exchange of land for shares of unascertained value in a concern to be created in the future.\nThe phraseology of the provision is ambiguous. It may be read as a bargain that the shares must be of the value of $2,500, or that the contemplated price of the land sold is $5,000 plus $2,500 for which the shares are to be accepted in lieu of the $2,500 balance.\nTo solve ambiguity in a document it is competent to look at the acts of the parties immediately before and after the conclusion of the bargain to ascertain its meaning.\nSurrounding circumstances may be considered to remove ambiguity. The gist of the question to be determined is whether or not there was an intention to abandon any claim to a vendor's lien or to form a contract inconsistent with its presumed existence.\nThe proposal was made by letter written on the 9th of November, 1907, by the respondent from Vancouver, to Clarry, at Toronto, and a deed of conveyance carrying out in part the sale was made on the 21st of November,. 1907, by Chandler, of Vancouver, who held the property in trust for the respondent. If we, make allowance for. the distance the parties were apart,, the deed may be almost taken as immediately following the offer, and, in truth, the final and formal expression of the concluded bargain.\nIt certainly must have been executed before the cruising could have taken place and before, the suggested, alternative of delivering shares instead of paying money was determined. That deed expressed the consideration to be $7,500.\nReading both documents can there be a shadow of doubt that such was held by the parties to be the actual price of the property, but with an added term that if shares were delivered within a given or reasonable time they must be accepted in lieu of $2,500 which, prim\u00e0 facie, according to the terms of the deed, was to be cash.\nThe fact that one Myers, first proposed to be the person, on whose report the matter was, finally, to be dependent was substituted by one Jarvis shews, at least, that some things transpired between the parties which renders it unsafe to rely too much upon the exact terms of the written offer to the exclusion of the deed which must, I submit, be taken as the final expression of the consensus of the parties.\nAnd this more especially so when we find, as we do, that it was understood a deed was to be executed and delivered as an escrow as a means of carrying out the understanding of the parties and this deed is an instrument pursuant to the final decision or expression of the will of the parties.\nThen we have the following statement in the fourth paragraph of the respondent's statement of claim:\nAt the request of the plaintiff and in accordance with the directions of the defendant Clarry, the said E. R,. Chandler executed a proper assignment of the said timber licenses to the defendant, Clarry, and the same were, on or about the 21st day of November, 1907, delivered to. the defendant, Clarry, who, thereupon, paid the plaintiff the sum of $5,000, but the balance of the purchase price, namely, $2,500, to be paid by the delivery of the said twenty-five shares in the said B.C. Pressed Brick Company, was not paid to the plaintiff.\nThis is admitted in the appellant's defence and thus there seems to be an end to any dispute of the possible meaning I have ventured to put on the original offer or that coupled with the deed. Unless we are to fritter away justice by over-refinement, I do not think we should allow the appellant to withdraw from the position this admission puts him in.\nAll this is followed by a suit against Clarry to enforce payment of the balance of $2,500, and judgment for the plaintiff therefor, on the 29th of March, 1909.\nThe deed under which the appellant claims is dated the 2nd of April, 1909, and from the said Clarry to him. I will, presently, deal with its peculiarities.\nI merely note the date and, for the present, pass on to consider its relation to this branch of the case I have been and am dealing with.\nNow, can a man, resting upon a bargain made in face of the concurrence of the parties, thus finally adjudicated between them, claim to put any other interpretation upon the meaning of their bargain than all these things imply?\nWhat right has he to say it was not for cash, but on other terms than thus adjudged before his intervention?\nIt is further said, however, that the subject-matter of the sale was such that a vendor's lien could not, in law, exist. In that aspect, whether a volunteer or not, the appellant is quite within his right in making such a contention.\nFor no matter how weak his right or title may be he is attacked by virtue of the alleged legal existence of a lien which is not the creation of the will of the parties. It is a thing that may be waived by a vendor but is given quite independently of his will in any other sense than as to a question of intention to waive it. It can usually only thus arise without intention in respect of a transaction entirely relative to real estate.\nLiens on chattels (having no relation to realty) sold are gone the moment possession has changed. Other liens may arise from the express or implied intention of the parties.\nIn regard to real estate dealings a vendor's lien arises in favour of the vendor independently of such considerations.\nCan this sale of a license to cut timber mean anything but a sale of real property?\nIn principle it seems clear. In some cases the bargain may be relative to the price of timber when cut and, hence, have no relation to the land. I think confusion apt to arise, and has in some cases arisen, out of a non-observance of this distinction.\nI can see no room here for doubt or difficulty.\nI find, moreover, that, in Mitchell v. McGaffey[1], Chancellor Blake, as far back as 1858, decided a lien arose out of such a transaction as a sale of the right to cut timber.\nHis test there, put in the first sentence of a well-reasoned judgment, was, could specific performance be decreed of such a bargain, and his deduction from the authorities that it could, and other consequences follow, seem to me unanswerable.\nThis case was not cited to us. Scott v. Benedict[2], decided in this court, and of which only a note is reported in our reports, was cited.\nTracing its history back to 5 Ontario Reports, at page 1, we find there a divided court and those holding no lien existed do not rely upon any such doctrine as suggested here, but upon the peculiar circumstances of that case. No doubt the same reasons led to the decision noted in the reports of this court[3]. Other cases cited have equally no bearing upon this point.\nNor can I find anything in the distinction sought to be made out of these licenses by the Crown being renewable from year to year for twenty-one years. The presumption is in favour of renewal and, if not cancelled, that the right continues. There is no evidence of interruption and, hence, the lien attaches to the right subject to the liability to such interruption. I conclude that, on principle, a lien may arise upon a sale of such an interest as now in question.\nThis brings me to the defence set up of a purchase for value in good faith and without notice.\nThere is no evidence given to support it. The respondent's pleading certainly does not; and the deed to the appellant, alleged to have been put in by the respondent, does not. It refers to some previous indenture of the month of February. What that is, I have no knowledge of. I tried, in argument, to find out. It was said to be clear, on the reading of the pleadings. Now, in the pleadings, we have the following statement of the appellant's defence:\n9. The said defendant says that, on the 2nd of April, 1909, he bought and received a transfer of all the interest of defendant, Clarry, in the said timber-licenses and paid valuable consideration therefor, and the said defendant claims to be the owner of the said timber licenses.\nWe have no reference to the indenture of February which that of April purports to assign or to be made in pursuance of. I can find nothing in the record to define or make clear what that of February may be.\nThe respondent's pleadings merely charge the defendant Clarry had sold or pretended to have sold to the appellant and sought to get his deed registered.\nHow that renders this curious deed appellant has put in evidence any more definite I am unable to say. It shews what an intangible thing the respondent has been contending against, indeed a mere cloud on his Tight.\nAll these references to that matter I should have put aside but for one thing, and that is the claim the appellant's counsel makes to proof furnished by admission in this deed of payment for some property the deed relates to. It may be for that in question or something else.\nIt seems to me, therefore, this defence fails.\nAgain, it was suggested in argument, that, inasmuch as the respondent's deed, on its face, shews an acknowledgment of the receipt of consideration, though proven to be untrue, the respondent is estopped from shewing that.\nThere is no evidence appellant ever saw this deed or was led to rely upon it.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the fair inference from the facts in evidence is that the sale as finally concluded was a sale for $7,500 cash. That being the case it is not necessary to consider whether a lien or charge would arise in favour of the vendor as security for the performance by the vendee of an agreement to deliver shares in a company to be formed as part of the consideration for the purchase where the subject-matter and circumstances of the sale justify the presumption that the expectation of all parties was that the property sold should be available for sale in the hands of the vendee. We were furnished by counsel with a list of authorities upon the point, but it is desirable, I think, to refrain from expressing any opinion upon it until a case arises requiring the determination of it. Mr. Nesbitt based the appeal upon two grounds; the first being that the subjects of the sale in question were not land; and that a vendor's lien attaches to that description of property only. It is not, I should think, seriously open to doubt that the interests created by the instruments transferred from the vendor to the purchaser were interests in land. But the immediate point is, quite irrespectively of that, settled by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re Stucley[4]. The principle of that decision is stated thus by the present Master of the Rolls, then Cozens-Hardy L.J., at pages 83 and 84:\nBut it has been argued that a vendor's lien is limited to land, and does not extend to personal estate. Now, there is the distinct authority of the Court of Appeal, in Davies v. Thomas[5], to the contrary; and, that -being so, I do not think it necessary to go back to the earlier authorities, nor to discuss the principles upon which those authorities were decided. I see no reason, in principle, why the doctrine should not apply to every case of personal property in which the court of equity assumes jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the sale.\nThe point of substance in the appeal is whether the property is bound by the respondent's lien in the hands of the appellant, who says he is a purchaser for value without notice of the lien.\nOn this point I agree with the court below that, in order to avail himself of that position as against the vendor's claim, Mr. Laidlaw was bound to allege and prove that he was a purchaser for value and a purchaser for value without notice of that claim. The question of the incidence of the burden of proof in such cases has recently been before the courts in Re Nisbett and Potts' Contract[6]. The substance of the decision as affecting that question is thus stated, by Cozens-Hardy L.J., in the last mentioned report, at page 410:\nBut, what must he prove in order to claim this exemption ? He must prove that he is a purchaser for value of the legal estate without notice. If in the old days, he had simply pleaded, \"I am a purchaser for value,\" such a plea would have been demurrable; he would have had to go further and allege and prove that he was a purchaser for value without notice, and he must do the same at the present day.\nSince the argument Mr. Nesbitt has called our attention to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Whitehorn Bros. v. Davison[7]. The effect of this decision is that, where the purchaser of personal chattels (who has acquired them under a contract voidable because of fraud practised by him in the matter of the purchase) pledges or re-sells them, the seller, in order to establish his right to avoid the sale as against the pledgee or subsequent purchaser must prove that the latter has taken them with notice of the fraud or otherwise than in good faith. The reasoning upon which this decision is based has, I think, no application whatever to the question before us. Where a purchaser of chattels procures the delivery of them to him by fraud, his fraud may affect the transaction in one of two ways. If, for example, the owner has been deceived as to the identity of the person with whom he is dealing and, in fact, never intended to pass the property to. that person, then no title passes. Speaking generally in such a case the purchaser cannot pass a title to a third person; Cundy y. Lindsay[8]; Where, on the other hand, there is an intention to pass the property, but that intention has been brought about by the collateral fraud of the purchaser, then a title does pass, but it is a title voidable at the option of the seller. In such a case it is settled law that the seller may assert his right to avoid the contract against the author of the fraud, against volunteers claiming under him, or against purchasers for value acquiring otherwise than in good faith. But when the seller seeks to assert his right he must, of course, as plaintiff, make out his case, and, as against persons other than the author of the fraud, he must shew either that they were volunteers or that they were acting in bad faith. All this is beside the question upon which we have to pass. The lien of a vendor is an equitable interest in the property itself. Persons acquiring subsequent interests which come into competition with the vendor's interest can displace the latter only by shewing some superior equity. The subsequent acquisition of the legal estate, in itself, gives no superiority even when it is acquired for value. The person relying upon it must go further and prove something else before he can successfully claim to occupy a higher position than that of the vendor standing on his lien. One thing he may do is to shew that at the time he paid his purchase-money he had no notice of the existence of the lien. But, if he is relying upon his position as purchaser for value without notice he must prove that defence in its entirety.\nAnglin J. agreed with Duff J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs,\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacNeill, Bird, Macdonald & Bayfield.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smith & Woodworth.\n[1] 6 Gr. 361.\n[2] 14 Can.

By the judgment appealed from the reddition de compte was ordered and, in default of compliance with the order, the defendant was condemned to pay the plaintiff the amount of $1,000 demanded.\nHeld, that the controversy was limited to $1,000 and the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal. Bell v. Vipond (31 Can. S.C.R. 175) distinguished.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nGervais K.C. supported the motion to quash the appeal on the ground that the controversy involved in the cause affected merely the rectification of the accounts between the parties and the claim by the plaintiff for the amount of $1,000, and, consequently, that no appeal could lie under the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act\" respecting appeals from the Province of Quebec.\nSt. Jacques, for the appellant, contended that, in the circumstances of the case, an appeal would lie, and he cited Bell v. Vipond[1].\nSt. Jacques, for the appellant.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The respondent moves to quash for want of jurisdiction. This is an action to reform an account (en r\u00e9formation de compte), in which the plaintiff alleges that his interest in the sum with respect to which the new account is claimed amounts to $1,000. By the conclusions of the declaration it is prayed that the defendant should be ordered to render an account and, in default of his doing so, that he be condemned to pay the said sum of $1,000. The judgment of the court below orders an account and, in default of compliance with the order, the defendant is condemned to pay the sum of $1,000.\nOn these facts I am of opinion that the amount in controversy is the amount with respect to which the plaintiff claims an interest to have the account corrected, viz., $1,000, which sum is not within the appealable limit; and the motion to quash should be granted with costs.\nI distinguish this case from the case of Bell v. Vipond1. In that case an account was filed pursuant to the judgment of the court and, on the discussion of the account, the conclusions of the original declaration were amended and the plaintiff's demand increased to an amount exceeding $2,000. See per Taschereau J., at page 176:\nThe plaintiff, by a contestation of that account, claimed to be entitled to an amount which, though not specified, yet, by his allegations, clearly amounted to a sum exceeding two thousand dollars, withdrawing expressly the alternative conclusion of his declaration for one thousand dollars.\nThe motion is allowed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\n[1] 31 Can.

The parties to a chattel mortgage may waive the provisions of the third section of the North-West Territories Ordinance, 1898, ch. 34, in respect to the expenses of the seizure and sale of the mortgaged property. Robson v. Biggar ((1907) 1 K.B. 690), followed. Judgment appealed from (3 Alta. L.R. 166) reversed.\nWhere interest in excess of the rate of seven per cent per annum has been voluntarily paid upon the settlement of accounts stated between a bank and its debtor, the amount so paid cannot be recovered back from the bank by the payer. In respect of unsettled accounts between a bank and its debtor, charges of interest in excess of the rate limited by section 91 of the \"Bank Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 29, made in virtue of an agreement between the parties, should be reduced to the rate of seven per cent per annum upon the surcharging and falsifying of such accounts. Judgment appealed from (3 Alta. L.R. 166) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nWhere loss occurs to mortgaged property in consequence of want of reasonable care in its removal from the place of seizure to the place at which it is sold under the authority of a chattel mortgage, the proper measure of the damages recoverable by the mortgagor is the amount of depreciation in value caused by the negligent manner in which the removal was effected. In the present case, the evidence being insufficient to justify the assessment made by the trial judge, it was referred back to have the damages properly assessed. Judgment appealed from (3 Alta. L.R. 166) varied, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing, in part, the judgment of Beck J., at the trial[2].\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.C. and Walsh K.C. for the appellant.\nC. C. McCaul K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. \u2014 This appeal should be allowed as to the penalties. The cross-appeal should be dismissed. As to the rate of interest the judgment should be confirmed. The, judgment of the court below should be varied by directions that, on a reference back to assess the damages, the measure of damages to be allowed should be the depreciation in value, if any, of the horses caused by the manner in which they were driven from the ranch to the place of sale. The whole should be with costs in favour of the appellant.\nDAVIES J. \u2014 I agree that this appeal should be allowed as to the penalties and the judgment below confirmed as to the rate of interest allowed to the bank and that the cross-appeal should be dismissed. I agree with the reasoning of Duff and Anglin JJ. on these two questions of the non-liability of the appellant for the penalties prescribed by the Consolidated Or- dinance of the North-West Territories, 1898, ch. 34, and as to the right of the appellant, notwithstanding the provisions of section 91 of the \"Bank Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 29, to retain the rate of interest on the basis of voluntary payment made by the respondent to the bank, which the court appealed from allowed.\nAs to the question of damages, I am unable to find any evidence justifying the amount at which the trial judge assessed them. In exercising the power of seizure and sale under the mortgage the bank was, of course, obliged to act reasonably in the circumstances. In driving the horses from the ranch to the place of sale their duty was to take reasonable care of the animals and not to over-drive them; and, for any damages caused by such breach of duty, the appellant would, of course, be liable. The necessary evidence to justify the recovery of any such damages as those assessed by the trial judge was wanting in this case. It seemed to me to be purely guess-work. On this question of damages there should be a reference back to the court below to assess the damages and the measure of such damages should be the depreciation in value, if any, of the horses caused by their having been improperly driven from the ranch to the place of sale.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent and another owed the appellant bank, and, on the 28th of May, 1907, gave a chattel mortgage upon a large number of horses and other chattels to secure the sum of $36,233, which was the sum supposed on that date to be due from them to said bank.\nOn or about the 6th of July, 1908, the bank mana- ger at Calgary instructed by letter one Smith to take possession of the horses and cattle and employ such men as necessary to round up or hold the stock of which sales were to be made.\nThis was done under a power of sale in the mortgage.\nIt is not denied that the respondent was in default and the mortgage enforceable by this means.\nThe horses taken possession of were found some fifty or sixty miles from Calgary and undergoing medical treatment known as \"dipping\" under the supervision of the veterinary authorities for the district.\nThe horses numbered from three hundred and fifty to four hundred and there were several hundred cattle also to be taken care of.\nBefore the horses could be taken out of quarantine and got into any shape for selling advantageously some weeks elapsed.\nThere were over three hundred taken to Calgary and finally entrusted to the Alberta Stock Yards Company in that city, to be sold. They were sold there.\nAfter the sale of horses the assistant-manager of appellant at Calgary wrote the following letter to the respondent's solicitors there:\nCalgary, Alta., September 9th, 1908.\nMessrs.

C. F. PENTLAND,\nAsst.-Manager.\nWithout asking for any further explanation this suit was brought for penalties under the ordinance I am about to refer to and for damages done the horses in the course of driving them to Calgary and for an account.\nThe North-West Territories Consolidated Ordinance, 1898, ch. 34, provides for fees, etc., to be taken in respect of distress or seizure made either by landlords or under chattel mortgage. Section one deals with the former and section two deals with the latter.\nWe are only directly concerned here with section three, which enacts:\nIf any person making any distress or seizure referred to in sections 1 and 2 of this ordinance shall take or receive any other or greater costs than are set down in the said schedule, or make any charge whatsoever for any act, matter or thing mentioned in the said schedule and not really performed or done, the party aggrieved may cause the party making the said distress or seizure to be summoned before the Supreme Court of the judicial district in which the goods and chattels distrained upon or seized or some portion thereof lie and the said court may order the party making the distress or seizure to pay to the party aggrieved treble the amount of moneys taken contrary to the provisions of this ordinance and the costs of suit.\nThe schedule is as follows:\nSCHEDULE.\n1. Levying distress $1.00\n2. Man in possession, per day 1.50\n3. Appraisement, whether by one appraiser or more, two cents on the dollar on the value of goods up to $500, and one per cent on the dollar for each additional $500 or fraction thereof up to $2,000, and one-half per cent on all sums over that amount.\n4. All reasonable and necessary disbursements for advertising.\n5. Catalogue, sale, commission and delivery of goods, three per cent on the net proceeds of the goods up to $1,000 and one and one-half per cent thereafter.\nNow, it is to be observed this enactment does not deal with things outside the schedule and that does not pretend to cover the maintenance of or the removal of and fitting for sale of any such thing as stock when seized.\nThe power of seizure and sale in the mortgage is in that regard as follows:\nAnd upon and from and after taking possession of such goods and chattels it shall and may be lawful, and the mortgagee, and each or any of them, is and are hereby authorized and empowered at his or their discretion to sell the said goods and chattels or any of them, or any part thereof, at public auction or private sale on the premises hereinbefore described, or elsewhere as to them or any of them may seem meet; and from and out of the proceeds of such sale in the first place to pay and reimburse all such sums and sum of money as may then be due by virtue of these presents, and all costs and expenses (including the costs (if any) of the solicitor of the mortgagee) as may have been incurred by the mortgagee, in consequence of the default, neglect or failure of the mortgagors in payment of the said sum of money with interest thereon as above mentioned, or in conquence of such sale or removal as above mentioned, or in consequence of failing in the performance of any of the covenants or agreements herein contained, and on the mortgagors' part to be performed and kept, and in the next place to pay unto the mortgagors all such surplus as may remain after such sale and after payment of all such sum or sums of money and interest thereon as may be due by virtue of these presents at the time of such seizure and after pay- ment of the costs, charges and expenses incurred by such seizure and sale as aforesaid.\nIt seems abundantly clear that there is no substantial conflict between this and the penal enactment in section 3 and the schedule. It is true that there is room to argue that the language of the prior sections forbids any charges save and except as in the schedule, but there is no sanction annexed thereto save that in section three.\nTo my mind it is quite impossible, if we have regard to the law governing the construction and application of penal enactments, to read this one as extending to anything beyond the excessive taking of fees for the specified subjects named in the schedule.\nSection four of the ordinance used the words \"fees or costs.\"\nThe history of the legislation shews its purpose was such as to fix and limit the fees for specified services. And the enactment covers only excess thereof and acts not really performed or done, yet charged for.\nThen, again, these enactments are not of such a general character, embodying a public policy that would render a contract anticipating their operation and providing against same as between parties concerned, illegal and therefore void.\nThe general purview of the legislation demonstrates this. The penalty can only be sought by an aggrieved person. How can a free person who has specifically agreed that these provisions shall not be applicable to a contract he has entered into be an aggrieved person under said section?\nAt all events how can such a person, desiring to protect his own business and property from ruin in case a distress has to be made, not contract for any and every thing to be done outside the said schedule and its operation ?\nSuppose a distress made by or with one man only, and no feed for stock so distrained, is this one man foreshadowed in the schedule to keep the stock without feed or drink?\nIs it to be illegal for tenant or mortgagor to bargain with the distrainor for either feeding or transportation to a suitable market?\nIf not illegal after the seizure, what makes it, or can make it illegal to contract for and in anticipation thereof?\nBut the absurdity of the contention appears when we consider the case of the landlord under section number one, and the law binding such an one distraining to proper treatment of stock when seized and to hold the chattels for specified terms before he can sell.\nI should not have supposed this argument needed, but for the finding of the court below that this penal enactment leaves no room for the operation of the powers of removal and re-payment of the costs thereof even when expressly contracted for as above.\nIn my opinion such is not the law. The reasonable and necessary cost for the care and maintenance, and transportation, of the stock seized were all impliedly within the contemplation of the parties to the mortgage in question, and I think contracted for.\nSo holding, \u2014 what case is made out for adjusting a penalty? The charges under the schedule seem blended with other expenses contracted for. How can a court pass judgment without knowing if the schedule has been transgressed? What has happened and is in evidence in support of this penalty? How can we draw any inference such as cases like Dickenson v. Fletcher[3], for example, require to be drawn before penalties can be enforced?\nA statute may by its terms indicate that a mens rea is not essential to subjecting one to a penalty, but is this one of that nature?\nThe appellant has not as yet taken anything; for the respondent confessedly on this evidence was when rendered this account indebted for a balance so great that all these charges even if trebled were negligible. It is not as if the debt were wiped out and a balance clearly coming to the respondent, but for the appellant insisting on keeping it.\nThe mortgagor is suing for an account and, without waiting to see the result of that account, the court has directed an inquiry to be made to see if by any possibility there can be found some ground for inflicting this penalty. Where is there any precedent for such a proceeding?\nSo tender has the court ever been as to penalties, it has refused to aid in the discovery or grounds for inflicting them. The cases of Hunnings v. Williamson[4], and cases and principles there cited and discussed shew the attitude the courts have held and ought to hold relative to such analogous inquiries as therein treated of. How can such an inquiry be made with due regard to the observance of the principles of the law as laid down there, or what result can we reach but that such an inquiry and direction is improper ? The ordinary account and inquiry is quite proper, but it cannot be had for such a purpose or indeed efficiently conducted when hampered by such a pursuit.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nA cross-appeal has been taken relative to a claim for damages found by the learned trial judge and set aside by the court of appeal and a reference directed in respect thereof.\nI do not think Ave should interfere with this exercise of discretion in disposing of the trial judgment. The evidence does not warrant our reversing the court of appeal and restoring the trial judgment.\nAnd when we look at its mode of disposing of the future trial it is a mere matter of procedure that is involved.\nIndeed, in that regard it seems akin to the case of Union Bank of Halifax v. Dickie[5].\nI agree, however, that the measure of damages, referred to is not stated accurately.\nThe damages should be confined to and measured by the difference between the price for which the horses were sold, and what they should have been sold for, if they had been driven with due care, from the place where seized or held to Calgary.\nAs framed the judgment may permit of some other result than that of an allowance for damages caused to the horses by over-driving or an improper mode of conducting the transportation from one point to the other.\nAnd there should be added to this or striken out of the bank's claim for expenses, any expense incurred in caring for and resting them longer than might have been necessary if they had not been over-driven or improperly driven. It is the depreciation and loss (if any) solely attributable to these causes that had to be considered on the inquiry and borne by the bank.\nAnother question raised is the taking of accounts between the parties. The court of appeal has interfered, erroneously, I think, with the disposition of such matters by the learned trial judge. That might have been improved, but this judgment in appeal seems worse.\nThere is no reason for treating a bank differently from other parties.\nSo far as the parties have settled their accounts from time to time they should be bound by that settling of accounts, even if there be covered thereby an allowance for a greater rate of interest than the rate recoverable by an action at law.\nIt is quite competent for the customers of a bank to agree to pay any rate of interest named. And when they have paid what they have promised they are bound by the payment and cannot recover it back any more than in the case of any other voluntary payment.\nThere is no law enabling the recovery back.\nThe payment by way of any settlement and striking of a balance clearly understood between the parties is good both in law and morals and ought not to be disturbed.\nThe parties surely must be taken to have stated their accounts up to the date of the last mortgage.\nIt is not clear how much further settlements proceeded, but if had, as likely, at each renewal of notes or otherwise, they must be respected even if including charges for interest beyond seven per cent per annum. In the absence of definite evidence in this last regard, I would have the taking of accounts to begin with 28th of May, 1907, accompanied with a direction to observe duly stated accounts, if any, since that date, and that same be not disturbed merely because of a greater rate of interest having been charged than would be recoverable by an action.\nThe agreement of the parties so far as executed must not be disturbed for any other reason than fraud or mistake.\nI do not understand fraud to be charged at all, and, that being out of the question now, the possibility of mistake is all that is left. And in regard to mistake the onus is always on the party to a settled or stated account claiming error to state it and prove it.\nNo one should be lightly deprived of this right and I would, therefore, feel inclined to give, as the learned trial judge gave, the right to impeach any stated account between the parties, and direct that upon proof of error the same be rectified, but in carrying out the rectification the calculations of interest shall proceed upon the basis of the general rate of interest, which defendant from time to time purported to charge. There is much force in the point made that no clear case of impeachment of the stated accounts was made by evidence at the trial. But the learned judge might have formally reserved this part at the outset. I think, though he did not do so quite according to the usual practice, his wishes might well be respected.\nIn so far as settled or stated accounts have not put an end to the question of the rate of interest to be charged or chargeable, a question arises upon this mortgage of May, 1907, which provided for eight per cent interest, which is beyond the rate for which the bank can recover by action. It is contended that the covenant is therefore, void. I cannot see how it can be sued upon. Indeed, it is not claimed that it can serve for a recovery of eight per cent. But cases have been cited, which, it is urged, manifest that it is good for seven per cent.\nNone of the cases cited, when examined, so meet this condition of things we have to deal with as to produce such a result. It was not argued that the covenant was not intended to be read as referring to anything but the eight per cent. rate in the proviso for redemption. The language is not as express as the redemption proviso, to which it is a sequel, but obviously means such interest as therein provided for.\nIt is, therefore, to be treated as simply a covenant to pay eight per cent. The statute by its legal effect says that kind of contract is not one upon which the bank can recover. To read this covenant otherwise and as implying an alternative of the legal limit, seems against all principles of construction.\nIt is a cutting in two of that which in its very terms forbid such a thing being done. And if it can be read merely as a covenant to pay interest, that would mean interest according to the usual legal acceptation of the term.\nIf no action will lie on the covenant, what is the condition of things?\nIt is clear from the nature of the transaction and the business of the parties that they intended that interest should be paid.\nThe covenant being set aside as invalid for purposes of this recovery, can it be looked at at all as evidence of the intention that interest should be paid ?\nCan there be any doubt if a customer overdraws his account interest can be charged upon money so lent? Is it because it is payable on demand? If so, then could it be recovered without demand, or before demand?\nI cannot find it can be rested upon any satisfactory basis except the implied contract to pay interest by reason of the nature of the transaction and the universal understanding that such an implication is a term of the contract thus formed between the parties as banker and customer.\nIn Marshall v. Poole [6] it was held when goods were sold and delivered upon an agreement to pay by a bill due at a future day, and no such bill was given, interest ran from the date at which the bill should have fallen due, because it would have carried interest from such clue date if it had been given.\nIt seems to rest upon nothing but an implied agreement; for interest would not in the then state of the law run on the price of the goods, but for that agreement giving room for such an implication.\nBesides, I incline to think the covenant may be looked at for the purpose of settling the question of whether in fact it was a gratuitous loan, or to bear interest.\nIf an action cannot be founded upon the covenant it may be said the instrument cannot be looked at for any purpose.\nDoes not the principle upon which some of the cases cited from Leake, page 556, where the instrument is used for a collateral purpose, support this suggestion, that the covenant, though illegal, may form some evidence of the relation of the parties.\nThe subject is a difficult one, not fully argued, but though doubting, I conclude interest was an implied term of the contract of loan.\nIt was contended that the elementary principle that an express contract excludes an implied one, excluded the implication of interest in this case.\nThat, however, is beside the question, for if there was merely a void covenant, I fail to see how it could exclude anything.\nIf interest is to be allowed, at what rate ?\nIt is suggested that the statute, which is expressed as follows:\nThe bank may stipulate for, take, reserve or exact any rate of interest or discount, not exceeding seven per centum per annum, and may receive and take in advance, any such rate, but no higher rate of interest shall be recoverable by the bank\nenables a recovery at seven per centum. I cannot so read it. Indeed, it seems to me rather a far-fetched construction.\nIf good for anything it must mean that seven per centum is to be the rate in all cases of money due or accruing due to a bank, unless where an express contract exists between a bank and its customer fixing another rate.\nI cannot assent to any such consequences as within the purpose of the legislature.\nI think, therefore, the rate, where not provided for and disposed of by what I have already said, must be five per cent. This was and is the ordinary rule where a contract exists to pay interest, as I find, without stating its rate and is fixed by section 2 of the \"Interest Act\" for all such cases.\nIt is quite likely when all the facts are disclosed as to renewals, etc., it is only as to past due debts that there can be any question herein. And in such cases, of course, the usual damages on a five per cent basis must be allowed.\nIt is to be observed that the learned trial judge allowed five per cent., and the only complaint made in the cross-appeal upon which this issue turns, is the raising of the rate by the appellate judgment to seven per cent., and hence cross appellant can hardly complain if interest allowed at five per cent.\nI preferred, notwithstanding that ground, to investigate the matter, and see if I could rest it upon what the law gives the parties independently of the slip in the notice.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs; and the cross-appeal allowed on the question of interest, but disallowed on the question of restoring the judgment for damages, and the form of judgment be varied so as to better define the operation of the sphere of the reference by measuring the alleged damages as above indicated. The cross-appeal having only succeeded in part should be disposed of as thus indicated without costs.\nThe judgment as it stands better be rescinded and framed anew on the lines necessary to effectuate the taking of the accounts between the parties, on the lines indicated by the majority of the court and the basis of the indebtedness being assumed (until a later settlement (if any) appear) to be that stated in the last chattel mortgage, subject to such impeachment for error in any of the items constituting the amount thereof and the accounts being surcharged and falsified; and that the clerk in taking the reference shall, if he find any later settlement of the accounts as a whole, confine the taking of accounts to the dealings subsequent to the latest of any such settlements, and subject to the corrections of errors in like manner as above directed. A general declaration better be made directing him not to interfere with any allowance in the past of interest based on what the parties have agreed to, except for error in calculation, but where no agreement exists to take the account, it ought, in my opinion, to be on the basis of five per cent. per annum, as rate of interest to be allowed.\nDUFF J. \u2014 Three questions are raised by this appeal. First, as to the effect of the Consolidated Ordinance of the North-West Territories (1898), ch. 34. There is no reason, I think, why a person employing a bailiff, or the person on whom the incidence of the charges ultimately falls, should not be at liberty to waive the benefit of the statute: Robson v. Biggar[7]. Since the mortgage in question contemplates obviously that the mortgagee shall, when acting under the power of sale, make such expenditures as may reasonably be necessary for the proper care of the mortgaged property and for obtaining the most satisfactory results, I think we may properly imply an assent on the part of the mortgagor to such waiver by the mortgagee where, in the circumstances, it would be reasonable. That it was reasonable in the circumstances of this case cannot be disputed.\nSecondly. \u2014 With respect to section 91 of the \"Bank Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 29, I think the governing words of this section as regards its effect upon the obligations of the parties under a contract providing for the payment to a bank of a higher rate of interest than seven per cent are these: \"no higher rate of interest shall be recoverable by the bank.\" Where a sum in excess of the amount exigible according to that rate has been paid the circumstances of the case must determine whether that excess is or is not recoverable from the bank by the payer. I think the allowance made in the court below on the basis of voluntary payment is right and ought not to be disturbed.\nThirdly. \u2014 As to damages. The duty of the mortgagees in exercising the powers of taking possession and selling was to act reasonably. That involved, in the circumstances of this case, the duty of taking reasonable care of the appellant's cattle while on the way to the place of sale.\nThere was evidence that they failed in this duty, and sufficient evidence, I think, to support the finding of the trial judge as to the quantum of damages. On this point, I should allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with this variation, viz., that the sum awarded as damages be allowed to the plaintiff in the mortgage account.\nANGLIN J. \u2014 In my opinion the Consolidated Ordinance of the North-West Territories (1898), ch. 34, is not applicable as between a chattel mortgagee, who sells through a bailiff, and his mortgagor. It is substantially a re-enactment of the English statute, 59 Geo. III. ch. 93. The preamble to this latter Act makes it reasonably clear that such a case would not fall within its purview. Although the territorial ordinance lacks this preamble, having regard to its history, to the unsuitability and incompleteness of its provisions and to the fact that the original Act, which deals only with landlords' distresses, appears to have been designed for the protection of the landlord as well as of the tenant against extortionate charges by bailiffs, I am satisfied that this legislation was not intended to govern such a case as that now before us.\nBut if it were, quisque potest renunciare juri pro se introducto. The mortgagor for whose protection the statute was passed could waive its provisions if he so desired. Robson v. Biggar[8]. By the clause in the defendant's mortgage authorizing it to reimburse itself for\nall costs and expenses * * * incurred by the mortgagee * * * in consequence of sale or removal\nof the mortgaged property, having regard to the nature of such property, the mortgagor must be taken to have sanctioned the outlays made by the mortgagee so far as they were reasonably necessary and proper for the care and disposition of it. Apart from the objection to them based on the statutory tariff the reasonableness of the charges made has not been challenged. The mortgagor has, in my opinion, by his agreement waived any right which he might otherwise have had to object to them because in excess of the tariff prescribed by the ordinance. The appellant is, therefore, entitled to a reversal of the judgment of the provincial appellate court in so far as it has been held liable to pay to the plaintiff\ntreble such sum as may have been taken by the defendant for costs and charges in excess of the costs and charges allowed under the ordinance respecting distress for rent and extra-judicial seizure.\nThe plaintiff cross-appeals against the judgment of the court en banc setting aside the award of the learned trial judge in his favour for $2,800 for dam Ages for negligent driving of the plaintiffs' horses from their ranch to Calgary and for improperly selling them while suffering from the effects of such driving. I think there was clear evidence of negligence in the driving of the horses and of consequential injury to the plaintiff and sufficient evidence upon which the amount of the damages sustained might be estimated without merely guessing. There was evidence upon these issues which could not have been withdrawn from a jury. While it may be that, if ourselves assessing damages, we should not have allowed as large a sum as was awarded by the learned trial judge, if that award had been the verdict of a jury, I cannot understand on what principle it could be set aside as unsupported by evidence; neither would it, in my opinion, be deemed so clearly and grossly excessive that an appellate court would be justified in ordering a new trial on that ground. The finding of a trial judge resting upon oral evidence\nis in its weight hardly distinguishable from the verdict of a jury, except that a jury gives no reasons. Lodge Holes Colliery Co. v. Wednesbury Corporation[9], at page 326.\nThe trial judge in this case gave no reasons for his assessment. The court en banc, though not informed as to the basis on which the learned judge proceeded in arriving at the amount and unable to discover any method by which such an amount could properly be arrived at, should not have set aside the assessment unless, if it had been the verdict of a jury, it must have been set aside as clearly unwarranted by the evidence \u2014 in fact a mere guess, or as based upon an improper measure of damages, or the consideration of matters which should not have been taken into account. Phillips v. London and South Western Railway Co.[10]. This, in my opinion, could not properly have been done. I would, therefore, restore the finding of Beck J. that the plaintiff is entitled to the sum of'$2,800 for damages sustained through negligence of the defendant or its agents. But the plaintiff is not presently entitled to a judgment for this sum; his only right is to have it set-off against the defendant's claim in the taking of the mortgage account.\nIn the view I have taken it is not necessary to discuss the basis on which damages should be assessed by the referee under the direction of the provincial appellate court for a reference to ascertain them. I merely desire to say that as to what should be the basis of assessment I concur in the views of my learned brothers who are of opinion that the trial judge's assessment should not be restored, but that this reference should be had. Perhaps it is not surprising, in view of the rule which it prescribed for the ascertainment of the plaintiff's damages, that the provincial appellate court was unable to discover any method by which the sum allowed by Mr. Justice Beck could properly be arrived at.\nThe plaintiff further cross-appeals against the allowance to the bank of interest at 7 per cent. up to the 31st of December, 1904, at 8 per cent from that date to the 28th of May, 1907, and at 7 per cent thereafter. The allowance at 8 per cent during the period specified rests on the basis of voluntary payments made by the plaintiff to the bank on the footing of an account stated when the second mortgage was executed on the 28th of May, 1907. I cannot find any reason for disturbing this direction. Neither do I disagree with the direction for the allowance of 7 per cent during the other periods.\nThe \"Bank\" Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 29, sec. 91, provides that:\nThe bank may stipulate for, take, reserve or exact any rate of interest or discount, not exceeding seven per centum per annum, and may receive and take in advance, any such rate, but no higher rate of interest shall be recoverable by the bank.\nI cannot understand the purpose or effect of the concluding clause of this section, unless its office is to define and express the consequence which a contract by a bank for a rate of interest in excess of 7 per cent shall entail. The section itself is in form not prohibitive, but enabling. Its effect is not that the bank's contract for a rate of interest exceeding 7 per cent is illegal, but that as to the excess it is ultra vires. Parliament has seen fit to express the consequence, viz., that the higher rate of interest, that is, the rate in so far as it exceeds a rate of 7 per cent., shall not be recoverable by the bank. This is, in my opinion, the proper construction of this important provision of the \"Bank Act.\" If it had been intended to make any contract in which a bank should stipulate for more than 7 per cent. illegal and to deprive it of all right of recovery thereon, I cannot but think that Parliament would have expressed that intention in language very different from that which it has in fact used. I would, therefore, confirm the judgment in appeal upon this point.\nAppeal allowed in part and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 3 Alta. L.R. 166.\n[2] 2 Alta. L.R. 319.\n[3] L.J.R. 9 C.P.

VII. ch. 71, does not expressly empower the commissioners to deal with compensation for land taken for the railway, and section 15 giving them \"the rights, powers, remedies and immunities conferred upon a company under the 'Railway Act' \" does not confer such power.\nThe Transcontinental Railway is a public work within the meaning of section 2, subsection (d) of \"The Exchequer Court Act,\" and proceedings respecting compensation for land taken for the railway may be taken by or against the Crown in the Exchequer. Court.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (13 Ex. C.R. 171) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the information of the Attorney-General of Canada on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain it.\nThe purpose of the information filed on behalf of His Majesty was to obtain a declaration that certain land belonging to the respondent taken for the Eastern division of the National Transcontinental Railway were vested in the King and to have the compensation therefor awarded. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court held that under the provisions of \"The Transcontinental Railway Act\" and those of \"The Railway Act\" relating to expropriation of land the compensation for land taken for the purposes of the Transcontinental Railway must be ascertained by arbitration under \"The Railway Act\" and the Exchequer Court has no jurisdiction in the matter. The Crown appealed.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy-Minister of Justice for the appellant.\nThe respondent did not appear.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Sir Louis Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court dismissing the information fyled by the Attorney-General of Canada for a declaration that certain lands taken for the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway were vested in the King, and that certain compensation should be awarded therefor to the owner (defendant).\nThe learned judge reached the conclusion that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the information on the ground that the damages for the lands taken must be determined by proceedings on behalf of the Crown or the commissioners under the clauses of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37, relating to the taking or using of lands and compensation and damages, sections 172 to 215.\nI have already had occasion to consider this question generally in the appeal of Johnstone v. The King[2], in which I reached the conclusion that so far as damages or compensation for the taking of lands located by the Government for the Eastern Division of the Transcontinental Railway are concerned the commissioners were without jurisdiction to deal with them. Section 13 of the \"Transcontinental Railway Act,\" 3 Edw. VII. ch. 71, relating to the expropriation of the lands required for the Eastern Division of that railway enacts that the deposit of the description and plan of the lands taken in manner therein provided\nshall act as a dedication to the public of such lands which shall thereupon be vested in the Crown saving always the lawful claim to compensation of any person interested therein.\nThe question at once arises where and how is that lawful claim to be prosecuted? If I am right in my holding in the case above referred to that the whole question of the adjustment and settlement of these land damages is ultra vires the commissioners, then it seems clear that section 15, which is relied upon as giving them jurisdiction to have these damages adjusted and settled under the land compensation clauses of the \"Railway Act,\" would have no application. That section giving to the commissioners\nthe rights, powers, remedies and immunities conferred upon a company under the \"Railway Act\"\ndoes so only\nin so far as they are applicable to the said railway and in so far as they are not inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of this Act.\nThese conceded rights, powers, etc., clearly relate only to matters over which the commissioners have jurisdiction given to them. Once it is conceded that they have no jurisdiction or power in the matter of land damages over the located line of the Eastern Division of the Transcontinental Railway, then the argument that section 15 can be invoked to give them such jurisdiction must fail. That section can only be invoked over matters and in cases where jurisdiction exists in commissioners aliunde.\nThe scheme of the general railway Act and that of the Eastern Division of the Transcontinental Railway relating to damages are entirely different. Under \"the general railway Act the company cannot enter upon and take possession of the lands until the damages are adjusted and either paid or tendered. Under the \"Transcontinental Railway Act\" the mere fyling of the plans and descriptions operates as a dedication of the lands to the public and a vesting of them in the Crown\nsaving always the lawful claim of interested parties to compensation.\nI cannot see how it is possible for the commissioners to take the necessary steps under the general railway Act to have the damages ascertained by the statutory arbitration proceedings, if they are without jurisdiction on the subject-matter.\nThe only remaining question is whether the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction under the Act constituting it and the Act respecting the expropriation of lands, chapter 143, Revised Statutes of Canada.\nThe latter Act, section 2, sub-section (d), defines a public work to mean and include inter alia\nthe works and properties acquired, constructed * * * at the expense of Canada, or by the acquisition or construction * * * of which any public moneys are voted and appropriated by Parliament and every work required, for any such purpose.\nThe \"Exchequer Court Act,\" ch. 140, R.S.C., sec. 20, gives that court exclusive jurisdiction over\n(a) every claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose. I agree with the contention of Mr. Newcombe that no adequate interpretation of these words can exclude the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway.\nI think the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from reading the \"National Transcontinental Railway Act\" and the agreement it ratifies and confirms is that the Eastern Division of that railway is a public work in the course of construction by the Government, but through the agency of the commissioners to the extent to which they are by statute authorized. It is a public work vested in the Crown, constructed at the expense of Canada, or for the construction of which public moneys have been voted and appropriated by Parliament within the meaning of section 2 para. (d), of the \"Expropriation Act,\" and the procedure taken by the Crown in fyling this information to determine the claim against the Crown for the lands taken falls within the language of the 20th section of that Act, and the claim itself is one coming, in my judgment, within sub-section (a) of section 20, of the Act constituting the Exchequer Court and defining its jurisdiction over\nevery claim against the Crown for property taken :for any public purpose.\nAltogether I entertain no doubt that the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court covers the claim made and think the appeal should be allowed and the jurisdiction of the court affirmed.\nIdington J.\u2014In this case some of the questions raised relative to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court are substantially the same as in the case of Johnstone v. The King[3], heard a few days ago. I need not repeat here my reasons given there for holding the Crown and not the commissioners liable.\nThere are two other questions of an entirely different character raised herein touching the jurisdiction of said court to hear this case.\nThis is the case of an information filed at the suit of the Crown, seeking a declaration of title in the Crown in respect of certain lands taken from respondent, for the purposes of the right of way of the National Transcontinental Railway, and to have the compensation due the respondent therefor determined.\nThe respondent is not concerned apparently in what form this may be tried. As I understand the learned judge's reasoning it is that the statute under which the lands have been entered upon and taken incorporates so much of the \"Railway Act,\" including its expropriation clauses, as to constitute arbitration proceedings, therein provided for, the exclusive means of determining the measure of compensation; and that even if such be not the case the Exchequer Court is not given authority to deal with such cases.\nIf anything can be clear in law it is quite clear that the Crown's representatives who took possession of the lands in question could not justify such a proceeding by virtue of anything in the \"Railway Act.\"\nHow then can the provisions of that Act be applied in this case?\nThat Act provides for the expropriating party filing in the registry office plans sanctioned by the railway commission, defining what land is to be taken or power intended to be exercised with regard to the lands in question, and making a tender of compensation, and then only after all this giving to the owner or interested party a notice. If the land to be taken is required for the railway for right of way as claimed by the plan, there must be a certificate of an engineer accompanying the notice.\nOther powers than those strictly relative to lands to be taken for right of way may also be, by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners, exercised by way of expropriation.\nAll done under the \"Railway Act\" in these regards requires the sanction of the said board.\nI cannot find that the board has any authority to deal with the project in question herein, save conditionally in respect of specified things which do not touch the power of the Crown or its commissioners relative to the taking of lands as herein.\nIt seems as if the powers to be exercised, and alleged in this information to have been exercised, by the commissioners under the Act now in question relative to the taking of lands and the mode of taking are incompatible with the powers furnished by the \"Railway Act\" for any like purpose.\nThe very foundation for the proceedings to take and compensate according to the methods prescribed by the \"Railway Act\" cannot exist in regard to this project. I fail to see how the rule of law relative to pursuing a remedy prescribed by an enabling statute can have given a semblance of authority for the Crown to pursue or apply the \"Railway Act\" to compensate for what has been done in question here.\nThe Act under which the Crown's commissioners are proceeding enacts by section 13 thereof, as follows:\nThe commissioners may enter upon and take possession of any lands required for the purposes of the Eastern Division, and they shall lay off such lands by metes and bounds, and deposit of record a description and plan thereof in the office for the registry of deeds, or the land titles office for the county or registration district in which such lands respectively are situate; and such deposit shall act as a dedication to the public of such lands, which shall thereupon be vested in the Crown, saving always the lawful claim to compensation of any person interested therein.\nI see nothing in the \"Railway Act\" or in this Act to suggest that a part of the one can be dovetailed into the other so as to constitute a specifically prescribed method provided by Parliament for the coherent execution of the power and consequent determination of the amount of compensation to be given for the exercise of this power.\nThe provision of section 3 of the \"Railway Act\" incorporates its provisions with any special Act and the interpretation of \"Special Act\" is quoted in the judgment appealed from to shew that the road in question herein is one of such special Acts.\nBut section 3 provides that\nthe provisions of the special Act shall in so far as it is necessary to give effect to such special Act be taken to override the provisions of this Act,\ni.e., the \"Railway Act.\"\nThe expropriation provisions in the \"Railway Act\" seem by the said section 13 of this special Act to be overridden thereby.\nIt is to be observed also that the national transcontinental scheme is of such a composite character that we must guard against being supposed to express any opinion of any of the provisions bearing on other sections of that work than the one before us.\nWhat the Crown's commissioners have done under said provision seems to have effectually vested the lands in question in the Crown and however satisfactory and convenient it may be to have the court declare it properly done, it stands as complete, subject to the right to compensation.\nThe commissioners of the Crown are of right in possession by section 13 above quoted.\nI cannot find or hold that the express provisions of section 15 have any relation to this subject-matter now under consideration.\nWhen once we have concluded, as I do, that the method prescribed as suggested by the learned judge does not apply, what is our next duty?\nWhether or not that right to compensation can be enforced elsewhere than in the Exchequer Court, is not part of our present inquiry.\nOur next inquiry must be to ascertain if the powers thus exercised having been thus completed, can the Exchequer Court be asked to fix the compensation due respondent by reason thereof?\nI am not concerned with what is possible as the measure of compensation in one court as distinguished from what may be fixed in another. I am only concerned to know if, this expropriation having been accomplished, indemnity can be got in the Exchequer Court.\nThat question is within a narrow compass.\nThe Exchequer Court Act, sec. 20, provides as follows:\u2014\n20. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\u2014\n(a) Every claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose;\n(b) Every claim against the Crown for damage to property injuriously affected by the construction of any public work.\nIt seems clearly to follow from what I have already said that these two sub-sections cover all that is necessary to give the court jurisdiction. Indeed, if I am right in my interpretation of section 13, quoted above from the \"National Transcontinental Act,\" it seems too clear for argument that the above section 20, subsection (a) is sufficiently comprehensive.\nMoreover, if this property so taken as above set forth, to form a part of the railway in question, and to become the property of the Crown, is not taken for a public purpose, it would be difficult to find one that has been.\nIndeed, in face of section 13, above referred to, and this section 20, just now quoted, when we read its exclusive terms it seems hard to find room for the argument relative to the \"Railway Act\" having any application to this matter.\nNor do I see any reason for our resorting to the \"Expropriation Act\" in its relation to the question of jurisdiction. It may or it may not furnish the proper measure of damages to be adopted, or be applicable in any way. I repeat, all that is something that at present does not concern us.\nI think the appeal must be allowed.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Sir Louis Davies.\nAnglin J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed. There should be no costs.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. L. Newcombe.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. B. Chandler.\n[1] 13 Ex. C.R. 171.\n[2] 44 Can.

By \"The North-West Irrigation Act, 1898\" (61 Vict. ch. 35), it is provided, (sec. 11b) that irrigation companies should submit their scheme of works to the Commissioner of Public Works of the North-West Territories and obtain from him permission to construct and operate the works across road allowances and surveyed public highways which might be affected by them; that (sec. 16) his approval and permission for construction across the road allowances and highways should be obtained prior to the authorization of the works by the Minister of the Interior of the Dominion, and, (sec. 37), that during the construction and operation of the works, they should \"keep open for safe and convenient travel all public highways theretofore publicly travelled as such, when they are crossed by such works\" and construct and maintain bridges over the works. The commissioner was the local officer in control of all matters affecting changes in or obstructions to road allowances and public highways vested in the territorial government \"including the crossing of such allowances or public highways by irrigation ditches, canals or other works.\" The commissioner granted permission to the appellants to construct and maintain their works across the road allowances and public highways shewn in their ap- plication \"subject to the provisions of section 37 of the said North-West Irrigation Act,\" without imposing other conditions.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, (3 Alta. L.R. 70), the Chief Justice and Idington J. dissenting, that the absolute statutory duty in respect of the construction and maintenance of bridges imposed by section 37 of \"The North-West Irrigation Act, 1808,\" relates solely to highways which were publicly travelled as such prior to the construction of the irrigation works, and that, as no further duty was imposed by the commissioner as a condition of the permission for the construction and maintenance of their works, the company was not obliged to erect bridges across their works at the points where they were intersected by road allowances or public highways which became publicly travelled as such after the construction of the works.\nPer Davies and Duff JJ.\u2014In construing modern statutes conferring compulsory powers, including powers to interrupt the exercise of public rights, questions as to what conditions, obligations or liabilities are attached to, or arise out of the exercise of such powers, are primarily questions of the meaning of the language used or of the proper inferences respecting the legislative intention touching such conditions, obligations and liabilities to be drawn from a consideration of the subject-matter, the nature of the provisions as a whole, and, the character of the objects of the legislation as disclosed thereby.\nNOTE\u2014Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was granted, 20th July, 1911.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Scott J., by which the action was maintained.\nThe action was brought, on behalf of the Government of the Province of Alberta, to compel the defendants to erect and maintain bridges across their irrigation canal at certain points where it crossed road allowances and highways which had not been publicly travelled as such prior to the construction of their irrigation works. The trial judge entered judgment, pro forma, in favour of the plaintiff and the Supreme Court of Alberta, on an appeal, affirmed the decision. The judgment now appealed from ordered that the company should erect the bridges or \"abate and keep abated the nuisance created through the interruption of public travel by the maintenance and operation of their said irrigation canals across the said road allowances at the points * * * mentioned respectively, so that the said original road allowances respectively, having been adopted and now being used (save as to those portions extending for a short distance on each side of the said points respectively) as highways by the public, may be conveniently travelled by the public.\"\nThe questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart, K.C., and E. F. Haffner, for the appellants.\nS. B. Woods, K.C., for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting) \u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Idington.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting) \u2014This case is within a narrow compass, yet to understand it properly we must bear in mind the governmental and other condition of things in the North-West Territories, before and at the time of the appellants receiving their charter of incorporation, and the concession of water now in question.\nThese vast and almost uninhabited territories, after being acquired by Canada, in 1870, were legislated for by Parliament and within such legislation ruled by officers appointed by the Dominion Government.\nLegislative as well as administrative powers were delegated from time to time by Parliament or, within lines it laid down, by the Government to the council or councils which, in time, thereby grew to be representative assemblies, or partly so, concurrently with the powers of the executive council proper.\nAll the details relative to this development except the one or two features directly bearing on this case may be passed by. In the delegating of these local powers from time to time the legislation therefor was not always as well expressed or the powers as well defined as they might have been. In the rapid changes thus made some confusion was apt to arise, as we will see presently, in the carrying into execution of the legislative and administrative purposes of the parent and delegated powers.\nThis vast territory was from its acquisition being rapidly settled. To promote that settlement the lands were surveyed from time to time, according to a plan which, speaking generally, divided the land into sections of a mile square and left for the use or creation of future highways, road allowances of a chain in width, between each of these sections, so that each section was surrounded by a road allowance.\nIt would be as well also to bear in mind that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was entitled to select each alternate section in the whole stretch of country from east to west and forty-eight miles wide, which were to be free from taxation for a long period.\nIt was, I may observe, from the earliest period of this rule, as these enactments relative to this company shew, hoped to carve out provinces each with autonomy like that of the other provinces of Canada, and that municipal institutions should, when settlement required them, be created by each of such provinces.\nThere had been, as the arid, or periodically arid, character of parts of the country became known, various legislative plans adopted for meeting this obstacle in the way of settlement and improvement.\nThese plans, saving rights acquired under them, were set aside by the \"North-West Irrigation Act, 1898.\" Section 4 of this Act enacted that there should be deemed to be vested in the Crown\nthe property in and the right to the use of all the water at any time in any river, stream, watercourse, lake, creek, ravine, canon, lagoon, swamp, marsh or other body of water.\nThis Act covered all such water in the North-West Territories, except in specified districts, and prohibited the diversion of it, saving by those having prior rights or licenses under this Act.\nThe water might be used for domestic purposes on the land where found, but its use for irrigation had to be acquired by means of licenses to be issued to individuals or companies from the Department of the Interior.\nA comprehensive scheme is laid down in the Act and powers are given the Minister of the Interior for making regulations to carry it out.\nThe Commissioner of Public Works of the Northwest Territories has, in any case, to be memorialized by any one desiring a license to divert and use such water.\nThe preliminary requirements to be observed by any of such memorialists as apply for a license for diverting, or diverting and carrying, a less quantity than twenty-five cubic feet of water per second, are of a simpler nature than those asking concessions respecting that or any greater quantity.\nBut the party applying for a license for the greater quantity had, in applying, to observe the same preliminary terms and conditions specified for an application for a license for the less quantity and in addition thereto a great deal more.\nThese several requirements are set forth in sections 11 and 12 of the Act.\nI assume the prescribed mode of application set out in these sections was complied with.\nAmongst other things these sections required, was an application, under section 11, sub-section (b) of the Act, which is as follows:\u2014\n(b) an application on forms provided by the commissioner, for the right to construct any canal, ditch, reservoir, or other works referred to in the memorial, across any road allowance or surveyed public highway, which may be affected by such works.\nThe following is the form used by the appellants in making their application, so far as shewn in the case herein:\u2014\nLethbridge, January 31, 1899.\nTo the Commissioner of Public Works, Regina, Assa.\nSir,\u2014We beg to inform you that we have made application to the Minister of the Interior, under the provisions of the North-West Irrigation Act, for permission to divert water from the St. Mary River, on the south-east quarter of section 36, township 1, range 25, west of the fourth meridian, for irrigation purposes, and to construct the canals, ditches, reservoirs and other works necessary for the utilization of such water.\nWe have received the authorization for the construction of the works in question, but would point out that in completing such construction it will be necessary to cross the road allowance, or public highway,. and we therefore beg to apply for permission under the North-West Territories and Dominion Lands Act to construct and maintain the canals, ditches and reservoirs across the road allow- ances or public highways at the places indicated in the accompanying plan, the necessary bridge or bridges at these points being constructed and maintained by us as provided by sub-section (b) of section 11 of the North-West Irrigation Act.\nYour obedient servant,\nTHE ALBERTA IRRIGATION COMPANY,\nPer C. A. MAGRATH, Superintendent.\nThe concluding words \"as provided by sub-section (b) of section 11 of the North-West Irrigation Act\" are evidently misplaced. The sentence seems rather long for the clear expression of its purpose. These words at the end, in one way of treating the sentence, are nonsense, and hence mere surplusage.\nBut giving them a meaning they were evidently intended to bear, as if they had been inserted after the words \"point out\" near the beginning of the sentence, they are comprehensible.\nIn any way we may treat them (unless we are to assume there never was a comprehensible application made as required by the Act, and, hence, the whole concessions given by the commissioner void)\u2014Can we read the notice without imputing to the applicant the express tender of an undertaking to construct and maintain the necessary bridge or bridges at the points indicated on the plan?\nThe only points indicated are the crossings of each road allowance or public highway.\nHad there been some selected from these and specially designated, such designation might have excluded the remaining crossings; but as it is, the proffered undertaking can only mean all. No doubt the parties concerned so understood the undertaking to be and acted accordingly.\nThis is, if possible, still clearer when we turn to sub-section (d) of the same section 11, which is as follows:\u2014\n(d) a plan, in duplicate, on tracing linen, shewing in detail all head-works, dams, flumes, bridges, culverts or other structures to be erected in connection with the proposed undertaking,\nand ask its meaning.\nWe find applicants thereby required to furnish along with the memorial a plan of the bridges to be constructed on the proposed work. And on turning to those filed with this application we find two distinctly different bridge plans.\nOne is evidently intended to meet the statutory requirement of section 37, to which I will again refer, and the other is a twelve-foot bridge. What is this twelve-foot bridge for? Is its draft or plan not to meet this very requirement of sub-section (d) and its construction to fit the proffered undertaking contained in the application? What other meaning can it have?\nAre we to discard all these things because the western man in a hurry had not taken time to revise his form and allowed the projector to write his requisition and undertaking on a clearly defective form?\nIt is a form that refers to some Act which I cannot discover, and which certainly is not the true title of this Act. We must treat the application as designed to meet the requirements of the Act, or as a nullity, for the parties had no power save when acting in conformity with the statute.\nIf we treat this application as null, what rights can appellants have? They are bound by the statute to apply on a form provided by the commissioner who impliedly must have had the instructions and regula- tions of the Minister of the Interior for a guide, as the express power is given him by section 51 to prescribe the forms to be used.\nI see no insuperable difficulties either in the way of our maintaining the rights of the appellants or the rights of the Crown, when we have regard to the considerations already adverted to and the nature of the business the parties had in hand.\nThe commissioner could not be endowed by the North-West Council or the Legislative Assembly which defined his duties, with power to deal with such a subject, regardless of the purposes of the Dominion.\nThe forms were to be provided by the commissioner, but the power in section 51 shews the forms were to be framed by the Minister.\nIt is true the commissioner was given by the Legislative Assembly in the year preceding the passing of the \"Irrigation Act, 1898,\" power to deal with questions affecting changes in, or obstruction to, roads\nincluding the crossing of such road allowances or public highways by irrigation ditches,\nbut this of necessity must be referable to Irrigation Acts which, as already noted, were swept away by this Act of 1898.\nIt is conceivable, however, that in referring to him by section 16 of this latter Act, the granting of a certificate, regard was had to the local legislation.\nNow what did the commissioner do in response to this application? He granted the permission but the certificate thereof shews no reference to the proffered undertaking. Surely that must be read as an assent to the application on the terms offered.\nIt seems rather a strong thing to presume that he intended to reject the terms proffered, which were so very onerous for the applicant, and so directly for the benefit of the public and governments he represented.\nTo do so would seem like a betrayal of the trust reposed in him.\nI can draw no such inference. Nor do I see the slightest ground for such an implication.\nThe certificate ends by using the words\nsubject, however, to the provisions of section 37 of the said North-West Irrigation Act.\nIt is urged this impliedly relieved the applicants from the comprehensive words of the undertaking. How can that be so? It but repeats what the statute had imposed and could not be dispensed with by this officer. The applicants and he were both bound by that statutory provision which by its terms pre-supposes a travelled highway. It is the case of mere road allowances he had, and we have, to deal with.\nIt may be admitted, for argument's sake, a crossing of a road allowance was subject to his judgment, as, for example, at a point where the configuration of the ground was such as to render a highway impossible. That might be a case for his dispensing with a bridge.\nHe could, for such or other good reason, have dealt with crossings, not covered by section 37, but yet within his power, in a way that might by his manner of selection perhaps have given rise to the application of the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius relied on, and thereby relieved the applicant in regard to other places within this power. Them this argument might have had great force if so aplied to the necessary crossings under his control.\nHow that can apply here I cannot understand. I cannot see how any expression relative to something else than that within his power and so being dealt with by him can have any bearing on the matter. It seems to me clear that all that was meant by this reference to section 37 was of abundant caution and does not affect the matter one way or another.\nAnd when we find nothing done to alter the plans submitted for two kinds of bridges the undertaking stands good.\nIt seems this application and the certificate were printed forms likely in use for another Act, and hence clumsy of expression relative to this, yet these words\nthe necessary bridge or bridges at these points being constructed and maintained by us\nhave a terseness and force that cannot be set aside.\nThey are the language the statute provides should be supplied by the commissioner for the applicant to use, and we are not idly to assume he departed from the requirement of his own implied demand according to the statute, merely because he did not reiterate same in his assent.\nAnd I find a printed form in the case before us which suggests an evident explanation for the peculiarity of ending this appellants' application seems to wear.\nIn this form a blank space is left for receiving the name or designation of the party on whom the burden of building bridges and maintaining them was to be cast.\nIn that blank when used by the appellants (as ap- plicants) the word \"us\" was written in, no doubt by its officer, and it reads in the copy used for this case as if no pause or punctuation ever could have been needed. Hence if this surmise or inference be correct, appellants' neglect to punctuate is entirely to blame for the present misleading shape which the end of their application assumes.\nThe limited nature of the commissioner's powers relative to these road allowances and public highways, does not seem to me to have conferred any jurisdiction to destroy either a public highway or a road allowance or authorize any one else to do so. His jurisdiction was entirely of a preservative character.\nIt is evident that the construction of a canal forty-eight feet wide as proposed in the one case, or of sixteen feet wide as proposed in the other of those instances presented for our consideration, of necessity certainly had, unless provided against, this result of destruction and not preservation.\nI do not think the commissioner ever supposed he was assenting to such destruction, nor do I see how we can fairly impute such kind of assent to him, in face of the accepted proposal providing for all the necessary bridges over road allowances or public highways.\nNor can his adding from abundant caution the reference to the statutory provision section 37, which is entirely applicable to other cases than road allowances, justify such an inference.\nThe express language of the application refers to \"road allowances or public highways,\" whilst section 37 clearly refers only to travelled public highways, and deals not with mere road allowances. The application does not restrict its undertaking to build bridges only at public highways either then existent or by future development to become, before construction, public highways.\nNor should we forget that concessions of this kind given the appellants are to be restricted, and the authority therefor restricted, within what is clearly and explicitly expressed or by implication as clear as if so expressed.\nThe intrusion involved in the execution of such works without clear authority, upon parts of the Crown domain consecrated as these road allowances were for a specific purpose, would be as illegal as if they had been fenced off by the appellants without clear and explicit authority.\nEither such works, including such consequences without express authority from the dominant power, must be held illegal and liable to abatement, or their continuation regardless of the tender of sufficient necessary bridges to overcome the consequences of such intrusion must be held illegal; and abatement must follow, unless the tender thereof which induced the grant be fully implemented.\nI might let the matter rest here but perhaps I ought not to pass in silence other points pressed in argument.\nThe attempt to import section 37 into the application in substitution for the section 11, sub-section (b) already referred to as therein, seems without foundation.\nThe elaborate, and I respectfully submit, irrelevant argument to prove that the term \"road allowances\" means only public highways, leaves them as distinctly different as ever. Every public highway may be on, or be loosely referred to as a \"road allow- ance.\" But every road allowance is not a public highway; yet when it becomes such, will need a bridge over such canals as in question here, and when, and so often as necessity therefor arises, the undertaking is to become from time to time operative.\nLet us bear in mind the condition of things already briefly referred to, as existing in the country in question and the claim in argument that this building and maintaining of bridges involves enormous expense.\nThe more the expense is magnified the less force favourable to the appellants does any argument derived from expense appear to have.\nIf the section 37 of the statute is the only authority to be observed, and the only means out of the difficulty, there would seem to have been innumerable crossings by way of bridges and approaches to be constructed when the district got settled. And at whose expense? And for whose benefit but those holding lands thus irrigated?\nIt seems impossible to suppose that Parliament intended to supplement this concession by assuming the burden.\nIf local taxation is the only source left, the upland landholder deriving no benefit might have to pay thus for the man on the level plain. And until Canadian Pacific Railway lands had become taxable the burden in some districts covered by this legislation would probably fall on a fractional part of a district concerned only with the need for bridges and perhaps having none of the irrigated lands within its jurisdiction.\nIf the cost of bridge building is borne by the water company then the charge finally falls on those who are paying for the use of the water and receiving the benefit thereof.\nEvery improvement helps even those not directly benefited. Yet taxation for others' benefit does not tend to promote settlement, and its incidence does not compensate. The Canadian Pacific Railway construction apparently conferred direct benefit on everyone within the range of the part exempted from taxation, yet common knowledge tells us its repetition of exemption from taxation most unlikely in 1898, for a purely private enterprise like this.\nIt may be said these things have nothing to do with the interpretation of the statute. I agree; nothing of statutes and contracts must be construed in such a manner as to lead to absurdity.\nBut these things constitute the conditions and surrounding circumstances that so evidently must have been present to the minds of those who asked in no doubtful terms for a concession, but were granted it in terms alleged to be ambiguous.\nAgain it is said some bridges have been built by the Alberta Government. What does that amount to? It is said to have been done under protest. But whether so or not the circumstances are not at all of the same character as of a man who has made a grant being met by his own acts thereafter as interpretative of his intention relative to an ambiguous term of the grant.\nThe province was created after all these happenings now in question, and it may well be that somebody had blundered. We have only too much apparent in this case of how errors may occur in transacting government business in a country where conditions relative thereto are rapidly changing. The great effort in argument seemed to be addressed to the proposition that section 37 must govern all that was ever conceivably within the range of the commissioner's business vision, or powers in law, to impose.\nWhat can such a proposition lead to? When we reflect that this Act was equally applicable to the possibly common case of the farmer or farmers in need of water for irrigation purposes, applying for a license therefor.\nThe grant prayed for in such case may involve the crossing (by means, for example, of a pipe or ditch of a capacity to carry only what a pipe of three inches or three feet in diameter might carry) of one or more road allowances not yet become travelled highways.\nWho is to determine the question of the right to cross such road allowances and the terms upon which the leave is to be given? And by what procedure is such a determination to be reached?\nAt each step in the proceedings up to the officer who finally grants the permission to cross such road allowance, the man and the officer in each such case are identical with those who had to be consulted to certify and to do all leading to the granting and to grant such permission as was given to the appellants:\nYet we have two or three things urged upon us herein as if undoubted law, that if acted upon would lead to extraordinary results in the operating of this Act in this connection.\nOne is thus stated in the appellants' factum:\u2014\nThe \"necessary\" bridges were, of course, those which were rendered necessary by the statute under which the application was made. And that the Commissioner of Public Works so understood, is shewn by the language in which he couches his permission:\u2014\"sub- ject, however, to the provisions of section 37 of the said North-West Irrigation Act.\"\nIt would have been quite irregular for the commissioner to impose any condition not warranted by the Act. He did not do it. And it may fairly be assumed that the company did not voluntarily assume any such liability.\nThe contention means, if it means anything, that the only thing the commissioner could do in the case of the farmers requiring permission for a pipe of a capacity of three inches or three feet in diameter across a road allowance or travelled highway, was to require they should build a bridge as provided for in section 37, or put the Public Works Department or other public authority to the expense of providing for all time a culvert for the sole benefit of such grantees.\nIt first assumes that an officer empowered to act on behalf of the Crown, can never stipulate for anything conditional to his consent unless his power has been expressly clothed with a provision enabling the public to be so protected. And in the next place it assumes that a grant obtained by virtue of such condition is perfectly good. In other words, the grantee can repudiate, and by his repudiation acquire something he never could have got but by breach of faith.\nI cannot accept such a doctrine as law. Such a grant has been obtained either by fraud or mistake, if the officer had no right to stipulate; and work constructed thereunder must be liable to abatement.\nIt is further to be observed that said section 16 of the Act requiring a certificate as stated above, contains all the legislation of the Dominion relative to the commissioner's power or duties in connection with the subject now in question. Certainly there is thus afforded the amplest scope for him so far as that legislation is concerned. And when we have regard to the power conferred by the above - mentioned enactment of the assembly, how can it be said he had no power to impose any conditions or stipulate for anything the public weal required at his hands in the discharge of his duty.\nHow can it be said he was confined to observing or to the stipulating for the observance by others of section 37 in the Act? He had no power relative thereto. He could not dispense with its operations for an instant. It bound him and it bound the promoters, and still binds appellants. And to assume as a mere matter of course he was doing so, seems either idle, or that we are to assume he was an idle and useless functionary.\nIf he had no power beyond the limits of this section 37, which is plain and expresses a purpose that becomes operative under certain conditions and not otherwise, why should there be a reference to him at all?\nAgain, it seems as if the man or company demanding a right of way across a road allowance dedicated to the public use when the district had not yet become so settled as to have any need for a bridge, must as an initial step have imposed by the commissioner upon him or it, the burden of needlessly constructing a bridge such as section 37 specified, or nothing.\nIt is unnecessary in this view to consider the question of want of authority, or semblance thereof, respecting the subsidiary undertaking secondly in question herein.\nAny questions as to the mandatory form of the judgment directing building of bridges where no authority may exist for the constructing of the works necessitating same, can be met by modification there- of, if the respondent be so advised as to ask herein for same.\nIt is competent for the respondent to waive the extreme right he may have to relief, and accept in any conditional form found advisable, a judgment within and subject to such conditions.\nI would allow such amendment in this regard by way of variation as the respondent may desire and be advised.\nMeantime I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDUFF J. \u2014 The appellants, the Irrigation Company, have established irrigation works in Alberta under the authority of the \"Irrigation Act of 1898.\" Their works include canals or open ditches which intersect roads now used for public travel at different places, and the controversy that has given rise to the action is upon the question whether the appellants are or are not under an obligation to provide bridges for the accommodation of the traffic at these places.\nThe appellants do not dispute that they were and are obliged to make provision for the passing over their works of the traffic upon highways which had actually been in use for public travel before those works were constructed across them. They admit that section 37 of the Act imposes that duty; but they deny that any duty is incumbent upon them to provide for traffic upon highways that were not so used until after the construction of the works \u2014 in which category the roads in respect of which this controversy arises are admitted to be. It is disputed by the appellants that, at the time of the construction of these works, these roads were, in law, public highways. I do not think it necessary to decide that point, and for the purposes of this case I shall assume in favour of the Crown that they were.\nThe Crown rests upon two distinct grounds: 1st, that as a condition of the permission (necessary under the statute) to cross the highways in question, the appellants were required to enter into (and did so) an obligation to construct such bridges as should be necessitated by their works; and 2ndly, that the right derived from the statute of constructing their works over a given highway was in every case burdened with a co-relative duty to make provision for the passage of public traffic over the parts of the highway affected by the exercise of the right whenever such provision should be reasonably demanded by the requirements of that traffic.\nThe second of these contentions may be conveniently considered first. The learned judges of the full court of Alberta have unanimously upheld this contention, basing their view mainly upon the authority of a series of decisions of which the latest is Hertfordshire County Council v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[2].\nI do not think it necessary to discuss these decisions in detail. As I read them they are not inconsistent with what I take to be a settled principle in the construction of modern statutes conferring compulsory powers, including powers to interrupt the exercise of public rights; namely, that the question of what conditions, obligations or liabilities are attached to or arise out of the exercise of such powers is primarily a question of the meaning of the language used or of the proper inferences respecting the legislative intention touching such conditions, liabilities and ob- ligations to be drawn from a consideration of the subject-matter, the nature of the provisions as a whole and the character of the objects of the legislation as disclosed thereby.\nThe statute in question was a re-enactment of a statute passed in 1894, with some changes not without a bearing on the construction of the Act. The parent enactment made provision for the construction of irrigation works under the authority of the Governor-General in Council according to plans to be approved by the Minister of the Interior. In 1897, a representative \"Legislative Assembly\" was for the first time constituted for the North-West Territories. The legislative authority vested in the assembly was subject to the control of the Dominion Parliament; but, broadly speaking, extend to the same subjects as those assigned to the provincial legislatures and an executive was established responsible to the assembly. When in the following year, 1898, the \"Irrigation Act\" was re-enacted, its provisions were changed to suit the altered circumstances. The memorial praying for authority to execute irrigation works and the plans of such works were to be filed at Regina in the office of the Commissioner of Public Works\u2014a member of the executive of the territories; the documents were to be examined by the engineer-in-chief of the territories, and the approval of the chief engineer was one of the conditions which the Act required to be observed before the execution of the works could be authorized by the Minister of the Interior.\nThe changes touching the matter of the interference with highways are important and significant. The Act of 1894 contained (section 31) a provision in these words:\u2014\nAny person or company constructing any works under the provisions of this Act shall during such construction keep open for safe and convenient travel all public highways theretofore publicly travelled as such, when they are crossed by such works, and shall, before water is diverted into, conveyed or stored by any such works extending into or crossing any such highway, construct, to the satisfaction of the Minister, a substantial bridge, not less than fourteen feet in breadth, with proper and sufficient approaches thereto, over such works; and every such bridge and the approaches thereto shall be always thereafter maintained by such person or company.\nThere was a further provision requiring the information forwarded to the Minister to contain a description of bridges at highways and farm crossings, but otherwise no express mention of the subject of highways. The Act of 1898 reproduced the first mentioned section as section 37; but it further required as a condition of a grant of authority by the Minister that the consent of the territorial Commissioner of Public Works to the construction of any work across any road allowance or surveyed public highway that might be affected by such works, should first be obtained. It is to be observed that road allowances became vested in the territorial executive and assembly before 1898; and that the phrase \"surveyed public highways\" refers to highways transferred under the authority of statute to the territorial government by the Government of Canada.\nThe duty of dealing with obstructions to road allowances and public highways vested in the territorial government was specifically placed upon the Commissioner of Public Works by an ordinance of 1897 (No. 17); and the same ordinance provided for the appointment of a deputy-commissioner, who should also be chief engineer. I do not think that, in view of these provisions, an intention can be imputed to Parliament to impose an absolute obligation such as that which it is now sought to fasten upon the company in respect of highways and road allowances to which section 37 does not apply; the general effect of the provisions of the Act seems rather to be that Parliament has left in the hands of the territorial authorities the protection of the interests of the public in such highways and road allowances; and consequently, to ascertain the obligations of the irrigation company in this respect, we must look to what passed between the company and the territorial commissioner at the time the permission to construct across highways was granted. The respondent relies upon the words of the company's application. It will be convenient to set out in full this application and the formal certificate of permission to cross road allowances issued by the Commissioner of Public Works of the territories; and they are as follows:\u2014\nLethbridge, January 31, 1899.\nTo the Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\nSIR,\u2014We beg to inform you that we have made application to the Minister of the Interior, under the provisions of the North-West Irrigation Act, for permission to divert water from the St. Mary River on the south-east quarter of section 36, township 1, range 25, west of the fourth meridian, for irrigation purposes, and to construct the canals, ditches, reservoirs and other works necessary for the utilization of such water.\nWe have received the authorization for the construction of the works in question, but would point out that in completing such construction it will be necessary to cross the road allowance, or public highway, at the points indicated on the general plan herewith, and we therefore beg to apply for permission under the North-West Territories and Dominion Lands Act to construct and maintain the canals, ditches and reservoirs across the road allowances or public highways at the places indicated in the accompany- ing plan, the necessary bridge or bridges at these points being constructed and maintained by us as provided by sub-section (b) of section 11 of the North-West Irrigation Act.\nYour obedient servant,\nTHE ALBERTA IRRIGATION COMPANY,\nPer C: A. MAGRATH, Superintendent.\nCanada,\nNorth-West Territories,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nRegina, March 15, 1899.\nThis is to certify that the Alberta Irrigation Company, having been authorized under the provisions of the \"North-West Irrigation Act\" to divert water from the St. Mary River on the south-east quarter of section 36, township 1, range 25, west of the fourth meridian, and to construct the necessary canals, ditches, reservoirs, and other works for the utilization of such water for irrigation purposes, is hereby granted permission, under the provisions of \"The Public Works Ordinance\" relating to road allowances and public highways, to construct and maintain the canals, ditches, reservoirs or other works forming part of such authorized system, across the road allowances or public highways at the point or points shewn by the plans filed by the said The Alberta Irrigation Company in the Irrigation Office, subject, however, to the provisions of section 37 (31 struck out) of the said North-West Irrigation Act.\n(Sgd.) J. H. ROSS,\nCommissioner of Public Works.\nIt is argued that there is to be found in these two documents read together an undertaking on the part of the company to construct and maintain such bridges as might from time to time become necessary to furnish proper accommodation for public travel upon the highways crossed by the company's works. I do not think this is the natural construction of these documents. The company appears to me to be proposing to construct and maintain a bridge or bridges at such places as shall be nominated by the commissioner, or, in other words, to be submitting itself to such conditions as in this respect the commissioner may think fit to impose; and, in granting the application, the commissioner restricts himself to requiring a compliance with section 37. To my mind, it is not easily conceivable (if the view of the commissioner had been that the company was entering into the large undertaking now attributed to it) that he would have refrained from noticing the undertaking in the document in which his permission is expressed. Moreover, any doubt arising upon the meaning of these documents as touching this point, when read by themselves, would appear to be settled in favour of the company by the subsequent conduct of the parties. Paragraphs 14 and 15 of the statement of defence shew that bridges were built and have been maintained by the governments of the North-West Territories and Province of Alberta, upon road allowances intersected by the company's canals, since the granting of this permission; and until very recently no claim has been made upon the company by any of the governments concerned in respect of the cost of constructing or maintaining these bridges. That, in the absence of some other explanation\u2014and none is forthcoming \u2014 seems to shew conclusively that the territorial Commissioner of Public Works did not understand the company to have entered into any such obligation as would support the claim made in this action.\nI think the action fails.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This action comes before us in the form of a special case upon pleadings and admissions settled between the parties. The question in controversy is whether the appellants are or are not obliged to erect bridges at points where their canals or irrigation ditches intersect road allowances or surveyed public highways which have become publicly travelled roads only since the construction of the works.\nThe appellants constructed their works under the authority of the \"North-West Irrigation Act, 1898,\" 61 Vict. ch. 35, (D.), to the provisions of which the powers conferred on them were made subject by section 16 of their original Act of incorporation, 56 Vict, ch. 69, (D).\nA study of the \"North-West Irrigation Act, 1898,\" has satisfied me that Parliament therein provided fully and exhaustively for the crossing by irrigation ditches of all highways and road allowances, and for the protection of public interests therein. Whether, as argued by Mr. Woods, the \"public highways theretofore publicly travelled as such\" dealt with in section 37 are confined to old trails still in use, jurisdiction over which had not been transferred to the Legislature of the North-West Territories, but was still vested in the Dominion Department of the Interior, or whether, as contended by Mr. Ewart, they also include road allowances and surveyed highways which are in actual use for public travel at the time of construction and over which the local legislature had been given jurisdiction and control (60 & 61 Vict. ch. 28 (D.), secs. 18 and 19; 55 & 56 Vict, ch. 15 (D.), sec. 6), it is incontrovertible that, by the words \"any road allowance or surveyed public highway,\" clause (b) of section 11 is made applicable to all highways and allowances for roads which irrigation ditches may cross and which are not covered by section 37. It would therefore seem to be not only unnecessary, but inadmissible to seek for implied obligations on the part of licensees operating under the statute in regard to the crossing of highways or road allowances other or greater than those imposed by its provisions. By section 37, Parliament has imposed upon the licensees an absolute obligation in regard to every public highway publicly travelled as such before the construction of their works to provide against interruption of safe and convenient travel after, as well as during construction. The existing conditions of travel with which this section deals involve the necessity of some such provision as it makes for bridging. But in the case of a highway which, although surveyed, was not actually in public use before the works were constructed, and in the case of a mere road allowance shewn upon a plan of survey\u2014whether it should be regarded as a highway in law or merely as a reservation which might, at a later period, become a highway \u2014 the necessity for bridging and the kind of bridge which might be requisite would obviously depend upon the nature of the surrounding country, the likelihood of the surveyed highway or road allowance coming into public use, the character of the traffic for which provision might be necessary, and other considerations upon which it would be eminently proper that a responsible and well informed local official should exercise his judgment.\nThese surveyed highways and road allowances having been placed under the control of the local legislature, that body by the \"Public Works Ordinance of 1897\" (No. 17, secs. 3 and 8) provided for the appointment of a Commissioner of Public Works for the North-West Territories who should be a member of the executive council, and it empowered him to\ndeal with all questions affecting changes in or obstruction to any road allowance or public highway which has been vested in the North-West Government for public use, including the crossing of such allowances or public highways by irrigation ditches, canals or other works.\nIt is to this responsible officer that, under clause (b) of section 11 of the \"Irrigation Act,\" the petitioner for a license must present his application\nfor the right to construct any canal, ditch, reservoir or other works * * * across any road allowance or surveyed public highway;\nand it is his permission to so construct such works which must be certified to the Dominion Minister of the Interior before he may be asked to authorize the construction of the works (section 16). As to existing travelled highways, section 37 makes provision for the protection of public interests; as to surveyed highways and road allowances not publicly travelled before the construction of the works, those interests are protected by the powers vested in the local Commissioner of Public Works, whose permission to carry the works across such highways and road allowances the applicant for a license must obtain before he can procure the Minister's authorization to proceed with construction. It follows that to the discretion of this member of the local government is entrusted the duty of making such provision as may be requisite and adequate for the protection of the rights of the public in regard to surveyed highways and road allowances not actually travelled as public highways before his permit is obtained. It is his duty to\ndeal with all questions affecting changes in or obstructions to\nsuch highways or road allowances, including the crossing of them by these irrigation ditches. To his judgment Parliament has committed the determination of the circumstances in which permission to cross should be granted or withheld; to his discretion it has entrusted the duty of fixing the terms and con- ditions upon which such permission shall be given. When application is made to him for a permit, he must decide what obligations, present and future, the applicant should assume for the protection of public interests, present and future, in the then untravelled highways or road allowances the crossing of which he is asked to sanction.\nParliament has thus made a rigid provision (section 37), where conditions permitted of that being done; and an elastic and adaptable provision where the conditions rendered rigidity unsuitable and undesirable. But in these two provisions the whole subject of the crossing by irrigation works of highways and road allowances, whatever their character, and of the protection of public interests in the matter of travel is, in my opinion, exhaustively dealt with. I therefore conclude that the appellants, who were, of course, obliged to comply with the provisions of section 37, would have been required, in regard to surveyed highways and road allowances to which section 37 does not apply, to submit to and carry out such terms for the protection of the public interest therein as the Commissioner of Public Works when granting them permission to carry their works across such highways and road allowances might have seen fit to impose.\nAt some points where road allowances which were to be crossed would, owing to physical difficulties, be unlikely to become travelled roads (par. 16 of the statement of defence, which is admitted) it might be manifestly unnecessary and unfair to exact the construction of bridges; at others the settlement of the adjacent territory might depend entirely upon the success of the irrigation undertaking and it might well be deemed only reasonable that the owners of lands thus rendered arable should by municipal taxation, or that the state, which would be greatly benefitted, should, out of public revenues, provide such bridges as might become necessary for public travel. In fact the public advantage from the appellants' works as a whole might be so great and their construction so costly, and yet so desirable, that it might well be deemed fair and proper entirely to relieve the company undertaking them from the burden of providing crossing facilities for public travel. All these matters Parliament no doubt intended that the commissioner should consider when dealing with applications for permission to cross highways.\nThat the protection of public interests in highways or road allowances yet untravelled should be confided to the care and judgment of the member of the local government presiding over its Department of Public Works is not only not surprising, but seems to be a natural sequence of the transfer of jurisdiction and control over them to the local legislature, and of the action of that body in making it the duty of that member of the local executive to\ndeal with all questions affecting changes in or obstruction to any road allowance or public highway * * * including the crossing of such road allowances or public highways by irrigation ditches, canals or other works.\nIt is contended that the cutting through highways which the crossing of them by irrigation canals entails is, in reality, a \"closing up\" of such highways and that power to authorize the closing up of roads is reserved to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 28, sec. 20 (D.). But the \"closing up\" which is thus provided for is what occurs where the right of public travel over land reserved as a road allowance or a surveyed highway is entirely taken away and such land is, or may be devoted exclusively to other purposes, whether a substituted or diverted road is or is not provided (see 61 Vict. ch. 32, sec. 5 (D.). The interruption of public travel occasioned by the cutting of an irrigation canal or ditch through it is rather \"a change in or obstruction to the road allowance or highway\" which gives rise to \"questions\"\u2014e.g. what provision will be suitable in the changed circumstances to overcome the obstruction? The public right of way over the part of the road or allowance crossed by the canal is not wholly destroyed or taken away, as it is in the case of the \"closing up\" of a road: it is merely obstructed or interfered with, and must in the future be exercised in a different manner and by the aid of artificial means. The manner in which it should be exercised and upon whom the burden of providing the necessary means should fall are inter alia \"questions\" with which the legislature has made it the duty of the commissioner to \"deal;\" and Parliament has placed persons seeking to exercise rights conferred by the \"North-West Irrigation Act\"\u2014including corporate bodies created by itself for that purpose, such as the defendants \u2014 under the control of the local commissioner in regard to the crossing of surveyed highways and road allowances not theretofore publicly travelled by making his permission to carry the works across them a pre-requisite to obtaining from the Minister of the Interior the necessary authority to construct such works.\nThat it was the deliberate policy of Parliament to place in the hands of a local official the power and the responsibilty of determining what provisions for the protection of public interests should be made in connection with the construction of works which the \"Irrigation Act\" empowers the minister to authorize is further indicated by the clause (section 16) requiring examination and approval of applicants' memorials and of their plans of projected works by the chief engineer and surveyor of the local Department of Public Works as a further preliminary to the grant by the minister of authority to construct such works.\nThe controlling powers of the commissioner must be exercised at the time his permission to cross highways and road allowances is applied for. As I read it that is what the statute provides; and it is only reasonable that it should be so. It must be of the utmost importance to a company undertaking the construction of irrigation works involving an investment of a large amount of capital that it should know what obligations to the public it is obliged to assume. This does not necessarily mean that the commissioner must immediately determine and specify with precision what bridges the company shall build. But he must define the obligations to which it will be subject \u2014both present and future. He may require it to undertake to provide bridges, either merely at stated points, or, as will frequently be necessary, immediately, or within defined periods, at specified points, and in the future at such other points as he may in his discretion from time to time determine. The company, with this knowledge of the obligations which it, must assume, if construction goes on, will be in a position to decide whether it can safely proceed with its project. As I construe the provisions of the \"Irrigation Act,\" the terms or conditions imposed by the Commissioner of Public Works when granting his permit for the crossing of highways and road allowances shewn on the plans of the works filed with him, as required by section 11, are (subject always to the provisions of section 37) the only terms and conditions to which in this matter the rights of the company subsequently obtaining authorization to construct such works from the minister under section 16 are subject. When the commissioner has granted his permit, except as to the enforcement of such terms as it contains or as may have been imposed by him as a condition of its being granted, he is functus. The statute contains no other provision under which such obligations may be created; and, in my opinion, it is equally conclusive against the existence of the suggested common law duty on the part of the company to build bridges over its canals which the commissioner has not, when granting his permit, required it, or reserved the right to require it, to construct.\nThe permit of the commissioner for the crossing shewn on the appellants' original plan imposed no condition except the observance by the company of the provisions of section 37. It was suggested in argument that the commissioner may have assumed that under section 37 the company would, whenever travel should require it, be bound to erect bridges at all points where its works cross road allowances or surveyed highways. This is scarcely conceivable; and were it the fact no obligation on the part of the company in respect of highways not within section 37 would ensue.\nBut, for the respondent, it is urged that in their application for the commissioner's permit the appellants undertook to build bridges at every point where their canals or ditches should cross road allowances or public highways. The appellants' letter on which this contention is based followed a form prescribed by the Minister of the Interior. It reads as follows:\nLETHBRIDGE, January 31, 1899.\nTo the Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\nSIR,\u2014We beg to inform you that we have made application to the Minister of the Interior, under the provisions of the North-West Irrigation Act, for permission to divert water from the St. Mary River on the south-east quarter of section 36, Township 1, Range 25, west of the Fourth meridian for irrigation purposes, and to construct the canals, ditches, reservoirs and other works necessary for the utilization of such water.\nWe have received the authorization for the construction of the works in question, but would point out that in completing such construction it will be necessary, to cross the road allowance or public highway, at the points indicated on the general plan herewith, and we therefore beg to apply for permission under the North-West Territories and Dominion Lands Act to construct and maintain the canals, ditches and reservoirs across the road allowances or public highways at the places indicated in the accompanying plan, the necessary bridge or bridges at these points being constructed and maintained by us as provided by sub-section (b) of section 11 of the North-West Irrigation Act.\nYour obedient servant,\nTHE ALBERTA IRRIGATION COMPANY,\nper C. A. Magrath, Superintendent.\nThe reference at the conclusion of this document to sub-section (b) of section 11 presents some difficulty. As it stands it is meaningless. Counsel for the appellants suggested that this clause of the statute is referred to by mistake and that the reference should have been to section 37. Counsel for the respondent would transpose this concluding phrase and place it at the beginning of the letter.\nThe bridges prescribed by section 37 are to be of a uniform width of 14 feet. The fact that the bridge plan filed by the company shews designs for bridges of 12 feet in width as well as of 14 feet makes it reason- ably clear that the company contemplated at least the possibility of its being required to build other bridges than those for which section 37 provides. Although the form used is certainly full of mistakes, I do not think the reference in it to sub-section (6) of section 11 was inserted in mistake for a reference to section 37.\nNeither can I yield to the suggestion of Mr. Woods. As introductory to the letter the phrase in question would be ungrammatical and inaccurate. It would find its proper place in the second paragraph of the letter between the word \"and\" and the word \"we.\" If it may not be inserted at this point it must be rejected as entirely meaningless and unintelligible. But with it or without it, and wherever it is placed, the letter has the same meaning and effect.\nThe words\nthe necessary bridge or bridges at these points being constructed and maintained by us\nmay have reference either only to bridges prescribed by section 37, or to those bridges and, in addition, to such bridges at other points of crossing as the commissioner should deem it necessary to require as a condition of granting the permit sought. In view of the fact already alluded to that a design for bridges 12 feet wide is shewn on the bridge plan filed by the company with the commissioner, and of the scope of the powers and duties of the commissioner, as I understand them, in regard to granting his permission to carry irrigation canals or ditches across highways or road allowances, I think the latter is the proper construction. The allegation in the 16th paragraph of the statement of defence (which is admitted) that it was unlikely that some of the road allowances to be crossed by the company's canals would ever become public roads and the fact that the Government of the North-West Territories has at different times constructed bridges at points where the company's canals crossed highways then in use but which had not been publicly travelled prior to the construction of the works (par. 14, statement of defence) precludes the contention that the company in its letter of application undertook to construct a bridge at every point where its filed plan shewed that any of its canals or ditches cross a highway or road allowance. Moreover, if that were the intention, the word \"necessary\" before the words \"bridge or bridges\" in the letter, would be superfluous. I read this letter of the company as an undertaking on its part to construct, in addition to the bridges imperatively prescribed by section 37, bridges at other points where its plans shewed that highways or road allowances were to be crossed if the commissioner should deem them necessary and should direct their construction, either when granting his permit or subsequently, pursuant to a reservation of his right to so direct, contained in or made when his permit was granted. The permit actually granted to the appellants limited their obligation in regard to bridges to a compliance with section 37: they were relieved from any duty to construct other bridges presumably either because the commissioner thought other bridges would not be necessary, or because, having regard to all the circumstances, he concluded that any other bridges which might become necessary should be built at the public expense.\nDuring argument the suggestion was made that the company might have carried its canals through tunnels under the highways which they cross, and that having chosen a method of \"crossing\" unnecessarily involving interruption of public travel they must be taken to have done so subject to the burden of providing such means as their action has rendered necessary for the restoration of this public right. No such case is made upon the pleadings. The plans filed by the company and approved by the chief engineer and surveyor shew an open canal. No provision is made for tunnels or culverts under highways. The plans filed make express reference to necessary bridges. The permit granted by the commissioner is to carry the canals \"across\" not \"under\" road allowances and highways. Crossing by open canals or ditches appears to be expressly sanctioned; \"crossing\" by means of tunnels or culverts, assuming its practicability of which there is no evidence, would probably be unauthorized and illegal.\nWith regard to the crossing in township No. 6, it was urged that the appellants had not obtained a permit for it from the commissioner. No such permit is produced and the admission is made that the exhibits filed included\nall the material documents that have ever come into existence.\nThere is, however, in evidence a certificate, from the chief engineer of the Department of Public Works of the North-West Territories given under section 16 of the \"North-West Irrigation Act, 1908,\" that permission had been granted to the appellants by the commissioner to construct their works across this road allowance or highway in township No. 6. If necessary, a verbal permission from the commissioner might be presumed as the foundation of this certificate. The statute does not require it to be in writ- ing. But a sufficient answer to this ground of claim appears to be that no such issue is raised on the pleadings settled by the parties.\nFor these reasons, I am, with great respect, of the opinion, that the defendants are not under any obligation to construct bridges across their canals at the points in question. Their appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court en banc, and this action should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 3 Alta.

B. transferred one-half of his interest to M., who gave valuable consideration therefor with knowledge, at the time, of B.'s agency for the sale cf the lands. Shortly after the conveyance of the lands by the owner, P., to C, they were re-sold to another person at a large profit, and P., having discovered the nature of the transactions, brought action against B., C. and M. to recover the amount of the profits which they had realized upon the re-sale of the lands.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (3 Sask. L.R. 417), Fitz-patrick C.J. and Anglin J. dissenting, that the agreement between B. and C. was a partnership transaction; that C. thereby became subject to the fiduciary relationship existing between B. and P. in respect of the sale of the property; that he was dis- qualified as a purchaser of the lands which were the subject-matter of B.'s agency, and that he was equally responsible with B. to account to P. for the profits realized from the re-sale of the property.\nIn regard to M. it was held, also affirming the judgment appealed from, Idington J. dissenting, that as the evidence did not shew that he was other than a bon\u00e0 fide purchaser for valuable consideration he was under no obligation to account for profits realized upon the sale of the interest in the lands acquired by him under the transfer from B.\nQucere.\u2014On the appeal by C. against the judgment declaring him liable to account for illegitimate profits on the transactions in question, had the Supreme Court of Canada jurisdiction to entertain a cross-appeal by P. to obtain recourse against M. who had been exonerated in the court below and was not made a party to the appeal taken by C.? McNichol v. Malcolm (39 Can. S.C.R. 265 ) discussed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1] by which the judgment of Johnstone J., at the trial[2], was varied.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nAt the trial, the plaintiff's action against the defendants Bate, Coy and Murison (purchasers under the deed of the lands in question from him to Coy), was maintained with costs, and dismissed with costs in regard to DeVeber, who had become purchaser on the re-sale of the property. The defendants Coy and Murison appealed to the Supreme Court, en banc, and, by the judgment now appealed from, the judgment at the trial was affirmed in regard to the condemnation against Coy, but was reversed in regard to Murison and the judgment against him was set aside with costs. . The appeal by Coy sought no relief against either Bate or Murison, and neither of them was made a party on his appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The plaintiff, however, attempted to obtain relief against the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in so far as it dismissed his action against Murison and, in that respect to have the judgment of the trial court restored.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellant.\nStraton for the respondent.\nJ. Travers Lewis K.C. for defendant Murison, on the cross-appeal.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting on the main appeal).\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDavies J.\u2014At the close of the argument I was strongly of opinion that the judgment appealed from was right and that the appeal and the cross-appeal should both be dismissed. Owing to there being a difference of opinion as to the proper conclusion to be drawn from the evidence, I have gone through it carefully, and my study of it has only tended to confirm the opinion I formed when the argument closed.\nI think the transaction between Bate and Coy for the purchase of the land in the name of Coy, but for the benefit of Bate and Coy alike, was a partnership transaction, pure and simple. It was not like the ordinary purchase of a piece of land by two persons in their joint names, each holding a several interest which he could dispose of as he pleased, and where each party had a right to partition.\nThis purchase was made as the facts shew as a speculation with the view of a speedy re-sale. The fact that Bate was the agent for sale of Pommerenke was well known to Coy, who stipulated at the time he entered into the bargain that he (Coy) should share in Bate's commission on the sale of his principal's land. An agreement in writing was entered into between the two partners (and conspirators) providing not only that they should be equal joint-owners of the land, but\nthat they should share equally on all profits made on a sale of the same or any part of same, and should each be liable equally for any liabilities in connection with the purchase or sale.\nThis agreement for the sale was taken in Coy's name alone, and the agreement as to the mutual interests of Bate and Coy in the purchase was post-dated, no doubt to deceive any inquisitive parties into the belief that Pommerenke's agent, Bate, had first completed a sale to Coy and then afterwards re-purchased an interest bon\u00e0 fide in the lands.\nI am satisfied that both parties knew a fraud was being committed upon the owner in the purchase of the land by his agent, Bate, in Coy's name, but for their joint benefit. It is conceded that if the principal, Pommerenke, had discovered the fraud practiced upon him by his agent, Bate, in which Coy participated, before the lands had passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser he could have had the contract of sale rescinded. As he was too late in discovering the fraud to do that it is in my opinion still open to him to make both Bate and Coy restore their illegitimate profits. Bate has not appealed from the judgment against him. The evidence of Coy and Bate alike satisfy me that the land was purchased as a speculation, with the intention of reaping in the near future a rich harvest through a re-sale, an intention more than realized, and that it was a partnership transaction and intended to be such, both parties sharing alike in the agent's commission and in the net profits; and entering into it with full knowledge of all the facts.\nAgreeing, as I do, with the court of appeal on this being the proper conclusion to be drawn from the proved facts, I cannot see any room for doubt that Coy, equally with Bate, is accountable with the plaintiff for the profits made by the partnership in the resale of the lands to DeVeber, an innocent purchaser for value.\nThe authorities, if any were needed, are marshalled in the judgment of the court of appeal, delivered by Mr. Justice Brown, and need not be repeated by me. I adopt his reasoning and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAs far as Murison is concerned I also think the judgment of the court of appeal correct. He stood in an entirely different position from Coy and I agree with the court of appeal that\nthe plaintiff had not brought home to Murison any knowledge that Bate was a joint-purchaser with Coy from the plaintiff, or that there had been any breach of trust on his part.\nI share with my brother Anglin the grave doubts he has expressed whether the appeal of the respondent Pommerenke from the judgment dismissing the action as against Murison is properly before the court. Murison was not made a party to the main appeal taken by Coy, and is not before us as a party to that appeal. Coy has no interest whatever in the relief sought by Pommerenke against Murison in the cross-appeal, nor has he anything to do with the plaintiff's case against Murison. Murison is brought here, not by the appellant Coy, but by the respondent Pommerenke, who does not appeal from the judgment dismissing the action against Murison nor give the necessary security for costs which such an appeal would involve, . but seeks to have the judgment in Murison's favour reversed on a notice under rule 100 of this court. I am inclined to think the decision relied upon by Mr. Straton in support of this method of cross-appeal of McNichol v. Malcolm[3] is not applicable to parties standing in the relative positions of Pommerenke and Murison on these pleadings and appeals.\nThe facts in that case of McNichol were that McNichol and the Standard Plumbing Company were both defendants in an action for damages brought by Malcolm against them. The plaintiff had obtained a judgment at the trial against both defendants. The Court of appeal confirmed the judgment against McNichol and dismissed the action as against the Standard Plumbing Company. McNichol appealed to this court making his co-defendants respondents on his appeal. It was there held that the plaintiff, respondent, Malcolm was entitled to cross-appeal by notice against the defendant, respondent, the Plumbing Company, in order to have the verdict against them at the trial restored.\nThe facts of that appeal, I think, fairly distinguish it from this which is an attempt on the part of Pommerenke by way of cross-appeal to bring forward a claim he made in the action against Murison, in which claim the main appellant Coy has no interest.\nOn the merits, however, and without deciding the point of practice my judgment is that the cross-appeal against Murison should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by the court of appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting on the cross-appeal) \u2014 The questions raised in this case are whether or not an agent can, with the assistance of others, buy the property of his principal upon the understanding with each assistant for a division of the profits, to be got by a re-sale, being made between him and each of such others aiding in the purchase; and he or these others be free from liability to account for the profit so made.\nLike many other legal questions they are almost answered by a full statement of the facts and the application of a few elementary principles.\nThe respondent owned a piece of land in Saskatchewan, supposed to be about two hundred and thirty-three acres. One Bate, after several ineffective attempts, induced him, by a letter of the 31st of March, 1906, to agree that Bate should, as agent, sell upon commission said land at the highest price obtainable, but not for less than thirty dollars an acre, and get a commission of five per cent. for the first $1,000, two and a half per cent. for the balance up to $30 an acre, and ten per cent. on such sum as realized over f 30 an acre.\nAppellant and Bate occupied the same office in Saskatoon, and Bate verbally offered him this land for |35 an acre, and appellant says he verbally accepted it.\nThen Bate sent, the same day, the 31st of March, 1906, respondent who lived in Minnesota, the following telegram:\nSold thirty-five per acre, third cash, deposited, balance four years, mailing agreements and cash according to instructions, on receipt of acceptance wire confirmation. No cash had been paid as represented, nor was any agreement then mailed.\nOn the 2nd of April, 1906, a telegram from respondent to Bate as follows:\nConfirm sale of two hundred and thirty-three and fraction acres at thirty-five per acre,\nwas received at the telegraph office in. Saskatoon, at four minutes past eight in the evening of that day.\nWhether it was delivered that evening or next morning is doubtful. But it seems clear that the next step taken was Bate calling on Murison, agent of a bank with which Bate had dealings, early on the morning of the 3rd of April.\nBate's evidence of this is as follows:\nQ. How did you come to make up your mind? In what way\u2014 what circumstances?\nA. On the morning of the 3rd passing down to my place of business I called on Mr. Murison. I told him the evening before that I had sold this land to Mr. Coy and we were talking about that and other matters. On the morning of the 3rd, I think it would be before the bank was opened, and talking with Mr. Murison, discussing matters in general, the prospects of a purchaser making anything out of his purchase, and Mr. Murison was of the opinion that this investor was threatened in his investments and there might be a reasonable chance for this property being sold at an advance before very long, and the outcome of our conversation was that I was recommended to ask Mr. Coy if he would allow us to buy a half interest from him.\nQ. What did you do in consequence of this?\nA. I went to see him and asked if he would let me have a half interest.\nQ. What was the result of that?\nA. He was surprised that I should ask such a question and asked where I was getting the money, and I told him that Mr. Murison had suggested it \u2014 that it had been suggested in our conversation, and Mr. Murison was willing to help me to finance a quarter interest and he himself would take a quarter interest and thus become joint purchasers in a half interest from Coy. Mr. Coy objected to having anything to do with Murison.\nQ. What did you do as a result of this?\nA. It was agreed between Coy and myself that if I would purchase a half interest from him myself and Murison not appear in it he would make no objection.\nQ. Was the agreement put in writing?\nA. Not at that time.\nAlthough he pretends in this to have told Murison the evening before, the latter does not refer to it so as to corroborate him. His cross-examination indicates he did nothing till seeing Murison on the 3rd. In other respects their story seems to conform with the fact of the despatch being received and pondered over by him, before seeing either appellant or Murison. And it seems clear from the evidence of them all that it was only after seeing Murison and arranging with him to see the appellant that the latter saw the telegram. He was asked again, and says:\u2014\nQ. Did Mr. Coy want to take all of this property?\nA. Certainly, he wanted to take it all.\nQ. Why did he not?\nA. Just because I asked in pursuance of that conversation Mr. Murison and I had, if he would sell us a portion of it.\nLater he says as follows:\nQ. In your examination for discovery you say that Coy objected to Murison and you shoulder the whole responsibility?\nA. No, he preferred to have another man to deal with.\nQ. He did not want to have Murison's responsibility as well?\nA. He did not want to have anything to do with Murison.\nThe story of appellant on his first hearing of this confirmatory telegram on the 2nd of April, is as follows:\nQ. When did he first tell you about receiving this confirmation wire?\nA. On the morning of the 3rd of April in the forenoon.\nQ. What else took place at the time he told you he had received the confirming wire?\nA. When he came in he said he had heard from the owner confirming the price of the land, but, he says, I want it to be understood that I am to have a half-interest, and, of course, I kicked against it. I remonstrated; I would not agree. I told him he was not in a position to go into a deal of this kind, and I did not want him in; that I did not think he was treating me fair; that he had quoted the price at $30 and had raised it to $35, and now he made it a condition that I could only purchase half of it, and I had not decided the matter any way. I told him what I thought about him; at the time I believed what he told me. He assured me he was the sole agent for the owner.\nQ. Was Murison's name brought up?\n\u00c0. I asked him how he was going to manage it in view of his financial standing, and he told me Murison was a friend of his and he would furnish the money.\nHe proceeds to tell that Bate in answer to these and other remonstrances said if he (Coy) would not take the half interest, he, Bate, would turn it over to others who would purchase with him and that it seemed to him (Coy) as if he must submit to such terms as Bate offered, or lose the chance of anything. He did not even know the name of the owner, so much unfinished was Bate's business as agent.\nAfter taking some hours to consider the matter and consult friends, he finally agreed with Bate to buy jointly with him.\nThe details of the sordid business may be passed. It ended in the following writing being signed by both:\nWe, William H. Coy and William P. Ba, both of the town of Saskatoon, real estate agents, having jointly purchased from August Pommerenke, of Good Thunder, Minnesota, the N. half of section 34, Tp. 36, R. 5, W. 3rd M., 233 acres, more or less, on agreement of sale dated April 3rd, 1906, and having paid jointly the first payment thereon,\nAgree as Follows:\n1. That the title to the said land shall remain in the name of William H. Coy.\n2. That the said William H. Coy and William P. Bate shall be joint owners of this land equally in all profits made on sale of any part thereof, and are each liable equally for any liabilities, in connection with the purchase or sale thereof.\nSigned in duplicate this 5th day of April, 1906.\nWitness: E. L. Townsend.\nW. H. Coy.\nWilliam P. Ba The commission Bate was to get divided between them so far as this half-interest extended, by Bate agreeing to be satisfied with half of what respondent would have to allow. And appellant the same afternoon gave Bate his cheque for $1,246, being for half the cash payment going to respondent on this half-basis plus this half commission; and the appellant signed the agreement for sale and purchase as if he were sole purchaser and respondent the sole vendor.\nOn the same day Murison discounted Bate's note in the bank for $400, to help him to make up his share of cash for the other half of the cash payment and gave his own cheque of $623.25, being for a quarter of such cash payment plus the amount of his share of the commission Bate was supposed to be earning on the same basis as appellant had been dealt with.\nThen, to accompany the agreement of purchase a draft was got from the bank of which Murison was agent for $2,408 to remit to Pommerenke the cash payment of one-third, less Bate's commission, and the curious can figure out the allowance for bank charges on the draft.\nBut the honest man forgot the excess commission for the part of the price over $30 an acre.\nAnd to shew his great fidelity to his principal, when this was pointed out he explained his reason thus:\nQ. In that case you told Mr. Coy about the five and two and a half per cent., and not about the ten per cent?\nA. No, I could not.\nQ. Why did you not tell h?\nA. If I had told him that the whole sale would have been thrown out. I had still to see Pommerenke's interest through.\nQ. You were afraid the whole thing was going to fall through if you told him that?\nA. Yes. Q. That was in conversation on the -3rd, that this commission was mentioned?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So that at that time you did not have the thing so completely closed that Coy could back out if he wanted to do it?\nA. One can always throw away.\nThe writing above quoted shews that he and appellant considered each other partners, and in his examination for discovery put in as evidence, he refers to Murison as his partner.\nQ. On what, Mr. Bate, on the whole land? Who was interested in that land at the time the money went?\nA. We were all interested.\nQ. When you say all, what do you mean?\nA. Murison and I and Coy.\nQ. And that was the first payment Pommerenke got?\nA. Yes.\nThe defendants Bate and Murison entered into the following agreement:\nSaskatoon, Sask., April 4th, 1906.\nWilliam H. Coy, of Saskatoon, being owner under agreement to purchase from August Pommerenke, of Good Thunder, Minn., the N. half of Section 34, Tp. 36, R. 5, W. 3rd M., 233 1-3 acres, and having purchased from the said W. H. Coy a half-interest in the said land (title remaining with W. H. Coy for the time being) on an agreement made between myself and W. H. Coy whereby I am entitled to receive one-half of all profits made on sale of the said land or any part of it, and whereby I am also liable for one-half of all future payments and charges in connection with the purchase and sale of the said land.\nI agree to sell to W. J. Holt Murison, banker, of Saskatoon, for value received, one-half of my interest as above, he being now entitled to receive one-fourth of all profits and bear one-fourth of the charges on account purchase and sale of the above land.\n(Sgd.) William P. Bate.\nSaskatoon, April 4th, 1906.\nThese several agreements between the parties are by reason of the dates they bear confusing. They may have been made purposly so or by accident.\nThe learned trial judge finds they were, in fact, all made on the same day. I think he is correct in substance. Whatever dates they bear they evidently represent the transactions as arranged and concluded on the 3rd of April, 1906. Possibly time did not permit of them all being signed on that date and hence the confusing dates.\nIt is clear respondent was entirely ignorant of them, and was kept from knowing of them till after the property had been re-sold, as it was, for $125 an acre, in the beginning of August following; and he had been paid the following November the balance and given a deed to the appellant. The parties fell out and had some litigation over the fruits of their ill-gotten gain. Then one of them had the impudence to ask respondent for a ratification to overcome the defect in title to the profits this breach of trust produced.\nHe then sued to recover the profits unaccounted for to him, and the learned trial judge in a well considered judgment, gave judgment for the plaintiff against each of the several parties for his share of said profits.\nBate did not appeal. But Murison and Coy did, and the court of appeal held Coy and Bate liable, but relieved Murison by dismissing the action against him. And Coy now appeals here, and Pommerenke cross-appeals as against Murison.\nIn this cross-appeal objection is taken to the jurisdiction, and I will deal with that point hereafter.\nMeantime, I will consider the law applicable to the case as it stands on these facts relative to each of the parties. It is well to bear in mind that Bate had concluded no sale or indeed a legally binding bargain of any kind until the agreement of purchase had been executed by appelant and that was not done until after Bate had completed with each of his fellow adventurers the bargain for contributions on a settled basis for a division of burdens and for a corresponding division of profits.\nThe appellant's counsel put forward as his chief argument the interpretation he asks to be given the letters of Bate when tendering his valuable services to respondent. He contended the retainer of Bate was only to find a purchaser, and when that was done his duty ended, and he was as free as any other man to re-purchase. I cannot put the interpretation contended for even an Bate's letters, and we have not the letter from respondent to Bate authorizing the sale. His evidence states it to have been\nto go ahead and sell these lands for the highest price obtainable, etc., etc.,\nand Bate's version of it does not differ materially from this.\nBut in any way one can look at the facts, there was no sale of any kind, that either respondent or appellant could have relied upon until the corrupt bargains now complained of were reached.\nNeither party knew who the other was or where he was. No description of the land was given in the telegram, and, in short, nothing to bind the purchaser to be found, or respondent either, unless he was to be held by his assent, induced by a lying telegram, to something that had only a nebulous existence.\nIt seems simply impossible to maintain any such contention in face of these facts I have stated. It would relieve Bate as well as the appellant, but the former has had the good sense not to try to be so; since he knew the law. It would be needless to quote law to condemn Bate herein, but as there seems to be a misapprehension of an agent's true position and, consequently, that of those dealing with him, it is necessary to have an accurate statement of the law. Fortunately we have it on undoubted authority. In Parker v. McKenna[4], at page 125, Sir G. Mellish L.J. in dealing with the question of how far an agent for sale is precluded from purchasing from his own purchaser the property which he is entrusted to sell, says:\nIn my opinion, as long as the contract remains executory, and the trustee or agent has power to enforce it or to rescind or alter it, as long as it remains in that state he cannot re-purchase the property from his own purchaser, except for the benefit of his principal. It appears to me that that necessarily follows from the established rule that he cannot purchase the property on his own account\nIf we had sought to frame the law to fit the facts which surrounded this bargaining between Bate and his partners, how could it have been more accurately expressed to shew that his position was a false one, and the contracts made with him were founded on a fraud and, until full disclosure to respondent, it was obviously so to the minds of both appellant and Murison, if they had chosen to exercise ordinary business sense and rectitude of purpose.\nAppellant's contract seems at first blush the more gross of the two, for he plainly Avrites himself down as the partner of this unfaithful agent; and avowedly the commission was divided and he believed himself let in on the ground floor by paying half of it for or on account of his half.\nBut there is a feature of his conduct that deserves at least a passing notice. He bowed to what seemed to him the inevitable if he was to get any interest in the sale. He bribed this agent by allowing him as the reward of his breach of faith, one-half the profits expected to be made, plus or minus, as one looks at it, half the commission.\nThe law relative to such a case is well expressed by A. L. Smith L. J., in Grant v. Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate, in appeal[5], at page 244, as follows:\nThe case in this court of the Salford Corporation v. Lever[6] is a clear authority that where an agent, who has been bribed to do so, induces his principal to enter into a contract with a person who bad paid the bribe, and the contract is disadvantageous to the principal, the principal has two distinct and cumulative remedies; he may recover from the agent the amount of the bribe which he has received, and he may also recover from the agent and the person who has paid the bribe, jointly or severally, damages for any loss which he has sustained by reason of entering into the contract without allowing any deduction in respect of what he has recovered from the agent under the former head, and it is immaterial whether the principal sues the agent or the third person first. This is the head-note of this case, and it accurately describes what was decided thereon.\nThe law applied here would render the transaction one in which the respondent on this ground alone would have been entitled to sue the agent for the bribe he got, in other words, the profits he made, and also the appellant and him for the damages suffered. It is answered he suffered no damages because at the time of the transaction this land was not worth more in the open market than the respondent got; yet each gave more, to the extent of the half commission at least, than the net money sent him. Besides the mode of reasoning is entirely fallacious. The fact is the bribed agent had no authority in law at all to make such a sale, and the appellant knowing this, and joining in it, never got any valid agreement of sale as against the respondent. The result was he had no agreement which in law he could have enforced against the respondent; see Williams v. Scott[7]; Delves v. Gray[8]; and cases cited there, if authority needed for so plain a proposition of law.\nAnd this was the legal position of the matter and the relation of the appellant and respondent at the time when the former made a re-sale of the property and got the profits respondent was entitled to.\nIt was then, or later, by a continued concealment of the facts, that the respondent was thereby induced to convey the property to appellant and soon after which he reconveyed the land to another who was equally innocent with respondent of the facts.\nSurely then is the time when the acts of the appellant and Bate had borne final and definite fruit and the legal wrong was committed upon which damage should be assessed. Until then perhaps no damages could be properly assessed. So long as able to restore the property undeteriorated and undepreciated in value, could he not answer any suit by a tender thereof and costs?\nI am prepared to hold that such is the legal position of both Bate and appellant and that the damages as a result might well have been assessed jointly against them, both on the basis of the entire profits of all concerned being the measure thereof.\nBut it appears to me there is another and a broader ground upon which the right of relief against appellant may well rest. Bate, by his contract, above set out, with the appellant, constituted himself the constructive trustee of respondent and Coy equally became so thereby, also such, if the terse language of Lord Thurlow be good law, as undoubtedly it is, in Hall v. Hallet[9], at page 139, when he says the court will\nturn Hallet and Scrase (the nominal purchaser there) into trustees for the benefit of the family,\nand liable to have his agreement or any deed to him rescinded and hence becomes accountable for all the profits he, or he and his confederates, might make and did make.\nIt is apparently conceded that if this agent's duty had not ended before the bargain between the agent and the appellant was made and reduced to writing as above, the contract for purchase or deed if given appellant would have been rescindable, but it is persistently urged that when the land passed into the hands of the defendant DeVeber, who took for value and without notice, the respondent had practically no remedy as against any one but the agent.\nThis is put in two ways. First, it is said the only remedy would be damages assessable as of the date of the bargain. That view I have dealt with. Next, it is said there was no fiduciary relation between the appellant and respondent, and that the cases shew such relation is the basis of the right of recovery of profits an agent may have made.\nSo is fiduciary relation the basis of the right to recover in most eases of undue influence. There can be no doubt that appellant put himself in the position of a constructive trustee of this property, just as much as if his partner Bate had induced this result by undue influence. The respondent had not, as I have already shewn, become bound in law, and if the deed had been executed and passed to appellant the title on the day before he made the sale with such profits, he could have been compelled to return the property. The court never found itself in such a case so impotent that it could one day thus remedy a great wrong and the next day be powerless to do so. In such cases it proceeds by reaching the proceeds and specially so if the money in the court, as it is said to be herein, The reported cases where proceeds had to be reached in third parties' hands, are not so numerous as those of reconveyance or rescission being found on adequate remedy. The principle, however, is undoubted, and the remedy is identical with what was exercised in the Imperial Mercantile Credit Association v. Coleman[10] as against Knight; in Bagnall v. Carlton[11], at page 408, as against 0. F. Richardson. But as between the principal and the agent, and latter's nominee, see McPherson v. Watt[12], at pages 264 and 265; and Charter v. Trevelyan[13], and its sequel Trevelyan v. Charter[14].\nThe law on this subject is well stated in Lewin on Trusts (12 ed.), pages 207, 214, 567, 798, 1099 et seq.; Godefroi on Trusts (3 ed.), page 416, but perhaps most aptly by Fry J. in the undue influence case of Bainbrigge v. Browne[15], at pages 196 to 197, where he says:\nThen the next point which arises is this, against whom does this inference of undue influence operate? Clearly it operates against the person who is able to exercise the influence (in this case it is the father) and, in my judgment, it would operate against every volunteer who claimed under him, and also against every person who claimed under him with notice of the equity thereby created, or with notice of the circumstances from which the court infers the equity.\nAnd I can find no distinction in this regard between undue influence and any other improper means of getting from a man his property. I am not saying-it need be rested only on this, or dealt with only in this way, for In re Gallard[16] shews how Vaughan-Williams J. found his way to assess damages when he could not justly set aside the whole transaction.\nBesides, though the court has in some cases, as in the Salford Corporation v. Lever[17] case, not found it clear as to the form of action which might lie, whether for damages or for money had and received, some suitable means in law has always been found to remedy such wrongs. But the form of remedy chosen in a given case may limit the extent of relief.\nAnd again the evidence would well warrant a finding that each of these defendants, Murison and Coy, knowingly aided the agent to commit the breach of confidence his principal had placed in him and thus became responsible for the results of such fraud.\nThe court of appeal has seen its way to relieve Murison, but I cannot agree in the reasons given therefor.\nIn the judgment of Mr. Justice Brown, speaking for the majority of the court, he says:\nThe fact that Murison was aware that Bate had been an agent for the plaintiff in the sale to Coy is not sufficient, it seems to me, to charge Murison with the knowledge that he (Bate) was the purchaser jointly with Coy from the plaintiff. To make Murison liable it must be shewn that he was aware that Bate was secretly purchasing from his principal, or that fiduciary relations between them still existed.\nHow can it be said that Murison did not know that the fiduciary relations between respondent and Bate had still existed when the latter was in the very act of continuing to a close the discharge of his duty as an agent when collecting from Murison his contribution to the cash payment, and at the same instant he was discounting a note to help Bate to make up his share of same cash. Is it conceivable he was so stupid as not to realize what was being thus done and he taking part in? Or is it conceivable he was not shewn the telegram which it was clearly Bate's mission to the bank so early in the morning of the 3rd to shew, and see if he could get some aid either to contrive against both Coy and Pommerenke, as they did, or financial assistance to carry out what he had already contrived?\nIf he saw the telegram it told the whole story. He has not seen fit to deny seeing it. And even Bate will not deny shewing it to him. Or how can it be supposed, if Coy was as well able as Bate says he was, to carry the whole load, Murison could imagine he was going to give up half to Bate and himself?\nAnd are we to suppose a bank agent so blind to the business side of such a transaction as not to inquire in what shape the agreement of sale, was, and how he was to be secured for the advance he was making, and the future payments he was undertaking? And then there is much one cannot help suspecting relative to the blindness as to, or forgetfulness of all the details.\nHe paid on the identical basis appellant did, which included the division of the commission.\nNow he tenders an affidavit by way of laying foundation for a new trial in which he pretends this was an oversight.\nIs it conceivable that at the stage things had reached when he gave his evidence under commission, he had not yet discovered the bearing of what he now professes was a mistake?\nI rather think there was a mistake of some kind as to this commission, but the mistake is not to my mind in the sense Murison suggests.\nFor the basis of his dealing was to take with Bate the half of what Coy got.\nAnd the tenor of Bate's evidence, as friendly as possible, goes to shew Bate was the emissary of Murison. Are we to take it for granted he reported nothing of what was said relative to Coy's dislike for having Murison as a partner.\nAnd if told what was the result? As a business man he needed Coy's sanction and the safety it would carry. But he was content to take the document from Bate which appears above and where does that leave him?\nClearly he was only entitled to claim such share of the profits as were coming to Coy through Bate. It was for profits he bargained and to be got from a man who had no right to any, and was accountable for them to respondent alone.\nWhy should any court step in to aid him and frustrate the righteous claim of another?\nThe judgment of the learned trial judge was right so far as it went, and Murison is not entitled to be relieved from it.\nHe may be thankful he has only that limited judgment against him, for the learned trial judge might well have held he was the man to blame for the whole of this disagreeable business. His plain duty, as well as that of appellant, was, if desiring to buy, to have disclosed to the respondent what Bate, his agent, proposed. Possibly he might have given either a chance if thus properly treated.\nI need not repeat what I have already assigned as reasons against Coy. But may say, barring the bribing feature, not quite so applicable here, the reasoning applies as against Murison.\nA question of jurisdiction is raised by Murison's counsel relative to the hearing of this cross-appeal.\nThe appellant having launched his appeal against the respondent, he in turn gave notice by way of cross-appeal pursuant to rules 60 and 61.\nThis notice was moved against before me, in chambers, and relying upon the principle upon which Mc-Nichol v. Malcolm[18] had proceeded, and Pilling v. The Attorney-General for Canada, unreported, must \"have proceeded, the motion was dismissed.\nNo appeal was taken from this order, but Muritson's counsel now takes the point that the court has no jurisdiction to entertain, as against Murison, a cross-appeal thus founded.\nWhatever may be said of the interpretation put upon rule 60, it is somewhat difficult to understand -wherein the want of jurisdiction consists.\nSection 51 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" is as follows:\nThe court may dismiss an appeal or give the judgment and award the process or other proceedings which the court, whose decision is .appealed against, should have given or awarded.\nSection 52 enables granting a new trial even if put upon the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence.\nWhat do these sections mean? Has the court no jurisdiction to grant a new trial herein as desired below by Murison, except as between parties named by appellant, unless a substantive appeal for that purpose has been taken?\nThat result would be one of the many absurdities implied in holding we have no jurisdiction to hear anything involving Murison.\nThe language giving jurisdiction is, express and ample enough to cover getting aside or varying in any way the judgment of the court appealed from. Why should the jurisdiction be frittered away?\nThe judges are empowered by section 109 to make rules for regulating the procedure of the court and the bringing of cases before it from courts appealed from or otherwise and for the effectual execution and working of the Act and the attainment of its intention and objects. This is one of those rules so made for such purposes. But the court has no power to limit its jurisdiction. It can only makes rules conformably to the executing of its jurisdiction. Of course, if parties do not conform to these rules they may have no right to invoke the jurisdiction. That is another matter, but does not touch the jurisdiction. And this rule 60 so far from implying any limitation of jurisdiction assumes it to exist and provides for overcoming even the irregularity of a non-compliance with its terms. How can the question of jurisdiction be raised upon such a rule? But the point has been expressly passed upon by the court in the case of Town of Toronto Junction v. Christie[19], where the appeal was from an award and the amount was increased though no cross-appeal notice given.\nThe late Chief Justice, Sir Henry Strong, pointed out and dealt with this question in clear and comprehensive terms, holding that it was not because the court had no jurisdiction to hear without, the notice, but that it was usually fair to require the notice, but entirely in the discretion of the court. The earlier case of Pilon v. Brunet[20] deprived respondent, who had lodged his substantive appeal and not proceeded by way of notice as rules provided, of any costs but such as latter simple method would have incurred.\nIt may be said these are only cases between the same parties, but as touching questions of jurisdiction wherein lies the difference? The rights of an appellant in a judgment cannot be disturbed any more than those of any other party to the suit without jurisdiction. And if an appellant had got on one branch of his case, say one cause of action, a judgment, and failed in another and distinct cause of action, is it to be said, on an appeal in the latter, not touching the former, he cannot be attacked without a substantive appeal? And that a cross-appeal notice is not enough?\nThe purpose of the order was to lessen the costs of such a proceeding and so simplify matters that once an appeal has been launched and the whole case before the court, the simple method the court provides for executing the purpose of the Act and enabling the judgment the court should have given, to be given, is reached thereby.\nThis principle of acting was adopted in the McNichol v. Malcolm case[21], and if doing so had stretched the jurisdiction of the court, surely the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council would have granted instead of refusing, as it did, leave to appeal[22]. Then, as pointed ont in my judgment disposing of the Chamber motion herein, the decision of the unreported Pilling Case, clearly disposed of the question not only of jurisdiction, but of practice. The brief of authorities submitted in that case by counsel moving to quash shew the grounds taken were on the interpretation of the rule and the peculiar nature of the case which I am about to refer to and had no reference to the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nCounsel for Murison suggests now that the appeal in that case was from the Exchequer Court, and hence by the Attorney-General, and hence the motion to quash could not prevail.\nIt is true it was from the Exchequer Court and by the Attorney-General, but it is just as true (as an inspection of his notice shews) that he neither intended to avail himself of section 84 of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" nor to pursue any other right than given by rules 60 and 61. The motion was merely that on the hearing of the appeal, which two out of five men affected by a judgment of that court had taken to this court, he (the Attorney-General) would urge that both the appellants and three others who had rested content with the result, and were seeking no relief, should have the judgment as to them all, so varied as to affect each though interested only as to separate amounts; and resting on independent rights, originating, however, in the same cause of complaint.\nNone of the conditions to be observed in this special right of appeal were, so far as I can find, ever thought of as applicable or observed.\nHow then can the fact of the Crown having had another right of appeal, which it did not exercise, and could not exercise, save by observing the conditions, affect the matter? This court has no power to dispense with statutory conditions precedent to an appeal by the Crown or any one else. Security is only one term from which the Crown may be free. Time and mode binds as others are bound.\nI repeat, everything in that case involved the right and power to hear, on a cross-appeal motion, an appeal against those not connected in any way with the main appeal.\nBesides it was an extreme exercise of the power.\nThe proceeding was a winding-up one and each of these five men proved his claim therein, by prima facie proof, and had the case rested there I should have felt the cross-appeal by way of motion could not reach them.\nI was only persuaded in that case that by reason of an issue having been framed and tried so far as I could find out, wherein all five joined and made common cause, they fell under the usual practice adopted by the court. All this, including my difficulty, appears in my own opinion judgment in the case.\nThe case was appealed from here and though leave was refused to appeal on all points save this lastly mentioned point; as to which leave was given.\nThat is entirely another matter from the question raised here, but does bear directly on the statement and argument presented here.\nIf the proceeding in the case had been aught but a cross-motion appeal, how could any court have ever supposed there was a want of jurisdiction to hear it? If it had been the substantive appeal the Attorney-General is suggested in this argument to have taken or relied on, how could any one have ventured to ask the Judicial Committee to grant leave on the ground of want of jurisdiction? Yet it was granted because of the ground I suggest, not the ground taken here.\nMoreover, in the case of Bulmer v. The Queen[23] this court refused to hear an appeal taken by the Crown because the proceedings had not conformed to the requirements of these rules 60 and 61, and thus disposes of the argument from another point of view.\nIt may also be observed that in the case of Johnston v. Town of Petrolia[24], as an interpretation of the rule claimed to be substantially the same as rule 60, the court exercised the power in the rule to allow the appeal. And the Cavander's Trusts Case[25], closely examined does not even touch the practice here questioned. The appellant here was, and is much or might be much affected by respondent Pommerenke's claim against Murison. Is Coy prepared altogether to share the burden for Murison ?\nI have no doubt of the jurisdiction to hear the cross-appeal and rectify the error below.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs, the cross-appeal allowed with costs, and respondent have his costs in the court of appeal, and the learned trial judge's judgment be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014I think there is sufficient evidence to support the finding of the court below that Coy was a partner of Bate in the purchase and that Bate's commission was divided between them as a part of the profits of the partnership. Coy thus came under a fiduciary relation to Pommerenke in respect of the sale and the legal result of this relation was to disqualify him from purchasing the lands which were the subject-matter of the agency without the consent of Pommerenke. He stood, I think, in the same position as Bate. He would be liable to account as Bate was. I think Murison is not implicated in the same way. In his case the proper inference seems to be that drawn in the court below, namely: that he was unaware of the true relation between Coy and Bate, and being unaware of the impropriety of their conduct could, of course, incur no disability on account of his failure to disclose it to Pommerenke. As against Murison, an innocent purchaser, I do not think Pommerenke can deny the authority of Bate to sell.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J. (dissenting on the main appeal).\u2014 Upon the evidence it is well established that the defendant Bate, without the vendor's knowledge, acquired an interest in the property in question while still holding a fiduciary position as vendor's agent, and that he made use of that position to compel his co-defendant Coy to allow him to acquire such interest. Apart from any question of fraud, Bate is, on well-known principles, accountable to the plaintiff for whatever profit he has made upon the re-sale of the property. Against the judgment holding him liable to so account he has not appealed.\nIt is equally clear that there was an entire absence of bad faith on the part of the defendant Coy, who appeals from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan holding him likewise accountable to the plaintiff for profits made by him on the re-sale of the property. Bate was the sole agent of the plaintiff. Coy had through him agreed to purchase the property wholly for himself, at the price at which it was eventually bought, before there was any suggestion that Bate should take an interest in it. His offer had been submitted by Bate to the plaintiff and had been approved and accepted by him. Apart from the Statute of Frauds, and possibly notwithstanding its provisions, Coy had an enforceable contract to purchase. With matters in this position Bate pressed Coy to allow him to acquire a half interest in the purchase-Coy was unwilling to do so; but, upon Bate insisting, fearing that, if he refused, Bate might dispose of the property to another purchaser, he yielded, and agreed to take a half interest only, giving the other half interest to Bate, and stipulating that Bate should give him one-half of the commission which he was to receive from the plaintiff. It is quite clear that Coy had no idea of doing anything which would injure the plaintiff. His conduct is not open to any suggestion of fraud or dishonesty. His fault lay in permitting Bate to become a co-purchaser with him, knowing that Bate was concealing from his principal the fact that he was acquiring an interest in the property.\nThe learned trial judge and the majority of the learned judges in the court en banc have held Coy accountable to the plaintiff for the profit made by him on the re-sale to DeVeber on the ground that he and Bate became partners in the purchase from the plaintiff. It may be that if Coy and Bate were really partners in this transaction, notwithstanding the views upon which the decisions in Stroud v. Gwyer[26], at page 141, and Macdonald v. Richardson[27], at page 88, were based, on the authority of such cases as Flockton v. Bunning[28], and Imperial Mercantile Credit Association v. Coleman[29], the defendant Coy would be accountable to the plaintiff for profits made by him on the re-sale of the property.\nBut upon the facts in evidence Coy and Bate were, in my opinion, not partners. Notwithstanding the stipulation that the vendor's commission should be divided between them, they were merely co-purchasers who became co-owners or tenants in common of the property. There was no evidence of any intention on the part of Bate and Coy to become partners; each was at liberty without the consent of the other to transfer to a stranger his own interest in the property; each had a right to partition; Lindley on Partnership (7 ed.), pp. 26-7; neither was an agent of the other, Bullen v. Sharp[30]. This case is, therefore, distinguishable from that of The Imperial Mercantile Credit Association v. Coleman29, relied upon in the provincial courts. As co-owner with Bate, Coy did not hold towards the plaintiff even a constructive fiduciary position, to which it is said the rule that \"a trustee shall not profit by his trust,\" does not apply. Lewin on Trusts (11 ed.), p. 1159-60.\nThe view so powerfully stated by James L.J. in Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Co. v. India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Co.[31], at page 526, that\nany surreptitious dealing between one principal and the agent of the other principal is a fraud on such other principal cognizable in this court,\nis, of course, incontrovertible. That the principal whose agent has been tampered with, if he comes to the court before rights of innocent third parties have intervened, is entitled to have the contract set aside is equally clear. Nor can a co-purchaser with an agent of the vendor who has bought surreptitiously successfully oppose rescission: McPherson v. Watt[32], at page 276. If rescission is impossible because the plaintiff has not come to the court in time, or is not sought, he may, says Lord Justice James, have\nsuch other adequate relief as the court may think right to give him.\nWhile this is not a case of the agent of the vendor being bribed in the sense in which bribery is ordinarily understood\u2014not a case in which the \"other principal\" sought in any way to influence the conduct of the agent to the prejudice of his own principal, it is a case in which there was surreptitious dealing between the agent and the other principal. Transactions of that sort are so dangerous \u2014 it is so often impossible to ascertain the real truth of the circumstances which surround them, that the prohibition of them by courts of equity is absolute; and where rescission is asked and is possible* they will not inquire whether the principal has or has not sustained a loss. Neither does his right to recover from his agent any profits made by him at all depend on that fact. Parker v. McKenna[33], at page 118.\nBut I know of no ground on which a co-purchaser in the position of the defendant Coy can be held accountable for profits made by him on a re-sale. If Coy had bribed Bate to sell to him at a figure lower than the agent, if honest, could have got for his principal, his liability, as pointed out by Mr. Justice New-lands, citing Grant v. Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate[34], rescission being impossible, would have been to pay damages to the vendor for any loss sustained by him by reason of entering into the contract of sale. If the liability of the fraudulent briber is limited to damages \u2014 if he is not held accountable for profits, a fortiori an innocent co-purchaser, who is not a partner, may not be held so accountable.\nWhether without proof of actual fraud on the part of Coy he would be required to pay damages to the plaintiff, had it been shewn that he secured the property at a figure below its market value at the time he purchased it, need not now be considered. The evidence is overwhelming that the plaintiff got for his property all that it was then worth, all that any agent, however energetic or scrupulously honest could have been expected to obtain for him. I agree with Mr. Justice Newlands that the plaintiff has failed to establish a case against the defendant Coy and am of the opinion that Coy's appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the provincial appellate court, and that the action against him should be dismissed with costs.\nThe case of the defendant Murison, against whom the plaintiff has preferred what he calls a cross-appeal, is still clearer. While the trial judge thought that Murison acquired his interest with knowledge that Bate and Coy were co-purchasers from the plaintiff, the full court thought the evidence consistent with the view that, when Murison acquired his interest, he was unaware that Bate was really a purchaser from Pommerenke and may have believed that he was a subpurchaser from Coy after the latter had bought from the plaintiff. Although not by any means satisfied that if I had been sitting in the provincial appellate court I would have reversed the finding of the trial judge on this question of fact, neither has a perusal of the evidence convinced me that the view expressed by Brown J., concurred in by the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan and not dissented from by Mr. Justice Newlands, is so clearly erroneous that I would be justified in reversing their judgment \u2014 Deniers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co.[35]. But in any case the defendant Murison is entitled to succeed on the same ground as the defendant Coy. He was not a partner of, but merely a co-purchaser with Bate. While he might possibly have been liable to the plaintiff for damages, if any, he is not accountable to him for profits made on the re-sale of the property.\nThis conclusion as to Murison is satisfactory because I more than gravely doubt whether the appeal of the respondent Pommerenke from the judgment dismissing the action as against this defendant is properly before the court. Murison was not made a party respondent to the main appeal taken by Coy. He is not before the court as a party to that appeal. The appellant Coy had no interest whatever in the relief sought against Murison. He has nothing to do with the plaintiff's case against Murison. Pommerenke gave Murison what purports to be a notice, under rule No. 100 of this court, of his intention to contend on the hearing of the main appeal that the decision of the provincial appellate court should be varied by restoring the judgment of Johnston J., holding Murison liable to account to him for the profits made by him on the re-sale of the land to DeVeber. In his factum he prefers his appeal against Murison as a cross-appeal. He has not given the security required by section 75 of the \"Supreme Court Ad.\" I very strongly incline to the view that it is not competent for a respondent by a mere notice under rule 100 to bring before this court a person not a party to the main appeal, and to claim against him relief in which the original appellant is not interested. As pointed out by Osier J.A., discussing the corresponding Ontario rule in Begg v. Ellison[36], at page 269,\nthe word \"parties\" as here used must mean persons who are parties to the action or proceeding in question on the appeal.\nThe same learned judge says in Johnston v. Town of Petrolia[37], at page 335, quoting the language of Jessel M.R. in Re Cavander's Trusts[38],\nan appeal on a point which does not affect the original appellant cannot be a cross-appeal. * * * It cannot have been intended to enable the respondent to bring forward in this way a case with which the appellant has nothing to do. If he has a case of that kind he must give notice of appeal.\nThe case of McNichol v. Malcolm[39] was relied upon by Mr. Straton; and the case of Pilling v. Attorney-General (not reported), in which the judgment of this court was delivered on the 15th of February, 1910, has also been called to our attention. Without expressing any opinion upon the conclusions reached in these cases I would point out that they appear to be distinguishable from that now before the court. In McNichol v. Malcolm39 the notice under rule 100 was given to a person, who, although no relief was claimed against him in the main appeal, had been made a respondent to it. He was, therefore, already before the court. In Attorney-General v. Pilling, although the three parties to the proceedings, Lawson, Hasseltein and Bloom, who were not parties to the main appeal, were held to be affected by the relief granted on the cross-appeal, they were in the same interest as the appellant on the main appeal and they had joined with him in the pleadings in the action. That was not an attempt by a respondent by cross-appeal to bring forward a case with which the main appellant had nothing to do. This is.\nIf rule 100 bears the construction which counsel for the plaintiff Pommerenke seeks to have us put upon it, I am inclined to think that it would be ultra vires of the judges of this court to enact it, inasmuch as it would confer a right to launch and maintain what is in reality an independent appeal without complying with the provisions of section 75 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nBut, in view of the conclusion which I have reached on the merits of the attempted appeal from the judgment dismissing this action as against Murison, it is not now necessary to determine the question whether the plaintiff's so-called cross-appeal has or has not been properly launched.

The inspector gave notices to the plaintiff with respect to his buildings, alleged to be dangerous, but failed to give him definite orders with regard to the nature of the demolition required and, subsequently, entered upon the plaintiff's property and demolished the buildings on his default to comply with the requisitions contained in the notices.\nHeld, Davies J. dissenting, that the conditions prescribed as necessary before the exercise of the right of forcible entry and demolition of the structure had not been fully observed, and that, in consequence of omission strictly to comply with the conditions, the municipal corporation was responsible for the damages sustained by the plaintiff through the unauthorized destruction of his property.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed save and except as to the amount of $394, awarded to him, with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nMcAvoy K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. L. Archambault K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action of damages for trespass to land. It is admitted that the servants of the corporation defendant (respondent here) entered upon the plaintiff's (now appellant's) property against his will and there demolished a building in course of erection. The forcible entry is justified on the ground that the building was defectively constructed with improper materials and by incompetent workmen; that the respondent had legal authority for what it did, and that it acted throughout in conformity with the directions or allowance of the legislature. There is no evidence of imminent danger or of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the public and the respondent does not base its defence to the action on that ground. Certain sections of the municipal charter, to which I will later more fully refer, were invoked in the written pleadings and at the argument here to justify the proceedings of the municipal employees. Since the statute, 5 Richard II., st. I., ch. 7 (1389), it is a criminal offence to enter, in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace, upon the property of another (sections 102 and 103 of the Criminal Code).\nIt is true that if the buildings in course of erection by the plaintiff on his land were in such a state as to constitute a nuisance it would have been permissible for any one having a sufficient interest to take such steps as were necessary to abate the nuisance. The conditions subject to which this right may, in English law, be exercised are stated with admirable clearness by Adrien G\u00e9rard in his recent book on \"Les torts ou d\u00e9lits civils en droit anglais,\" at pages 355 and 356:\nAvec l'abatement of nuisance\" nous revenons \u00e0 une question touchant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re. La \"nuisance\" consiste \u00e0 causer pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 autrui en le troublant dans la jouissance de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9; le propri\u00e9taire peut alors d\u00e9truire l'\u00e9tat de fait; qui lui cause pr\u00e9judice, et c'est ce qu'on nomme \"abatement of nuisance.\"\nSi l'\u00e9tat de fait pr\u00e9judiciable a son si\u00e8ge, sa cause, sur le terrair. d'autrui, le propri\u00e9taire l\u00e9s\u00e9 par la \"nuisance\" doit d'abord sommer son voisin d'en faire dispara\u00eetre la cause; puis, s'il n'agit pas, peut p\u00e9n\u00e9trer sur son terrain pour se faire justice \u00e0 soi-m\u00eame. Si, par example, mon voisin construit sur son terrain une maison qui fait \u2022obstacle \u00e0 l'exercice de mon droit de passage, je dois d'abord le sommer de la d\u00e9molir, et s'il l'obtemp\u00e9re pas, je puis la faire d\u00e9molir, pourvu que je ne lui cause pas de dommage inutile et que je ne trouble pas la paix publique. Remarquons, cependant, que ce n'est pas l\u00e0 un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 conseiller, qu'il est toujours dangereux de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer ainsi sur le terrain d'autrui pour se faire justice, et qu'enfin nous ne trouvons pas de d\u00e9cision moderne sur ce point.\nPollock, \"Torts,\" says, at page 421:\nIt is a hazardous course at least for a man to take the law into his own hands and, in modern times, it can seldom, if ever, be advisable.\nIn the Province of Quebec the law does not permit a citizen to do justice to himself. \"Il n'est pas permis de se faire justice \u00e0 soi-m\u00eame\" is still the law there. M. Demogue in the \"Revue Trimestrielle\" of 1898, at page 690, writing of a then recent judgment in the Cour de Cassation, says, however,\nun arr\u00eat de la chambre des requ\u00eates semble vouloir ramener le vieil adage qu'on ne peut se faire justice \u00e0 soi-m\u00eame \u00e0 une port\u00e9e raisonnable; on ne doit pas faire d'actes troublant l'ordre material, pouvant occasioner des rixes, des luttes, mais le surplus reste permis.\nArticle 529 of the Civil Code lays down the rule as to the limits within which it is permitted to interfere with the property of one's neighbour. I may cut the roots of my neighbour's tree which grow into my land, but, contrary to the rule of English law (Earl of Lonsdale v. Nelson[1]), I may not touch the branches of the same tree that grow over my property. The most I can do is to call upon my neighbour to remove the branches.\nThe municipality does not pretend to have, in the circumstances of this case, the right to enter upon the plaintiff's property, except in so far as authority to do so is found in its charter. Before referring to the provisions of that charter. it may be proper to state that there are certain general principles which should be kept in mind. When the law invests a person with authority to do an act which, if done without express legal sanction, would be an offence, the conditions subject to which the act is authorized must be complied with literally. In other words, where the legislature has thought fit to direct the doing of something which but for that direction or authority would be an actionable wrong it is incumbent on the party who professes to exercise the power conferred by the statute to prove beyond all doubt that he strictly complied with the conditions subject to which the power has been conferred. The statute relied upon by the respondent provides very clearly, as I shall point out, that the alleged wrong-doer should first be warned and required to abate the nuisance complained of; and it is only after notice and refusal that entry on the land to abate the nuisance can be permitted.\nThe city is authorized by 37 Vict. ch. 51, sec. 123, sub-sections 51 and 52, and subsequent amendments, to make by-laws to provide for the inspection of all buildings and to require the demolition of any that may endanger the lives of the citizens; and, by-law No. 107 was passed under the authority of that statute. It is there provided (section 56) that when an inspector finds, by actual survey of the premises, that any structure is in a dangerous state he should, after taking preliminary steps for the protection of passers-by, cause notice in writing to be given to the owner of such structure requiring him to take down or to repair it, as the case may require; and, if the owner fails to comply as speedily as the nature of the case permits with the notice, the inspector may order him to take down or demolish the building, in whole or in part. The by-law further provides that in cases of improper construction which do not come within section 56 the owner may, after notice from the inspector, be summoned before the recorder and there condemned to the penalty provided by section 103 of the by-law. Two different proceedings are, therefore, contemplated; \u2014 one applicable to the case of a dangerous structure which imperils the safety of the public; the other referable to the case of a building which is being defectively constructed and which may, when completed, become a source of danger. In the first case the inspector may enter upon the premises and there take such steps as are necessary to prevent the imminent danger; but, when the complaint is that the building is being defectively constructed without, however, danger of immediate injury being done, the offending owner is liable to be proceeded against for a pecuniary penalty before the Recorder's Court. In either case notice must previously be given to the owner and that notice should be so framed as to give him full information of the nature of the complaint against him and of the proceedings which it is intended to adopt. And this appeal must succeed because the notices required by the statute were not given.\nThe building in question was demolished on the 17th of August, 1898, and the. notices given are to be found printed at pages 356 to 362 of the case on appeal, and at page 3 of the respondent's factum.\nThe first notice was given on the 7th of March, 1898, requesting the appellant to make certain changes in the building which are set out in detail and the owner is informed that, in default of compliance with that notice, he will be proceeded against for the penalty provided by the by-law. I quote the terms of that notice.\nVous \u00eates en cons\u00e9quence requis d'avoir \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ces d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s dans les quarante-huit heures \u00e0 compter de la signification du pr\u00e9sent avis, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi vous serez poursuivi et encourrez la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par le dit r\u00e8glement.\nThis notice was followed by three other notices, dated respectively the 20th of May, the 20th of June, and the 8th of August. The concluding words of the notices of the 20th of May and 8th of August are as follows: Vous \u00eates en cons\u00e9quence requis d'abbatre, d\u00e9molir, reparer ou renforcer la dite maison, suivant qu'il en sera requis, etc. * * * \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi vous serez poursuivi et encourrez la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par le dit r\u00e8glement.\nand no further information as to what was required by the inspector was given to the appellant. The notice of the 20th of June is somewhat more definite; but it also concludes with the words\n\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi vous serez poursuivi et encourrez la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par le dit r\u00e8glement.\nProceedings were taken on this notice in the Recorder's Court and the appellant was condemned, under section 103, to pay a fine for having neglected to conform to the instructions of the inspector. On appeal, the judgment was, subsequently, set aside.\nThe chief reason why I feel, most reluctantly, constrained to allow this appeal is that no such notice as the statute requires was given by the inspector. The vague words used in the notices of the 20th of May and the 8th August, served on the appellant and on which the inspector acted, are :\nvous \u00eates en cons\u00e9quence requis d'abbatre, d\u00e9molir, r\u00e9parer, etc. * * suivant qu'il en sera requis.\nThe appellant is not told whether he is to take down the building, to alter it in part, or, simply, to strengthen it. A notice couched in such vague and uncertain terms does not give to an owner the information as to the defects found in the building which the inspector requires him to remedy, and which the statute contemplates, before the civic officials may venture to exercise their exorbitant right to enter upon the property of a citizen and, with force, demolish his buildings. In its terms the notice leaves the owner under the impression that the particular thing the inspector requires to be done will be subsequently indicated to him. The words used are:\nVous \u00eates en cons\u00e9quence requis d'abattre, d\u00e9molir, reparer ou renforcer la dite b\u00e2tisse, suivant qu'il en sera requis.\nCould anything be more indefinite, vague and uncertain? It would appear as if it was intended merely to puzzle and embarrass the owner.\nAs my brother Duff says, \"this is a case in which form is substance.\" The principle at issue is of the highest importance, affecting the right of property. It would be extremely unwise to establish in this court a precedent which might be invoked by every municipal officer to justify the right to enter upon the property of private citizens and there demolish their buildings on the ground that they are, in his opinion, defectively constructed. The legislature has, in the case of the respondent, thought wise to give the city officials very large powers, it is true, but it has coupled with the exorbitant right conferred a duty to give notice, and that duty must be literally and strictly complied with.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the record sent back to the court below to assess the damages. I am confident, however, that, in assessing those damages, the trial judge will have in mind the suggestions made by my brother Anglin, which have the full approval of this court.\nAn interesting note by Planiol, to Dalloz, 1905, 1, 298, gives a valuable suggestion as to the rules that should be followed in cases like the present, where the defendant acted honestly but under a mistaken apprehension as to its rights; and the conduct of the plaintiff is far from being commendable. Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal is one without any merits whatever. The only point argued, or indeed arguable, was that the notices given to the appellant requiring the demolition of the building complained of as constituting a public danger were not sufficiently full or explicit.\nI have reached the conclusion that the judgment of the trial judge and that of the court of appeal on this point were correct and think, therefore, that this appeal should be dismissed.\nFrom the time he began the erections complained of until their demolition by the civic authorities the appellant's actions and conduct in connection with the building were utterly indefensible and an open and flagrant repudiation of all civil control over him or his building operations. He refused to recognize as binding upon him the by-laws of the city respecting the construction of buildings within its limits. He declined to take out a permit for the erection of the buildings and proceeded with their erection without such permit. The evidence clearly established the fact that not only was their construction not in conformity with the by-laws and regulations but that they were constructed with bad and rotten materials and in an improper and defective manner, and at the time they were ordered to be demolished, as stated by Mr. Justice Lavergne, they \"constituted an imminent danger to the public.\"\nIn point of fact the evidence satisfied the courts below and satisfies me that the buildings demolished by the city officials were of the most imperfect and faulty description, and that to allow them to remain in the condition in which they were on the 6th of August, 1898, when the last and final notice was given to the appellant, or to allow the appellant to continue them to completion, would be dangerous not only to those who might occupy them, but also to the public using the street on which they fronted. Three independent surveyors appointed by the Recorder's Court to examine the condition of the buildings for the information of the court reported that:\nthe faults in construction and defects in materials used in this building are so flagrantly in violation of the city building by-law and of all rules for safe building that we are of the opinion that it should be condemned as a public nuisance, and we have no hesitation in recommending that, in the interest of public safety, it be entirely demolished.\nThe internal supports and joists of floors and roof are not properly placed and are not of a sufficient strength.\nNearly all the timbers used are unsound and rotten and wholly unfit for use.\nThe portion of the front, marked F. B. H. I. J. K., on the drawing, is carried to a greater height than allowed by the by-law, and much higher than is safe for plank framing. About one-half of this portion of the building is carried on three slight posts, marked L. M. N., which are quite insufficient in strength for the load they have to sustain, and do not rest upon proper foundations.\nThe findings of fact of the trial judge and of the court of appeal are substantially in accordance with the report of the surveyors and represent, in my opinion, the proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence.\nI am glad to have been able to concur with the courts below in holding that the notices to the appellant requiring demolition of these dangerous structures were sufficient, because, apart from this one technical question, the appeal is without merits of any kind whatever.\nThere was nothing arbitrary or high-handed in the proceedings taken by the civic authorities to compel the demolition of this \"public nuisance.\" The amplest possible notice was given to him of the danger the buildings were to the public and the necessity for their demolition, and it was only when and after he defiantly refused to comply with these notices that the buildings were demolished and the nuisance abated.\nAs my colleagues, however, think the notices insufficient, and have allowed the appeal and remitted the case for another trial, I feel somewhat at a loss to understand how, in the circumstances and facts with reference to the utterly bad and dangerous condition of the buildings at the time when they were demolished, any damages could be awarded other than merely nominal ones.\nIf it could be shewn that the manner of demolition was negligent, and in itself caused damages, I can understand these being assessable as against even a technical wrong-doer. But, if the facts, as proved at the first trial, with respect to the utterly faulty and dangerous condition of the buildings, are accepted, what real damage was sustained by the appellant in consequence of their demolition? If the buildings did not fall from their own inherent defects they would certainly have, for the public safety and as constituting a public nuisance, to be demolished either by the appellant himself or by the public authorities after a further order complying with the by-laws had been made.\nDemolition was necessary and inevitable. To justify the city authorities in demolishing the building better and fuller notices than those given were, it is held, required. But there cannot be any doubt whatever that the condition of the buildings and the manner in which and the material with which they were being constructed was so bad and indefensible that the buildings, in their then state, constituted an imminent danger to the public which it was alike the right and the duty of the city authorities to have re- moved. The manner in which they proceeded, so far as the notices are concerned, is held to have been technically wrong and not to afford complete justification for the demolition; but if all the facts and conditions demanded demolition; if, under these facts, it was the duty of the city to have the nuisance abated \u2014 if demolition was inevitable any way \u2014 then, surely, a failure technically to comply with the form of notice would not justify any damages beyond nominal ones, unless, indeed, as I have said, the manner in which demolition took place was, in itself, improper and negligent and so caused damages to the owner.\nIdington J.\u2014Certainly the appellant who disregarded the safety of others and defied the law for securing such safety, is not an object of sympathy; yet one of the surest means of inducing law breakers to respect the law, is to have it administered in a due and orderly manner according to the methods prescribed for enforcing it.\nThe law touching the questions raised herein is almost entirely comprehended in two sections of the respondent's charter and two sections of by-law No. 107 resting thereon and passed by respondent's council.\nThe two sub-sections of section 140 of the charter[2] are as follows:\n58. To prescribe and define the duties and powers of the inspector of buildings and to authorize him and such other officers as may be appointed by the council for that purpose, to visit and examine, in the performance of their duties, as well the interior as the exterior of any house or building;\n59. To authorize the said inspector to demolish any house or building that may endanger the lives of the citizens; and to cause such house or building to be temporarily vacated, if he deems it necessary; and to do and perform such work of repair as he may deem necessary for the safety of the structure, and to authorize the recovery, from, the proprietor, of the cost so incurred.\nThe by-law I have referred to contains the following:\nSec. 56. Whenever the inspector finds by actual survey of the premises that any structure (including in such expression any building, wall, chimney or other structure and anything affixed to or projecting from any building, wall or other structure) is in a dangerous state, the inspector shall cause the same to be shored up or otherwise secured, and a proper board or fence to be put up for the protection of passengers; and he shall cause notice in writing to be given to the owner of such structure requiring him to take down, demolish, secure or repair the same as the case may require.\nSec. 57. If such owner fails to comply, as speedily as th\u00e9 nature of the case permits, with the requisition of such notice, the inspector may order him to take down, demolish, repair or otherwise secure, to the satisfaction of the said inspector, such structures or such part thereof as appears to the said inspector to be in a dangerous state, within a time to be fixed by said inspector; and in case the same is not taken down, repaired or otherwise secured within the time so limited, the said inspector may, with all convenient speed, cause all or so much of such structure as is in a dangerous condition, to be demolished, repaired or otherwise secured, in such manner as may be requisite; and all expenses incurred by the said inspector in so doing may be recovered by him from the owner of such structure in any court having jurisdiction in the matter.\nThen follow these sections, one of which is applicable to the case of an owner who cannot be found, which is not this case.\nThe next two sections are as follows:\nSec. 59. If in erecting any building, or in doing any work to, in or upon any building, anything is done contrary to any of the provisions of this by-law, or anything required by this by-law is omitted to be done, in every such case, the inspector shall give to the builder engaged in erecting such building, or in doing such work, notice in writing requiring him, within forty-eight hours from the date of such notice, to cause anything done contrary to the provisions of this by-law, to be amended, or to do anything required to be done by this by-law, but which has been omitted to be done.\nSec. 60. If the builder to whom such notice is given makes de- fault in complying with the requisition thereof within the time specified in such notice, he shall incur the penalty provided in section 103 of this by-law.\nThe only remedy contemplated by these sections 59 and 60, seems to be to give notice and in default a prosecution for the penalty. Section 61 is as follows:\nSec. 61. In all other cases not hereinbefore specified, where the inspector may detect any imperfection, improper construction or defect, by which any building or any part thereof, may become dangerous to the public safety, either by fire or otherwise, he shall immediately notify the owner of such building to repair or remove such defects or imperfection within a reasonable delay to be specified in the notice, and in default of the said owner complying with said notice, he shall be liable to the penalty provided in section 103 of this by-law.\nThis section seems to have no sanction as an alternative to that of a penalty and may as well be eliminated from our present subject of consideration.\nThese references to sections 59, 60 and 61, are solely for the purpose of appreciating correctly the bearing of the notices given by the inspector to appellant relative to the business in hand.\nBefore considering the notices given and effect thereof let us try to correctly apprehend first what the true import of sections 56 and 57 may be.\nLet us assume that the inspector found by actual survey of the premises that the structure was in a dangerous state, did he act as section 56 of this bylaw required? Did he shore the building up or otherwise secure it? Or put a proper board or fence to protect passengers?\nNone of these acts are conditions precedent to exercising the authority to demolish, but they indicate the nature of the danger to be avoided thereby; and which must exist as a condition precedent to the exercise of such authority.\nIt indicates moreover the deliberate judgment required to be taken in such an emergency. Demolition is a desperate remedy and only to be resorted to in cases such as this when neither altering nor repairing nor strengthening can avail, and, in such alternative, only when the man on whom the obligation rests to do so makes clear default after having been duly ordered to do some such specific thing as the inspector's survey justifies him in ordering.\nWhat is the \"dangerous state\" to be found before acting? Is it a dangerous state with regard to passers-by on the street or elsewhere that people have a right to go or are permitted as of apparent right to go? Or is it the prospective danger arising from fire or possibly unsanitary conditions as regards the habitation of the building?\nAll that section 59 of the statute seems to contemplate as ground for demolition is that the building \"may endanger the lives of the citizens.\" And the by-law can go no further. Its attempted execution of the purpose of the statute must be restricted within the express authority of the statute.\nThe inspector or other authority named may, as section 56 of the by-law signifies, be properly authorized to do as specified.\nNow, what are the facts relative to this building which has been demolished? And what was done?\nThe structure was unfinished, incapable of occupation, and hence it cannot properly be said to have endangered the lives of those in it.\nAnd as there are two, and only two possible ways, by which the statute seems to contemplate a danger; one to the citizens generally, and the other to the occupants, any special danger to workmen engaged in its erection seems beyond the purview of the enactment.\nIt would seem, therefore, as if a \"dangerous state\" relative to passers-by on the street or possible lanes where people were accustomed to go was all that could be considered by way of justifying demolition in this particular case.\nDid the inspector feel under need of shoring it up? If so, he does not seem to have acted upon his convictions in that regard.\nI cannot find he either did that or fenced it in or placarded it as dangerous, and these were his instructions by the by-law.\nAnd if it was in a dangerous state, when did it become so, and what measures did he take to protect the citizens? A notice was served in March, clearly inapplicable and indeed only indirectly relied upon.\nAnother notice was served on the 20th of May, 1898. That pretends to rest on sections 56, 57 and 61 of the by-law number 107, but ends up as follows:\nVous \u00eates en cons\u00e9quence requis d'abattre, d\u00e9molir, r\u00e9parer ou renforcer la dite maison, suivant qu'il en sera requis, imm\u00e9diatement, \u00e0 compter de la signification du pr\u00e9sent avis; \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi, vous serez poursuivi et encourrez la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par le dit r\u00e8glement.\nThat clearly does not point to demolition, but to a prosecution for a penalty imposed by the by-law.\nAnd an abortive prosecution ensued.\nOn the 20th of June, 1898, a more specific notice is given, but rests only upon sections 59 and 61, which I have already shewn are outside the scope of demolition, and sections 12 and 14 still further beyond same scope and the notice like its predecessors only threatens prosecution for penalties under the by-law.\nIt seems pursuant to this the appellant was prosecuted with some greater success than on the first occasion.\nOn the 9th of August, 1898, he is served with a notice addressed to him in the following terms.\nMonsieur:\u2014\nAvis vous est, par les pr\u00e9sentes, donn\u00e9 que la b\u00e2tisse sur votre propri\u00e9t\u00e9, portant le num\u00e9ro 755, du plan cadastral et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement connu sous le num\u00e9ro civique, avenue H\u00f4tel-de-Ville et rue St. Norbert, quartier St. Louis, de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, et pr\u00e9sentement, est dans une condition dangereuse, et cela en contravention aux sections 56, 57 et 61 du r\u00e8glement No. 107 de la dite cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nVous \u00eates en cons\u00e9quence requis d'abattre, d\u00e9molir, r\u00e9parer ou renforcer la dite b\u00e2tisse, suivant qu'il en sera requis, dans les 24 heures, \u00e0 compter de la signification du pr\u00e9sent avis; \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi, vous serez poursuivi et encourrez la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par le dit r\u00e8glement.\nThe clerk serving this made a note that Riopelle answered he would not demolish.\nThere does not seem to be in this any implication that he would not do one or other of the other alternatives presented to him.\nI need not pursue the further steps taken or the facts which might, if a proper notice had been served, have given rise to considerations relative to demolition.\nI cannot think that such an autocratic power as this ever was intended to be executed by means of such an ambiguous series of alternatives as this notice presents.\nThe man may have been as wrong-headed as you please, but surely the form of notice might at this fourth attempt have become a little more specific.\nIt is simply the same from first to last, a threat of prosecution for the penalty incurred. Now, how can such a vague threat resting upon three sections by no means relative to an identical offence or species of remedy be a proper foundation for an act of demolition such as this? But more than that the man was actually prosecuted in the Recorder's Court as threatened in June by the like notice, and then for the first time there appears in an architect's report something in detail pointing out on the 6th of August at a trial where he was convicted, what were the defects from which, if the building continues as it was, or proceeded to its completion on such a plan, might render it dangerous to the public.\nIt is suggested this report was read as part of the evidence in the Recorder's Court in appellant's presence, and that hence these details as ground of complaint can be imported into the effect to be given the notice of the 8th of August.\nClearly the proper thing for the inspector to have done was when armed with this report to have made a proper use of it by his deciding how much of this defective building could be rectified by reparations or strengthening and what of each was to be attributed to either branch of his notice and if action was required to be taken thereunder respectively.\nA puzzling alternative notice such as given was unjustifiable if demolition was intended.\nA forty-eight hour's notice of demolition, when alterations could have been made and charged to the appellant, producing probably at a moderate cost quite as effective a remedy for the protection of the passing citizens who travelled the streets or adjacent lanes, would also have been unjustifiable. What did this notice mean? It was vague and misleading and in light of its several predecessors of the same sort quite insufficient to found demolition upon. It was the same old threat of prosecution for penalty.\nThe demolition was not ordered in such a specific manner begotten of such a specific necessity or requirement as seems to me can alone justify it in law.\nAnd the alternatives presented were not so specified as both statute and by-law express and imply ought to have been made clear before resorting to demolition.\nI think appellant entitled to recover, but am embarrassed to find exactly the lines upon which an inquiry as to damages may proceed.\nI am clear upon one point, that a man who builds a house not in conformity with but in violation of the law, has not a house that can be estimated as worth its cost, or worth anything as if a finished building. Hence he has no right to reckon upon rents as part of his damages.\nI should say the defects pointed out by the architects may be a guide yet may not.\nI rather incline to think the proper way to estimate his damages would be to consider just how much of the structure could have been used and made conformable to the by-law by discarding the parts clearly useless as in violation of the building regulations.\nAnd then having ascertained that, estimate its value as it stood, and deduct from that the value of the material left after the demolition. The balance should be the damages to be allowed.\nIf the conclusion to be reached is that there was, to begin with, no value if these lines were to be proceeded upon, or in other words, no structure that could be rendered conformable to the requirements of the building regulations, then there was no value, and in such case the damages should be assessed, if any exist, at the difference between the material as left and what a prudent owner might have rescued, if necessary for him to have demolished.\nIf nothing in that, then the only thing the appellant can be entitled to would be damages for the illegal entrances upon his premises and costs of this suit and this appeal, as well as the appeal in the court below.\nThe unfortunate delay in reaching an end to this litigation will make it difficult to proceed upon such lines as I have indicated. The act having been found illegal, it would be the part of wisdom for the parties to agree upon a sum upon the lines indicated as properly payable, and have it inserted in this judgment as an end of the matter.\nThirteen years old hasty happenings ought to have got so cooled by this time as to render this last method appear reasonable to all concerned.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nDuff J.\u2014This is one of those cases in which a public authority having the power on certain conditions to do acts which otherwise would be an invasion of private property fails to observe the prescribed conditions upon which alone the power is exercisable. In such cases, to use the well-known words of Lord Halsbury, \"form is substance,\" and the municipality by their unauthorized destruction of the plaintiff's property have brought themselves under a liability to pay the damages the plaintiff has suffered by reason of their act.\nIn estimating these damages it would be necessary, of course, to take into consideration all the circumstances. The premature destruction of a building which the authorities had the power to destroy on proper notices being given and which they had decided was one that ought to be destroyed might very well appear to a court not to be the occasion of any great loss to the owner. This, as well as other considerations suggested by the evidence, will no doubt be present to the mind of the court when assessing the damages to be awarded. There should be a new trial on the question of damages.\nAnglin J.\u2014With reluctance, because the conduct of the appellant was wholly indefensible and most provoking to the city officials, who appear to have been considerate and indulgent to him almost to a fault, I find myself obliged to concur in allowing this appeal, on the ground that the order, prescribed by section 57 of by-law No. 107 of the City of Montreal as a condition precedent to the right of the building inspector to demolish an offending structure, was never made. The \"notice in writing\" prescribed by section 56 was apparently given by him to the appellant several times \u2014 on the 7th March, the 20th May, the 20th June and the 8th August. No doubt the official thought he had fully complied with the requirements of the by-law. But its scheme is that a notice shall first be given to the owner of the obnoxious structure requiring him \"to take down, demolish, secure or repair the same as the case may require\" (section 56), and that, in the event of non-compliance with such notice, the inspector shall then order the owner to do what he deems requisite within a time to be fixed by him; and it is only upon disobedience to this order that the inspector is authorized himself to execute it; (section 57).\nThe power conferred on this municipal officer is somewhat extraordinary, yet it seems not to be greater than is needed for such a case as that now before us. But legislation which places the citizen and his property so completely under official control should be utilized with great caution. If the courts did not insist that the conditions imposed by such a by-law upon the exercise of the powers which it confers should be fully observed, and that the procedure for which it provides should be strictly followed, though designed as a salutary measure for the protection of public interests, it might easily be made an instrument of oppression destructive of personal liberty \u2014 any person whose property is interfered with has a right to require that those who interfere shall comply with the letter of the enactment so far as it makes provision on his behalf: Herron v. Rathmines and Rathgar Improvement Commissioners[3], at page 523, per Lord Macnaghten.\nI have little doubt that the notice of the 8th August, which fixed twenty-four hours as the delay within which the plaintiff was required to conform to it, was meant by the inspector to be an order under section 57 of the by-law. But it was in form merely a notice, and the building was not subject to demolition by the inspector until an order, made by him after non-compliance by the owner with a notice previously given by him, had been disobeyed.\nFor these reasons I feel constrained to allow this appeal and to remit the action to the Superior Court for assessment of the plaintiffs' damages. It by no means follows that, because his buildings have been demolished without full compliance with the provisions of the municipal by-law, the appellant is entitled to recover as damages their full cost price. He succeeds upon a technical ground. The buildings would appear to have been flimsily and defectively constructed.\nIf on the 8th August an order under section 57 had been made and served on the plaintiff, instead of a notice under section 56, it would seem probable that he would have had no cause of action against the city. In these circumstances, if the inspector, upon fully complying with the conditions of the statute, would have been within his right in demolishing the plaintiff's buildings as he did, and if the demolition was carried out with reasonable care, a court properly advised would award comparatively small damages. If, on the other hand, the buildings as erected could have been made to fulfil the requirements of the municipal building by-law and could have been put into such a condition as would render them safely habitable, while their demolition might not be justified, the cost of such repairs, alterations and additions as would be necessary to make them safe and in conformity with the requirements of the by-law should be taken into account in assessing the plaintiff's damages. Again, it may be that only partial demolition was necessary. All these matters should be carefully considered in estimating the damages which the plaintiff is entitled to recover. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that he built without a permit. If the character of his buildings was such \u2014 if they were so radically and fundamentally bad that he would not be entitled to a permit for them whatever alterations he made in them, however he strengthened and improved them, they had no real value and he sustained no substantial damages by their demolition, unless indeed it was so carried out that reckless and unnecessary injury was done to the building materials.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs in this court and to his costs already incurred in the provincial courts. The costs of the assessment of damages will be dealt with in the Superior Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McAvoy, Handfield & Handfield.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ethier & Co.\n[1] 2 B. & Cr. 302; 26 R.R. 363, at p. 370; and see Lemmon v.

This agreement was acted upon until December, 1907, when the city, claiming to have discovered the existence of a fund of $37,000, collected from the ratepayers of the several municipalities composing the county, which had not been considered in the settlement, brought action for its share of said fund, but did not ask for rescission or modification of the agreement.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (22 Ont. L.R. 151) that in the absence of fraud or mutual mistake the agreement was a bar to such action.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note.

The provisions of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d relating to matters consequent on the formation of new municipal corporations, and the other provisions of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d aforesaid shall, except so far as herein otherwise provided, apply to the said corporation of the City of Woodstock in the same manner as if the said town had been erected into a city under the provisions of the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d\nIt became the duty of the parties hereto upon said Act coming into effect to take steps for adjusting by agreement or arbitration all matters affecting their respective interests in respect of the assets in which they might have had a joint interest and of the obligations for the indebtedness due by the county and incurred for the common benefit.\nThey agreed in writing as to all these things, and as to the current expenses relative to the administration of justice, maintenance of buildings, use of and maintenance of the poor-house and of the registry office for the then next five years.\nThe appellant alleging, five years afterwards, a discovery of what was patent to everybody who cared to read at the time, viz., of an accumulation of surpluses arising out of annual levies, which might well have been taken into account in this adjustment and charged to the county in reduction of the county debt, before apportioning the share of it to be borne by each, has sued herein to recover what it alleges to have been its share of moneys so levied as to produce such surplus. It is manifest that the agreement was, as on its face it purports to be, a settlement of the financial arrangements between the county and the city, as required by the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d\nThe \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d certainly contemplated that no such outstanding claim should remain unsettled for a year, much less five or six years.\nIn the absence of fraud or mutual mistake, the agreement must stand as an insuperable barrier to opening up such a matter.\nFrom the day it was duly executed it concluded both parties as to any such outstanding claim unless rescinded or reformed.\nThere is no case made by the pleadings for rescission, and no case made by the evidence for reformation.\nIn adjusting matters such as this comprehensive agreement deals with, there is always much to be yielded on each side at every step, and it is looked at in the spirit of compromise by all fair-minded men so engaged. How can we, or any court, say what the result would have been if the committee room had been placarded with the annual statements shewing all this, now claimed to be a discovery? The result might have been a trifle less on account of annual contribution of appellant to the debt, and a larger contribution on some of the other things bargained for.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.H.

(Idington J. contra, Davies and Anglin JJ. dubitante), that the statute empowers the municipality to furnish water for the use of the customer in working a, printing-press.\nThe town council, by by-law, fixed the rates to be paid for water including \"printing presses, one service, 11\/4 pipe or less, per year, $30.\" C, proprietor of a newspaper and printing establishment, connected his premises with the water mains by a two-inch pipe and received water for a year for his motor, paying said rate therefor. He then continued the use of the water for some months when the council passed a resolution that newspaper proprietors should be notified that the supply would be cut off at a certain date, which was done. C. brought an action for damages to his business.\nHeld, per Idington J.\u2014The Council had no authority to make the contract with C; there was no authority in the absence of a special contract with the town, to place a two-inch service pipe for receipt of water; and if the municipality had power to enter into this agreement it was under no duty to exercise it. Per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J., that the municipality having entered upon the service of the appellant's motor was bound to continue it unless and until the council in the bon\u00e0 fide and reasonable exercise of its discretion thought it desirable to discontinue it in the interest of the inhabitants as a whole.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014If any contract existed it was one under which C. was entitled to a supply of water for his motor so long as the town council should, in its discretion, deem it advisable to continue it. There was no evidence to warrant the jury's finding that the council was guilty of negligence and exercised its discretion mal\u00e2 fide.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J.\u2014The circumstances disclosed were such as to warrant a finding of unfair discrimination against C, but the damages awarded were excessive.\nJudgment ordering a new trial (39 N.B. Rep. 573) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] setting aside the verdict for the plaintiff and ordering a new trial.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nO.S. Crockett, for the appellant.\nTeed K.C., for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree with my brother Anglin.\nIdington J;\u2014It is to be regretted that the law of New Brunswick did not, when judgment was given in appeal (though since changed), permit of the court of appeal dismissing an action when there existed no sufficient evidence to warrant a verdict for any of the alleged causes of action. It had then no alternative but to grant a new trial. The action is founded upon the supposed capacity of a municipal corporation created by a special Act, to contract in such a way as to bind it for a term of a year or more to supply water for a motor in an industrial establishment and that it had effectually become so bound.\nThe limit of its legal capacity in regard to water supply is contained in the following words from section 6 of said charter:\nThe town council of the Town of Campbellton are hereby authorized and empowered to provide for the said town a good and sufficient supply of water for domestic, fire and other purposes, etc.\nI cannot read these words as in law empowering such undertakings as are necessary to implement all that is implied in the alleged power to supply this motive power. If the power exists relative to a small machine does it not in absence of any limitation exist as to all the possible manifold operations of water power? Where is the limit? Such powers are never presumed to have been conferred unless the purpose to do so is made clear by the legislative language used.\nWhen this difficulty was suggested counsel fell back upon the expression \"franchises of the company\" which appears in the Act enabling respondent to acquire a water-supply system owned by a local company.\nIt certainly was necessary in order to put an end to the power of the company in the town that the latter should acquire the franchises.\nThat was an expedient measure, far from enabling when accomplished to use all of such franchises.\nTo acquire for purposes of extinction is one thing and for purposes of using is quite another. The power to use cannot be implied from anything in the enactments before us. And as to the nature or extent of such franchises there is nothing to shew what they were.\nSuch being the foundation of the town council's power it passed a by-law determining what tolls were to be taken by it for the use of water it might supply.\nOne item is as follows:\nPrinting presses, one service, 11\/4 pipe or less, per year, $30.00.\nThis cannot create a power out of nothing. But the town council had power to pass by-laws. The power was limited to what was needed\nin order to secure to the inhabitants of the said town an abundant supply of water and electricity,\nsection 21 of 60 Vict. ch. 58.\nThis does not seem to favour the contention that the power extended to a supply of motive force relative to industrial operative machinery.\nThe town council, it is said, though not shewn how, had appointed a committee that went under the name of water and something.\nWe are told in argument, and it is not denied, that there is no evidence in this case defining the powers of this committee. So we are left to infer, if we can, from its name, that it must have had ample power to bind the town. It acted in some way. I am not sure that it ever was quite unanimous, or a majority so, as to this business. And it is urged that out of the divergent views its members presented to the court of what did transpire something must be made, for this committee kept no records and made no written reports of its transactions.\nOne thing we are quite sure of. A two-inch service pipe was put in connecting this appellant's premises with the respondent's mains, and a year later\nthe town got thirty dollars. What right such a committee had to put in a two-inch pipe service when the only boundary of authority they would seem to have was this by-law fixing rates; yet that made no provision of rate for more than an inch-and-a-quarter pipe.\nIt is said the full capacity of this pipe was not used. I am quite willing to assume that as perfectly true and do so assume.\nBut it is obvious that this two-inch service-pipe was the only record we have to guide us as to the result of the agreement. It must be taken as the limit of what was from day to day tendered for use and usable if desired.\nIn the by-law it is expressly declared as follows:\nFor purposes not mentioned herein, or for larger services than above named, or for peculiar circumstances, special agreement to be made with the town council.\nWhen the year in question had expired nothing further was done in way of agreement.\nThe appellant continued without any further payment or tender of rates until his supply was cut off as complained of, or determination thereof was arrived at, though such rates were payable on the first of the months of March, July and November. Two of these gale-days had passed before this water was finally shut off.\nOn the 11th of December, 1906, the town council decided the water should be cut off from this motor\nin one week's time from date, on account of the very low pressure of water.\nNotice of this was given the appellant next day. The resolution was rescinded on the 18th of December, but on the 26th of February, 1907, the council resolved that the proprietors of newspapers using water for motor purposes should\nbe notified that the water for their water motors will be shut off on the first day of April next.\nSuch is the alleged contract and breach thereof for which damages are sought.\nWhere is the contract? What power existed to make it? What authority had those placing a two-inch service pipe there for appellant's use in face of the express prohibition of the by-law unless and until an express agreement had been made with the town council for such special contract? Since when has the law implied any right in any one to say that his mere continuation of enjoyment after expiry of the first term implies any further fixed term for its enjoyment? The law does not in any such case imply any such thing unless and until there has been something done from which an inference of purpose and agreement can be drawn.\nThe case of master and servant, Beeston v. Collyer[2], relied upon, illustrates how such an inference may, after years of continuation in service and payment for fixed periods of time, on fixed days, during successive years, be drawn therefrom.\nWhen no authority nearer than this can be found for the contention, it seems needless to argue further.\nThen it is said the very resolution cutting off for a specific reason, and rescinding it next week, can found such an inference and fix a term of one year as having been agreed upon. It seems impossible to hold such to be the law in any case. And where, as here, the whole proceeding was irregular and no binding contract ever had been made of the special nature involved, the claim as founded upon contract is hopeless.\nThen, was there any duty devolving upon respondent to supply water for power; or supply power derived from use of water in any way?\nI cannot find that there ever existed any power in the respondent to enter upon such an enterprise. In the entire absence of such power there could be no duty to do so.\nAnd even if there could be said to have existed a power enabling the respondent to do such a thing, there could not exist any duty in law to exercise it. If such an exercise of a given power ever was contemplated, certainly there exists in the statutes no express and imperative duty to exercise it, nor is there anything in the legislation and conditions presented for our consideration that can warrant us in holding any legal implication of such duty to exercise the power had arisen.\nThere being neither contract nor duty the claims for negligence and alleged malice all fall with these other claims.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the proper inference from the various provisions of the statute empowering the municipality to maintain a water-works' system is that having entered upon a particular service for any of the authorized purposes the municipality is bound to make such provision for that service as may reasonably be required unless and until the council of the municipality in the bon\u00e0 fide and reasonable exercise of its discretion thinks it desirable to discontinue it in the interests of the inhabitants as a whole. That a service such as that furnished the appellant was within the contemplation of the Act seems hardly open to doubt; \"domestic, fire or other purposes\" is a phrase which in its literal meaning embraces\u2014nobody would dispute\u2014the purpose to which the appellant was devoting the water supplied to him. \"Other purposes,\u201d it is said, is to be construed ejusdem generis. But what is the genus which comprehends the purpose of fire protection as well as everything denoted by the comprehensive words \"domestic purposes,\" and at the same time excludes the working of a motor? I have heard no attempt to answer this question. There appears to be nothing in the objection that a by-law was required. The existence of a by-law might in such circumstances be inferred. City of Victoria v. Patterson[3], at pages 623 and 624.\nThe question then is, was there evidence of mal\u00e0 fides fit to be submitted to the jury ? It is a point upon which I have a good deal of doubt. But if they accepted the plaintiff's story, as they evidently did, the jury might not improperly have thought the conduct of the members of the council from first to last only explicable upon the hypothesis of actual ill-will towards the plaintiff. On that hypothesis the circumstances were such, I think, as to support a finding of unfair discrimination against him.\nI am not able, however, to escape the conclusion that the damages awarded are excessive; and on that question there should, I think, be a new trial. I do not enter upon the question in detail as that becomes unnecessary in view of the opinion on the other points taken by the majority of the court.\nAnglin J.\u2014In my opinion, if any contract was established by the plaintiff it was a contract under which he was entitled to a supply of water for his motor at the rate of $30 per annum so long as the municipal council of the defendant town should in its discretion deem it advisable to continue such supply. I agree with McLeod J. that there was no evidence to support a finding of any other contract.\nNeither can I accede to the contention that the defendant owed to the plaintiff a statutory duty to supply him with water power for his motor at all times and regardless of the effect upon the domestic, fire and other similar services of the municipality. I doubt whether the defendant was compellable to furnish water for any such purpose, however great the supply available. But, if it was, the only construction of the statute under which it operated which seems to me at all reasonable is that the municipal council was within its rights in cutting off such a service as that which the plaintiff enjoyed whenever in its judgment to continue it would, or might be pre- judicial to the supply requisite for domestic, fire and other similar purposes.\nI agree with McLeod J. that there was no evidence to warrant a finding against the defendant of negligence, or of mal\u00e0 fides in the exercise of its discretionary power to discontinue the service in question to the plaintiff.\nWith regret that, under the law in force in New Brunswick when this action was dealt with, it appear to be not possible finally to dismiss it[4], I concur in the order for a new trial and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: O.

Co. for commissions on policies and renewals alleged to have been earned by said agent. The company denied liability and counterclaimed for money claimed to be due them from the agent. The trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiff, ordered a reference to take an account and reserved further direc- tions and costs. The Court of Appeal having sustained this judgment the company sought to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The respondent, plaintiff, moved to quash the appeal.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. for the motion.\nMowat K.C. contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014In my opinion the motion to quash this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I take no part in the judgment on this motion, being interested.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The question is raised of our jurisdiction to hear this appeal. The learned trial judge found that the plaintiff (now respondent) was entitled to an account and directed a reference to take such account and report, and reserved further directions and subsequent costs, and the Court of Appeal upholds the judgment.\nCan it be said that this is a final judgment? The answer appears in the following cases; The Rural Municipality of Morris v. The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[1], where an order to enter speedy judgment was held not a final judgment, as the clerk had to compute the amount. The Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. v. Marcheterre[2], where the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada had quashed an appeal to that court from the Court of Review, and it was held such judgment, though ap- parently concluding the parties\u2019 rights, was not such a final judgment as the \u201cSupreme and Exchequer Courts Act\u201d designated such.\nThe claim was for five thousand dollars. The plaintiff had been found, as here, entitled to recover and a reference directed to determine the damages, but no report thereon at the time of this attempted appeal.\nThe Bank of British North America v. Walker[3], where a judgment overruling demurrer held not final. Griffith v. Harwood[4], where a judgment affirming the dismissal of a plea of prescription held not final when other pleas on the record undisposed of. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The City of Toronto[5], where it was held that a ruling by a master on the reference as to title was not a final judgment.\nThese are not, by any means, all, but specimens illustrative, in many ways, of the view this court has taken of the words \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d\nAnd in each of these cases, and in others of like kind, there could not be a doubt but that, in a more or less extensive sense, the rights of the litigants had been finally bound; yet the judgments were not final in the sense held to be the meaning in the \u201cSupreme and Exchequer Courts Act\u201d and, hence, no appeal could lie.\nAnother case was The City of Toronto v. Metallic Roofing Co.[6], where the court rendered a judgment which I thought then, and still think, was in conflict with the foregoing cases. So matters stood till Wenger v. Lamont[7], which was a case of a judgment and reference to take accounts and this court held no appeal could lie.\nIn that case the judgment of reference was not quite the same as in this case, but, on the other question of the amount involved in the controversy, that could be no doubt that, outside the record, it was shewn, as the late Mr. Justice Girouard pointed out in dissenting, the evidence so far as taken at the trial disclosed a case involving more than a thousand dollars.\nThe judgment not being final, I am not much concerned as to amount.\nI think this motion should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014It seems to me to be very clear that the judgment in this case is not a final judgment as that phrase has been interpreted in this court and in the courts in England for the purpose of deciding controversies respecting the right of appeal. The Rural Municipality of Morris v. The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[8]; Ex parte Moore[9], per Brett M.R., at pages 633 and 634.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am satisfied that the judgment from which it is sought to appeal is not a final judgment within the meaning of sub-section (c) of section 2 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d as interpreted in the decisions of this court.\nIt was not suggested that, although it be not a final judgment, there is a right of appeal from it under any other provision of the statute. The motion to quash therefore prevails.\nThere is nothing which can be regarded as amounting to a special reason for granting leave to appeal.\nThe respondent is entitled to her costs of the application.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hodgins Heighington & Bastedo.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\n[1] 19 Can.

Later he notified the company that he withdrew his subscription and refusing to pay further calls was sued therefor. It turned out that when S. subscribed for the stock all the shares had been allotted by the company and those given to him had been obtained by surrender from one of the original allottees.\nHeld, that under the Ontario Companies Act, when stock has been allotted by a company, the only case in which the directors can regain control of it, is that of forfeiture for non-payment of calls. As in this case there was no forfeiture, the company did not legally own the stock allotted to S. and could not compel him to pay for it.\nHeld, also, that the provision in said Act that stock on which calls are unpaid cannot be transferred, is imperative and cannot be waived by the company.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the above head-note. Hellmuth K.C. and Ziba Gallagher for the appellant.\nSmyth K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action for calls upon stock of the respondent company for which it is alleged the appellant subscribed. It is admitted that the appellant signed a certain subscription agreement but he denies that the shares for which he agreed to subscribe were ever allotted to him. The action was maintained by the trial judge and his judgment confirmed on appeal. Other defences were set up; but the sole question to be considered in this appeal is: Was the appellant ever a shareholder of the respondent, liable to pay the calls for which this action is brought? The inquiry is, on the evidence did the company ever do that which it was entitled to do, if it was really meant to make the appellant a shareholder? It is important to bear in mind that the action is not for breach of an agreement to take stock, but for moneys due by the appellant for calls made in respect of shares of the respondent company. The claim, therefore, is based on the assumption that the appellant is the holder of certain shares of that company and is in arrears for calls made on those shares. The appellant could become shareholder in one of two ways:\n1st. By the allotment of shares from the company through the board of directors.\n2ndly. By a transfer of shares to him by a shareholder.\nThere can be no doubt that at the time of his subscription, as found by the trial judge, all the shares were allotted to other subscribers and that there was no stock at that time which the directors could allot to the appellant under the subscription agreement. The judgments below, however, proceed on the ground that appellant\u2019s subscriptions were taken in lieu of subscriptions of former subscribers to whom allotments were made but who were allowed to withdraw and whose stock was allotted or re-allotted to the appellant.\nTo maintain those judgments on the facts of this case it would be necessary to hold that a shareholder to whom stock has been allotted may be relieved of his obligations by the consent of the board of directors. Unless forfeited for non-payment of calls the directors have no control over shares that have been allotted. The title to those shares is fixed and the company cannot substitute any one for the allottee, and there is no pretence that there was a forfeiture here. Title of course can be acquired by transfer, if all the calls then due on the stock transferred have been paid; but here there were unpaid calls due by the original allottee and there is in addition no evidence that any transfer was executed to the appellant or that he ever heard of, or was asked to accept, any transfer.\nI would allow this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I cannot see how, having due regard to the provisions of the \u201cOntario Companies Act,\u201d it can be held that after a call had been made on allotted stock and whilst such call remained unpaid, the respondent company could allot stock to some one else and hold him liable as if he had duly sub- scribed for such stock, no matter how anxious he was to get stock or the man called upon was to get rid of what he had been allotted.\nNor can I see how a bargain forbidden by the statute can be converted into a bargain for something the parties never contracted for with each other.\nI think it is impossible to attribute appellant\u2019s subscription, for a certain number of shares only offered out of a specified block of stock, to a subscription for some other stock neither party had contemplated as in the market. Even if it could have been, contrary to the intention as evidenced by the documents, there has been no call made in respect of it.\nIt is a contract between the parties that is sued upon, but it is one that is subject to and can become operative only within certain statutory limitations.\nThe appeal should, I think, be allowed only with such costs throughout as the appellant might have been allowed to tax had he from the start confined his contention in defence and counterclaim to the neat point involved in this appeal. And I think he should be ordered to pay the respondents the costs throughout of and incidental to all other contentions set up by him in his pleadings and in the trial and in appeal below and here, such costs to be set off pro tanto against the amount he is entitled to recover on his counterclaim and (if need be) costs taxed to him.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think Mr. Hellmuth\u2019s contention is unanswerable. The directors had not the slightest intention of allotting to Smith any of the 300,000 shares of the nominal capital which had not already been allotted. Smith had no intention of applying for such shares. Smith expected to receive, when he made his application, and the directors intended to give him, when they professed to make him a shareholder, a part of the 700,000 shares which, under the existing arrangement, it was understood should be issued.\nIn fact the whole of this 700,000 shares had been allotted to other persons; and what the directors intended to do and believed they were doing was to cancel the allotments of some of these shares and re-allot them to Smith. They did not profess and had no intention to forfeit these shares for non-payment of calls. They acted upon the assumption, which, of course, nobody disputes was a mistake on their part, that having allotted a part of their share capital to a person who thereby became a shareholder they could by the consent of that person cancel the allotment and by that process acquire full power to deal with the shares as a part of the unissued capital of the company. This, it is perfectly clear, they could not do. As to the suggestion that Smith may be treated as a transferee holding under transfer from the previous allottees, that suggestion must fall to the ground for two reasons: 1st, there was no transfer in fact and Smith\u2019s application was an application to the company for an allotment of shares; and 2ndly, it seems to me to be perfectly clear that there is, a statutory prohibition against the transfer of shares upon which calls are unpaid. The argument that the statutory provision is directory merely or can be waived by the directors is, in my opinion, inadmissible for the short reason I put to Mr. Smyth in the argument, viz., the statute declares the shares themselves in such circumstances to be non-transfer- able; so long as any such call remains unpaid they are extra commercium.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Section 54 of the \u201cOntario Companies Act, 1907,\u201d declares shares upon which a call duly made remains unpaid and which have not been forfeited for non-payment to be non\u2011transferable. This provision, it is, in my opinion, not competent for the company or its directors to waive or to override. This section differs essentially from section 16 of the English \u201cCompanies Clauses Act,\u201d 8 Vict. ch. 16, which merely disentitles a shareholder to transfer such shares as of right; Ex parte Littledale[1], and from the not unusual provision that directors may decline to register a transfer of shares made by a person indebted to the company (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 79, sec. 67). It impresses temporarily upon the shares themselves the character of non-transferability. Declared by section 48 to be\ntransferable subject to such conditions and restrictions as by this Act * * * may be prescribed,\nshares are, by section 54, expressly made non-transferable,\nuntil all previous calls have been fully paid in, or until declared forfeited for non-payment of calls.\nThe company can deal with shares in this position only by taking the forfeiture proceedings prescribed by section 56, or, in the case of mining companies, by selling them under section 144. No step was taken under either of these sections. The shares which the defendants undertook to \u201callot\u201d to the plaintiff were in this position. They had been underwritten and allotted to other subscribers. A call had been made upon them and notice thereof had been given, as provided by the underwriting agreement, through the trustees to whom it was made payable. This call was unpaid. The shares had not been forfeited. The subscription or application of the defendant was for shares included in and subject to the underwriting agreement and not for any other shares. He knew that the entire underwriting of 700,000 shares had been subscribed: he did not know that the entire 700,000 shares had been actually allotted.\nAssuming that there was, or should be deemed to have been, a transfer of the 2,500 shares from the persons to whom they had been originally allotted to the plaintiff, sufficient if such shares were then transferable, the character of non-transferability impressed upon them by the statute while any call remained unpaid and they had not been forfeited rendered any attempt to transfer them abortive and ineffectual.\nThe incapacity of the company to accept a surrender of issued shares and to re-allot them is indisputable. Neither, in view of what was actually done and of the nature of the application or contract signed by the plaintiff, can the company be heard to say that he was allotted shares out of the 300,000 not covered by the underwriting agreement to which his subscription was attached and to the terms of which it was made subject. With respect, I would, for these reasons, allow this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Ziba Gallagher.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Samuel King.\n[1] 9 Ch. App. 257.\n"

By his lease S. has a right of access to and from his lot on the east and west sides.\nHeld, that S. was not a riparian owner and had no rights in respect to the water lot other than those given him by his lease. Hence, he could not restrain the F. K. Co. from erecting a wharf on the adjoining lot which would prevent access to his from the south, a right of access not provided for in his lease.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (40 N.B. Rep. 8) maintaining the decree of the judge in equity (4 N.B. Eq. 184, 261) reversed, Idington J., dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], affirming the decree of the judge in equity[2], enjoining the defendant company from erecting a wharf on their water lot in the harbour of St. John so as to cut off access from the south to the plaintiff's adjoining lot.\nThe question in issue on this appeal was whether or not the plaintiff, as lessee of water lot No. 2 in block \"A\" on the plan inserted below of lots on Sidney slip in the St. John harbour could restrain the defendant company, lessees of the adjoining lot No. 3, from erecting a wharf thereon in such a manner as to deprive the plaintiff of access to and egress from his lot on the southern side, not given him by his lease.\nThe plan referred to here follows. The judge in equity held that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction, which he according granted. His decision was upheld by the full court, and the defendant company appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHazen K.C. and J. B. M. Baxter K.C. for the appellants.\nTeed K.C. and A. A. Wilson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDavies J.\u2014The underlying error pervading the judgment appealed from is, I venture respectfully to say, that of assuming the plaintiff, respondent, to stand in the position of a riparian proprietor and as such entitled to a right of uninterrupted access to his water lot along its southern boundary from the waters of St. John harbour.\nIn my opinion the plaintiff never was a riparian proprietor in any sense of the word. He was the lessee of the water lot No. 2 forming part of the \"flats\" so called in St. John harbour lying between high and low-water mark. No part of the ripa or bank of the shore was included within or touched the boundaries of his lease. All the lands leased to him were away below high-water mark, and between his land and the ripa or bank of the river there intervened other water lots. I lay much emphasis upon this because the judgment of Chief Justice Barker proceeds upon the assumption that the plaintiff, respondent, as lessee of water lot No. 2 possessed the rights of a riparian proprietor or rights analogous to them including uninterrupted access from the harbour to and along the southern boundary of his lot. The argument at bar for the respondent, plaintiff, proceeded and I think necessarily so upon the same lines.\nIn my judgment the respondent was not a riparian owner at all and possessed none of the special rights of a riparian proprietor as such. He was simply the lessee of a water-lot lying in the harbour of St. John, between high and low-water mark, and had just such rights and those only as were conferred by his lease or necessarily arose out of it. The appellant took that ground very properly and treated as entirely irrelevant to the controversy between the litigants in this case the mass of learning contained in the cases defining and establishing the rights of a riparian proprietor.\nThat being so what were the rights of the plaintiff, respondent, under his lease? It is necessary in order to understand the contentions of the parties that the locations and boundaries of the plaintiff's lot should be clearly understood.\nBoth litigants are lessees from the City of St. John of water lots in the harbour of St. John. The defendants' lot lies immediately to the south of the plaintiff's. The south side-line of the plaintiff's lot No. 2 is the north side-line of defendants' lot No. 3. Originally these water-lots were laid off according to a plan approved of by the common council of the City of St. John, on the 26th October, 1836. This plan shews the ripa or bank of the shore, the streets running north and south to and from the shore, and those running east and west. The shore line north of the lots in question was a little south of Britain street. The plan shewed two water-lots running south into the harbour a distance of two hundred feet from Britain street. To the east of these two lots ran Charlotte street into what was called Charlotte slip, and lying between Charlotte slip and Sidney-Market slip to the east, the plan shewed eight water-lots comprising what was called \"Block A,\" and numbered from 1 to 8. The plan also shewed a contemplated wharf as running from Britain street into the harbour along the west boundary of all the water-lots, across the southern boundary of water lot No. 8 and then back northerly to Charlotte street. Thus the east and west ends of the two lots abutted on the contemplated wharf, which wharf would be bounded by the Sidney-Market slip and Charlotte slip respectively.\nThe scheme contemplated all the lots being bounded and enclosed by this wharf on the east, south and west sides, and except over and across this wharf there would be no access from any of these water-lots to the waters of the harbour. From this wharf there would be access to the waters of Charlotte slip on the east side and Sidney-Market slip on the west side.\nIn the year 1850 the city leased to one Sandall water-lots 1 and 2 of these water-lots shewn on the plan, for the term of twenty-one years. The lease described them as\nthose two several lots known and distinguished on the plan of water lots laid out by the city on the 26th October, 1836, as numbers 1 and 2 in the block of lots distinguished by the letter A, the said lots having each fifty feet front on a vacant space reserved for a wharf and highway of twenty-five feet wide on the east side of Sydney-Market slip, and extending back eastwardly continuing the same breadth, 60 feet, as exhibited on the said plan.\nThat is, the lots fronted on Sidney-Market slip on the vacant space reserved for a wharf, and extended back to a vacant space reserved for a wharf on west side of Charlotte slip. This lease contained a covenant from Sandall, the lessee, binding him to erect a strong wharf of the dimensions given\nalong the whole front of the said lots on Charlotte slip and also another wharf along the eastwardly side of the said lots on Charlotte slip as exhibited on the plan,\nand provided that both wharves were to be used as streets and public highways, and were for that purpose to be delivered up to the City of St. John for public accommodation reserving right to the lessee to demand and take all wharfage which might become payable for any ships or vessels lying, loading or discharging at the part of the wharf so built by the lessee on Charlotte slip aforesaid.\nSome eight years afterwards Sandall having assigned his leasehold interest in water-lot one (1) to one McAvity, and having fulfilled apparently his covenant for the construction of the two public wharves on the east and west boundaries of both lots, and Charlotte street having been extended out into the waters of the harbour as far at least as the southern line of lot 2, a new arrangement was come to between the city on the one hand and the lessee Sandall and his assignee McAvity on the other. The old lease was surrendered up to the city and separate leases were given of the two lots. Lot No. 1 to McAvity and lot No. 2 to Sandall for the unexpired term of the old lease, namely, till 1871, or for a term of twelve years. The descriptions were modified to conform to the then existing conditions, and as Charlotte slip had been filled in and made part of Charlotte street, the lots were fronted and bounded on that street, and the twenty feet originally reserved for a public wharf being no longer of any use as such was included in the new leases to McAvity and Sandall. Their lots were thus made eighty feet in depth fronting each fifty feet on Charlotte street and extending back to the east side-line of the wharf erected as a public highway on the east side of Sidney-Market slip. The description, however, carefully referred to the plans of the water-lots of the 26th October, 1836, in the same terms as used in the original lease.\nAs these leases expired new leases were given the lessees or their assignees or representatives for short terms, but in each and all of them the same reference was made to the plan of 1836, which continued to be as it was at the first incorporated in and made by reference a part of the leases.\nIn the year 1909, the appellants obtained their lease of water-lots 3 and 4 lying to the south of plaintiff's lot 2. No reference is made in the lease to defendants of the plan of 1836, which is referred to in all the plaintiff's leases.\nThe lands leased the defendants embrace practically water lots No. 3 and 4 as shewn on the original plan of 1836, and the description begins at the southeast corner of lot No. 2 and runs along the whole of its south boundary line. It contemplates a prolongation and broadening of the Sidney-Market wharf, as shewn on a plan attached to it, and leases more land in depth than is contained in plaintiff's lease.\nThis, however, does not in any way affect the question before us. It is most important to bear in mind that no complaint is made or is being dealt with of any obstruction of plaintiff's right of access to and from Sidney-Market wharf on the west side of his water-lot. Had there been any such interruption or stoppage of that right a different question altogether would have arisen. The sole and only question before us in this appeal relates to the plaintiff's claim of a right of uninterrupted access to and from the southern boundary of his water-lot No. 2.\nNow it may well be asked: When and how did such right first arise or come into existence ? What created it? Did the lease of 1850 or that of 1858 or any of the subsequent renewals do so? If not, did the lessee plaintiff gain it by prescription or can it be held to have arisen in some mysterious way because, as it is alleged, the original scheme contemplated in 1850 as shewn by the plan of 1836, which is read into the lease of that date and the subsequent renewals, has since been abandoned by the city.\nFor my part, I pressed counsel on the argument on these points, but could not get what for me was any satisfactory answer, nor does the supplementary factum which they were permitted to file afford any such answer.\nThe learned Chief Justice, if I understand his reasoning correctly, seemed to think the rights of the plaintiff arose out of the new leases granted in 1858, on the surrender of the lease of 1850, because, as he puts it, the description of the lots leased in that later lease of 1858\nleft the southern side of lot No. 2 of eighty feet open to the water as affording the only access by water the owner of that lot had to his property.\nIf the fact was as stated it might be a strong argument in support of the position plaintiff takes and which the Chief Justice indorses; but as I understand the facts and the situation they are altogether different. No one contends that under the lease of 1850 the plaintiff or his predecessor in title had any such right of uninterrupted access on his southern boundary as is now claimed by him. The right of access he had by that lease was not along his southern boundary at all. It was along his east and west boundaries where he had covenanted to build public wharves or highways over one of which he was to have the right to charge and collect wharfage, and his right of access to and from the harbour existed and was provided for. In one sense the language of the Chief Justice is correct, namely, that the only direct access from his own lot No. 2 to the waters of the harbour was on the south side of his lot. But surely the answer to that is that no such direct access to and from his south boundary ever was contemplated. The access which he was intended to have was not from his southern boundary, but from his east and west boundaries into the two slips, Sidney-Market slip and Charlotte slip, over and across the public wharves there. The plan shews that clearly and beyond doubt. It shews a public wharf surrounding all these lots and excluding access to the harbour excepting over this wharf. It shews lots 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 all lying south between plaintiff's lot and this contemplated wharf. This plan was referred to in such clear and distinct terms as made it a controlling factor in construing the lease of 1850. It is introduced in each succeeding new or renewal lease to the plaintiff and his predecessors in title. It shews clearly that no such right of direct uninterrupted access from the southern boundary of his lot to the waters of the harbour ever was intended or contemplated. Such a right, if conceded, would have effectually destroyed all the other water-lots. The changes made in the description of the lease in 1858 did not in any way add to the plaintiff's previous rights of access on his southern boundary. Instead of bounding on the wharf to be built by him on the twenty feet of land lying between his lot No. 2 and Charlotte slip on the east, he was bounded on Charlotte street which had been extended and covered the slip. The lessee got that additional land lying between Charlotte street and lot No. 2 included in his lease of 1858. But in what possible way could this change agreed to by lessor and lessee add to or take away from the lessee's rights along his southern boundary? I fail to see. His access to the harbour remained from his west boundary by way of Sidney-Market slip and on the east from the extension of Charlotte street. That access still remains, as far as we know, unimpaired. At any rate this action is not brought for any infringement or impairment of that right.\nFrom 1858, when the lease of water-lot No. 2 was granted to the plaintiff, and down to 1909 when lot No. 3 was leased to the defendants the title to lot three remained in the City of St. John. That lot 3 bounded plaintiff's lot 2 on its entire southern side. As the owner of lot 3 it was the right of the city to build or use lot 3 as it pleased. If it chose to fill it up or otherwise use it so as to prevent access from the southern side of lot 2 to the waters of the harbour, it was clearly within its right to do so. Whether under the scheme contemplated by the plan of 1836 if such right was exercised a corresponding duty of extending the contemplated wharf along the east side of Sidney-Market slip in front of lot 3 would arise is an entirely different question and does not arise here. The only question before us is as to the claimed right of uninterrupted access by the plaintiff to the waters of the harbour from the south side of water lot 2 leased to him.\nAs to the abandonment of this plan, which was suggested, I fail to see any sufficient evidence of it. The renewed and continuous introduction into all the leases of lots 1 and 2 given from 1850 down is cogent evidence against such abandonment. There was no covenant, express or implied, on the part of the city that the complete wharf would be built by it as shewn in the plan. The scheme contemplated was, I think, the leasing of the several lots 1 to 8 inclusive, and the construction of the wharf by the lessees just as in the case of the lessees of lots 1 and 2. The fact that no leases were given of lots 3 to 8 until 1909, is not of itself evidence of any abandonment of the original scheme. There is no evidence that any such lease was ever applied for or ever refused. The absence of any reference to this plan of 1836 in the lease to the defendants in 1909 is explained by the fact that the plan had been lost, but whatever inference of abandonment of the scheme of constructing a continuous wharf around the eight lots contemplated by the plan of 1836 might be drawn from the granting of the lease to the defendants in 1909 of the water-lots on the south side of the lot 2 leased to plaintiff, it could not possibly operate to confer upon the plaintiffs' rights of access which their own leases not only did not give them, but which, in my judgment, these leases read in conjunction with the plans incorporated in them clearly negatived.\nThe argument that any such right as that claimed by the plaintiff could have been under the facts of these successive leases gained by prescription was mentioned, but hardly pressed, by counsel and could not, in my judgment, be sustained. If there could, under the evidence, be held to have been an abandonment in 1909 when defendants' lease was given or, before that, of the original scheme of constructing a public wharf or highway around these lots connecting with the city streets such an abandonment could not possibly operate to confer upon the lessee of lot No. 2 rights such as these claimed herein not necessary for the enjoyment of his lot and not directly arising out of his lease. Whether in case such abandonment was proved and the defendants suffered any damage as a consequence a right of action accrued to them for such damages gives rise to a question which I do not stop to discuss, as it does not arise in this action. The appeal should be allowed, the injunction dissolved and the action dismissed with costs in all the courts.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised by this appeal is whether or not the City of St. John, having demised to the respondent's predecessor in title a part of the foreshore in said city, has derogated from its grant by a lease to Francis Kerr under whom appellants claim. .\nThe city was incorporated by royal charter on the 26th of July, 1785, and granted all the then ungranted land or ground whatsoever, covered or uncovered with water, and lying within the boundaries of said city and given\nfull power, license and . authority not only to establish, appoint, order and direct, the making and laying out all other streets, lanes, alleys, highways, water-courses, bridges and slips, heretofore made, laid out or used, or hereafter to be made, laid out and used, but also the altering, amending, and repairing all such streets, lanes, alleys, highways, water-courses, bridges and slips, heretofore made, laid out or used, or hereafter to be made, laid out or used in and throughout the said City of Saint John, and the vicinity thereof, throughout the county of Saint John hereinafter mentioned and erected, and also beyond the limits of the said city, on either side thereof, so always as such piers or wharves so to be erected, or streets so to be laid out, do not extend to the taking away of any person's right or property, without his, her, or their consent, or by some known laws of the said Province of New Brunswick, or by the law of the land.\nThis grant of incorporation, and of land and powers or privileges, was confirmed by 26 Geo. III. ch. 46 (3 L. &P. S., p. 3).\nIn 1836 the common council of the city took steps to frame a scheme for the utilization of a large part of the foreshore so granted. And a plan reported to the council by a committee was adopted, yet there seems a doubt as to the finality or legal effect thereof.\nThe report accompanying the plan recommended the leasing of lots laid out according to said plan when completed.\nTheir acts in regard thereto even if valid were liable to change. The city and those claiming under its leases or licenses, according to the plan, might be held bound thereby for the purposes of such leases or licenses. But a plan and the purposes of that day were not immutable. And the conduct of the city authorities as well as the public right to which I will hereafter advert, must all be borne in mind if we would determine this case aright.\nThis plan was somewhat extensive and evidently too ambitious for the time. The part of it we are concerned with may be described as a rectangular block, (105) one hundred and five feet wide by (650) six hundred and fifty feet in length, having on its north side a street called Britain street, running along and barely touching the foreshore. On the west side was a slip known as Sidney-Market slip, (150) one hundred and fifty feet in width, and (650) six hundred and fifty feet in length southerly from the said Britain street. On the east side the boundary was the extension of Charlotte street running at right angles to and south from Britain street two hundred feet to a wharf twenty-five feet wide which runs parallel with Britain street, and from the south side of that wharf to the southern end of the block (425) four hundred and twenty-five feet a slip to be known as Charlotte slip (60) sixty feet wide.\nThere lay south of it and other like blocks parallel to it a large tract of land only dry at low water. As the tide rolled in at high water the block in question would be covered by water to a depth of from ten to fifteen feet or more, if we assume the condition then the same as now. I infer such vessels as could, came in over it as of right to Britain street.\nThe plan proposed to divide this block as follows: Two lots one hundred feet long and together eighty feet wide fronting on Britain street and flanked by Charlotte street and marked by names of persons probably occupying them then. South of these lots there were to be laid out eight lots each fifty feet in width and sixty feet in depth, numbered from the north end to the south, one to eight. And on the east side of said lots so numbered, a strip was marked for a wharf twenty feet wide between Charlotte slip and the ends of said lots. On the west side of all of said lots a strip was marked for a wharf twenty-five feet wide running from Britain street to the southerly boundary of the block. And the whole south end of the block, between lot eight and the southerly side of the block was marked as if to connect both wharves by one of fifty feet wide.\nThis plan was filed in the office of the common clerk and so remains, though mislaid at the time when this litigation began and for many years previously.\nThere does not seem to have been anything done with the property so plotted out till the year 1850, when the city demised to one John Sandall for twenty-one years to be computed from the 1st of May, 1849,\nall those two several lots, pieces and parcels of land, beach or flats, situate, lying and being in Sidney ward in the said city and known and distinguished on the plan of water-lots laid out there by the said Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of Saint John, approved of in common council, on the 26th October, A.D. 1836, and on file in the office of the common clerk of the said city by the numbers (1) one and (2) two in the block of lots distinguished by the letter \"A,\" the said lots being each fifty feet front on a vacant space reserved for a wharf and highway of twenty-five feet wide on the east side of Sidney-Market slip and extending back eastwardly continuing the same breadth sixty feet, as exhibited on the said plan, with all and singular, the rights, members . and appurtenances to same lots belonging or in any wise appertaining: to have and to hold * * *\nSandall covenanted within two years from said date to\nerect, build and complete a good substantial and strong wharf of twenty-five feet wide and of such height as will allow the top thereof to be two feet above high water at the highest spring tides along the whole front of the said lots on Sidney-Market slip as aforesaid, and also within the time aforesaid, erect, build and complete another good substantial and strong wharf of twenty-five feet wide and of similar construction and height along the eastwardly sides of the said lots on 'Charlotte slip, as exhibited on the said plan. The said several wharves when completed to be used as streets and public highways and for that purpose to be delivered up to the said Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of Saint John and their successors for public accommodation, he, the said John Sandall, his executors, administrators and assigns, nevertheless, being entitled to demand and have, receive, and take all wharfage and emoluments which may arise and become payable from any ships or vessels lying, loading or discharging at that part of the said wharf which may have been so built by him, the said John Sandall, his executors, administrators or assigns, on Charlotte slip aforesaid, for and during so long a time as he, the said John Sandall, his executors, administrators or assigns may continue to hold the lots and premises aforesaid by virtue of these presents. The lease provided that if Sandall put wharves, bridges, buildings or other improvements on these lots, such erections were to be valued at the end of his term and the city to have the option of paying same or re-letting the property to him for seven years by lease to contain the like covenants.\nThere seems to have been an interest in lot 1 assigned by Sandall to one McAvity, and in 1858, both surrendered to the city, and on the same day new leases made by the city to each of the parties so become interested.\nThe new leases are made to cover more ground. McAvity got lot one, and Sandall lot two, but the description comprising lot two is as follows:\nAll that certain lot, piece and parcel of land, beach or flats, situate, lying and being in Sidney ward, in the said city and known and distinguished on the plan of water-lots laid out there by the said Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the said City of Saint John, approved of in council on the 26th October, A.D. 1836, and on file in the office of the common clerk of the said city, by the number (2) two, in the block of lots distinguished by the letter \"A,\" the said lot being fifty feet front on Charlotte street, extending back preserving the same breadth, eighty feet, or to the east side line of the wharf erected as and for a public highway on the east side of Sidney-Market slip, with all and singular the rights, members, and appurtenances to the said lot belonging, or in any wise appertaining: to have and to hold * * *\nIt is clear from this that the plan was so far departed from as to abandon the purpose of (continuing Charlotte slip as such, and to constitute that space a street and the land demised is made to front on that street, and run back eighty feet to the wharf on the west side, to be used as a public wharf and highway, which, I infer, Sandall had constructed in accordance with his covenant to do so, before the surrender and new demises.\nA curious feature of the case is that this public wharf is now sixty feet wide, including the twenty-five feet in width thus erected, as I infer, by Sandall. When was it so widened, and by whom? Witnesses who do speak of the existence of this wharf refer to it as being in existence for fifty to fifty-five years. Collins, who worked in 1874 at the premises in question, says the public wharf was twenty feet, about, in width. I think the fair inference is that it had been extended to sixty feet wide shortly after that time, and indeed may have been so at the time of the granting of the last renewal leases in 1882. Since that, which would be for seven years, in fact there has been no further renewal made.\nThe new-leases to MeAvity and Sandall respectively, made in 1858, were to continue for the term of twelve years which exactly covers the residue of the twenty-one year term in the original lease to Sandall.\nNo one seems to have taken up the other lots in this block till Kerr got the lease I am about to refer to.\nMeantime the Sandall lease has been renewed from time to time till 1882, and ever since has been assumed to be renewed by the conduct of the parties and payment of rent, for the space just described. The last term is now thus vested in respondent and unexpired containing covenants for compensation for improvements or renewals as first provided, unless the term may have become a yearly tenancy as to which no contention is set up.\nAll these successive lessees of lot two and the added easterly strip, have used, apparently as of right from time to time, the south end of the wharf erected on said lands as well as the westerly side for unloading vessels. The leases were clearly to enable the lessees to use the demised premises for the business of wharfingers and the like businesses needing access to and from the sea or tidal waters thereof.\nIt is, therefore, contended that the city's lease gives this right of access, and thereby it became appurtenant to said land and was so, when last demised \"with the appurtenances\" to the respondent or those under whom he claims.\nIn argument there are several ways that the grounds of such claim were presented. The right having been acquired by prescription was tentatively suggested; and then that a grant might be presumed after so long an exercise of the right; and finally that the plan was entirely abandoned and the case one of a demise of so much land clearly useful only for wharf purposes, and unloading and storage in connection therewith, and impliedly demised for such purposes, with two sides open to the sea the right of access must be presumed to have been intended as part of the grant made by way of demise. One means of access was alongside and over the public wharf and highway on the east side, and the other on the south open to the tidal flow of the sea.\nAs to prescription or presumption of a grant, it seems to me on reading the evidence and considering all the circumstances, and especially want of evidence of transfer from one lessee to another, it is idle to contend for either. They were each and all independent lessees claiming under the same landlord for brief periods. I think certainly this part of the history might have been made clearer.\nThe only arguable ground, as it seems to me, upon which the respondent's contention of right of access to the southerly side of lot two can be maintained, is some such ground as is stated in the ground last mentioned, or what was not precisely taken in argument, but may be a fair presentation of what was aimed at therein. It is this, that the departure from the plan in 1858 closing up Charlotte slip and thereby depriving the lessees of access for vessels on that side followed by so long a period of actual use by its lessees of the southerly access, and recognition thereof by the city, it must be taken to have intended, in making later renewals, and especially this last one, to have included this right of access to the south side as one of the appurtenances covered by the lease.\nIf there had never been framed any plan or scheme for developing this foreshore property, but the city in the exercise of its rights and powers over it acquired by the grant above quoted, had demised for wharf purposes this very land now held by respondent, and described it by metes and bounds after having appropriated, as in fact had been done in this instance, the lands adjoining the northerly and easterly sides, could it be said that thereafter the city could with impunity shut off access on both or either of the remaining sides ? Is it conceivable that such a proceeding could be held as a thing rightfully done, and that it was not a derogation from the grant?\nSomething was said of there being no riparian rights in such a case, and it seemed to be supposed by this argument that when quit of that basis of right the appellants were freed from the law as laid down in the case of Lyon v. Fishmongers' Co.[3]. The principle of law proceeded upon therein must surely be observed. The right of access in that case rested upon the riparian rights of the plaintiff. The right in this case rests upon the nature of the grant and the necessary implications therein, having regard to \"the position into which the parties have placed themselves,\" as expressed by Cotton L.J. in the Birmingham, Dudley and District Banking Go. v. Ross[4], at page 308.\nI am disposed to bear in mind in this connection in addition to the considerations noted by Chief Justice Barker, the peculiar nature of the title to and powers over the foreshore conferred upon the city by the grant to it.\nThe cases of Attorney-General v. Burridge[5], and Attorney-General v. Parmeter[6], as well as the case of Mayor of Golehester v. Brooke[7], at page 374, and other cases, shew that a grant such as this by the Crown is held subject to the general public right of passage, and cannot entitle the grantee to use the property in a way detrimental to the public.\nThere may be sanctioned by Parliament an alienation of the foreshore that may destroy any such public right.\nBut the original grant by the Crown in question here seems to have been such as those which were in question in the cases I refer to. And I doubt if the language of the statute confirming that grant added any more to its effect than if validly granted. It seems to have been simply of a confirmatory nature and possibly to overcome the difficulty akin to that suggested in the case of The Queen v. Clarke[8], relative to the powers of colonial governors.\nDid it not leave the grant to be in effect simply what this court held in Wood v. Esson[9], resulted from a grant by the Crown merely passing the title to the soil? And if the grant is considered it seems to be no more than that, and a measure of conservancy which would, when confirmed, enable the exercise of a regulating power.\nIn argument the question was raised, but not fully argued, and I do no more now than point out that it is not to be lost sight of in considering the implications lying in such a lease so given.\nThe city shortly before this suit made a lease to Kerr, under whom appellants claim, of the land to the south side of that held by respondent. The lease is dated 11th of March, 1909, and demises\nall that certain piece and parcel of land, beach and flats situate, lying and being in Sidney ward, in the said City of Saint John and bounded as follows, that is to say: beginning at a point on 'Charlotte street extension three hundred (300) feet south, of Britain street or at the south-easterly corner of lot No. 2, thence running in a westerly direction along the southerly end of Sidney-Market wharf one hundred and forty (140) feet, thence southerly along a prolongation of the line of the westerly side of said Sidney-Market wharf parallel to said Charlotte street extension one hundred (100) feet, thence easterly parallel to said southerly end of Sidney-Market wharf one hundred and forty (140) feet or to the westerly side of Charlotte street extension thence northerly along said westerly side one hundred (100) feet to the place of beginning, all as shewn within the red margin on the plan hereto annexed, with all and singular the rights, members and appurtenances to the said lot belonging, or in any wise appertaining: to have and to hold * * * for the term of ten years.\nThe appellants proceeded to erect on said premises thus demised a wharf. Thereupon this suit was instituted. Clearly the result of such erection if continued will be to shut out respondent from all access to the southerly side of his premises enjoyed for half a century, and impair the possibility of access to same on the westerly side, if not destroy it entirely.\nChief Justice Barker finds that its effect is to close up respondent's entire water-frontage. And save such possibilities as the access to the Sidney-Market slip, this seems absolutely so.\nThat slip was narrowed by the widening of the public wharf some thirty-five feet. It is left only one hundred and fifteen feet wide. Not only have we no evidence of this being of no public use for vessels, but we have the difficulty of the right of access across the added width to the wharf, making it sixty feet instead of twenty-five, across which to transfer freight from vessels to the respondent's property, if at all possible.\nCan such a proceeding be held not to be in derogation of the city's grant? Can it be tolerated in law? Does it need authority beyond the principles of law expounded in the Birmingham, Dudley and District Banking Co. v. Ross[10], and the Fishmongers' Case[11], though the points involved here are not identical with those apparent in either of said cases to demonstrate that the respondent is not bound in law to submit to such deprivation of what is implied in the grant to him or those under whom he claims?\nWhether we look at it technically as a derogation from the grant or as a breach of an implied covenant as suggested by Bowen L. J., in the Birmingham Case10, the wrong seems flagrant. The later cases of Aldin v. Latimer, Clark, Muirhead &. Co.[12], and Cable v. Bryant[13], may also be looked at for instances of the application of the principle of law expounded therein and authorities cited in them relative to it.\nBut those who profess to give this right to do so are by the very terms of their charter, if we look at its language, scope and purpose, conservators of the public right and in duty bound as such to see that those acquiring leases such as respondent has are enabled to carry on their business as wharfingers.\nThe only excuse offered is that the plan referred to plainly indicated that lots three and four marked thereon were to have been the subject of such leases as made of numbers one and two, and that these lots are comprised in the lease to appellants. True they are, and a great deal more, but so far from following the plan the numbers of lots are not even named in the lease, but metes and bounds are assigned which are absolutely at variance with the plan.\nThe plan has been departed from in almost every other material respect. Why not also by leaving a slip at the south end wide enough to serve the land in question, and something further south as was proposed to appellants?\nThe plan must be treated as abandoned if fair dealing is to prevail. It certainly cannot, as against respondent, be appealed to unless the city is prepared to abide by it, save in so far as the closing of Charlotte slip, evidently assented to by all parties concerned when converted into a street. If the plan with that exception had been adhered to the respondent would have the entrance and access originally contemplated. Now he is to be deprived thereof on the strength of the plan. And in the next place they claim the plan is fatal to the right of plaintiff, but deprive him of the plan.\nCounsel took exception to the comparison by the court below of the right involved, to that in cases of lateral support in the soil for adjacent buildings.\nBut without entering upon that inquiry, I may say the comparison and illustrations were made by Lord Cairns (in quoting with approval Lord Wensleydale in Chasemore v. Richards[14]) in determining the Fishmonger's Case[15]. I have already pointed out the analogy in principle involved there and here. It all comes back to what right of access must be implied in a grant in a given case. The grant of anything for a specific purpose surely implies that the grantor should not so use his property or power as to destroy entirely (even though done bit by bit) that which he has granted.\nAppellants have failed so far to shew authority justifying their conduct, that counsel are driven to rely on the case of Crook v. Corporation of Seaford[16], which relates to an agreement relative to some marsh land, and was a case of specific performance in no way involving the rights of navigation or the accommodation therefor such as wharves.\nAs conservators of this harbour the city authorities are no doubt entitled, to modify plans, but in so doing are not to deprive others of their rights.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree in the result.\nAnglin J.\u2014With very great respect for the learned Chief Justice and the judges of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, I find myself unable to agree in the view which they have taken of this case.\nIt is, I think, unquestionable that under the original lease of lots one and two made to John Sandall in 1850 he took and held this property subject to the right of the city to lease or otherwise deal with the adjoining lots, Nos. 3 and 4, and the other lots in block \"A\" lying to the south for purposes which would deprive the lessee of lot No. 2 of any water-frontage along its southern limit. Although in 1858 there was a departure from the original plan of 1836 according to which lots 1 and 2 had been leased, in that provision was then made for converting the Charlotte street slip into a public street, the new leases which the respondent's predecessors then took establish their acquiescence in such departure and also sufficiently indicate that in other respects their rights as lessees of lots 1 and 2 were intended to be the same as they had been under the lease of 1850. That the city by the leases of 1858 forewent any of its rights in respect of lots 3 and 4 and the other lots in block \"A\" shewn on the plan of 1836 or subjected these lots to any such easement or servitude as the plaintiff asserts cannot, in my opinion, be successfully maintained. The leases themselves make it clear that the plan was to be adhered to subject to the necessary modification of it due to the conversion of the Charlotte street slip into a street. Throughout the subsequent renewal leases of lots 1 and 2 down to and inclusive of those under which the respondents now hold them (except that by an obviously clerical error 1856 is sometimes written for 1836) lots 1 and 2 are consistently described as lots in block \"A\" according to the plan of 1836, modified, of course, by the arrangement of 1858, which gave to the leased property an additional depth of 20 feet with a frontage on the Charlotte street extension in lieu of a frontage on Charlotte street slip. I, therefore, find nothing in the various documents under which the respondent asserts title, taken by themselves, which confers upon him any such right as he claims in this case.\nNeither do I find in the circumstances existing at the time of the making of any of the several leases upon which the plaintiff relies, as disclosed in the record, anything which would, in my opinion, justify us in holding that the plan of 1836, which the parties deliberately embodied in these leases, as part of the description of the premises leased, should be put aside or ignored. The lease of lot 2 according to that plan, subject to the modification of 1858, excludes the idea that by virtue of it the plaintiff's predecessor in title acquired anything in the nature of riparian rights \u2014 anything which would now entitle him to require the city to preserve for him the water-access to the southern side of lot 2, which he had enjoyed merely because the city had not itself, or by any tenant or assign, exercised such rights as it possessed in respect of lot No. 3.\nThe evidence in the record is insufficient to establish a case of prescriptive acquisition of a right to have vessels come up to and lie against the southern face of the wharf built on lot 2 and of a consequent easement or servitude over lot 3, if indeed such a right could in the circumstances of this case be acquired by any mere user, however extensive or prolonged.\nThe terms of the charter of the City of St. John, confirmed by legislation[17], are wide enough to enable the city to lease lots 3 and 4 to the defendants for building purposes, as it had in the exercise of the same powers previously leased lots 1 and 2 to the predecessors in title of the plaintiff. By a clause of the charter (pages 1010-11) all\nmessages, tenements, dwelling-houses, lots of ground and all other lands or grounds whatsoever, covered or uncovered with water, situate, lying and being within the said City of Saint John and the limits and boundaries thereof, saving all houses, lands, tenements and hereditaments held, enjoyed or legally claimable by subjects of the Crown) are vested in the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of St. John and their successors forever to be held \"in free and common socage, as of our manor of East Greenwich, etc.\nThis description includes all the lots shewn on block \"A\" of the plan of 1836 and surrounding lands covered by water.\nBy another clause of the charter (p. 1014) the common-lands on the east side of the harbour are declared to be for the common use of the inhabitants of the city residing on that side of the harbour and it is provided that the rents, issues and proceeds arising by the sale or other disposal thereof shall be applied to the improvement, benefit and advantage of that part of the city and of the inhabitants thereof. The Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty are also made conservators of the water of the river, harbour, and bay of the city (pp. 998-9) and have conferred upon them\nthe sole power of amending and improving the said river, bay, and harbour for the more convenient, safe and easy navigating, riding and fastening the shipping resorting to the said city;\nand they are empowered\nas they shall see proper (to) erect and build such and so many piers and wharves into the river as well for the better securing the said harbour and for the lading and unlading of goods as for the making docks and slips for the purpose aforesaid.\nThey are further empowered\nto establish, appoint, order and direct the making and laying out of other streets, lanes, alleys, highways, water-courses, bridges and slips heretofore made, laid out or used or hereafter to be made, laid out and used and also to alter, amend and repair all such streets, lanes, alleys, highways, water-courses, bridges and slips * * * so always as such piers or wharves so to be erected or streets so to be laid out do not extend to the taking away of any person's right or property without his, her or their consent or by some known laws of the said Province of New Brunswick or by the law of the land.\nThe soil of the water-lots is therefore vested in the municipal corporation. As part of the common lands these lots are subject to the powers of the city to sell or otherwise dispose of them. The charter clearly contemplates that they may be leased. While private rights of property are expressly saved, the municipal corporation is empowered to construct, or to provide for the construction of slips, piers and wharves as it shall see proper, and in doing so it is empowered to interfere as far as may be necessary with the public right of navigation. The scheme of the plan of 1836 was within the powers conferred by its charter upon the City of St. John. In making the lease to the defendants of which the plaintiff complains the city, therefore, did not unwarrantably interfere with any public right, nor, as pointed out above, did it without sanction of law take from the plaintiff the private right or property of the loss of which he now complains. It could not take from him that to which he had no legal title.\nThe plaintiff's claim in this action and the judgment in appeal extend only to preventing the defendants injuring or obstructing the plaintiff's alleged\nright of access to the waters of the harbour on the southern side of the plaintiff's wharf, or the privilege's heretofore enjoyed by the plaintiff of laying and mooring craft, loading and unloading, and embarking and disembarking goods on the south side of the plaintiff's wharf.\nThe building of a wharf or other construction on the most easterly 80 feet of the premises which the city has purported to lease to the defendants and which lie immediately along the southern frontage of lot No. 2 will effectually destroy the right which the plaintiff asserts. If the defendants cannot be prevented from building on this part of the premises leased to them this action must fail. The plaintiff presently makes no claim in respect of any erection which they have placed or may place on the westerly 60 feet of the premises lying immediately south of the east wharf of the Sidney slip. Indeed, if the defendants build upon the easterly 80 feet of their premises the plaintiff's access by water to the southern side of his existing wharf would be totally destroyed, and any erection on the westerly 60 feet could not further affect it. Whatever rights the plaintiff may have in respect of this latter parcel of land leased to the defendants, whether he is or is not entitled to have it utilized for the purposes of a public wharf and highway free from any buildings or other obstruction which would interfere with such use of it \u2014 whatever claim he may have against the city for damages based on any failure on its part to observe or fulfil its obligations to him in regard to the scheme defined by the plan of 1836, in my opinion he has not any right of access by water to the southern front of lot 2 such as would entitle him to the relief which he seeks in this action and which he has been accorded in the provincial courts. He has not made a case of prescriptive right; and the lease to the defendants, at all events as to lots 3 and 4 as shewn on the plan of 1836, involves no derogation by the city from its earlier deeds under which the plaintiff claims.\nI would allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the provincial appellate court and would dismiss this action with costs.

McKinnon on the list of contributories of the Ontario Sugar Co. in process of liquidation under the \u201cWinding-up Act.\u201d\nThe facts are fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin on the application for leave.\nW.N. Tilley for the motion.\nWallbridge, for McKinnon, contra.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The liquidator applies under section 106 of the Dominion \u201cWinding-up Act\u201d for leave to appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of Mere- dith C.J.1, who dismissed an appeal by the liquidator from the refusal of the referee to place the name of Mr. S.F. McKinnon on the list of contributories in respect of a sum of $5,000 unpaid on certain shares of the insolvent company. To the liquidator\u2019s claim McKinnon has pleaded, inter alia, that it is res judicata that he is not the holder of these shares. This plea is based upon a consent judgment dismissing an action brought by the company, in 1902, to recover from McKinnon the same sum of $5,000 in respect of unpaid calls. To the company\u2019s claim he then answered that he was not a shareholder and, alternatively, that the calls sued upon had not been regularly made. He also brought in a third party against whom he claimed indemnity. The judgment dismissing the action provided for the withdrawal of the claim against the third party.\nIn reply to the plea of res judicata the liquidator urges that since irregularity in the making of the calls would, if established, have been a sufficient defence to the company\u2019s action, the record does not shew a determination in McKinnon\u2019s favour of the issue whether he was or was not a shareholder.\nIn the present proceedings the regularity of the calls is admitted. Referring particularly to this admission, the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas held that it was sufficiently established that\nthe ground upon which the respondent succeeded in the action was that he was not a shareholder in the company.\nIn delivering the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal the learned Chief Justice of Ontario makes special mention of the withdrawal of McKinnon\u2019s claim against the third party as indicating that it was intended that there should be \u201can end to all claims upon the shares.\u201d I do not, however, understand him to reject the grounds upon which Sir W.R. Meredith based his judgment, but rather to add to them another leading to the same conclusion.\nLooking at all the circumstances of the former action including those which appear to have received special attention in the provincial courts, and also the conduct of the company and its officers in regard to the respondent\u2019s status as a shareholder from the date of the judgment in 1904 down to the commencement of the liquidation in 1908\u2014he did not receive notice of the meetings or other proceedings of the company\u2014I see no reason to doubt the correctness of the judgment against which the liquidator seeks to appeal.\nThat a consent judgment will support a plea of res judicata is conceded. Although contested by counsel for the applicant, the proposition that the court may look beyond the judgment and the pleadings to ascertain what issue was actually determined in an action, is well established by the authorities which the learned Chief Justices cite. The facts proper to be considered in this case make it reasonably clear that by the consent judgment the parties meant to dispose finally of the issue whether the defendant was or was not a shareholder in the plaintiff company. The judgment of which the liquidator now complains\u2014I say it with respect\u2014seems to me to be plainly right. Leave to appeal might properly be refused on this ground. Lake Erie and Detroit River Ry. Co. v. Marsh[2].\nBut, whether right or wrong, that judgment merely decides that from particular facts the proper infer- ence is that by the consent judgment dismissing the company\u2019s action it was determined that McKinnon was not a shareholder. The proposed appeal raises no question of public importance. Dominion Council of Royal Templars of Temperance v. Hargrove[3]. The affirmance or reversal by this court of the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal would not settle any important question of law or dispose of any matter of public interest. Whyte Packing Co. v. Pringle[4]. These usual grounds for seeking leave to appeal are therefore absent.\nI have not overlooked the fact that in section 48 (e) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d under which the cases that I have cited were decided, \u201cspecial leave\u201d is mentioned, while in section 106 of the \u201cWinding-up Act,\u201d \u201cleave\u201d is the term used. But \u201cleave\u201d must be granted in the exercise of judicial discretion. Matters other than the amount involved in the appeal must be considered\u2014and amongst them those to which I have alluded. Notwithstanding Mr. Tilley\u2019s able argument, unless leave to appeal to this court should be given as a matter of course in every case in which a substantial amount is at stake, I find no reason for granting the present application. Having twice appealed unsuccessfully, the liquidator has certainly discharged his whole duty. Although he has carried his case to the court of last resort in the province, his contention has not been accepted by a single judge. In a further appeal I see no prospect of any advantage to the insolvent estate, but rather a very great probability of its being involved in useless additional heavy expense. This litigation has been already prolonged. The respondent should not lightly be subjected to the worry and the cost of further proceedings, which, so far as I can see, would serve no good purpose. This seems to be eminently a case in which the judgment of the provincial Court of Appeal should be accepted as final.\nThe motion will be dismissed with costs fixed at the figure usual in this court\u2014$50.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 22 Ont.

(1909)) erected dams at the outlet of the Lakes Ste. Anne into the River Ouelle to form a reservoir, by penning back the waters of these lakes, for the purpose of augmenting the natural flow of the River Ouelle during seasons when its waters had abated to facilitate the transmission of timber cut on their limits below that point and delivering it at their saw-mill further down stream. They were owners of the lands on both sides of the stream at the place where the dams were erected. The fish and game club were lessees of fishery and 'hunting privil\u00e8ges under a lease issued in virtue of the \"Quebec Fisheries Act,\" and the \"Quebec Game Laws\" which had been in force for a number of years prior to the erection of the dams but which was surrendered subsequent to their construction and a new lease granted to the club in its stead by the Crown. The leases cover the territory included in the above mentioned townships and the timber limits therein held by the lumber company. The action was brought by the club to recover damages for injuries occasioned to their rights as lessees of the fishery and hunting rights in consequence of the manner in which the dams were used and lumbering operations carried on in the river by the lumber company.\nHeld (Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting).\u2014That the plaintiffs have a status to maintain an action for injuries to their rights as fishing and hunting licensees and that the judgment at the trial (Q.R. 36 S.C. 486) for such damages should be restored.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard and Anglin JJ.\u2014The respondents had the right to construct and maintain the dam in question and to use it to facilitate the flotation of logs etc. in the lower reaches of the River Ouelle.\nPer Idington J. (Davies J. dubitante).\u2014This right exists only in respect of the streams or portions of them down which logs, etc., are actually driven by the timber licensees and does not extend to storage dams upon upper reaches and tributary waters not themselves used for the flotation of timber.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The powers conferred by the statute must be exercised reasonably. In this case, the impounding of the stream's sources, miles beyond any part of it on which any timber could be expected to pass, is not within the contemplation of the statute and would not be a reasonable exercise of the powers intended to be conferred.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard and Duff JJ. (agreeing with the court below (Q.R. 19 K.B. 178) ).\u2014The right to aid the user of floatable streams by artificial means authorized by article 7299 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec ( 1909) may be exercised at all seasons of the year.\nPer Davies, Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014Articles 7298 and 7299 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909) must be read together and, while the right to use floatable streams in their natural state for the flotation of timber exists at all times and in all seasons, the right to aid such user by the artificial means authorized by article 7299 may be exercised only during the periods mentioned in article 7298, viz., during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets.\nPer Curiam, Fitzpatrick C.J. contra.\u2014This right, whatever its extent or duration, is exercisable only subject to the condition that the person enjoying it shall make compensation to I others holding rights such as the appellants enjoy; and, having regard to the circumstances of this case and the legislation governing it, the question of priority in the acquisition of the respective rights of the parties is of no consequence.\nLeave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused, 15th May, 1911.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench[1], revelling the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Kamouraska[2], and dismissing the appellants' action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe dispositif of the judgment of Cimon J., in the trial court were as follows:\u2014\n\"Arbitrant \u00e0 quatre cent piastres les dommages que la d\u00e9fenderesse a caus\u00e9s au demandeur dans les deux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019action,\n\"Ordonne \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de ne plus user de la dite \u00e9cluse de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 inonder les terrains conc\u00e9d\u00e9s au club demandeur pour les fins de p\u00eache et de chasse, et en ce qui concerne la dite \u00e9cluse, 'd'agir en tous points de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner aux eaux des dits lacs dans la dite d\u00e9charge leur cours naturel' et ce tant et aussi longtemps que les baux de p\u00eache et de chasse du demandeur seront en vigueur; et\n\"Condamne la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer au demandeur, pour dommages caus\u00e9s au cours des deux ann\u00e9es qui de ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019action, la somme de quatre cent piastres, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat du 11 mai, mil neuf cent huit, et les d\u00e9pens de l'action.\"\nThe consid\u00e9rants of the formal judgment of the Court of King's Bench are as follows:\u2014\n\"Considering that the appellant had, at all times herein referred to, a right to maintain and use as it did the dam in question in this cause and that respondent, by and in virtue of its fishing and hunting leases, acquired the right of fishing and of hunting only as they existed in the year. 1905 and subject to the prior right of the appellant to maintain and use said dam as it did for and in connection with lumbering operations.\n\"Considering that respondent suffered no damage by the action of appellant and that it has no right to recover from it or to have appellant condemned to cease using said dam as it has done.\n\"Considering that there is error in the judgment appealed from.\n\"This court doth maintain the present appeal and reverse the judgment appealed from, * * * and, proceeding to render the judgment the said Superior Court ought to have rendered, doth maintain appellant's pleas and dismiss respondent's action with costs against respondent in favour of appellant in this court and in the Superior Court.\n\"Mr. Justice Carroll concurs in reversing so much of the judgment a quo as condemns appellant to cease using its dam as it has done, but dissents from so much of the judgment now rendered as reverses that part of the judgment a quo which condemns appellant in damages.\" L. P. Pelletier K.C. for the appellants.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and C. E. Dorion K.C. for the respondents.\nTh\u00e9 Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014This is a possessory action to which has been joined a claim for damages; and were it not that, on other grounds, I have come to the conclusion that the action should be dismissed, I would have felt obliged to very seriously consider the question of the plaintiffs' right to ask, in this proceeding, for any order with respect to the construction or operation of the dam. It is undoubted law that a mere lessee cannot bring a possessory action \"en complainte\" although he may sue for damages.\nLe preneur n'ayant qu'un droit personnel et mobilier n'a pas l'action possessoire. Guillouard, Louage, vol. 1, no. 29.\nSee also Pigeau, vol. 2, p. 9; S.V. 41, 1, 852 and S.V. 93, 1,237. Guillouard, ibidem, no. 174.\nThe right to hunt is generally considered in English law to be a grant of an interest in land. Webber v. Lee[3]. In French law there is a distinction to be made which is well expressed in Fuzier Herman, R\u00e9p., vo. \"Chasse,\" no. 111:\u2014\nLa cession \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux du droit de chasse ne doit pas \u00eatre confondue avec la location de ce m\u00eame droit. La cession est consentie moyennant l'acquittement d'un prix une fois pay\u00e9, tandis que la location suppose, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le paiement de fermages p\u00e9riodiques. Le cessionnaire a un droit r\u00e9el, qui lui permet d'intenter directement toutes actions contre les tiers pour faire reconna\u00eetre et respecter son droit. Le locataire, au contraire, n'est qu'un cr\u00e9ancier de jouissance; en cas de trouble occasionn\u00e9 par un acte juridique, il ne peut que mettre son bailleur en cause. Si le propri\u00e9taire du fonds grev\u00e9 de la servitude personnelle de chasse vient y chasser ind\u00fbment, il peut \u00eatre poursuivi correctionnellement par le cessionnaire; le locataire, en pareil cas, \u00e0 notre avis du moins, n'a contre le bailleur qu'une action civile en dommages\u2014 int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nSee also B\u00e9lime no. 267; Garnier, \"Actions Possessaires,\" pp. 168, 169.\nI am disposed to think that the possession given by the leases relied on here must be construed to mean use and occupation and not civil possession as defined by article 2922 of the Civil Code, and that they do not confer on the licensee any higher right than the tenant would have at common law. Aubry & Rau, vol. 2, par. 177, p. 106, defines possession:\u2014\nL'\u00e9tat de fait qui donne \u00e0 une personne la possibilit\u00e9 physique, actuelle et exclusive d'exercer sur une chose des actes mat\u00e9riels d'usage, de puissance et de transformation.\nBecause of the form in which the claim is made, and of the nature of the evidence adduced to support it, another question would require to be considered arising out of the distinction between the rights of the owner and those of the lessee which I find stated in these words in a note to Dalloz; 1905, 2, 10: Il ne faut pas\nconfondre la possession du droit de chasse au cours des man\u0153uvres, avec le droit de chass\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, celui-ci, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans son ensemble, constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment souvent fort important du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. On peut bien faire ressortir la confusion ainsi commise en opposant la privation de jouissance, qui est une servitude grevant le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'atteinte r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9peuplement total ou partiel, lequel abolit en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame.\nIn this case the claim is chiefly, if not entirely, for damages caused not to the fishing and hunting but to the fishery and to the hunting preserve; such damages constitute a permanent injury to the property which might well give the owner a claim, but not the lessee. If the dam is maintained and operated as at present the fish will, according to the allegations of the declaration, be destroyed and the other game driven from the preserve. How much of the damages allowed is to be apportioned to the permanent injury done the property and how much to the interference with the appellants' rights of enjoyment? If the respondents pay the present claim, can they set that payment up in answer to a claim from the owner for permanent dam ages to the property? I feel it to be my duty to mention these difficulties which must strike everyone at all familiar with the principles applicable to possessory actions as fundamental; and, although in the conclusion I have reached, it is not necessary for me to do more than to draw attention to them, they must be disposed of and decided by those who are in favour of allowing this appeal. The effect of article 1065 C.P.C. was not raised here or below.\nThe facts are very fully stated by my brother Anglin. The respondents are owners of timber limits, covering about 300 miles, of which they and their auteurs have been in possession for a great number of years under government licenses renewable annually. Those licenses convey for the period of their duration the ownership of all the timber within the area granted. Sections 1599-1600, R.S.Q.; Watson v. Perkins[4] per Sanborn J. at page 270; Dupuy v. Ducondu[5] per Fournier J. at page 463. For the purpose of manufacturing into timber the logs cut on their limits the respondents have built a saw-mill on the River Ouelle at the place called St. Pac\u00f4me. The logs are floated from the limits where they are cut to the mill, a distance of about 20 miles, on the waters of the River Ouelle and its numerous branches and tributaries. For the purpose of facilitating the conveyance of their logs from the limits where they are cut to the mill, where they are sawn, the respondents erected a dam on a stream that serves to discharge the waters of two lakes into one of the branches of the River Ouelle. The two lakes are connected together by a small stream called by the witnesses \"La Passe\" and are within the area covered by the timber licenses. The dam, built entirely on the respondents' own property, raises the level of the water in the lakes and floods their shores to the injury of the fishing and hunting privileges held by the appellants over a large area which includes these two lakes; hence this action.\nBoth parties practically agree that the dam was built by the respondents, and is used by them, to facilitate the floating of their logs down the river, from the limits to the mills at all seasons, but more particularly when the freshets of the Spring, Summer and Autumn having ceased to affect the flow of the water the river in its natural state cannot float logs. Two questions, therefore, fall to be decided on the merits of this appeal. The first is: Have the respondents the right to erect and maintain the dam complained of, subject to the obligation to pay damages, if any are occasioned? And, if to this question an affirmative answer is given, the next question to be considered is: Can the dam be utilized during all seasons? Girouard J, and I agree, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin, with the unanimous judgment of the provincial court of appeal that the respondents have the right to erect and maintain the dam to facilitate the floating of their logs; but there is a difference of opinion between us as to the periods of the year during which the dam may be used for that purpose. My brother Anglin holds that the use of the dam must be limited to the periods of the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets. My 'brother Girouard, with whom I agree, holds that the respondents may utilize the waters of the dam to aid the flotation of their logs at all times, as occasion to do so arises. I would add just one word with respect to the right to erect this dam for the pur- nose of storing water to aid in floating logs when the rivers are low. We are called upon to construe a statute passed for the purpose of aiding a most important industry by a legislature which presumably is familiar with the local conditions to which the provisions of that statute are made applicable. The words used, giving to them their ordinary and natural meaning, authorize the erection and maintenance of dams anywhere for the purpose of facilitating the floating of timber down all rivers, etc., the condition being payment of damages. Should we with at best a very limited knowledge of the conditions which the legislation was intended to remedy assume to say that, because of some inconveniences that may result if we give to the language used its plain and obvious meaning, the legislature did not mean what it said?\nThe dam was built in the Autumn of 1903 on a lot of land acquired by the respondents in fee simple from the Crown and was first put into operation during the lumbering season of 1904. At that time the appellants held fishing and hunting leases over a small portion of the territory covered by the timber licenses; but, in March, 1905, those leases were cancelled and new leases issued which are produced as appellants' documents of title. Let me observe here that the leases of March, 1905, are not renewals but new leases issued in lieu of the old leases which were cancelled; and the ground of action is an alleged interference with the rights granted by these new leases within the two years preceding the date of the action, (1908). The rights of the lessees as to fishing and hunting are defined in sections 2256 and 2350 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909) in substantially the same words in so far as they affect the issues here, and I will quote only one section:\u2014\n2256. The lease shall confer upon the lessee, for the time therein : specified, the right to take and retain exclusive possession of the lands therein described, subject to the regulations, fees and restrictions which may be established, and shall give him the exclusive right to fish in the waters fronting on such lands subject to the provincial and federal laws, fees and regulations then in force, and also to prosecute in his own name any illegal possessor or offender against this section and to. recover damages, if any, but not against any person who may pass over such lands or the adjacent waters, or who engage in any occupation not inconsistent with this section, nor against the holder of a license to cut timber, who has, at all times, in accordance with his license, the right to cut and remove trees, lumber and saw-logs, and other timber, within the limits of his license, and during the term thereof, to make use of any floatable river or watercourse, or of any lake, pond or other body of water and the banks thereof for the conveyance of all kinds of lumber and for the passage of all boats, ferries and canoes required therefor, subject to the charge of repairing all damages resulting from the exercise of such right.\nNo such lease can be issued by the Minister for more than nine years (R.S.Q. art. 2249) and the rent is payable annually in advance as a condition of renewal (art. 2255). The right to cut and remove all timber from the territory covered by their license, which includes the area covered by the hunting and fishing leases, is especially reserved to the respondents together with the right to utilize for that purpose all floatable rivers, water-courses, lakes, ponds or other bodies of water, whether they are within or without the area covered by these leases. So that if, to drive timber cut on their limits within or without the territory covered by the appellants' fishing and hunting leases, it is necessary to utilize waters situate within that territory, the respondents have authority to do it and the appellants cannot complain. The difficulty in this case, it is said, arises out of the fact that the timber was cut on the river below the place at which the dam is built, and it is argued that the statute does not contemplate the contingency of a dam being required above to gather water to facilitate the driving of logs cut on the river below the dam. With all deference, it appears to me obvious that the object of the statute is to increase the floatability of rivers and streams by artificial means for the driving of lumber. The statute does not limit the places at which the works designed to effect that purpose may be built provided they aid in the result which the legislature had in view; and there is no more effective way to reach that result than by creating a reservoir at the source to increase the flow of water in the river during the dry seasons. I will not press this point further, as I am of opinion, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin, that the right to build the dam must be maintained.\nI now come to the point of difference between my brother Anglin and myself which I have already explained. Because of the enormous importance of the issue involved to the respondents who, by the use of the dam, have been able to increase their output of logs from about eighty thousand per annum to over three hundred thousand and generally to the lumber industry, which is by far the most important in the Province of Quebec and which will be seriously affected by this judgment, I will endeavour to explain my view of the rights enjoyed by timber-limit holders in Quebec. It is and always has been (since the ordinance of 1669, \"Ordonnance des eaux et for\u00eats'') the law in the Province of Quebec that the public have a legal servitude for floating down logs or rafts at all seasons of the year on all rivers, streams and water-courses of the province. See \"Ordonnance des eaux et for\u00eats, 1669\"; Oliva v. Boissonnault[6]; McBean v. Carlisle[7]; Tanguay v. Price[8]. The right to use the watercourses of the province for the conveyance of all kinds of lumber was extended to their banks by 20 Vict. ch. 40, sec, 2 (C.S.L.C. ch. 26, sec. 2, sub-sec. 2). This right is re-affirmed in article 891 of the Municipal Code and will be found in the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1886) section 5551, and in the new Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909) section 7349; and any interference with this somewhat exorbitant right renders the person interfering liable in damages, Atkinson v. Couture[9]. Incidentally I may here observe that, the right to use the waters of all rivers, streams, and water-courses and their banks at all seasons being indisputably the law, the necessity for adding to the Revised Statutes (1886) section 2972 (d), which is also re-enacted as section 7298 of the new revision (1909) is not very apparent, purporting, as it does, to convey the more limited right to use the waters but not the banks for the purpose of driving logs during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets. However, it is not argued that the general right has been in any way limited by this amendment, and I must now consider the legislation passed to authorize the making of improvements to facilitate the floating of logs on those water-courses which are subject to this legal servitude in favour of the public.\nIt is common knowledge that as the forests in Quebec became depleted it was necessary for the lumbermen to go further up the rivers towards their sources to procure a supply of logs for their mills, and, as a result, they had a longer distance to drive their timber and less water. To this difficulty was added the shortening of the period of high water through deforestation, as the water where the lumber is cut down runs off more freely. Then it became necessary to provide artificial means to improve the rivers and streams for lumbering purposes, and 16 Vict. ch. 191 was passed to authorize the incorporation of companies to facilitate the floating of timber down rivers and streams. The provisions of this statute were re-enacted in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 68, and in the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1888), section 4921, new revision (1909), section 6266:\u2014\n6266. Any number of persons, not less than five, may form themselves into a company under the provisions of this section, for the purpose of acquiring or constructing and maintaining any dam, slide, pier, boom, or other work necessary to facilitate the transmission of timber or pulp-wood down any river or stream in this province, and for the purpose of blasting rocks, or dredging or removing shoals or other impediments, or otherwise of improving the navigation of such streams for the said purpose.\nNo such company shall construct any such work over or upon, or otherwise interfere with or injure any private property or the property of the Crown, without first having obtained the consent of the owner, or occupant thereof, or of the Crown, except as hereinafter provided.\nBy 54 Vict. ch. 25, a new section was added to the old Revised Statutes as 2972 (e), now in the new revision 7299, which I quote:\u2014\nIt is and always has been lawful to erect and maintain dams, slides, aprons, booms, gate-locks or other necessary works to facilitate the floating or transmission of timber, rafts or craft down such (i.e., all; v. art. 7298 R.S.Q. 1909), rivers, streams, lakes, ponds or creeks, to blast rocks, dredge or remove sand-banks, remove trees, shrubs or other obstacles without, however, doing any damages to such rivers, lakes, ponds, streams or creeks. If it is absolutely necessary for the construction of such improvements to take and occupy any private property, expropriation proceedings shall be taken for the land strictly required for such purpose, by observing, for the valuation of the land and the damages resulting from the works, the provisions respecting expropriations for railways.\nNo work to which this sub-section applies shall be done in rivers to which salmon resort, unless previously authorised by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, who shall determine how the work is to be done and the conditions to which it shall be subject.\nIn effect this section extends the powers theretofore vested in joint-stock companies with respect to improvements on all rivers, streams and water-courses in the province to individuals, and it is with respect to the construction of this new section 7299 that a difference of opinion exists between Anglin J. and myself. While we both agree that the right to erect and maintain dams to facilitate the floating of timber is absolute, my brother Anglin would restrict the use of these dams and the enjoyment of the benefits they confer to the period of freshets in Spring, Summer and Autumn. I contend, on the contrary, that the section is general in its terms and purports to be declaratory of the law. The terms used are:\u2014\nIt is and has always been lawful to erect and maintain dams, etc.\nFor what purpose? \"To facilitate the floating or transmission of timber\" down all rivers, streams, etc.; there is no limitation as to the seasons during which they are to be operated, or with respect to the places at which they are to be built. It is lawful to erect dams anywhere provided the effect be to facilitate the floating or transmission of timber down the rivers and streams of the province. I do not find in the words used any intention to limit the places at which dams may be built or to exclude the right to build a dam at the source of the river or on one of the tributaries as was done in this case. The scope and object of the Act is to authorize improvements to facilitate the floating or transmission of timber down rivers or streams and there is no limitation either expressed or implied with respect to the periods of time during which these improvements are to be utilized. If the right to erect and maintain is absolute, I do not find in the statute any limitation of the resulting right to use. Construed literally and giving to the words of the statute their natural meaning there is no limitation of the exercise of the right conferred to any particular season. The right to float timber at all seasons and for that purpose to use the banks of all streams was part of the law of the province when this statute was passed declaring in express terms that it has always been permissible to facilitate the exercise of that right by making such improvements as are now in question. If the right to use the rivers to drive logs exists at all seasons, which is undoubted, and the statute gives the right to make improvements to facilitate that use, how can it be said that, although the right to use the river may be exercised at all times, the right to use the improvements is to be limited to those periods \u2014 the season of freshets \u2014 when these artificial aids are unnecessary? If the section we are now considering (7299) is to be read with the preceding one (7298), which latter purports to create a new right, how can it be said that it was the intention of the legislature to declare that it has always been legal to do something in aid of the exercise of a right created then for the first time? It is clearly not necessary to have recourse to artificial means to create a flow of water at those seasons of the year when nature makes ample provision for that purpose. To store water to aid the drive during the Spring, Summer or Autumn freshets would appear to be a very useless proceeding. But what more effective means could be devised to aid the lumberman in his operations than to give him the right to store water during those seasons of abundance to be used in water famine times? If there is any doubt as to the proper construction to be put upon this section, I would refer to article 12 C.C. and article 13 R.S.Q. What was the intention of the legislature? What was the object for which the Act was passed?\u2014To authorize the making of improvements to facilitate the floating of logs not during the freshets, but in the lean period when the water had subsided. I can entertain no doubt as to this. The effect of this new section (7299) is to declare that a private individual may, for the purpose of his industry, do that which may be done by a company for the same purpose. A joint-stock company may use their dams and other improvements at all seasons of the year and there is no reason either in justice or on a fair construction of the statute to say that an individual may not in the like circumstances do the same.\nComing now to the damages. The right to make improvements is impliedly made subject to the condition that damages are to be paid; but these damages must be limited in this case to the injury done the appellants in the enjoyment of their rights to fish and hunt. \"L'int\u00e9r\u00eat est la base et la mesure des actions. When they entered into possession in March, 1905, the dam existed and had been in operation for a year to the appellants' knowledge. There was no change in the local conditions and there is no evidence that the damages increased after 1905. I adopt this consid\u00e9rant of the court of appeal:\u2014\nConsidering that the appellant had at all times herein referred to, a right to maintain and use as it did the dam in question in this cause and. that respondent, by and in virtue of its fishing and hunting leases, acquired the right of fishing and hunting only as they existed in the year 1905, and subject to the prior right of the appellant to maintain and use said dam as it did for and in connection with lumbering operations.\nSee also Chaudi\u00e8re Machine Co. v. Canada Atlantic Ry. Co.[10].\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nGirouard J.\u2014I would allow this appeal in part,\nI agree with Carroll J. that only that part of the conclusion of the action claiming damages can be maintained and that no order can be issued by the court respecting the use of the dam. The construction and use of that dam is authorized by statute, subject to the payment of such damages as may be caused. I would, therefore, allow the appeal from that part of the judgment which refuses those damages. Furthermore, I would reserve to the appellants any right they may have to claim damages which have accrued since the institution of the action, the whole with costs against the respondents in all the courts.\nDavies J.\u2014The controversy in this case turns upon the right claimed by the respondents to build a dam across a small river or stream flowing from the Lakes Ste. Anne and by means of it to dam back and raise in height the waters of these lakes and overflow the lands surrounding them. The object in so damming back these waters was to create a huge reservoir to be utilized by the respondents during the dry seasons of the year to facilitate the floating of their timber down the Grande Rivi\u00e8re to their mills from the junction of the river flowing from the lakes with the Grande Rivi\u00e8re. The stream or overflow from the lakes did not join the Grande Rivi\u00e8re until it had flowed from the lakes 7 to 10 miles. No timber or lumber was floated from the lakes down the overflow stream. The object was not to facilitate transmission of logs or timber on the lakes or from the lakes down the overflow stream to the Grande Rivi\u00e8re, but to facilitate during the dry season of each year the transmission of logs from the junction of this lake overflow stream with the Grande Rivi\u00e8re down that river to the defendants', respondents' mills.\nThe plaintiffs had Crown leases giving them the exclusive right of fishing in these lakes, and the exclusive right of hunting in certain territory surrounding the lakes.\nThe defendants held certain timber limits under which they had a right to cut timber on a large part of this hunting area of plaintiffs.\nNo question appears to me to arise out of the priority of either of the fishing, hunting or timber leases.\nThe manner in which the defendants used the dam constructed by them caused damage to the plaintiffs as such fishing and hunting lessees, which were assessed by the trial judge at $400, and, so far as the amount of the damage is concerned, I see no reason to quarrel with it. The rights conferred on the plaintiffs as fishing and hunting lessees by the statutory provisions now consolidated in articles 2256 and 2350 R.S.Q. were seriously injured and partially destroyed by the manner in which the defendants used the dam complained of. I think it appeared clearly that the dam had been constructed upon lands of the respondents of which they had a grant from the Crown and so the only question remaining open was the right of the defendants by means of this dam to raise the waters of the lakes as and when they did, even to the injury of the plaintiffs as hunting and fishing lessees as above stated, and without compensating them for such damage. The defendants attempted to justify the raising of these waters by means of this dam even to the injury of the plaintiffs under several statutory provisions of the Province of Quebec.\nIn my judgment, however, the only statutory provisions which could with any shew of reason be invoked to justify the claim of right of the defendants to do the plaintiffs the injuries they did, were the provisions now embodied in the E.S.Q. (1909), articles 7298 and 7299.\nThe questions which at once arise as to the permissive powers declared and allowed by these sections are:\u2014Have they any and what limitations as to the places where and times and seasons during which they can be exercised? And do the rights to construct and maintain dams, etc., conceded to any person, firm, or company by the article, 7299, R.S.Q., carry with them the obligation to compensate riparian or other owners of property who may be damaged in their property rights by the exercise of the permissive privileges conferred?\nIt was strenuously contended at bar by Mr. Pelletier that this statutory right of constructing and maintaining dams, etc., to facilitate the floating or transmission of timber, etc., down the rivers and streams cannot receive such a broad construction as would justify the erection and maintenance of the dam in question on the stream or overflow from Lakes Ste. Anne, and the formation of a huge reservoir there, because no timber or logs were transmitted or floated down these lakes or on this stream or river flowing from these lakes, and that the avowed and admitted object of the construction of the dam and the use to which it was put were to create and make a reservoir of water which might he used during the dry seasons of each year and between the freshets to float and transmit timber and logs not on the river or stream whereon the dam was built, but on the Grande Rivi\u00e8re below the junction of the overflow stream from the lakes with such river, on which latter river alone the defendants floated down their logs or timber.\nI confess there is very much in this argument which appeals to me as putting a fair and reasonable construction and limitation upon the article 7299, but, in the view I take of both these articles now under consideration, I do not find it necessary to decide the point.\nIn my opinion the two articles must be read together and, comparing them with several other articles of the statutes of Quebec relating to the same subject matter of the transmission of timber and logs down rivers and streams, such as articles 6266-6275, it seems to me that these articles are merely intended to affirm and declare such rights of transmission and to declare the times and seasons when, as well as the manner and extent to which, they might be exercised.\nThe articles so far as they relate to the points under discussion read as follows:\u2014\n7298. Subject to the provisions of this sub-section, any person, firm or company may, during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets, float and transmit timber, rafts and craft down all rivers, lakes, ponds, streams and creeks in this province.\n7299. It is and always has been lawful to erect and maintain dams, slides, aprons, booms, gate-locks or other necessary works to facilitate the floating or transmission of timber, rafts, or craft down such rivers, streams, lakes, ponds or creeks, to blast rocks, dredge or remove sand-banks, remove trees, shrubs or other obstacles without, however, doing any damage to such rivers, lakes, ponds, streams or creeks.\nNow it will be observed that the article 7298 starts out with the statement \"subject to the provisions of this sub-section any person,\" etc. So that it is clear the legislature intended all the articles comprised in the sub-section to be read and construed together, and that the general rights declared by articles 7298 should only be exercised subject to the provisions of the entire sub-section which included article 7299. Then the declared rights were expressly limited as to the times of their exercise to the periods of the freshets, \"during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets\"; and then article 7299 declared it to be and to always have been lawful to erect and maintain dams, etc., to facilitate the doing on such streams, etc. (that is on the streams mentioned in article 7298) of the very thing article 7298 had declared might be done. What was that?\u2014It was that during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets it was lawful to float and transmit timber, etc., down the rivers and streams. One article asserted and declared the rights, the other article authorized the doing of certain things necessary for their proper exercise. As the article, 7298, conferring the rights limited their exercise to a special period of the year, namely, during the freshets, article 7299 regulating these rights and authorizing the doing of certain things to facilitate their exercise, might be read subject to the same controlling limitation.\nBut even if I was wrong in this construction of these articles, even if it could be held that article 7299 R.S.Q. should be construed without any limitation as to seasons, and that under it dams could be erected, maintained and used in the seasons between the freshets, I should entertain no doubt that the party exercising the permissive powers conceded by the section would be liable for all damages caused by the maintenance of the dams, etc., to either the riparian proprietors above or below him, or to other proprietors abutting upon the lakes or streams whose property or rights were injured or destroyed by the manner in which the dams were maintained and used.\nThe permissive powers declared by article 7299 to exist in regard to the erection and maintenance of dams, etc., to facilitate the floating of timber down rivers and streams were not intended in my judgment to authorize the user of such dams in a way to injure riparian or other proprietors above or below the dams. The very great care taken by the legislature in articles 6266-6275 to guard and protect alike public and private interests from damage in the case of companies formed under those sections for the identical purposes expressed in article 7299 of facilitating the transmission of timber, etc., down rivers and streams, convinces me that the latter article could not be and was not intended to give permission to all persons and companies not formed under articles 6266-6275 to do with respect to riparian and other proprietors what is expressly forbidden and guarded against in these articles with respect to all companies formed under them.\nIn the absence of express language to the contrary, articles 7299 cannot be construed as conferring a legal right to damage, by overflow, or otherwise injure, the rights of the riparian proprietors on these rivers.\nThe principle laid down by the Judicial Committee in their judgment in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parke[11] at page 544, is the one which I think must apply and govern in the construction of this article 7299 R.S.Q. Their Lordships say:\u2014\nWhenever, according to the sound construction of a statute, the legislature has authorised a proprietor to make a particular use of his land, and the authority given is, in the strict sense of the law, permissive merely, and not imperative, the legislature must be held to have intended that the use sanctioned is not to be in prejudice of the common law right of others.\nIn the case before us the use permitted is not confined to the proprietors' own land, but is the right to dam back the water of the rivers or streams of the province to facilitate the floating of timber down them and the rights injured are statutory rights and not strictly common law rights. But the controlling distinction enunciated as it seems to me by the Judicial Committee is that which exists between a permissive act done under and by virtue of a statute, and an imperative one. In the former case it will not, in the absence of clear language to the contrary, be construed to sanction a use to the prejudice of the common law rights, and a fortiori statutory rights of others; in the latter it may be.\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed as to the damages awarded by the trial judge, and his judgment as to such damages restored with costs in all courts.\nIdington J.\u2014Notwithstanding the wealth of legal lore bestowed on the argument of this case, I respectfully submit that the greater part of it is entirely irrelevant to the proper determination of the issues involved.\nI agree that in giving effect to any legislation invading the common law of any country we must have due regard to that law and restrict legislation of an invasive character to the clear and distinct expression thereof before allowing it to change the common law.\nHere we have hardly any need for the application of so elementary a principle of law.\nWe have presented to us as the basis of all else to be considered a piece of Crown domain freed from the embarrassments of there being inherent therein relative to its tenure anything but what the legislature may have seen fit to stamp thereon in its administration thereof, or the lines it may have laid down by statute for such administration.\nWe have statutes enabling the Crown through its ministers to dispose thereof or of defined interests therein.\nPursuant to the powers thus conferred by legislation we have rights given each of these respective litigants. We must find these rights if we can, neither inconsistent nor incompatible. If we should unfortunately find them so then the priority of grant might become an important factor. But inasmuch as I think that the learned trial judge has rightly found them possible of conciliation, I am not at all troubled with such difficulties as might in the converse case have arisen.\nThe respondents became licensees of the Crown giving them the right to cut timber over certain limits. The appellants became exclusive licensees of the Crown to hunt or fish within certain defined limits.\nOnly at two points of small extent do these limits overlap each other.\nAlthough each is called an exclusive right, and each party is spoken of as having an exclusive possession, I think this latter word must be given, of its many possible uses or meanings, no more force than simply as to each party that exclusive right to possess to the extent necessarily implied by the legal limits of the rights to be respectively exercised within the terms of their respective grants.\nI am not, when I find the exercise by each of its own rights quite compatible with the fullest exercise by the other of its rights, concerned with the fact that there is an overlapping in the territorial sense of their common ground for operating upon.\nThe respondents, so far as their operations in the way of cutting timber up to the present time are concerned, have not cut off or upon any of the territory over which the appellants' rights extend and thus the matter is further simplified.\nThe appellants' claim extends over two lakes of which the larger empties into the smaller, and from this smaller one there is a river, called D\u00e9charge, forming its outlet and running some seven or eight miles before it empties into the long River Ouelle.\nIt is said the D\u00e9charge carries in fact, though short, the larger quantity of water.\nThe respondents in carrying on their business as lumbermen have mills some miles below the confluence of these streams.\nTheir lumbering operations as to cutting logs and floating them to the market or their saw-mills have been confined solely to the River Ouelle.\nThey have never attempted and do not now claim it is part of their purpose to attempt to float logs over or through the lakes in question or the River D\u00e9charge.\nWhat they do claim is that being owners of a lot granted to them by the Crown, and through which the D\u00e9charge runs, they can erect thereon at the point where it passes through said lot, a dam by means of which they can dam back the water in the lakes and river so as to form therein and upon the lands bordering same a large reservoir for storing water by means of which, and the flood-gates for the purpose, they can from time to time let off the water so stored and assist the floating of logs in the River Quelle.\nThey erected such a dam and have had it in operation for some years and the appellants claim they have thereby impaired the utility of the lakes as a fish-pond of which appellants have been by their licenses put in exclusive possession for fishing purposes, and destroyed the utility of the Crown road by which the lake was reached, by submerging it.\nThe learned trial judge found the respondents had no right to do this and other such things, and assessed the damages at $400, and enjoined them from continuing it. I will refer to the terms of this injunction later.\nThe questions raised thus must to my mind be resolved by the interpretation and construction of two or three statutes now brought together in the recent revision of the statutes of Quebec, and numbered articles 7295 to 7300 inclusive.\nArticle No. 7295 is as follows:\u2014\n7295. Every proprietor of land may improve any watercourse bordering upon, running along or passing across his property, and may turn the same to account by the construction of mills, manufactories, works and machinery of all kinds, and for this purpose may erect and construct in and about such watercourse, all the works necessary for its efficient working, such as floodgates, flumes, embankments, dams, dykes and the like.\nThis was first enacted by 19 and 20 Vict. ch. 104, sec. 1, of the Parliament of Old Canada but confined in its operation to Lower Canada, now Quebec.\nI am unable to comprehend how a statute of which the purview seems so clearly related to the turning of power thus provided to the designated purposes can be made to directly subserve an entirely different purpose.\nWhere would such a method of construction end in extending the purposes thus expressed to something or everything merely incidental to and very remotely if at all, connected with the execution of the expressed purposes?\nIf this contention for the extension of the operation of such a statute could be held tenable, I should expect next to hear of its use in enabling the creation of rice-fields, or farms of fur-bearing animals to supply men engaged in milling or manufacturing with such needful products.\nThis statute came under the notice of this court in the case of Jones v. Fisher[12], but such remote contingencies failed to be encouraged.\nSomebody, however, would seem to have raised questions of its operating in a way to hinder the very industry it is now alleged to have some remote relation to.\nIn consequence thereof the legislature enacted what is now article 7297 R.S.Q., providing as therein appears and especially protecting joint stock companies in their business of floating timber.\nIt had so happened that a year or two before the first mentioned statute was passed, an Act was passed to facilitate the creation of such companies and regulate their operations. Are these the companies referred to in article 7297? If, as I so suspect, then the public utility of said statute does not appear to have had much to do with floating logs, or to have led anyone to suppose it related thereto.\nAs if determined to put an end to the obstruction, such as an unrestricted exercise of power, which the first statute enabled might create, the legislature enacted also that which appears now in articles 7298 and 7299, R.S.Q., of which the following are the chief parts concerning us :\u2014\n7298. Subject to the provisions of this sub-section, any person, firm or company may, during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets, float and transmit timber rafts and craft down all rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, and creeks in this province.\n7299. It is and always has been lawful to erect and maintain dams, slides, aprons, booms, gate-locks or other necessary works, to facilitate the floating or transmission of timber, rafts or craft down such rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, or creeks, to blast rocks, dredge or remove sand-banks, remove trees, shrubs or other obstacles without, however, doing any damage to such rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, or creeks.\nIf it is absolutely necessary for the construction of such improvements to take and occupy any private property, expropriation proceedings shall be taken for the land strictly required for such purpose, by observing, for the valuation of the land and the damages resulting from the works, the provisions respecting expropriations for railways.\nArticle 7300 provided for the compensation of such persons as made such erections by fixing tolls to be paid for their use.\nIn default of being permitted to rest upon the first statute the respondents seek to rest their rights to do what they have done upon article 7299.\nIt seems to me there are two or three complete answers to this latter claim. In the first place it does not seem to me that these two articles which must be read together, cover this case at all or ever were intended to sanction such a proceeding as that of the respondents.\nAny one conversant with the history of litigation in the Province of Quebec relative to the rights thus definitely established need not have far to seek to find good reason for this legislation.\nBut I have failed to find or hear of any such attempt ingenious and praiseworthy as it is (if only legal) to impose upon others by process of law any such unexpected burdens as this must of necessity involve.\nIf some such thing had been tried it would likely have been made to appear in the litigation in and jurisprudence of the province.\nIt seems as if the respondents feel they can only succeed by using the article 7299, and discarding the preceding article.\nI think we may well look to their origin and past relation, as well as the present, though amended by Acts incorporated in the revision, and in such case anything to be done seems to have been contemplated as relating to the seasons of freshets, whereas this expedient in question here is to aid chiefly in the dry seasons.\nIndeed its use mostly objected to is that in such seasons.\nPassing all that and reading these articles in their plain ordinary meaning do they, or either involve any such thing as the storage of water in a branch or feeder over which no timber is ever supposed to have passed? I confess I cannot so read them or either of them. And with that must fall the respondents' whole contention.\nIn the next place if we try to find herein a provision for the storage of water supplemental to the river on which the floating of timber is to be operated, how can we suppose such a purpose was ever intended to have been expressed by such inapt language.\nIt is expressly declared that the dams, etc., provided for must not do \"any damage to such rivers, lakes, ponds, streams or creeks.\"\nHow can you more effectually destroy or damage the utility of a stream of which every riparian proprietor is to be supposed to be entitled to use, as it passes, the waters thereof, than by shutting up its waters until a vast reservoir has been filled? It might take days or weeks to fill, and during all this time those down the stream are not to have their use of water for use of mills or herds or other domestic purposes.\nIt may be said this instance does not involve any such consequences. But it is not this case alone or its peculiar facts we must consider. It is the possible and probable operation of the construction (implying this enactment provided for auxiliary storage dams) which is contended for and has to be borne in mind.\nNow let us look at the provision for compensation to those damnified by any such operation as implied in that construction and see how badly it fits.\nIt is clearly not applicable to any such case as that of those deprived of their use of water but those whose land has to be taken to enable the construction of any of the contemplated works.\nIt is not to be imagined that the legislature ever intended, when so careful of so small consequences as the expropriation of a bit of land, to deprive anyone of that of which the deprivation would do infinitely more harm, as in the case of such riparian proprietors. If again the principle of the railway legislation taken as the measure of right between the parties is to be applied, how can it be applied here where the thing is first taken possession of and used?\nThe railway expropriations are preceded by an arbitration or by an order of the court and deposit presumed to meet the damages or compensation to be fixed by arbitration.\nA railway company failing to observe such conditions is treated as a trespasser just as the learned trial judge treated the respondents.\nAgain we are told the Government having power to fix the tolls has fixed them, and hence it must be taken to have revoked the appellants' license pro tanto.\nIn the first place the order does not name any works on the D\u00e9charge River, but on the Ouelle River.\nIf that is not conclusive, how can the provision for tolls have any relation to such a work as this?\nA dam or slide on a river over which timber is floated is for common use and hence the provision for tolls in legislation of this character is a most justifiable expedient.\nBut how can that have any relation to the case of a storage dam on a branch of such a river? Let us suppose the branch and lands on both sides or either side thereof entirely, as it might well be, the property of those erecting such a storage dam. What right could anyone else have to use the storage dam thereon? Or what right has been given to any power to fix tolls in such a case? We might as well say the Government had power to fix tolls for the use of any patent device and machinery one company had for overcoming such obstacles, and thereby impose the duty upon an enterprising party to lend its apparatus and skill to someone else. The legislature has not yet gone so far.\nSo far from finding any consolation for respondents in the fixing of tolls, I find in the provision therefor in the Act one of the most destructive arguments against their whole contentions.\nIt is the common path, the common highway over which this method of transportation is a matter of supreme importance for an important industry that the entire legislation relates to and nothing else.\nI think the learned trial judge was right in his conclusions and almost entirely so in his reasoning.\nI have had only one doubt of practical importance relative thereto, and that is this: The judgment enjoins the interference with the current and it may be that this is too wide.\nIt may well be the respondents have the right to raise the water within the range of their own premises in a way that the appellant has no right to complain of.\nBut this is a minor matter and so far as I could gather from answers to questions put, is of no consequence.\nBut if it is, then the judgment ought to be varied in that regard if the respondent so desires.\nI think that, however, merely an incident or accident and not what the parties are here for.\nI think it is not common to give rights of action to Crown locatees and licensees, and that the right of action given by the statute to the appellants as licensees is of that character and by virtue thereof as well as other rights of action, the appellants are entitled to protect their rights and subject to such variation of the judgment, and whether judgment so varied or not, the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below, and the judgment of the trial judge be restored so far as consistent with said variation.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondents, the lumber company, professing to act under the authority of article 7299 R.S.Q., have erected a dam in a stream through which the waters of two lakes (known as the Lakes of Ste. Anne) in the county of Kamouraska, are discharged into the Grande Rivi\u00e8re. The dam is situated at the debouchement of this stream from the more northerly of the two lakes. The purpose which it is made to serve is this:\u2014The respondents have a saw-mill on the Grande Rivi\u00e8re twenty miles below its point of confluence with the discharge. The timber (cut upon the banks of the Grande Rivi\u00e8re and its tributaries) is brought to that river at places below this point. The waters of the two lakes impounded by the dam are, at times when those of the Grande Rivi\u00e8re (unless artificially augmented) would be insufficient for that purpose, discharged into the river for conveying this timber to the respondents' mill.\nThe appellants, the game club, have licenses to fish in the Ste. Anne Lakes, and hunting privileges in the surrounding territory. It is hardly open to dispute that these rights of the club have been prejudicially affected by the operations of the lumber company, and the question is whether, in respect of this prejudice, they are entitled to reparation.\nBy the law of Quebec, streams (although not navigable in the strict sense) so far as they may be capable of conveying small craft and rafts of timber, have always, under the denomination of \"floatable\" streams, been subject to public use for such purposes. Some question which appears to have arisen touching the exercise of this right during seasons of high water in respect of streams not ordinarily floatable, is set at rest by article 7298 R.S.Q., one of the provisions of enactment under which the lumber company justifies the operations out of which the action arises.\nThis enactment authorizes the construction of works improving the floatability of streams already floatable, or making floatable such streams as do not already fall within that category. The scheme of the Act\u2014expressed very summarily\u2014appears to be to authorize persons having occasion to use as a public highway a stream already publici juris, to remove obstructions and to construct artificial works for the purpose of improving it as a highway, and in the case of streams not publici juris, to convert them into public highways by works of a similar character. The form of the leading provision of the enactment\u2014 though not necessarily incompatible with another view\u2014appears to suggest the design on the part of the legislature that improvements executed, under the authority of the Act should be situated on the stream which they are intended to affect; and this suggestion receives confirmation from article 7301 R.S.Q.\nIt seems to be necessary that some such limitation as to the situation of such works should be implied. If the legislature had intended that any person having occasion to use a stream for the conveyance of timber should be entitled to impound the sources of the stream miles beyond that part of it over which any timber could be expected to pass, one would have looked for some provisions aimed at protecting the interests of other persons having occasion to use the stream for similar purposes; and affording some I means of adjusting the rights of such persons in respect of the use of such improvements.\nThis view receives illustration from an enactment (now articles 6266 to 6340 R.S.Q. ), providing for the incorporation of companies authorized to construct and maintain works of the same character and for the same purposes as those mentioned in article 7299 R.S.Q. The legislature in framing that enactment has been careful to provide that such works are to be permitted only after approval by a Minister of the Crown, and for the regulation of the use of such works in a \"safe and orderly\" way (K.S.Q. articles 6276, 6323,4 and 7). The provisions of the statute, even with these precautions, pointedly suggest that the legislature had in contemplation only works situated on that part of a stream over which timber might be expected actually to pass. The point is not free from difficulty, but on the whole, balancing the relevant considerations, it seems improvable that the legislature had in view, in enacting article 7299 R.S.Q., such works as that in question here; and that the use of such works for the purposes to which the respondents have put them is not a reasonable exercise of the powers conferred by the Act.\nI do not pursue the argument into its details, because, since on this point the court is equally divided, the appeal actually falls to be determined upon the hypothesis that such plans as those of the respondents are within the authority given by the statute.\nOn that hypothesis, the appellants do not appear to me to be entitled to a restraining order. I am not able to read article 7398 R.S.Q. as restricting the scope of the subsequent articles. That article, in my view, as already indicated, is to be explained as intended to re- move some doubt which the legislature thought it worth while to allay. I do not think I can affirm that the doubt was groundless; if I should have been able to do so, still I should have preferred to act on the assumption that the legislature had enacted a wholly. superfluous provision, rather than limit the beneficial operation of the subsequent articles in a manner which appears to be opposed to every consideration of practical convenience ; and which it would be very difficult indeed to reconcile with the purpose the legislature obviously had in view. See Hough v. Windus[13], at page 229, per Lord Selborne.\nThe question of compensation remains. The right to use public rivers for the purpose of conveying timber, has always been subject (in Quebec) to the condition that the person so using them shall make compensation for injuries thereby caused (Mun. Code, sec. 891; and R.S.Q., art. 2256). There is, I think, the strongest presumption that the legislature, in declaring the existence of the auxiliary right to execute improvements of the kind mentioned in article 7299 R.S.Q., did not intend to deprive persons prejudicially affected by the use of such improvements, of this right of compensation \u2014 without providing a substitute for it. The right to use the improvements has for its basis the right to use the stream. The duty to compensate must, I think, be assumed to be co-extensive with the right to use; and consequently to be attached to the exercise of the right as well in the improved as in the unimproved state of the water-way. Anglin J.\u2014The facts of this case are fully stated in the judgments of the provincial courts.\nThree questions present themselves for determination: the first, whether as holders of fishing and hunting leases from the Quebec Government the appellants have a status to maintain this action; the second, whether the acts of the respondents, which interfered with the natural levels of (the waters of the two lakes Ste: Anne, and caused flooding of adjacent lands, thus injuriously affecting the appellants' rights of fishing and hunting, are or are not authorized by statute; and the third, whether, if such acts are so authorized, the respondents are or are not liable to make compensation for damages thereby occasioned.\nThe first question is, I think, concluded in favour of the appellants, at all events as to their right to maintain an action for damages, by the statute 62 Vict. (Que.) ch. 23, which re-enacts (as article 1383 R.S.Q.) with a slight alteration, article 1376(2) of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, declaratory of the effect of fishing leases, and the statute 1 Edw. VII. ( Que. ) ch. 12, sec. 6, similarly declaratory of the effect of hunting leases.\nArticle 1383 R.S.Q., as enacted by 62 Vict. ch. 23, reads as follows:\u2014\n1383. The lease confers upon the lessee, for the time therein determined, the right to take and retain exclusive possession of the lands therein described, subject to the regulations and restrictions which may be established, and gives him the exclusive right to fish in the waters fronting on such lands in conformity with the provincial and federal regulations, then in force, and also to prosecute in his own name any illegal possessor or offender against any provision of this Act, and to recover damages, if such exist, but not against any person who may pass over such lands or the adjacent waters, or who engages in any occupation not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, nor against the holder of a license to cut timber, who has, at all times, in accordance with his license, the right to cut and remove trees, lumber and saw-logs and other timber, within the limits of his license, and, during the term thereof, to make use of any floatable river or watercourse, or of any lake, pond or other body of water and the banks thereof for the conveyance of all kinds of lumber and for the passage of all boats, ferries and canoes required therefor, subject to the charge of repairing all damages resulting from the exercise of such right.\n(See now R.S.Q., 1909, art, 2256.)\nThe language of 1 Edw. VII. ch. 12, sec. 6, is the same. (See now R.S.Q. 1909, art, 2350.) For convenience in discussing this legislation I shall refer to the numbers of the articles in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909.\nThough by no means free from ambiguity\u2014 indeed each at first blush appears to be self-contradictory\u2014 articles 2256 and 2350 R.S.Q., upon their proper construction, in my opinion, give to the holders of fishing and hunting leases the right to maintain an action against any holder of a license to cut timber who, in the exercise of his rights in making use of a floatable river, watercourse or lake, has done damage which he has failed to repair. The rights of timber licensees are \"subject to such regulations and restrictions as may be established\" (R.S.Q. 1888, art. 1311; now R.S.Q. 1909, art 1599): inter alia they are subject to the obligation of the licensees to repair any damage occasioned by their exercise to fishing and hunting lessees of the Crown. If the right of damming asserted by the respondents is one of the rights of a holder of a license to cut timber referred to in articles 1156 and 2350 R.S.Q. (1909)\u2014I think it is not\u2014it is only exercisable subject to the charge of repairing all damages thereby occasioned. If it is not such a right, the defendants in interfering with the rights of the appellants, unless justified by other statutory authority, were \"offenders\" against the \"sections\" of which these articles form parts, and as such are made liable to an action at the suit of these Crown lessees of fishing and hunting rights for damages sustained by them. To declare the rights of timber licensees to make use of rivers, lakes, etc., to be\nsubject to the charge of repairing all. damages resulting from the exercise of such rights\nwould indeed be futile, unless failure to make such reparation should give to the person injured a right to compel it by action. The only possible reparation for injury such as is complained of by the appellants is pecuniary compensation for their loss. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the acts of the defendants which caused damage to the plaintiffs for which reparation was not made \u2014 if such acts are authorized only by a statute which does not relieve from liability for consequential damages, or are unauthorized\u2014 gave to the appellants, as holders of fishing and hunting leases, a right of action for compensation.\nIt may be important to note at this point that the statutory provisions to which I have alluded were both enacted, or re-enacted, by the legislature subsequently to the enactment of those under which the respondents claim authority to do the acts of the effect of which the plaintiffs complain, viz.: R.S.Q. (1888) arts. 5535-6, and 54 Vict. ch. 25, sec. 1. Both sets of statutory provisions are now found consolidated in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909.\nIn support of their allegation of statutory authorization, the respondents first invoke articles 5535-6 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, which are re-enacted in the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909), as follows:\u2014\n7295. Every proprietor of land may improve any watercourse bordering upon, running along or passing across his property, and may turn the same to account by the construction of mills, manufactories, works and machinery of all kinds, and for this purpose may erect and construct in and about such watercourse, all the works necessary for its efficient working, such as flood-gates, flumes, embankments, dams, dykes and the like.\n7296. (1). The proprietors or lessees of any such works are liable for all damages resulting therefrom to any person, whether by excessive elevation of the flood-gates or otherwise.\nIn my opinion these provisions have no application to the present case. It is true that the respondents have a mill on the Rivi\u00e8re Ouelle some miles below the point at which the discharge from, the Ste. Anne Lakes flows into it. But the dam here in question is not erected \"in and about the water-course\" on which the defendants' mill is constructed and it certainly is not a work necessary or helpful for the \"efficient working\" of the machinery of such a mill. There is \"no mill or machinery operated by this dam.\" Jones v. Fisher[14], at page 525. Improving a water-course in order to provide material for manufacture in a mill is not improving it or turning it to account for the efficient working of the machinery of the mill. It should be noted that, if article 7295 R.S.Q. did apply, under article 7296 the defendants would be liable in damages.\nThe respondents next invoke the statute 54 Vict. (Que.), ch. 25, sec. 1, as amended by 4 Edw. VII. eh. 14, sec. 2. These provisions are now found in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, as follows:\u2014\n7298. Subject to the provisions of this sub-section, any person, firm or company may, during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets, float and transmit timber, rafts and craft down all rivers, lakes, ponds, streams and creeks in this province.\n7299. It is and always has been lawful to erect and maintain dams, slides, aprons, booms, gate-locks, or other necessary works to facilitate the floating or transmission of timber, rafts or craft down such rivers, streams, lakes, ponds or creeks, to blast rocks, dredge or remove sand-banks, remove trees, shrubs or other obstacles without, however, doing any damage to such rivers, lakes, ponds, streams or creeks.\nIt was provided by 54 Vict. ch. 25, that nothing therein should\naffect the rights of joint-stock companies for the transmission of timber down rivers or streams.\nThis provision is found, slightly altered, in article 7297 R.S.Q., 1.909, and, though now couched in general terms, it probably refers only to companies incorporated under the legislation consolidated in articles 6266 et seq. (R.S.Q., 1909), which have no application to the present case.\nAlthough my first impression was that article 7299 R.S.Q., because of its intimate connection with article 7298, and because of the provisions of article 7301, confers the right to erect dams and other improvements only upon water-courses down which timber, etc., is actually floated or transmitted, after a study of the history of this legislation and careful consideration of its terms that interpretation appears to me to be too narrow. First introduced in Quebec in 1890, as 54 Vict., chapter 25, the prototype of this provision is to be found in the Ontario Statute 47 Vict. ch. 17, enacted after the decision of this court in McLaren v. Caldwell[15], and while that case was standing before the Privy Council for judgment[16]. The Ontario statute is preceded by a preamble containing this recital:\nWhereas grants have been made by the Crown of lands situated upon such streams; the said licensed and granted lands being above as well as below the places where such obstructions were or are, or where such works are or may be constructed. The Ontario provision corresponding to article 7298 R.S.Q. is much older (12 Vict. ch. 89, sec. 5).\nIt is obvious that \"to facilitate the floating of timber\" upon the lower reaches of a river the water from the several forks of its upper reaches, or from tributary streams may be equally serviceable. Article 7299 R.S.Q. does not require that the dams declared to be lawful shall be constructed on that part of the river in which the timber is actually floated; it does sanction the construction of improvements which will facilitate flotation and transmission. These improvements may be above or below the point at which such flotation or transmission begins; and if above, why on one fork rather than on another? Why on the main river, and not on the tributary? A dam on either, if above the part of the river on which flotation or transmission is carried on, may equally facilitate it. Although the Quebec statute lacks the preamble found in the original Ontario Act, its enacting or declaratory language is itself wider; it omits the words \"therein or thereon\" found in the Ontario statute. Not, I confess, without some lingering doubts, due chiefly to the terms of article 7301 R.S.Q., I have come to the conclusion that the situation of the dam in question, having regard to the flotation \"which it is used to facilitate, does not preclude the application to it of the provisions of article 7299 R.S.Q.\nBut article 7299 is, in my opinion, clearly auxiliary to article 7298 R.S.Q. The erection of dams, etc., which it authorizes, is for the purpose of facilitating the floating or transmission of timber declared to be lawful by article 7298 R.S.Q. \"during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets.\" The rights conferred by the statute are limited to the periods of these freshets (Caldwell v. McLaren[17]; Neely v. Peter[18]. The use of the dams and other improvements sanctioned is to enable lumbermen to take full advantage of them. It may be that under the powers recognized by article 7299 R.S.Q., as a result of the legitimate use of dams within its purview, the duration of these freshets may be slightly prolonged. But this article does not contemplate the construction of dams for the storage and retention of a supply of water to be used for floating and transmitting timber during the dry seasons. The evidence shews that, their mill-pond being too small to hold all the logs needed to supply their mill, the respondents after the freshets kept great quantities of logs along the bed and banks of the Rivi\u00e8re Ouelle, and from time to time during the dry season allowed the waters stored by the dam in question in the Lakes Ste. Anne to escape and by the artificial freshets thus created carried the logs lying in the river, or such numbers of them as they required, down to their mill. This use of the dam was, in my opinion, not sanctioned by article 7299 R.S.Q. and was the chief, if not the sole, cause of the injuries of which the appellants complain. A comparison of articles 7298 and 7299 R.S.Q. with 47 Vict. ch. 17, sec. 1 (Ont.), is instructive. I entertain no doubt that article 7299 R.S.Q. does not sanction the use of dams, etc., to facilitate or make possible the flotation or transmission of timber in the dry seasons.\nMy attention has been drawn to article 891 of the \"Municipal Code,\" not cited at bar or referred to in the factums. Unlike article 7299 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec this article of the \"Municipal Code\" appears to declare the right of every person at all times (comp. articles 2256, 2350 and 7349(2) R.S.Q.) to use any municipal water-course for the conveyance of timber \u2014subject to payment of all damages resulting from the exercise of the right.\nEvery river or natural watercourse, in the parts thereof which are neither navigable or floatable (except at certain periods of the year after rains) is a municipal watercourse. (Art. 868 Mun. C.)\nArticle 891 (Mun. Code) is declaratory of rights in watercourses only in their natural state. Article 7299 R.S.Q., in my opinion, has no application to or connection with it, or with article 7349 R.S.Q. Article 7299 R.S.Q. is historically and by its terms so intimately connected with article 7298 R.S.Q., that it must, as I have said, be regarded as accessory or ancillary to it, and the rights for which it provides are exercisable only for the purposes of the flotation or transmission declared by article 7298 R.S.Q. to be lawful.\nThe right of all persons to use water-courses in their natural state at all tim,es for the flotation and conveyance of timber had, long before 54 Vict., been fully recognized and provided for by the legislation now consolidated in articles 2256, 2350 and 7349 R.S.Q., and article 891 Mun. Code, already referred to. Except that it expressly mentions \"rafts,\" article 7298 R.S.Q. (54 Vict. sec. 1, 1972d), if read apart from and independently of article 7299 R.S.Q., would merely reaffirm the existence of this right during freshets. I cannot think that this article was passed simply to give to the transmission of \"rafts\" the same statutory sanction which had already been given to the conveyance of all kinds of timber. Unless it is to be deemed quite superfluous and to have been enacted per incuriam \u2014 such a construction is to be admitted only if inevitable (The Queen v. Bishop of Oxford[19], at page 261)\u2014this article must apply to the right to use water-courses, or parts thereof, with the aid of such artificial means as are provided for by article 7299 R.S.Q. Otherwise its enactment is simply unintelligible. Apart from the inapplicable provisions of article 7295 R.S.Q., the only statutory sanction for the construction of improvements which interfere with private rights in or along watercourses, except by companies formed for the purpose (article 2266 R.S.Q.), is that given by article 7299 R.S.Q. The conditions under which these companies may exercise such powers are onerous and special. See articles 6272-8 and 6305 R.S.Q. Why should the legislature, when expressing its sanction of the making and use of such improvements by persons or companies other than those incorporated under R.S.Q. articles 6266 et seq. without the safeguards and free from the conditions by those articles imposed, by the same statute declare a limited right of flotation \u2014 quite unnecessary, because already more fully provided for, if user of water-courses in their natural state were in its mind\u2014unless it were for the purpose of defining the periods during which the right of flotation with the aid of such newly declared statutory privileges might be exercised?\nAgain it is urged that during the freshets waters held in storage are not required and that to confine the use of such waters as are retained by the defendants' dam to those periods will, in fact, render the dam of no value and will give no effect to article 7299 R.S.Q. That article provides for other improvements, all of which, including dams constructed on the parts of the river actually used for the flotation of timber, may be of great service during the freshets. Even dams situated, as is that here in question, above the part of the river in which it is sought to facilitate driving may be useful in regulating the flow of the water during these periods and thus be of material assistance in the transmission of the logs. The construction which I have put upon it by no means deprives article 7299 R.S.Q. of all effect. It is the only one, in my opinion, admissible, having regard to its collocation, its terms and its history. If this interpretation be narrower than the legislature intended; by a very simple amendment the article can be made to cover that for which the respondents contend.\nI am further of opinion that, although the use made of their dam by the respondents should be deemed to be authorized by article 7299 R.S.Q., they nevertheless could enjoy that privilege only subject to the obligation of indemnifying persons injured by its exercise. Apart from statutory authorization there can be no right to interfere with the natural level or flow of waters to the prejudice of persons having riparian or other interests which would be affected. Article 7299 R.S.Q., though declaratory in form, in fact confers new rights and should, I think, be regarded as merely permissive\u2014not imperative; and should the infliction of injury upon others follow the exercise of the rights thereby recognized or conferred, if there were no provision for compensation, it is possible that their exercise should be restrained. Canadian Pacific Railway Go. v. Parke[20], at pages 544-5. But, in the absence of any declaration of a contrary intention, articles 2256 and 2350 R.S.Q. may, in the cases of fishing and hunting lessees of the Crown, be taken to supply the provision for compensation which in modern times is generally found in a statute authorizing interference with private rights. Managers of Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[21], at page 208.\nThe opening words of the article, \"It is, and always has been lawful\" are worthy of further notice. If owing to their presence it must be assumed that article 7299 R.S.Q. is merely declaratory of powers already existing, the inference of a right in persons injured by their exercise to compensation seems irresistible, because without statutory authority it cannot have been lawful by the use of dams to alter the flow and levels of streams and lakes to the injury of persons interested in such waters as riparian owners or otherwise\u2014at all events without making compensation for such injury.\nAfter comparing article 7299 R.S.Q. with section 1 of the \"Ontario Act,\" 47 Vict. ch. 17, I entertain some doubt whether the concluding clause \"without however doing any damage, etc.,\" is applicable to the whole section, or only to blasting rocks, dredging or removing sandbanks and removing trees, shrubs or other obstacles. The absence of the conjunction \"and\" at the end of the fourth line leads me to think that the former is probably the correct construction. I am, however, not satisfied that the raising and lowering of the waters of which the plaintiffs complain does any damage to the lakes themselves. Injury caused by flooding to fishing and hunting privileges merely does not necessarily involve damage to the rivers and lakes in and about which they are enjoyed. Neither is it injury caused by the erection and maintenance of the dam, but rather by the use made of it. I, therefore, rest the right of the appellants to recover damages not upon the concluding clause of the first paragraph of article 7299 R.S.Q., but upon the fact that the use by the respondents of their dam to provide water for the flotation of timber during the dry seasons was not authorized by that article, and upon the absence from it of a provision depriving the plaintiffs of the right to compensation for injury which the exercise by the defendants of any right conferred by it might entail, coupled with the rights conferred on fishing and hunting lessees by the statutory provisions now consolidated in articles 2256 and 2350 RS.Q.\nThe rights of the timber licensees being, not absolute, but \"subject to such regulations and restrictions as may be established\" (article 1599 R.S.Q., 1909), the respondents acquired their rights subject to the reservations declared by articles 2256 and 2350 RS.Q. in favour of the holders of any existing or future fishing and hunting leases which the Government had granted or might see fit to grant. It is, therefore, I think, immaterial that the appellants obtained renewals of their fishing and hunting leases after the construction of the respondents' dam. The respondents' rights always were and remained subject to the provisions of articles 2256 and 2350 RS.Q.\nThe provision for expropriation in article 7299 R.S.Q. has no application, in my opinion, to the case of lands not \"taken and occupied\" in the erection and maintenance of the improvement, but merely injuriously affected by flooding. Compare article 6305 R.S.Q.\nThe appellants are, I think, entitled to the damages awarded, which were confined by Cimon J. to the injury done to their fishing and hunting rights during the two years immediately preceding the action. That the amount allowed was excessive was not seriously argued.\nSubject to the question whether as mere lessees, though given by the statute a right to exclusive possession, they have a status to maintain a possessory action (Price v. Girard[22]; Baptist v. La Cie. de Papier des Laurentides[23], at page 479) (see Fuzier-Herman, Rep. vo. \"Chasse\" No. 111) the appellants would, in my opinion, be also entitled to an order requiring the defendants to refrain from so using their dam as to affect the levels of the waters of the two Lakes Ste. Anne to the prejudice of the fishing and hunting rights of the appellants, except during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets. The result of the opinions of the majority of my learned brothers renders it unnecessary to determine whether these plaintiffs can or cannot maintain an action for this relief.\nBecause the dam is on the defendants' property, and because its use at certain times is legitimate, the prayer for its demolition was, in any case, properly refused.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pelletier, Baillargeon & Alleyn.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\n[1] Q.R. 19 K.B. 178.\n[2] Q.R. 36 S.C. 486.\n[3] 9 Q.B.D. 315.\n[4] 18 L.C.

McRae and The Imperial Bank of Canada (Defendants) Respondents.\n1911: March 27, 28; 1911: October 3.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPartnership\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Partnership funds\u2014Third party\u2014Banks and banking\u2014Negotiable instrument\u2014Notice\u2014Inquiry.\nR. a member of the firm of R.M. & C. engaged on a contract for railway construction in Quebec, shortly before its completion went to Ontario, leaving his partners to finish the work, collect any balance due, pay the liabilities and divide the balance among them. M. and C. finished the work and received $56,000 and over, went to Toronto and formed a new partnership of which R. was not a member. Having undertaken another contract in North Ontario, they arranged with the head office of the Imperial Bank to open an account with its branch at New Liskeard and the cheque payable to R.M. & C. was cashed at the branch in Toronto and by instructions to the New Liskeard branch was placed the credit of the new firm then and the whole sum was eventually drawn out by the latter firm. R., later, brought an action against M. and C. for winding up the affairs of their co-partnership and, pending that action took another against M. and C. and the bank claiming that the latter should pay the amount of the cheque with interest into court subject to further order.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J., affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (19 Ont. L.R. 584), Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that M. and C. had acted within their authority from R. by obtaining cash for the cheque; that there was nothing to shew that they had misapplied the proceeds or intended to do so by their dealing with the cheque; that in any case there was no notice to the bank of any intention to misapply the funds and nothing to put them on inquiry; and that the action against the bank must fail.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The evidence establishes that M. and C. had authority to convert the cheque into an instrument transferrable by delivery only and that it was acquired by the bank in good faith in the ordinary course of business. The bank, therefore, obtained a good title to the cheque and its proceeds as against the appellant.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of a Divisional Court by which the verdict for the defendants at the trial was sustained.\nThe facts of the case are not disputed. The action was brought by the plaintiff, Ross, to compel the Imperial Bank to pay into court the amount of a cheque made payable to Ross, McRae and Chandler, which had been placed to the credit of McRae, Chandler & McNeil at a branch of that bank. The plaintiff claimed that the bank on taking the cheque with his name on it as one of the payees was put on inquiry as to the right of the others to receive the amount. All the courts below have decided against this contention.\nLafleur K.C. and A.W. Mason for the appellant. The bank on taking the cheque payable to a firm from the two partners should see that it was indorsed with the concurrence of the third. Creighton v. Halifax Banking Co.[2]. See also London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[3]; Earl of Sheffield v. London Joint Stock Bank[4]; Federal Bank v. Northwood[5]. Bicknell K.C. for the respondent, The Imperial Bank.\nRose K.C. for the respondents, Chandler and McRae.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The facts of this case material to a determination of the controversy between the plaintiff, appellant, Ross, and the defendant, Imperial Bank, are as follows:\u2014\nRoss was a partner in a firm of contractors for the construction of a short piece of railway in Quebec, the firm name being Ross, McRae & Chandler.\nBefore the completion of the contract work Ross left Quebec and went to Ontario to look after some private work of his own leaving his two partners to finish up the contract, collect any balance due the firm under it, discharge with such balance the liabilities of the firm, and divide what moneys remained amongst the several partners according to their several rights.\nMcRae and Chandler accordingly finished the work and received a cheque for $56,251.57 in payment of the balance due on the contract upon the Bank of Montreal payable to their firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler.\nThey came to Toronto and having entered into a new partnership for some further work with one McNeil, under the style of McRae, Chandler & McNeil, they, McRae and Chandler, went to the Imperial Bank where McRae was known and had a conversation with the assistant general manager respecting the opening of an account in the bank at New Liskeard. Mr. Hay stated that Chandler said:\nHe and his partners, whoever they were, had completed a contract down east. I know he was speaking for McRae, and they were about to commence another contract up in the north, and as we had a branch of the Imperial Bank at New Liskeard, if it would be convenient, they would like to open an account with us.\nIt was acceptable to us and we opened the account. I took him downstairs I think and introduced him to the manager of the Toronto office, and approved of the opening of the account and his cheque was passed in and deposited to the credit of\u2014\nHere the witness was interrupted, but subsequently finished the sentence with the name \u201cMcRae, Chandler & McNeil.\u201d The witness was not able to say whether he specially observed that the cheque was payable to Ross, McRae & Chandler, and stated that he did not make any inquiries why Ross\u2019s name was not in the new account being opened, and that it did not occur to him as an important factor, though he knew \u201cRoss was a contractor\u201d and \u201cprobably identified him with the man on this cheque.\u201d He said \u201che had no suspicions and made no inquiries with regard to Mr. Ross.\u201d\nAs a fact the Toronto branch received and cashed the cheque and advised their New Liskeard branch to credit it to McRae, Chandler & McNeil. Mr. Hay stated there was no doubt that as the result of the negotiations the firm of McRae, Chandler & McNeil became entitled to credit at the New Liskeard branch for the \u201camount of the cheque.\u201d\nEvidence of the state of that account was given shewing that the whole of this credit had been subsequently paid out on the cheques of McRae, Chandler & McNeil.\nNo evidence was given as to the nature of these payments, whether they were in liquidation of liabilities of the old firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler or of the new firm of McRae, Chandler & McNeil, or of the private debts of any or either of the partners of the old firm.\nThe plaintiff Ross subsequently brought an action against McRae and Chandler, and McRae, Chandler & McNeil, for the winding up of the affairs of the firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler, which action is now pending, and they further brought this present action against the batik and McRae and Chandler, claiming that the bank\nshould be ordered to pay the said sum of $56,251.57, with interest into court to the credit of Ross McRae & Chandler, subject to further order herein.\nThe bank pleaded that it became a holder in due course of the said cheque and had no knowledge of the state of the accounts between the plaintiff Ross and the defendants Chandler and McRae, nor as to their respective rights to the proceeds of the cheque as between themselves.\nIt is obvious that the claim of the plaintiff as made could not be entertained. He had authorized his partners to complete the contract; collect the balance due on it; discharge its liabilities and divide what remained between the three partners, each being entitled to one third.\nThe utmost he could claim would be a declaration to the effect that the bank was liable for whatever share of that $56,000 would ultimately be found to belong to Ross on the adjustment of the accounts, and any such declaration could only be made as and when it was shewn that the bank was party and privy to some misappropriation of these funds and to the extent that such defrauded Ross.\nAs the matter now stands the adjustment of the accounts is proceeding under the direction of the court in another action, and it may be for aught the court knows that no part of the amount of the cheque will be shewn to be payable to Ross. He may be shewn to have received all he is entitled to under the partnership. It struck me, therefore, forcibly that we are now being asked to decide what may in the result be a purely academical question. However, that point does not seem to have been taken in the courts below, and was not taken here, so I say nothing more about it.\nThe substantial question is: Had the bank notice of an intended misapplication of the proceeds of the cheque received by them, and did they become parties or privies to such misapplication so as to make them responsible to Ross for any loss he may have sustained in consequence?\nThe only notice at all they had was the name of Ross as one of the payees of the cheque to Ross, McRae & Chandler, and the absence of his name from the firm to which they credited the proceeds of the cheque. Did that fact throw upon them the duty of inquiring as to Ross\u2019s rights under the cheque, and the rights and liabilities of the several partners in the payee firm? Was it a notice to them of an intended misapplication of the funds?\nWas the money received by the bank from the cheque or any part of it money which they applied for their own benefit? The answer is no. Beyond the indirect benefit which they might derive from the new firm\u2019s business they had no benefit whatever and they made no charge for cashing the cheque. Had they any knowledge that it was to be applied by McRae & Chandler for purposes other than those of the partnership? The answer on the evidence must again be no, they had not, unless such knowledge is to be imputed to them arising out of the facts connected with the cashing of the cheque and the placing of the funds to the credit of McRae, Chandler & McNeil.\nWas there anything to arouse suspicion on the part of the bank, anything to shew an intention on the part of the two partners to defraud Ross? Again it must be answered, nothing beyond the fact that Ross\u2019s name could be seen as one of the names of the firm to which the cheque was payable, and was not one of the names of the firm to which the proceeds were credited. If that fact alone is sufficient notice to the bank, and if it threw the duty of inquiry upon them, then it may well be argued they took the cheque at their peril and would be liable for any misapplication of the moneys by the other partners.\nThe trial judge says he was unable to find any negligence and further, that\nno possible imputation of fraud or unfair dealing, wilful blindness or any impropriety can successfully be made against Hay whose good faith in this transaction is above suspicion.\nAll the cases where a member of a partnership has in fraud of the partnership indorsed and delivered to a third party or bank in satisfaction of a private debt of his own due to the third party, bills of exchange or other negotiable securities of the partnership, the third party or bank being under the circumstances cognizant of the fraud, or having had sufficient notice of the intended misapplication, have no application in my judgment to this case.\nMcRae and Chandler it is conceded had a perfect right to indorse the cheque as was done for the firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler, and to receive the money personally either from the payee or from a third bank such as the Imperial Bank. It was part of the express mandate given them by Ross that they should collect the balance due on the contract and discharge with such collections the firm\u2019s liabilities. If they had received the money from the discount of the cheque instead of taking the course they did and then deposited it to the new firm\u2019s credit and drawn it out again by cheques signed by the new firm, I cannot see what possible difference it could make.\nWe are asked to determine affirmatively that the mere placing of the proceeds of the cheque to the credit of the new firm was a badge of fraud or at any rate clear notice of an intended fraud on the partner Ross, and of an intended misapplication of the moneys.\nI am quite unable so to conclude: The whole transaction appears to be one of an ordinary business character which, as a fact, gave rise to no suspicions and which should not have given rise to any. The placing of the moneys to the credit of McRae, Chandler & McNeil was not for the personal benefit of the bank \u201cdesigned and stipulated for\u201d; it was not done to pay a separate debt due to the bank by McRae and Chandler, or either of them, or what was known by the bank to be a separate debt due by one or two of the partnership. It was not in any sense fraudulent or necessarily inconsistent with the express purposes for which McRae and Chandler had been authorized to collect and disburse the moneys.\nI have read all the authorities cited in support of plaintiff\u2019s contention that the bank either was a party to a misapplication of the partnership funds and was in consequence liable, or had such notice of an intended misapplication of such funds as put upon them the duty of inquiry before paying out the money and so made them liable for its proper application.\nThe cases chiefly relied upon by the appellant to support his contention were Leverson v. Lane[6]; Heilbut v. Nevill[7]; Creighton v. Halifax Banking Co.[8]; Frankland v. McGusty[9]; and Ex parte Darlington District Joint-Stock Banking Co.; Re Riches and Marshall\u2019s Trust Deed[10].\nAs regards the first four cases it is sufficient to say that in each of them the partnership credit or property had been given or delivered in payment or satisfaction of a private debt of one of the partners, and that in each case the party to whom it had been so delivered was under the circumstances of the case held cognizant of the misappropriation committed or attempted to be committed, or had under the special facts of the case the onus thrown upon him of shewing that the property or security had been given with the authority of the other partners. The controlling factors are, it seems to me, absent in the case before us, and these authorities cannot have any bearing upon the appeal unless it is held that the court is bound to infer from the evidence a knowledge on the respondent bank\u2019s part of an intended misapplication of the proceeds of the cheque to the private purposes of the two partners or to the purposes inconsistent with those of the partnership of Ross, McRae & Chandler, coupled with a subsequent actual misapplication.\nThe case of Ex parte Darlington District Joint-Stock Banking Co.10 is a very peculiar one, and the observations of Lord Chancellor Westbury therein relied upon at bar must, of course, be read with reference to the facts with which he was dealing. That was a case of fraud where one partner had forged or manufactured bills of exchange to a large amount with the name of his firm appended as drawers and indorsers as also his own individual name as indorser, and had discounted these bills with the appellant\u2019s bank, which had credited the proceeds to his private account.\nIt was on these forged and fraudulent bills that after the death of the fraudulent partner the bank had claimed as creditors against the estate of the two surviving partners, Riches and Marshall, under the \u201cBankruptcy Act,\u201d and the holding of the Chancellor was that the transactions there shewed on their face a conversion by the customer of partnership property to his own purposes, and such great negligence on the banker\u2019s part in abstaining from inquiry as justified the rejection of their claim.\nAll persons (he said, p. 585) may give credit to his (a partner\u2019s) acts and his authority, unless they have notice or reason to believe that the thing done in the partnership name is done for the private purposes, or on the separate account, of the partner doing it. In that case authority by virtue of the partnership contract ceases, and the person dealing with the individual partner is bound to inquire and ascertain the extent of his authority. If he do not so act, he must depend upon the right of the partner or on circumstances sufficient to repel the presumption of fraud.\nThis is nothing more than saying that persons giving credit to the acts and authority of a partner, but having \u201cnotice or reason to believe that what is done is for the private purposes or on the separate account of the partner doing it\u201d gives such credit at his peril.\nThe question in every case is: Had the person giv- ing credit to the individual partner such notice or must he be held under the facts proved to have had knowledge that the thing done in the partnership, name was done for the private purposes of the individual partner?\nA very instructive case as to what amounts to notice and knowledge on the bank\u2019s part of the acts of individual partners being done for their own private and separate purposes is that of Gray v. Johnston[11], where it was held that:\nIn order to hold a banker justified in refusing to pay a cheque of his customer, the customer being an executor, and drawing a cheque as executor, there must be a misapplication of the money intended by the executor, so as to constitute a breach of trust, and the banker must be cognisant of that intention.\nThe existence of a personal benefit to the banker, designed or stipulated for, as a consequence of the payment, would be strong evidence that the banker was privy to the breach of trust.\nThe Lord Chancellor Cairns, at page 11, after reviewing the authorities, says:\u2014\nThe result of those authorities is clearly this: in order to hold a banker justified in refusing to pay a demand of his customer, the customer being an executor, and drawing a cheque as an executor, there must, in the first place, be some misapplication, some breach of trust, intended by the executor, and there must in the second place, as was said by Sir John Leach, in the well known case of Keane v. Robarts[12] be proof that the bankers are privy to the intent to make this misapplication of the trust funds. And to that I think I may safely add, that if it be shewn that any personal benefit to the bankers themselves is designed or stipulated for, that circumstance, above all others, will most readily establish the fact that the bankers are in privity with the breach of trust which is about to be committed.\nNow, as between a banker and his customer the Lord Chancellor laid down the proposition that to justify a bank in refusing to pay a demand of its customer, there must first be a misapplication of the funds intended, and next, proof that the bankers were privy to such intent, and lastly, that proof of personal benefit being designed or stipulated for, would be the most cogent evidence of the banker\u2019s privity with the contemplated breach of trust. At page 14 Lord West bury says:\u2014\nSupposing, therefore, that the banker becomes incidentally aware that the customer, being in a fiduciary or a representative capacity, meditates a breach of trust, and draws a cheque for that purpose, the banker, not being interested in the transaction, has no right to refuse the payment of the cheque, for if he did so he would be making himself a party to an inquiry as between his customer and third persons. He would be setting up a supposed jus tertii as a reason why he should not perform his own distinct obligation to his customer. But then it has been very well settled that if an executor or a trustee who is indebted to a banker, or to another person, having the legal custody of the assets of a trust estate, applies a portion of them in the payment of his own debt to the individual having that custody, the individual receiving the debt has at once not only abundant proof of the breach of trust, but participates in it for his own personal benefit.\nHaving determined that the payment in that case was not intended to be for the benefit of the bankers, His Lordship goes on to say:\u2014\nThat being so, it was a payment in the ordinary way of trade in common discharge of the ordinary duty between a banker and his customer, and it is impossible for the parties interested in the estate to follow that transaction, to stamp it with the character of fraud, and to make out that the payment was any other than what it appears to have been, namely, a payment in the ordinary course of trade, and to pursue it as having a different character, the character, namely, of a payment made collusively and fraudulently by the executrix for the personal benefit of the bankers.\nIt appears to me that the facts of that case of Gray v. Johnston[13] were much stronger against the bank than those of this case. There the funds in question had been transferred from the credit of an estate on a cheque signed by the executor to the credit of a partnership account in the same bank in which partnership the executor in its personal capacity was a partner, and the special benefit the bankers received was that the payment of the money, \u00a3850, went in diminuation of the liabilities of the firm to them of which firm the executor was a member.\nIn the case before us the bank derived no special benefit whatever. There was no debt due or owing to them which this cheque in dispute or any part of it went to diminish. There was not a scintilla of evidence of any personal benefit to the bank \u201cdesigned and stipulated for\u201d when the cheque was discounted.\nThe facts shew simply an ordinary every day business transaction. A person known to a bank as a reliable business man offers to the bank a cheque on another bank which is accepted and cashed. No charge is made because the person tendering the cheque intends opening an account with the bank and desires the money to be placed to his credit. The cheque is payable to a firm of which the person tendering it is a member. It is indorsed by the firm\u2019s name and also by the individual\u2019s name tendering it. There is not a suspicious circumstance surrounding the transaction. The bank had no knowledge of the state of the accounts between the partners or as to the respective rights of the partners to the proceeds of the cheque as between themselves. It derived no special benefit from the discount of the cheque or from the moneys arising therefrom. It had no knowledge or suspicion of any intended breach of trust or misapplication of the funds. It was an ordinary banking transaction and after discounting the cheque it placed the funds where its customer instructed it to place them to the credit of the new firm of McRae, Chandler & McNeil. The bank held the funds arising from the discount of the cheque to the order of McRae, Chandler & McNeil. If the latter had signed a cheque in their own favour and indorsed it to be put to their own credit, the transaction would in no sense have been different from that which actually took place when the money was placed by their verbal order and direction to the credit of the new firm. It was practically the case of a bank dealing with funds of its customer on the latter\u2019s order, and in such a case it is, \u201cimpossible,\u201d as Lord Westbury says in the case of Gray v. Johnston[14], at page 14 of the report,\nfor the banker to set up a jus tertii against the order of the customer or to refuse to honour his draft on any other ground than some sufficient one resulting from the act of the customer himself.\nMcRae and Chandler were acting perfectly within their mandate when they indorsed and discounted the $56,000 cheque. The proceeds of the cheque when cashed were held by the bank at their credit. They could have taken the cash with them had they desired. They preferred putting it to the credit of the new firm of which they were partners. This indorsing and cashing of the $56,000 cheque was done in furtherance of the special mandate they held from Ross. They were to finish the contract which Ross, McRae & Chandler had, to collect what was due and payable thereon out of such contract. In cashing the cheque they were literally obeying Ross\u2019s mandate. They were further to pay and disburse out of the moneys they collected on the contract all outstanding liabilities and after that to divide the funds between the three partners as stipulated in their partnership articles. To impose upon a bank discounting a cheque under such circumstances the duty of inquiring into the rights of third parties to the proceeds, to require the bank at its peril to make necessary inquiries from Ross who was in another part of the country as to his possible rights to a share of the cheque, to insist upon the proceeds being deposited only in the name of the old firm until Ross gave special authority otherwise, to impute to the bank under the circumstances a privity to a fraudulent attempt to defraud Ross in the application of the proceeds of the cheque, and simply on grounds of mere suspicion and curiosity would, in my humble judgment, be a most serious and unwarranted interference with ordinary banking business and throw great, if not insuperable, difficulties in it being carried on in this country. Most of the cases on the subject are reviewed at length by Bryne J. in Coleman v. Bucks, and Oxon Union Bank[15], where he shews the supreme importance of the factor so much relied upon by Lords Cairns and Westbury, of a personal benefit being to the bankers themselves designed and stipulated for as establishing privity with a contemplated breach of trust. At the close of his judgment Byrne J. says, page 254:\u2014\nIf bankers have the slightest knowledge or reasonable suspicion that the money is being applied in breach of a trust, and if they are going to derive a benefit from the transfer and intend and design that they should derive a benefit from it, then, I think, the bankers would not be entitled to honour the cheque drawn upon the trust account without some further inquiry into the matter.\nThe case of the Bank of New South Wales v. Goulburn Valley Butter Co.[16] is also in point. The head-note of the report reads:\u2014\nIn an action by a company to recover from its bankers moneys which, standing to the credit of its account, had been transferred by cheques of its managing director to the credit of his own overdrawn private account with the same bankers:\u2014\nHeld, that the bank, acting in good faith and without notice of any irregularity, was not bound before honouring the cheques to inquire into the state of the account between the company and its managing director.\u201d\nIn delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee Lord Davey says, page 550:\u2014\nThe law is well settled that in the absence of notice of fraud or irregularity a banker is bound to honour his customer\u2019s cheque Gray v. Johnston[17]; Thomson v. Clydesdale Bank[18], and is entitled to set off what is due to a customer on one account against what is due from him on another account, although the moneys due to him may in fact belong to other persons: Union Bank of Australia v. Murray-Aynsley[19]. On the other hand, a banker is not justified of his own motion in transferring a balance from what he knows to be a trust account of his customer to the same customer\u2019s private account: Ex parte Kingston; In re Gross[20]. Their Lordships are of opinion that Earle was not bound to inquire into the state of the account between the two parties. He had no materials to enable him to do so, and it is difficult to suggest any one of whom he could have made inquiry other than Ballantyne himself.\nI do not think the evidence in this case warrants the inference of any agreement having been made between the bank and McRae and Chandler to discharge the latter\u2019s private debts out of the moneys arising from the discount of the cheque or that there was intended, or as a matter of fact had, any misapplication of these funds, or that the bank can under the circumstances be held liable for the disposition made of the proceeds of the cheque after discount.\nI think the law is correctly stated in para. 473 of Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, Vol. 1, page 226:\u2014 Moreover, no agent who, being in possession of property which his principal holds in trust for another, makes on the instructions of his principal, any disposition thereof which is inconsistent with the trust, is guilty of a breach of trust, unless he had notice of the trust at the time, and was aware that the disposition made by him was in breach of trust.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant and two others formed a contracting firm named Ross, McRae & Chandler, and, upon the completion of a work they had executed, Chandler got, at Montreal or thereabout, to the said firm or order, a cheque on the Bank of Montreal for $56,251.57, to satisfy the balance due on account of said work.\nWithout the knowledge of the appellant, or even asking his leave, Chandler took this cheque to the respondent bank at Toronto and explained to Mr. Hay, the assistant manager of that bank, that he desired to open an account for his firm of McRae, Chandler & McNeil, at a branch of said bank in New Liskeard, and shewed him this cheque which he wished to use as the basis of this new account.\nThe assistant general manager was only too glad to have a new account with so good a beginning, and assented to the proposal and passed Chandler on to the proper officers of the bank to carry out the details of this arrangement.\nThat involved an instruction to the agent at New Liskeard to open the account and give credit for the exact amount of the cheque free of charges, and a transmission of the cheque indorsed by Chandler in the name of the first-mentioned firm, and next in the name of his new firm, McRae, Chandler & McNeil, to the respondent. It is not denied and I think is the proper inference from the evidence, that these indorsements were made in the bank and not so made until it was known that the arrangement for opening this new account, collecting the cheque and placing the full amount to the credit at New Liskeard had been completed.\nIt was found by the learned trial judge that the assistant general manager acted in good faith, and that there was no negligence, and some stress is laid on this in the court below.\nThese are only his inferences from facts which are not in dispute. I assume that his finding from the appearance and manner of the assistant general manager, as a witness, that he was telling the truth so far as he could recollect it, must bind us here and be taken as the statement of fact so far as it goes.\nBut I cannot, even assuming that, draw all the inferences from this evidence, that the learned trial judge has drawn.\nLet us bear in mind what Chandler and McRae were seeing the bank manager for, and the nature of the application made to him. It surely cannot be said that he was going to open an account with, and do business with and for a firm to whom the cheque belonged. On its face it plainly belonged to another firm. It was to become the basis of paying out to another firm which the bank trusted would circulate the bank bills.\nIt was not payable to the firm that was to be given credit.\nWhat was proposed and done was clearly as could be the transferring of one firm\u2019s property to another firm, and the bank was to be used as a medium or part of the machinery for doing so. Its assent to the proposal involved in its every essence the facilitating of this improper dealing with the cheque.\nHow could any one suppose this was not a using by Chandler of his firm\u2019s property for his own private purposes? Or if McRae was there, taking part therein, as the manager supposes, how could it be possible for any one not to see that it was a using by them both, for their own private purposes, of that which did not on the very face of the transaction, belong to them, or them and McNeil? And when Chandler and McRae referred to the fact that they had one contract and now were entering on another, surely there was nothing in that mode of expression to blot out Ross and substitute McNeil.\nIt is not an ordinary case. It is not one which might have happened by putting through an old account already established in the bank, a cheque sent in already indorsed over to be deposited in such old account, and in that way by, possibly, excusable inadvertence, procuring the execution of such an improper purpose as accomplished here.\nI am not saying even that would be excusable, but assuming it might be, the cases are widely different.\nNor do I think the excuse offered of there having been cases known to Mr. Hay, where a firm of the same men have for purposes of business adopted different firm names at different times, furnishes any valid excuse. These firms ostensibly presented in their very firm names, two different sets of men and thus two entirely different business concerns.\nIn his evidence in his cross-examination, Mr. Hay is asked, and answers thus, in speaking of Chandler:\u2014\nQ. Had you heard anything whatever in regard to his means, or his position, until this time when McRae and he came there? A. I heard of the new firm having got that contract before they called on us at all.\nQ. And you knew he was in that firm? A. Yes.\nThis shews he had present to his mind the creation of the new firm and the new contract, for he had stated just before this in his evidence, repeating from his examination for discovery, that the impression on his mind was that the three members of it had come together on the, occasion in question. But speaking of this at the trial I infer he then doubted the correctness of his first impression.\nI make no point of this lapse of memory, but merely wish to shew he never seems to have associated in his mind Ross as a member of the new firm.\nIt is found by the learned trial judge, and I think is abundantly clear that Mr. Hay never had any substantial reason for believing Ross was a member of the new firm, and without that I fail to see how his taking for the bank this cheque, on its face the property of Ross and his partners, can be upheld.\nThe facts seem to me to bring the case clearly within the principle acted upon in the Darlington Case[21] and the Leverson v. Lane case[22], referred to by the learned trial judge and cited in the various appeals and here; as well as in numerous cases referred to in the factum of the appellant.\nIt is not a question of mere suspicion, or something that might or ought to have put a man upon inquiry. It is the taking of that which on its face was partnership property from one of the parties for a purpose of his own, without any reason to believe or lead to the belief that the partners offering it had the authority of the other partner for so doing. I do not overlook the suggestion that he had the authority to indorse and get the money, and that the further indorsing by him for the new firm must be assumed to have taken place after the cheque had thus become payable to bearer. That momentary condition of things in this case was not the basis of this transaction; and to permit this mere theory to be set up as a line of entrenchment to protect from the consequences of a breach of faith on the part of a partner, is something which ought not to be allowed any weight in face of the palpable facts of this case.\nTo do so seems to be an acceptance of the shadow for the substance.\nIt seems equally idle to suggest the fraud might have been so easily perpetrated in another way by drawing the money. The field for the operation of fraud is wide enough already, without adding even a small bit to it.\nIn speaking thus of fraud, and assuming it here to have existed in law, I do not wish to be supposed as going further than what the law implies on the part of one partner so dealing with partnership property as this man did.\nFor aught we know the partnership account when taken may disclose a state of things that may leave the transaction a mere piece of a high-handed way of getting one\u2019s own without waiting for recovery thereof by due course of law.\nOf course that reprehensible method might not, in common parlance, be considered fraud whatever it might be in law.\nSection 56 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d is relied upon by respondent bank. It seems to me to oper- ate entirely against it. But after all this only brings the argument back to the same point of this cheque having been negotiated without notice of defect in title or in breach of faith patent to any one who read or rather was capable of reading.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, the judgment\u201d of the trial judge be set aside and such judgment be framed as will give appellant upon a taking of accounts the relief he is entitled to which is not so very obvious, nor will be until accounts are taken.\nOf course all partnership debts will have to be paid so far as this cheque extends, and interest thereon may not have been applied thereto, but beyond that it is not possible to say what actual rights the appellant has as against the bank which must be subrogated to any of the claims of Chandler and McRae on the partnership funds.\nDUFF J.\u2014The evidence appears to me to shew that the respondents McRae and Chandler had authority to convert the cheque in question into a negotiable instrument in the strict sense of the term, that is to say, an instrument transferable by delivery alone; and that it was acquired by the respondent bank in good faith in the ordinary course of business. In such circumstances the bank, I think, obtained a good title to the cheque and its proceeds as against the appellant.\nThe appellant Ross with the respondents McRae and Chandler had been as partners carrying on the construction of railway works between Three Rivers and Shawinigan Falls, Quebec, under contract with the St. Maurice Construction Company. The appellant was for some time engaged in superintending the ex- ecution of the contract on the ground, but before the completion of it he left to take charge of some works in progress in Parry Sound, Ontario, in which McRae and Chandler were also interested. The completion of the St. Maurice contract and the winding up of the business of the partnership in connection with that contract was left in the hands of McRae and Chandler. This involved, of course, the collection of the moneys payable under the contract and making the disbursements necessary to discharge the partnership obligations. It seems to be indisputable that McRae and Chandler were thereby invested with authority to convert the cheque received from the construction company into cash. Some suggestion was made, though hardly pressed, during the argument that since the firm had a banking account at Shawinigan Falls their authority was limited to depositing the cheque to the credit of that account and disbursing the proceeds by cheques drawn thereon. I do not think there is any foundation for that suggestion. McRae and Chandler evidently lived in Toronto; Ross was at Parry Sound; it might very well suit the convenience of all parties, the works being finished, that any further business should be transacted in Toronto; and Ross\u2019s evidence seems to leave no doubt that he was quite content to have McRae and Chandler realize the proceeds cheque in any manner they might think fit so long as those proceeds were properly applied. They might convert the cheque into bank bills by presenting it at one of the branches of the Bank of Montreal, on which it was drawn; or they might by indorsing it with the name of the payees and thus making it transferable by delivery alone convert it into the equivalent of bank bills. It is perfectly true that it would be an abuse of their authority and a fraud upon their partner if they did either of these things for the purpose of enabling them to appropriate the proceeds of the cheque to their own purposes in violation of their partner\u2019s rights. But it would none the less enable them, it appears to me, to give to a person dealing with them in good faith an unimpeachable title either to the bank bills or to the cheque so indorsed. Their authority as between themselves and Ross was, of course, an authority to apply the cheque or its proceeds to partnership purposes alone. But having for such purposes authority to convert the cheque into currency or the equivalent of currency the rights of such persons (dealing with them in good faith) could not, I think, be affected by the circumstance that the opportunity created by the existence and exercise of that authority was being improperly used for other purposes.\nIn relation to third parties the situation of McRae and Chandler (who for the purpose of dealing with this cheque clearly had the authority of managing partners) appears to have been much the same as that of an agent having possession of commercial paper belonging to his principal with general authority to indorse such instruments in the course of transacting the business of the principal and for his benefit. If the agent misuse such authority by applying the paper so indorsed to his own private purposes his dealing with it is from beginning to end a violation of his principal\u2019s rights; but third parties taking the paper from him with no knowledge or suspicion of his breach of duty and for value acquire nevertheless an indefeasible title even as against the principal. This was expressly decided, if not elsewhere, at least in The Bank of Bengal v. Macleod[23], and Bryant Powis & Bryant v. Quebec Bank[24]. A passage in Lord Brougham\u2019s judgment in the first-mentioned case which has often been cited appears to be applicable to the circumstances of this case.\nBut it is further said, that even if the expression be read as only amounting to this, the indorsement is to be only made for the benefit of the principal, and not for the purposes of the agent. We do not see how this very materially affects the case, for it only refers to the use to be made of the funds obtained from the indorsement, not to the power; it relates to the purpose of the execution, not to the limits of the power itself; and though the indorsee\u2019s title must depend upon the authority of the indorser, it cannot be made to depend upon the purposes for which the indorser performs his act under the power.\nThe cheque in question, therefore, although in the hands of McRae and Chandler for a limited purpose, was a negotiable instrument in the strict sense when it was presented to the bank for deposit to their credit by the firm of McRae, Chandler & McNeil; its character was such that any person in possession of it could, even though acting in fraud of the true owner, convey a good title to it provided value was received for it and the person acquiring it did so without knowledge or suspicion that it was being dealt with in violation of good faith.\nThat value was given is not disputed. The question of good faith remains. Had the bank any suspicion that this cheque was in the hands of McRae and Chandler for a limited purpose only, and that this dealing was in breach of the terms upon which they held it? This question has been passed upon by the trial judge and he has found that the bank had no such knowledge or suspicion. The Court of Appeal as well as the Divisional Court, moreover, unanimously accepted that finding.\nIt must be admitted that superficially there does appear to be some ground for supposing the judgment of Lord Westbury in Re Riches and Marshall\u2019s Trust Deed[25] to be in conflict with this view. The case is distinguishable however on the ground that the bills in question there being manufactured instruments\u2014forgeries\u2014the partners who negotiated them had no authority limited or otherwise to indorse such documents, in the partnership name; and the Lord Chancellor does not deal with the case on the footing that they were negotiable instruments. While, moreover, it may be doubted whether the Lord Chancellor\u2019s conclusions in that case involve a finding that the bank had any actual knowledge or suspicion that the customer was acting fraudulently, I agree for the reasons given by my brother Davies that applying here the criterion which was applied in that case the respondent bank\u2019s responsibility is not established. In this connection it may be observed that the appellant\u2019s position really rests upon the contention that the fact of a cheque payable to the firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler being presented for deposit to the credit of the firm of McRae, Chandler & McNeil was in itself on its face notice that the cheque was being dealt with in violation of a trust. The contention seems to ignore the circumstance that this cheque was presented by two persons (one known to the banker personally as an honest business man, the other so known to him by repute) who were members of the firm to which the cheque was payable. I do not know why a breach of trust should in such circumstances have been suspected. The difference in the firm names would, I should have thought, be of no significance whatever to persons accustomed to the dealings of railway contractors; and the fact that it made no impression on the mind of this experienced banker is not without bearing on the point whether it was a circumstance likely in the ordinary course of dealing to convey a suspicion of wrongdoing. The truth no doubt is expressed by Lord Herschell in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[26], at page 223:\u2014\nI apprehend that when a person whose honesty there is no reason to doubt, offers negotiable securities to a banker or any other person, the only consideration likely to engage his attention is whether the security is sufficient to justify the advance\nor the credit required.\nI do not think there is anything in Lord Westbury\u2019s judgment to justify the conclusion that in his view a banker being offered money or its equivalent by a person known by him to be a partner in a firm from or through which the money has been received, should be held accountable for a higher degree of vigilance and more active suspicion than when dealing with a broker or other agent who, to the banker\u2019s knowledge, offers securities which are the property of his principal and which he has authority to deal with in the course of transacting his principal\u2019s business.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiff, who was the senior member of the contracting firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler, brings this action to compel the Imperial Bank of Canada to account to him for his interest in the proceeds of a cheque for $56,251.57, drawn upon the Bank of Montreal by the St. Maurice Construction Co. in favour of the firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler. This cheque represented the balance due to that firm in connection with a contract carried out by it at Shawinigan, Que. The firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler had been formed for the purpose of this Shawinigan contract. About the time of its completion, Messrs. McRae and Chandler entered into a new partnership with one McNeil, under the firm name of McRae, Chandler & McNeil. This firm, in which the plaintiff had no interest, secured a construction contract on the Temiskaming Railway in Northern Ontario.\nThe cheque in question was received by Messrs. McRae and Chandler after Mr. Ross had left Shawinigan. By arrangement made by Messrs. McRae and Chandler with Mr. Hay, the assistant general manager of the Imperial Bank, it was taken by the Toronto branch of that bank, with the understanding that the amount thereof would be immediately placed to the credit of the firm of McRae, Chandler & McNeil at the New Liskeard branch of the same bank, for their convenience in connection with their Temiskaming contract.\nThe cheque bears indorsements in blank of the firm name, Ross, McRae & Chandler, and also of the firm name, McRae, Chandler & McNeil. There is no express evidence whether Chandler, who made the indorsements, put either or both of them on the cheque before, during or after his interview with Mr. Hay. Assuming that the course which prudent business usage would dictate was followed, the indorsements were put upon the cheque only after the arrangements for the opening of the account for the new firm had been completed. In this country, where the system of crossing cheques is little used, business men seldom take unnecessary risk of losing a cheque indorsed in blank and thus made payable to bearer. Had the indorsements been upon the cheque when it was shewn to Mr. Hay, I have little doubt that he would have said so when he was pressed by counsel for the plaintiff to state whether he had not seen the cheque and whether, if he had looked at it, he would not have seen that it was payable to the firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler. Mr. Hay is an experienced banker and as a witness was not loath to give any evidence which might put upon the case an aspect favourable to his bank. The fact that he does not say that there was any indorsement on the cheque when it was presented to him. coupled with the usual practice of prudent business men in such transactions, warrants the inference that Chandler put both indorsements on the cheque after he had arranged with Mr. Hay for the opening of the New Liskeard account and probably when he was about to hand it over to the clerk in the Toronto branch of the bank.\nThe plaintiff claims that the Imperial Bank is accountable to him because McRae and Chandler had not authority to deal with the cheque in question as they did, and the bank, as he alleges, took it with notice that they were diverting a partnership asset or security to an account in which their partner, the plaintiff, had no interest.\nThat McRae and Chandler were not authorized to use the cheque as they did is not seriously controverted. The defendants, the Imperial Bank, have been held not liable in the provincial courts\u2014by the trial judge on the ground that there was no fraud or negligence on their part and that they had reason to believe that McRae and Chandler were acting within their authority; by the Divisional Court on the ground that the indorsement of the firm name of Ross, McRae & Chandler was within Chandler\u2019s authority, and that the case should be treated as if the proceeds of the cheque had been drawn from the Bank of Montreal and deposited by McRae and Chandler to the credit of the new firm; by the Court of Appeal on the ground that when Chandler indorsed the cheque for the firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler, it became payable to bearer, and when the amount of it was placed to the credit of the new firm, the bank became holders of it for value and without notice of any defect in the title; that negligence on the part of the bank would not suffice to render them liable, even if there had been negligence; that there was no evidence of fraud; and that there was nothing to suggest to Mr. Hay that he should have made inquiries. Mr. Justice Osler concurred in this judgment with doubt.\nAfter most careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal should be allowed. He is, I think, entitled to succeed, not because of any fraud on the part of the bank officials, nor because of their negligence\u2014although, with great respect for the learned trial judge and the provincial appellate courts, it seems to me reasonably clear that there was negligence on the part of Mr. Hay; Bissell & Co. v. Fox Brothers[27]; Hannan\u2019s Lake View Central v. Armstrong & Co.[28]; a word to Ross would have saved the situation\u2014but on the well recognized principle of the law of agency, which is part of the law of partnership, that in the absence of actual authority or ratification, the principal is not bound by the act of his agent done out of the ordinary course of business, or outside the scope of his apparent or ostensible authority.\nA partner has implied authority to deal with partnership property for partnership purposes; but it is beyond the scope of his ostensible authority to divert partnership securities to his private benefit, or to the benefit of a business in which he is interested, but which is not that of the partnership. A person acquiring an asset of a partnership from one of the partners with notice that he is diverting it to his own use, assumes the risk of establishing that such a disposition of the partnership property was sanctioned by all the other partners.\nIt is immaterial whether the partnership security is applied in discharge of an existing debt or whether it is used by the individual partner for the purpose of obtaining money from his own bankers to be applied for his own personal purposes. Re Riches, and Marshall\u2019s Trust Deed[29], at page 586.\nBy Mr. Hay\u2019s own evidence it is established that he was aware that it was a \u201cnew\u201d firm which had got the Temiskaming Railway contract; he knew of the \u201cold\u201d firm and he probably identified the plaintiff, as a member of it, with the name \u201cRoss\u201d upon the cheque in question; he had no reason to believe that Ross had any interest in the \u201cnew\u201d firm; its name indicated that Ross was not a member of it. He was informed that a contract had just been completed at Shawinigan. Although he does not in terms make the admission, the only proper inference from his evidence is that he knew that the cheque in question had been received in payment of a sum due to the contractors under the Shawinigan contract, and on the face of the cheque, which he saw, it was apparent that this payment was made to the old firm, Ross, McRae & Chandler.\nNotice and knowledge means not merely express notice, but knowledge or the means of knowledge to which the party wilfully shuts his eyes. Per Parke B. in May v. Chapman[30], at page 361.\nThe cheque was indorsed in such a manner that the diversion of it from the old firm to the new firm was unmistakable. It was equally obvious that the indorsement by which this transfer was effected was made by, and was in the hand-writing of Chandler. He had placed his own signature beneath that of the old firm to indicate this fact. The design of placing the proceeds of this security of the old firm to the credit of the new firm, so that the latter would be in a position to disburse the money for its own ends, was therefore apparent. Indeed the intention of McRae and Chandler to use it in connection with their Temiskaming contract was avowed when they explained to Mr. Hay the reasons why they desired to have the proceeds of the cheque placed to their credit in the New Liskeard branch of the Imperial Bank. As put by Meredith C.J.:\u2014\nIt seems equally clear that Mr. Hay, the assistant-general manager of the bank, with whom the transaction took place, had notice of the intended and of the actual application by McRae & Chandler of the proceeds of the cheque, so far as the depositing of them to the credit of the new firm was an application of them, for that they should be so deposited was the object of the transaction in which the parties were engaged. I would add that Mr. Hay knew that it was intended that the money should be used in connection with the Temiskaming contract of the new firm.\nThere is nothing in the evidence, as I read it, to support the statement of the learned trial judge that \u201cHay supposed that the old firm were going under a new name\u201d\u2014Hay certainly does not say so; nothing to warrant the learned judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe bank have made out they had reason to believe that Chandler was acting within his authority\u201d\u2014if, indeed, short of a case of estoppel, that be material when it has been established affirmatively that he acted without authority. Kendal v. Wood[31], at pages 248, 254.\nChandler no doubt had authority as a member of the old firm to indorse the cheque for the purpose of depositing it to the credit of that firm, or of drawing from the Bank of Montreal the money for which it called. But the indorsement of the name of the old firm for the purpose of transferring the cheque to the new firm was beyond the scope of his ostensible authority as a partner in the old firm, quite as much as it was beyond the scope of his real authority.\nMr. Hay knew or must be taken to have known that Chandler and McRae were not acting within such authority as may be implied from partnership agency. He trusted to their having special authority and he took the risk of its turning out that such special authority did not exist: McConnell v. Wilkins[32], at page 443.\nIf the agent be held out as having only limited authority to do on behalf of his principal acts of a particular class, then the principal is not bound by an act done outside that authority, even though it be an act of that particular class, because the authority being thus represented to be limited, the party prejudiced has notice and should ascertain whether or not the act is authorised. Russo Chinese Bank v. Li Yau Sam[33], at page 184.\nWhen the Imperial Bank accepted the cheque from McRae and Chandler and at once placed the amount of it to the credit of the new firm, it became not merely the agent of the new firm to collect the proceeds of the cheque for them, but the purchaser of the cheque. The materiality of this distinction is illustrated in the case of Bevan v. National Bank[34], at page 68\u2014a case concerning crossed cheques. Section 175 of our \u201cBank Act\u201d corresponds with section 82 of the \u201cEnglish Bills of Exchange Act,\u201d45-46 Vict. ch. 61.\nI do not understand the view attributed to Meredith C.J. in the Divisional Court, that the bank was the agent of the old firm to receive payment of the cheque. As its purchaser the bank became a holder of the cheque for value (\u201cBank Act,\u201d sec. 56, sub-sec. 2); but, with great respect, I cannot accept the view that it had not notice of the defect in the title of the new firm which negotiated the cheque with it.\nThat knowledge of the fact that a partnership security is being diverted by one or more of the partners to the benefit of a business in which another of the partners is not interested puts the person taking it upon inquiry as to the actual authority of the partner or partners so dealing with it, \u201cby which it is meant that he takes the paper at his peril,\u201d is established by many cases: Creighton v. Halifax Banking Co.[35]; Re Riches and Marshall\u2019s Trust Deed[36]; Leverson v. Lane[37]; Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, Vol. 1, p. 594. I fail to appreciate the distinction suggested between the case where, as here, the banker discounts or purchases for the benefit of an individual partner a cheque drawn in favour of his firm, and those cases where bankers, who, under similar circumstances, discounted promissory notes or bills of exchange, have been held accountable to the firm or the defrauded partner. A cheque is an inland bill of exchange drawn on a banker payable on demand. Lynn v. Bell[38].\nWe were pressed with the statement that, if the bank should be held accountable in the present case, banking business will be unduly hampered. I admit that weight which should be given to such a consideration. I question, however, the accuracy of the statement. But it is, in any case, of paramount importance that we should not disturb well-settled principles of the law of agency by disregarding them because in a particular instance their application may seem to result in a hardship, perhaps more apparent than real. The doctrine that a person, who deals with a partner in a matter or for a purpose beyond the scope of the ostensible authority which the partnership confers, does so at his peril, must not be jeopardized, impaired or weakened. I can discover no ground of distinction between the case of a bank which discounts a cheque drawn in favour of a partnership on another bank, and that of any other person who becomes the purchaser of such a security. Knowledge of facts indicating an excess of authority by the partner negotiating it puts both alike upon inquiry. The position of a banker who honours his customer\u2019s cheque is quite different. His primary duty to do so is a determining factor in cases such as Backhouse v. Charlton[39]; Gray v. Johnston[40]; Coleman v. Bucks and Oxon Union Bank[41]. The distinction between the case of a person originally discounting a partnership bill and that of a subsequent bon\u00e2 fide holder of it for value is pointed out by Lord Kenyon in Arden v. Sharpe[42].\nI accept the statement of the law, contained in the following paragraph of Mr Justice Riddell\u2019s opinion:\nNo one may with impunity take from one partner an asset of the firm \u201cfor the purpose of obtaining money to be applied for his own personal purposes,\u201d or with a knowledge that it is not to be applied for the purposes of the partnership.\nThat suffices to put the person taking the partnership asset on inquiry; and he ordinarily assumes the burden of shewing that the partner, from whom he received it, in so dealing with it, acted with the authority of his co-partner: Lindley on Partnership, 7th ed., p. 202.\nThe Master of the Rolls, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Frankland v. McGusty[43], at pages 301-2, says:\u2014\nI take it to be clear, from all the cases upon the subject, that it lies upon a separate creditor who takes a partnership security for the payment of his separate debt, if it be taken simpliciter, and there is nothing more in the case, to prove that it was given with the consent of the other partners. But there may be other circumstances attending the transaction which may afford the separate creditor a reasonable ground of belief, that the security so given in the partnership name is given with the consent of the other partners * * * Upon a consideration, therefore, of all the authorities, I am of opinion that the law is, that taken simpliciter, the separate creditor must shew the knowledge of the partnership; but if there are circumstances to shew a reasonable belief that it was given with the consent of the partnership, it lies upon the partners to prove the fraud. I think that will reconcile all the cases.\nExcept his idea that McRae and Chandler were reputable business men, and his gratuitous statement that \u201cit is not an uncommon thing for contractors to take the different contracts under different names\u201d\u2014he does not venture to pledge his oath that he believed that Ross had any interest in the Temiskaming contract or in the \u201cnew\u201d firm\u2014the bank manager suggests no basis for any reasonable belief on his part that Chandler was acting within his authority in negotiating the firm cheque as he did. His belief in Chandler\u2019s authority, if it existed,\u2014(again Mr. Hay is careful not to say that he did in fact entertain this belief; he apparently gave the matter no thought, had no suspicion, made no inquiries)\u2014based on these grounds would not, in the circumstances, be such a reasonable belief as would even shift to the plaintiff the burden of proving lack of authority on the part of Chandler. This would rather appear to be a case in which the banker had no reason to believe that Chandler\u2019s actual authority was greater than his ostensible authority as a partner\u2014a case of taking from an individual partner, for his own benefit, a partnership security simpliciter. Apart from conduct on the part of the plaintiff, upon which an estoppel might be founded, Kendal v. Wood[44], at pages 251, 253, but of which there is here no suggestion, good faith and belief in the authority of the partner negotiating the security, however reasonable, will not afford the banker a defence, at all events when absence of authority and fraudulent conduct on the part of the part- ner have been actually shewn. Lindley on Partnership, 7th ed., page 201, note (s); Smith\u2019s Mercantile Law, 11th ed., Vol. 1, p. 35; Hannan\u2019s Lake View Central v. Armstrong Co.[45]\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that, in respect of the cheque itself and its proceeds, the right of the Imperial Bank is no higher or better than that of Messrs. McRae and Chandler.\nAs pointed out in Heilbut v. Nevill[46], because Chandler had authority to indorse the cheque in the name of the partnership, though for partnership purposes only, there might be some difficulty in holding the bank liable for a conversion of it; but there is no difficulty in holding them accountable for its proceeds as money had and received to the use of the firm of Ross, McRae & Chandler.\nThe relevancy of section 96 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d relied upon by Mr. Bicknell, I cannot appreciate.\nIt has not yet been made clear what was the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the cheque. That will appear when the partnership accounts have been taken in the other action in which a reference for that purpose has been directed. The bank might, as a matter of strict right, be required to pay into court in this action the whole amount of the cheque in question. This would be placed to the credit of the old firm and the bank would then be entitled to claim as a creditor against the partnership for so much of the proceeds of the cheque as it could shew had been expended for the benefit of the old partnership; and as to the balance, it would be entitled to subrogation to the rights of McRae and Chandler as developed upon the part- nership accounting. But it will be simpler, and the net result will be the same, if the bank is held accountable to the plaintiff only for whatever sum, not exceeding $56,251.57, may be found to be the balance due to him upon the taking of the partnership accounts.\nThe defendant bank objects to the plaintiff recovering any judgment until it is shewn by the taking of the accounts of the partnership that there is a balance due to him. But the plaintiff, on the other hand, asserts that, unless the accountability of the bank is established, it may not be worth his while, because of their financial irresponsibility, to pursue his action of account against his late partners. The liability of the bank to account to the plaintiff depends chiefly, if not entirely, upon a question of law. But whether it involves solely a question of law or also questions of fact, under the circumstances it may well be disposed of before the accounts between the partners are taken up. Ontario Consolidated Rules 259 and 531. That the plaintiff\u2019s relief must be presently confined to a judgment declaratory of his rights against the bank is not an answer to his claim. \u201cOntario Judicature Act,\u201d sec. 57, sub-sec. 5. Such a judgment is all that can be now given him. With it, however, he will probably have no difficulty in realizing from the bank any amount found to be due him when the partnership accounts have been taken.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in all the provincial courts.\nAlthough no relief is asked against the defendants Chandler and McRae, they were, I think, properly made respondents on this appeal. Their peculiar dealing with the partnership cheque in question has been the cause of this entire litigation; they are vitally and directly interested in the accountability of their co-defendants to the plaintiff, and it was right that they should be given an opportunity to appear, if so advised, when the case against the bank was being dealt with. But as no relief was asked against them their appearance was not necessary unless they desired to contest the plaintiff\u2019s right to hold the bank accountable. That they could do only at their own risk. They should bear their own costs in all the courts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonald, Shepley, Middleton & Donald.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The Imperial Bank: Bicknell, Bain & Strathy.\nSolicitors for the respondents, Chandler and McRae: Beatty, Blackstock, Fasken & Chadwick.\n[1] 19 Ont.

Evidence making a prima facie case for the Crown in a criminal prosecution, if unanswered and believed by the jury, is sufficient to support a conviction of the person accused.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirming the conviction of the appellant, at the trial, upon an indictment for arson, on an appeal by special leave upon questions of law in respect of which the trial judge, Stuart J., refused to reserve a case for the opinion of the court in banco.\nThe following statement was made by the learned trial judge in refusing the application for a reserved case by counsel for the appellant.\nSTUART J. \u2014 \"I refuse to reserve the following questions for the opinion of the court, en banc, at the next sittings of the said court to be holden at Calgary, in Alberta.\n\"(I.)

A careful perusal of the evidence here satisfies me that there is evidence quite sufficient to prove that the house was destroyed by a fire under circumstances which clearly pointed to incendiarism, and that the accused might fairly be presumed to have set the fire. When the Crown's case was closed, of the three persons who had means of access to the building on the night of the fire two had given their evidence, frankly and fully testifying to all that occurred; the third, the accused, volunteered to go into the witness box and attempted to explain away those things which were calculated to throw suspicion upon her. To say the least, her explanation is not satisfactory. Her denials of facts that are proved beyond all doubt are very much to her discredit. In any event, the jury having had occasion to hear the story of the three persons who alone admittedly might have caused the fire, and the theory of accident being eliminated, came to the conclusion, on evidence which, in my opinion, was sufficient, that the appellant was guilty of the offence with which she was charged and no reason has been given here to justify us in setting that verdict aside. The facts are so fully and clearly discussed in the judgments below that I do not feel it necessary to say more.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"

The legislature of a province may provide for the levy and collection of taxes so imposed by the transfer of the interests affected by such taxes.\nThe Dominion statute, 53 Vict. ch. 4, authorized the granting of aid for the construction of a railway by a subsidy in Crown lands, and, by section 2, it was declared that such grants should be \"free grants\" subject only to the payment, on the issue of patents therefor, of the costs of survey and incidental expenses, at the rate of ten cents per acre. The lands in question formed part of the land-subsidy, earned by the railway company and reserved and set apart for that purpose by order-in-council, which had been conveyed by deed poll to the appellants by the railway company prior to the issue of a Crown grant. While still unpatented, these lands had been rated for taxes and condemned for arrears of taxes under the statute of Alberta, 7 Edw. VII. ch. 11.\nHeld, that the interest of the appellants in the said lands was subject to taxation and liable to be dealt with under the provincial statute, although letters patent of grant thereof by the Crown had not issued.\nHeld, also, that allotment of these lands as \"free grants,\" under the subsidy Act, related only to exemption from the usual charges made in respect of public lands by or on behalf of the Crown, except the cost of survey, etc., and did not exempt the appellants' interest therein from taxation under the provisions of the provincial statute, although neither the legal estate nor any interest therein remaining in the Crown could be liable to taxation.\nJudgment appealed from (2 Alta.

S.C.R. 550) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the order of Sifton C.J., which confirmed the return of the tax commissioner, so far as it affected the lands in question.\nOn the 25th of February, 1910, an application, by motion to the Supreme Court of Canada,* was made for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, in view of the doubt whether or not the matter in controversy originated in an inferior tribunal, and it was urged that there should, if necessary, be special leave granted, under the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act\" on account of constitutional questions and matters of great magnitude and public interest being involved in the dispute.\nChrysler K.C. supported the motion.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. contra.\nJudgment was reserved.\nOn the 3rd of March, 1910, the judgment of the court, on the motion, was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. \u2014 This application was made before the registrar, as judge in chambers, under the provisions of section 37(c) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" for leave to appeal. The motion was enlarged by him into court.\nThe application arises in the following manner. The local statute of Alberta, chapter 11, of 1907, sections 90 et seq., provides that the secretary of every district shall make a return of the assessable lands and also of arrears of taxes. Section 92 authorizes a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, in chambers, on the application of the Attorney-General of the province, to appoint a time for the holding of a court for the confirmation of the return; and section 95 provides that, any time after the expiration of a year, the Attorney-General may obtain an order from a judge, in chambers, directing that the title to the lands in arrears for taxes be vested in the Crown. In the statutes of 1908, chapter 7 (Alta.), it is provided that where jurisdiction is given to a judge, as persona designata, he should be deemed to have the jurisdiction of a judge of the court to which he belongs, and that his orders should be enforced as other orders of the court. By the same Act an appeal is given to the full court from his judgment, after leave has been obtained.\nIn the present case the lands of the Calgary and Edmonton Land Company were returned by the secretary of the district as in arrear for taxes, and this return was confirmed by the Chief Justice of Alberta, and, upon an appeal from his order of confirmation, the appeal was dismissed and his order was affirmed by the unanimous judgment of the full court. The land company now applies for leave to appeal under section 37(c) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" where an appeal is taken by leave of the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof, although the case may not have originated in a court of superior jurisdiction.\nWithout expressing any opinion as to whether, in the circumstances, it was necessary to move for leave, we think it is a proper case in which to grant the motion, quantum valeat, because of the magnitude of the interests involved. The motion is granted without costs.\nThe questions at issue on the hearing of the appeal on the merits are stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.C. and Laird for the appellants.\nS. B. Woods K.C., Deputy Attorney-General for Alberta, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Beck in the court below. DA VIES J. \u2014 This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta dated 24th December, 1909, dismissing the appellant's appeal from the order of the Honourable Chief Justice Sifton, which latter is dated 2nd March, 1909.\nThe order of the Chief Justice was made by him under the powers vested in him by section 93 of \"The Local Improvement Act\" of the Province of Alberta, being chapter 11 of the Statutes of Alberta (1907), and the effect of it was to confirm the return of arrears of taxes for Local Improvement District No. 607 of the Province of Alberta in respect of the north-east quarter of section 3, township 16, range 2, West of the fifth meridian, for the year 1906, these arrears amounting to $2. This land belongs, it is claimed, to the appellant, having been acquired by it under the circumstances hereinafter set out. The effect of the confirmation of the return of the arrears of taxes on this land is to vest it or the appellant's interest in it in the Crown for the public use of the province, subject, however, to redemption by the owners, as in the statute set out.\nAs the case was admittedly a test one and involved important questions affecting the public interests depending upon the proper construction of the \"Local Improvement Act\" of Alberta (1907), and of Canada's \"Constitutional Act\" (B.N.A. Act, 1867), special leave to appeal to this court was granted to appellant.\nThe circumstances under which the appellant became possessed of the lands in question are as follows:\nBy statute of Canada, 53 Vict. (1890), ch. 4, it was provided that the Governor-General in Council might grant a subsidy in Dominion land to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company (the predecessors in title of the appellant) towards the construction of the railway to an extent not exceeding six thousand four hundred (6,400) acres for each mile of the company's railway from Calgary to a point at or near Edmonton on the North Saskatchewan River, a distance of about one hundred and ninety (190) miles, and also to an extent of six thousand four hundred (6,400) acres for each mile of the company's railway from Calgary to a point on the international boundary between Canada and the United States, a distance of about one hundred and fifty (150) miles, such grant to be made in the proportion and upon the conditions fixed by order-in-council made in respect thereof and except as to such conditions to be free grants, subject only to the payment of the costs of survey and incidental expenses at the rate of ten (10) cents an acre in cash on the issue of patents therefor.\nBy order-in-council, 18th November, 1891, supplementing a previous order-in-council of the 27th June, 1890, the Government of Canada reserved and set apart (amongst others) the lands in question for the purpose of the land grant of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company, subject to its being found that it had not been disposed of or reserved prior to 27th June, 1890, this land (amongst others) having been applied for by the railway company on 20th October, 1891, and having been earned by the company at that time. These lands (amongst others) were transferred by deed of bargain and sale dated 13th December, 1902, by the railway company to the appellants and patent was issued to the appellants therefor on 19th June, 1907. The main issue, therefore, involved in this appeal is whether the appellants can be validly assessed for taxes in respect of this land in 1906, patent for it not being issued to them in respect of it until 1907.\nQuestions which were raised by the appellants arising out of the provisions of the order-in-council as to the lands reserved being fairly fit for settlement, and as to their not having been sold or disposed of prior to the 27th June, 1890, were withdrawn by Mr. Ewart during his argument at bar. He rested his appeal upon two points. First, that taxes could not validly be assessed upon the lands for the year 1906, because the patent from the Crown therefor did not issue till the year 1907, and next, because the second section of the \"Dominion Act,\" 53 Vict. ch. 4, granting the subsidies in lands to the railway company in aid of the construction of the railway provided that\nsuch grants should be free grants subject only to the payment by the grantees respectively of the cost of the survey of the lands and incidental expenses at the rate of ten cents per acre in cash on the issue of the patents therefor.\nThe argument, as I understand it, on the second point was that, as the statute provided that the grants thereof were to be \"free grants\" subject only to the payment of ten cents per acre for cost of survey the lands granted could not be liable for provincial taxation before the patent issued; otherwise they would not be free grants.\nI confess myself quite unable to appreciate this point. The term \"free grants\" mentioned in the statute meant free so far as the Crown granting the lands was concerned. It meant free from any of the customary charges made by the Government in selling its vacant lands to settlers or others, and from any charges of any kind by or on behalf of the Crown excepting those expressly mentioned for survey fees. It could not, in my opinion, be intended to exempt the beneficial interest of the railway company in the lands from liability to local taxation which it otherwise would be subject to after it came into existence, and before the patent issued. The term \"free grant\" meant free as far as the Crown granting the lands was concerned, not free from liens or charges which might attach to the lands by law by virtue or in consequence of the acquisition by the railway company of a beneficial interest therein. Such a construction as that claimed involves, I think, an unwarrantable extension of the language of the statute, the meaning of which seems reasonably clear to me.\nThe main question, however, remains, which is substantially whether the Alberta \"Local Improvement Act,\" chapter 11 of 1907, which was a revision of chapter 24 of 1903, as amended by chapter 8 of 1904, and chapter 11 of 1906, applied only to lands the title to which had passed by patent from the Crown or was applicable to the beneficial interest of an owner of lands the title to which had not so passed.\nReference was made during the argument to the decision of this court in Rural Municipality of North Cypress v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2], on the construction of the tax-exemption section in the Canadian Pacific Railway contract expressly exempting the lands of that company from taxation for twenty years \"from the grant thereof from the Crown.\" I cannot see how that case bears upon the case now before us. It was upon the express language of that exempting section that the decision of this court rested. No such language or any language analogous can be found in the statutes or orders-in-council which we have to construe in this case. The only language which can be invoked to support the contention is that of the second section of the \"Subsidy Act\" before mentioned as to the grant to the railway company being a free grant. I have already dealt with that holding that it simply meant free so far as any imposition or charge by the Government of Canada, the granting party, is concerned, but is not in any way restrictive of the jurisdiction of the province over taxation for provincial purposes.\nThat being so the only questions remaining to be considered are the 125th section of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" which reads that\nno lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation,\nand the meaning and scope of the \"Local Improvement Act.\"\nThe lands in question were admittedly at one time Dominion lands within the meaning of that section. They were vested in the Crown subject to the control of Parliament.\nBy the \"Subsidy Act,\" 53 Vict. ch. 4, Parliament had legislated declaring that the Governor in Council might grant the subsidies in land thereafter mentioned, (inter alia), to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company, 6,400 acres for each mile of the company's railway from Calgary to a point at or near Edmonton, and further declaring that such grant might be made\nin the proportion and upon the conditions fixed by orders-in-council, and that except as to such conditions the grants should be free grants,\nsubject only to the costs of survey, etc.\nFrom the evidence before us it is clear that the lands in question were earned by the railway com- pany, that they with others were selected by the company to answer the subsidy grant; that application was made to the Governor in Council for the necessary allotment of the lands to them; that the necessary order-in-council was passed \"reserving and setting apart for the purposes of the land grant\" to that railway company, (inter alia), the lands in question; that prior to the date when the taxes complained of were imposed the railway company had sold, assigned and transferred the lands in question with others to the appellants in this action, and that subsequently, on the 19th June, 1907, the patent for the lands in question issued to the appellants.\nCan these lands be held, notwithstanding the dispositions of them so made by the Parliament of Canada, the Governor in Council acting under the authority of that Parliament and the railway company, still to be lands belonging to Canada and not liable to taxation until after the patent issued ?\nThe legal title, it is true, still remained in the Crown until the patent passed, but the equitable title had become vested in the appellants to whom it had been transferred by the railway company. The interest of the Crown whatever it might have been could not be taxed, but the beneficial interest of the appellants certainly was not exempted under or by virtue of the section of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" under review. Canada had no interest in the land after the consideration for which it was stipulated to be granted to the railway company had passed beyond the right to the cost of surveying the same which was to be collected when the patent issued. The whole beneficial interest having passed to the company and the bare legal estate remaining in the Crown the land no longer can be said to be land belonging to Canada within the meaning of the section. The exemptions provided for by that section are for the protection of the interest of the Crown only, not of those who have derived beneficial interests in lands from the Crown.\nThe only remaining question is whether or not the provisions of the \"Local Improvement Act,\" under which the taxes were assessed, are comprehensive enough to cover that beneficial interest.\nThe Crown is not mentioned in that \"Local Improvement Act,\" and it is not, of course, contended that any interest the Crown may have had could be legally assessed or affected by the assessment of the lands. What is contended is that all of the interest of the appellants was assessed and was condemned, and that, subject to the right of redemption reserved by the statute, the order of the Chief Justice operated to vest in The King, in right of His provincial government, the whole beneficial interest of the appellants in the land.\nA reference to the Act in question shews that its scope and purpose was to embrace within the lands liable to be assessed and taxed every beneficial interest therein. Here we have only to deal with the legal estate which remained in the Crown and which the statute in no way affects or touches and the beneficial interest which had passed to the company and which I think clearly came within the interests assessable under the Act.\nThe interpretation section of the statute makes this abundantly clear. The conclusion I reach, therefore, is that the appellants had \u00e1 beneficial interest in the lands in question which was subject to taxation under the Act, and that the fact of the legal estate in the lands still remaining in the Crown made no difference and created no exemption in favour of the beneficial owner, the appellants, the Crown's interest being in no way affected.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. \u2014 This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Alberta, en banc, in a matter which came before it for the interpretation of \"The Local Improvement Ordinance of the North-West Territories\" and amendments thereto, which seem to have been enacted by local legislative authority previous to the creation of the Province of Alberta, yet remain as the taxing statutes of that province, and have since been supplemented by additions to the legal machinery for enforcing the rates when fixed, and determining the legality of the proceedings.\nThe questions raised are relative to the liability of certain lands, now vested in the appellant, to taxation and to have payment of the taxes imposed by virtue of said statutes enforced in the mode provided therein.\nI do not think it necessary to state in detail all the legislation that may be brought into action in this regard but, to illustrate, may briefly state sufficient thereof to understand how this case arises. The council for a district is given power to levy, in the manner and to the extent provided, upon every owner or occupant in the district \"for all lands owned or occupied by him\" and for that purpose to frame an assessment roll in which has to be set out each lot or parcel of land owned or occupied and the number of acres it contains, with the name and address of the person assessed, and the amount of assessment. And if the owner is not known the lot or parcel has to be set out, and the fact stated that the owner is unknown. Provision is made for an appeal therefrom by parties aggrieved and the final determination thereof by a justice of the peace. If the taxes are not paid within a stated time after notice, distress may be made of the goods of the person who ought to pay the taxes.\nSection 57 is as follows:\u2014\n57. The taxes accruing upon or in respect of any land in the district shall be a special lien upon such land having priority over any claim, lien, privilege or encumbrance thereon.\nThe taxes might be recovered also by suit.\nIn the event of taxes not being paid a return is made by the secretary of the district shewing all lands in the district upon which taxes remain unpaid. And other returns are required at the same time and the returns so made then constitute a return which is the foundation for the proceedings taken herein, and it is declared prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the validity of the assessment and imposition of the taxes as shewn therein, and that all steps and formalities prescribed by this ordinance had been taken and observed.\nThereupon the Attorney-General may apply in chambers to a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta for confirmation of this return.\nMachinery is provided for advertising, and notifying by mail, the parties concerned, of the proposed sitting of that court, and the time and place fixed by the judge, and at the time and place designated, the judge is required to hear the application, and all parties who appear thereon. Thereupon the judge is to determine whether the taxes in question respectively upon each parcel in the return, are due or not, and such adjudication being made, the effect of finding any parcel in arrears for two years, is declared\nto vest in the Crown for the public use of the territories the said lands subject, however, to redemption by the owners respectively of the said lands at any time within one year from the date of the adjudication, etc.\nThese proceedings having been taken and the lands in question herein, having been so adjudged liable to forfeiture and forfeited accordingly subject to redemption in respect of taxes the appellants herein appealed to the court, en banc, and that appeal was dismissed.\nThereupon the appellants asked leave to appeal to this court and it was granted by virtue of section 37, sub-section (c) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" yet the respondent claims there is no jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the kind.\nInasmuch as section 48 of the last named Act is specially designed for the purpose of dealing with cases of improper assessment I was at first doubtful if the sub-section (c) of section 37, wide as it is, could have been intended to apply to a class of cases of the kind in question. It may, however, well be held that this has not to do with assessment, but is a judicial proceeding for the purpose of ascertaining and determining relative to the regularity of the proceedings before executing the purpose of the legislation and may be looked at just as a quieting title proceeding might be.\nI am, on consideration, inclined to think this the case.\nAssuming jurisdiction exists, we must observe the nature of the question raised.\nIt is this. The lands in question form part of a land grant given to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company, by way of subsidy, out of the Crown lands, in what is now the Province of Alberta. The concession was made by virtue of a Dominion statute passed in 1890. The patent granting the lands in question, issued to appellants on 19th June, 1907, after the railway company had transferred such lands to the appellants by a deed dated 13th December, 1902.\nThe taxes in question consist of ratings made in 1906 and 1907. And it is contended that inasmuch as these lands remained in these years vested in the Crown on behalf of the Dominion, they remained nonassessable until after the issue of the patent and, hence, were non-forfeitable to the Crown on behalf of the province.\nA good many subsidiary points were taken (but later abandoned), in argument to support the position that though in fact forming ultimately part of the subsidy to the railway company which actually passed to the company or its assignees they had not been so definitely designated until the issue of the patent, as to transfer any interest in them to the railway company, or their assignees, the appellants, until the patent issued.\nThe question raised is thus reduced to the construction of the taxing ordinance and amendments, and their operative effect when the appellants had acquired an interest of any kind in the lands so long as they remained vested in the Crown on behalf of the Dominion.\nWe must if we would understand the statute and this case observe at the outset that the taxing statute in question in no way presumes to bind the Crown or to tax Crown lands as such. Then the rule of law that when a statute does not expressly or within the pur- view of the statute apply to the Crown or its lands it is to be taken as inoperative in relation to either must be borne in mind.\nBearing that in mind how can it be said that this ordinance which makes no such pretension can be said to have any reference to a taxing or forfeiture of the title, estate or interest of the Crown?\nOnce that or any such pretension is deleted, as it were, from the appearances derivable from the use of such expressions as land or lands in any of the sections brought forward for consideration and the meaning thereof restricted to the estate or interest of others manifestly taxable for their lands, or their lands in fact so rendered liable thereto, it seems clear the whole difficulty is removed and the foundation for the present contention gone.\nNot only is this so, but the interpretation of the word \"owner,\" which is as follows:\u2014\n13. \"Owner\" includes any person who has any right, title or estate whatsoever or any interest other than that of a mere occupant in any land;\nand, of the words \"land,\" \"lands\" or \"real property,\" as follows:\u2014\n18. \"Land,\" \"lands\" or \"real property\" includes lands, tenements and hereditaments and any estate or interest therein;\nmake it quite clear that nothing done can go beyond or be effective beyond those specified meanings given in the Act to the language used.\nRead as interpreted by the statute the estate or interest of the appellants is all that is touched and all that becomes forfeitable or forfeited if not redeemed. And assuredly the appellants never pretended, in the courts below, nor did any one suppose, that they had not a definite interest, but it was con- tended, that because the patent had not issued, even if appellants' estate or interest was, in 1906, as definitely fixed as it ever could be before the patent issued and forever beyond the power of the Crown to take that right and interest away, yet it was not, until 1907, taxable, and liable to be dealt with as it was by the officers of the district, confirmed by the Chief Justice who heard the application and was upheld by the court en banc.\nI hold quite the contrary is the meaning of the taxing statute and that the assignees of the concessionaries were, in 1906, just as taxable as are purchasers from the Crown paying their purchase money by instalments, as I presume a great part of the country in question stands to-day. To decide this test case on any other issue than the neat one of the taxability of lands or interest in lands before the issue of the patent, would be to defeat the purpose of the parties in trying to make of it a test case.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. \u2014 I concur in dismissing the appeal.\nANGLIN J. \u2014 Counsel for the appellants having expressly abandoned all their other objections to the order in appeal, the only questions for our consideration are:\u2014\n(a) Whether the interest held by the appellants in the land in question would be taxable if it had been acquired from a private owner who retained an interest similar to that held in the present case by the Crown;\n(b) whether provincial taxation of the interest of the appellants offends against section 125 of the \"British North America Act;\" and (c) whether, on a proper construction of the \"Local Improvement Ordinance\" of the North-West Territories (chapter 73 of the Con. Ord., 1905), the sole subject of taxation is the whole proprietary interest in land, or, whether any estate or interest less than the whole proprietary interest which may belong to an \"owner\" is also assessable.\nThe land in question forms part of the land subsidy authorized by the statute, 53 Vict. (D.) ch. 4, for the construction of the northern section (190 miles) of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway.\nBy a contract, which recites this statute and an order-in-council approving of the grant, the railway company undertook with the Dominion Government to fulfil the conditions upon which the grant of the subsidy was authorized by Parliament. Those conditions have been fully carried out. The railway company applied for, inter alia, the parcel of land in question (section 3, in township 16 of range 2, W. of Mer. 5), on account of the grant for the first 190 miles of railway. By order-in-council of the 18th November, 1891, which was passed on this application and stated that \"the company are now entitled to have conveyed to them\" lands to the extent of the area therein specified, the Government of Canada set apart, for the purpose of its subsidy, the lands for which the company asked.\nCounsel were, in my opinion, well advised in withdrawing the objections which they abandoned. They were based on provisions of the order-in-council which made the allocation of the lands so set apart in some respects conditional, the point of the objections being the absence of evidence to shew that the land now in question fulfilled such conditions. The order in appeal confirms a \"return,\" by the secretary of the district, of lands on which taxes remain unpaid. It has certain statutory effects. By sub-section 3 of section 83 of the taxation ordinance it is provided that\nthe return for all purposes shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the assessment and imposition of taxes as shewn therein * * *\nHaving regard to this provision and to the facts that the objections withdrawn appear not to have been raised before the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, or, if raised, not to have been supported by evidence; that the notice of appeal to the court en banc contains no reference to any of them; that, in order to appeal to the full court, the land company required the leave of the Chief Justice, which was granted, no doubt, on submission to him of the notice of the proposed appeal and to enable the company to obtain a decision upon the grounds of appeal which were specified in that notice; and that leave to appeal to this court was secured on the representation that the appellants desired to present a test case to determine the liability to provincial assessment of lands comprised in the land subsidy which had been fully earned, but had not been actually patented \u2014 had the objections which, were withdrawn been pressed they would probably have received scant attention.\nBy deed poll, of the 13th December, 1902, the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company conveyed to the appellants all their estate, right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever, both at law and in equity, in and to the section of land now being dealt with. Giving due weight to the Dominion statute, to the contract between the Government and the railway company, to the company's application for specified lands, to the order-in-council based upon such application and to the deed poll from the railway company to the appellants, I am satisfied that the section of land now in question must be deemed to have been finally and irrevocably allocated and appropriated to the land subsidy of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company. That company having fully earned its subsidy and being entitled ex debito justiti\u0153, upon demand and payment of the sum of ten cents per acre for cost of surveys, etc., to receive a patent of this land, I am of the opinion, that the appellants, as its grantees, acquired an interest in it, which, subject to any question arising under section 125 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" might properly be subjected to provincial taxation.\nBy section 125 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" it is enacted that\nno land or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation.\nAssuming that beneficial interests held by subjects in lands, the legal title to, and also some beneficial interest in which is vested in the Crown in right of a province, should be deemed liable to such taxation as the ordinance of the North-West Territories authorizes, the fact that the Crown title and interest in such lands is held in right of the Dominion does not, in my opinion, render taxation of the interest of the subject-owner obnoxious to section 125 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\"\nThe existence of the legal title and a beneficial interest in the Crown, in right of the Dominion, as mortgagee for a balance of the purchase money of lands acquired by it under special legislation in connection with the winding up of the Bank of Upper Canada and subsequently sold in the liquidation proceedings, was held not to invalidate municipal taxation of the purchaser's beneficial interest, or equity of redemption, and its sale for arrears of such taxes, the title taken by the tax-sale purchaser, however, being declared to be subject to the mortgage held by Her Majesty, and the operation of the treasurer's deed being restricted to passing the estate subject to such mortgage. Regina v. County of Wellington[3]. The trial judge had held the entire sale invalid. The Divisional Court modified his judgment as above stated. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the judgment of the Divisional Court was affirmed[4]. Section 125 of the \"British North America Act\" had been cited in argument (p. 426). A further appeal to this court was dismissed[5]. The judgments in this court and in the Ontario Court of Appeal proceed upon the construction of a clause of the Ontario \"Assessment. Act\" exempting property vested in the Crown. This sufficed for the disposition of the question directly in issue on the appeals, viz., the non-liability to taxation of the Crown interest in the lands. But it seems scarcely probable that, if the view of the Divisional Court, that\nthe interest of the defendant John Anderson in the land was, however, subject to taxation and to be sold for arrears of taxes and the sale and treasurer's deed operated to pass that estate,\nhad not been approved, there would have been no observation upon it by any of the judges in either appellate court. In the Divisional Court, owing to the modification of the judgment at the trial, it was necessary to pass upon the validity of the tax on Ander- son's interest, which was challenged. We have, therefore, the direct authority of the opinion of that most careful and able judge, the late Mr. Justice Street, concurred in by the present learned Chief Justice of the King's Bench of Ontario, that it is within the power of a province to authorize the taxation of the beneficial or equitable interest of a subject in lands of which the Crown in right of the Dominion holds the legal title and in which it has some beneficial interest as well. I think that full effect is given to section 125 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" by holding that it precludes the taxation of whatever interest the Crown holds in any land or property and that so long as such interest subsists, the taxation of any other interest in the land and any sale or other disposition made of it to satisfy unpaid taxes, while valid, is always subject to the rights of the Crown which remain unaffected thereby. Attorney-General of Canada v. City of Montreal[6].\nFinally, I think it reasonably clear that the interest of the appellants in the lands in question is, as a subject of taxation, within the purview of the Consolidated Ordinance of the North-West Territories. By sections 49 and 72 the council is empowered to levy a tax \"upon every owner or occupant in the district for all land owned or occupied by him.\" By sections 57 and 77 the taxes are declared to be\na special lien upon such land having priority over any claim, lien, privilege or incumbrance thereon.\nBy section 85, land in arrear for such taxes, duly returned under section 83, is, upon judicial confirmation of the return, vested in the Crown for the public use of the Territories * * * subject, however, to redemption by the owners respectively of the said lands at any time within one year.\nBy section 2, sub-section 13\n\"owner\" includes any person who has any right, title or estate whatsoever, or any interest other than that of a mere occupant in any land,\nand by section 2, sub-section 18,\n\"land,\" \"lands\" or \"real property\" includes lands, tenements and hereditaments and any estate or interest therein.\nSee Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps[7].\nThe enacting language of section 49, read in the light of the interpretative clauses, is wide enough to embrace such an interest as that of the appellant. The fact that Crown interests are not expressly exempted, as they are in the Ontario Act, probably ex majori cautela, signifies nothing. The general rule that the Crown is not bound unless expressly named would apply: Mersey Dock Trustees v. Cameron[8]; and the exemption under section 125 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" must always be read into any Dominion or provincial taxing Act which does not expressly exclude it. Having regard to the apparent policy of the North-West ordinance to render all available lands and every interest therein subject to assessment (see section 2, sub-sections 13 and 18, and sections 52, 53, 74 and 76), and to the disinclination of the courts to give to exemptions any wider scope than a reasonably strict construction requires, Maxwell on Statutes (4 ed.), pp. 433, 439, I am of the opinion that the interest of the appellants in the land in question is within the purview of that ordinance. It is that interest which is made assessable; it is the same interest which is, by the judicial order confirming the \"return,\" vested in the Crown for the public use of the Territories. I know of no sufficient reason why it should be necessary in a general assessment Act to make special mention of such a private interest in lands more than of any other. Neither can I accede to the view that under the North-West Territories ordinance nothing short of the entire proprietory interest in land was meant to be assessed. Such a construction would involve the exemption of lessees and private occupants under the Crown which, I think it quite clear, was not intended.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 2 Alta.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], which, on an equal division of opinion among the judges, sustained the verdict entered at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nW. A. MacDonald K.C. and Travers Lewis K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The substantial question raised upon this appeal is as to the liability of the Municipality of Vancouver for nonfeasance in neglecting to repair a sidewalk in that city in consequence of which the appellant sustained injuries. The determination of that question must, of course, depend upon the construction of the charter of the city and the intention of the legislature as evidenced in that charter as a whole with regard to the duties and liabilities imposed upon the corporation. The statute or charter here in question, \"Vancouver Incorporation Act,\" B.C. Statutes 1900, ch. 54, sec. 219, expressly imposes upon the city corporation the duty (inter alia) of keeping its highways in repair. It says\nevery such public street, road, square, land, bridge and highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation. It is not contended by the appellant that for a neglect of this statutory duty amounting to a nuisance an indictment would not lie, but that a civil action by an injured person for damages has not been given and will not lie. As I understand the argument it is that, in the absence of clear and express language in the charter making the corporation liable in civil actions for special damages sustained by individuals in consequence of the corporation's breach of duty in failing to keep the streets in repair, no action will lie.\nI am not able to accept that argument. I have examined all the leading cases and authorities cited by the appellant and have reached the conclusion that express language creating civil liability for damages caused by the failure to perform a duty expressly imposed by statute upon a municipal corporation is not necessary. It is sufficient if a legislative intention to create such liability may fairly be inferred from the statute as a whole. If the duty imposed is one transferred from a body or authority on or with whom it previously rested and which body or authority was not itself liable in civil actions for nonfeasance, then very clear, if not express, language would be required to be shewn in the statute imposing this additional liability upon the transferee corporation.\nIn all cases it must, in the last resort, be a question of the intention of the legislature to be gathered from the whole statute. If the duties imposed are discretionary or permissible merely, and not absolute, or if absolute, adequate means are not given to carry them out, then very clear language must be used to found civil liability upon. But where the duty imposed upon a corporation with respect to its streets and highways is absolute in its terms and is created and imposed in the charter calling the corporation into existence accompanied with provisions giving the corporation ample powers to fulfil the duties imposed and is not a duty merely transferred from a pre-existing authority or body in itself not liable for civil damages for neglect of such duty, then it does seem to me the courts may fairly infer a legislative intention to make the corporation liable civilly for neglect of such duty.\nNow, in the statute in question I find everything, in my opinion, necessary to justify the drawing of such an inference. The absolute duty to keep the streets in repair is imposed upon the corporation, provisions are inserted giving adequate means to enable the corporation to discharge its duty. The duty is one created by the statute and not one transferred from any pre-existing body or authority not in itself civilly liable for its neglect. The nature of the duty itself affecting every inhabitant using the streets is one which I cannot imagine the legislature intended should be neglected, with civil immunity from damages, by the corporation and without remedy by one of the public specially damnified.\nUnless, therefore, bound by the decided cases otherwise to determine I would hold the corporation in this case liable. My colleagues, Duff and Anglin J J., have, in their reasons for judgment, collated and reviewed all the more important cases bearing upon the point at issue, including that of Cowley v. Newmarket Local Board[2], decided in the House of Lords, and those decided by the Privy Council of Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert[3]; Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila[4] (in 1890), and Borough of Bathurst v. McPherson[5] (in 1878), and have done it so fully and satisfactorily that I feel it quite unnecessary for me to go over the same ground.\nProperly read, with reference to the facts with which the courts were then dealing, these decisions will not be found at variance with the law as I have endeavoured to state it, though no doubt there are dicta of many distinguished judges which apparently are so. Amongst these are observations of Chief Justice Strong in Campbell v. City of St. John[6], at page 4. These, however, must be held to have reference to the particular facts relating to the charter of the city with which he was there dealing. That charter does not appear to have imposed any absolute duty upon the Municipality of St. John to keep the streets of the city in repair and in the absence of any such provision or of any language from which a liability for civil damages for misfeasance could be implied, the decision in that case cannot be held to be a binding authority, in such a case as we have now before us, where the duty to keep the streets in repair is expressly imposed upon the Municipality of Vancouver.\nIf, however, the controlling distinctions I have mentioned between duties permissive or discretionary and duty absolute, on the one hand, and between newly created duties with powers and authorities annexed to them sufficient for their discharge and duties transferred from pre-existing bodies or authorities not civilly liable for their neglect on the other, are kept in mind, it will serve to explain much that otherwise would seem conflicting and perhaps justify the caution so frequently repeated of late years in the highest courts that language used in delivering reasons for judgments, however broad, must be read and understood with reference only to the facts with which the court was then dealing.\nI concur in dismissing the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014 The appellant is a municipal corporation created by a charter which defines its powers and duties. Amongst such duties is enacted the following provision:\u2014\nEvery public street, road, square, lane, bridge and highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation.\nThe question is raised whether or not an action will lie against the corporation upon this enactment at the suit of any one having suffered damages by reason of the non-observance of the duty thus imposed. It is well, therefore, in order to appreciate the scope of this legislation to observe some other provisions in the charter. Section 125, sub-section 52, gives the corporation wide powers for\nopening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, widening, altering, diverting, stopping up and putting down drains, sewers, watercourses, roads, streets, squares, alleys, lanes or other public communications within the jurisdiction of the council, and for entering upon, breaking up, taking or using, etc.\nThe corporation is empowered, by sub-section 48 of same section, to remove all nuisances, by sub-section 77, to compel removal of snow and remove it, by sub-sections 81 to 97, to regulate in every way the width, grade, mode of construction and use of streets, and by section 185, it is empowered to prevent and abate public nuisances. Section 133 empowers, in a very wide way, the opening, extending and widening of streets, etc. Section 134 empowers the construc- tion of local improvements, including streets, by means of levying a local or frontage rate, and enacts that, when done, the work\nshall thereafter be kept in a good and sufficient state of repair at the expense of the corporation.\nThe corporation is, by section 57, empowered to levy, for all the necessary expenses of the city, up to one-and-one-third cents in the dollar, besides all rates for schools, interest and sinking funds.\nIt is abundantly clear that possessed of such very extensive powers which enable the corporation to limit the extent of street to be constructed and nature of construction in such manner as to keep expenditure within its powers of taxation, there can be no excuse for non-repair.\nIt is evident that the limit of taxation is such as to empower any necessary levy for such purposes. It is equally evident that no other body than the corporation has any power in the premises and that no other power exists having authority to meddle with the subjects of construction or repair of the streets or highways.\nThere does not appear in the charter, so far as I can find, any penalty or special power given in any way to enforce this duty imposed in such absolute terms upon appellant.\nBy reason of defective construction or non-repair, the sidewalk in question, built by appellant two years previous to the accident, had become \"wobbly,\" as one witness expressed it, for some time prior to the accident, though one of the street foremen or superintendents of appellant had occasion to travel over it daily.\nTwo years only having expired since construction, I should be inclined to infer, without much hesitation, that it never had been properly constructed, and the jury may well have so concluded.\nIt is contended, however, that it was the neglect of this duty to repair, that constituted the issue tried in fact, and that, being a mere nonfeasance, no action would lie.\nThe usual great array of authority displayed in cases like this, distinguishing between nonfeasance and misfeasance, has been presented.\nI cannot say that I can reconcile all these cases or indeed that the mass of them deserve any attempt to do so. I do not propose to do so.\nThe first question raised is whether or not, inasmuch as this statute gives no special remedy for the neglect of the duty it imposes, the respondent is one of the persons for whose benefit it was enacted; and next, if so: Is he entitled to an action for damages resulting from the neglect of such duty ?\nCommon sense would say there ought not to be any difficulty in such questions as are thus presented. But the development of our English law has proceeded in such a way that these questions are by no means free from difficulty. One is not surprised, therefore, to find the division of opinion in the court below.\nIn Couch v. Steel[7], Lord Campbell, at page 411, said:\u2014\nThe general rule is that \"where a man has a temporal loss or damage by the wrong of another, he may have an action on the case to be repaired in damages;\" (Com. Dig., \"Action on the Case,\" [A]). The Statute of Westminster, 2 (1 Stat. 13 Edw. 1), ch. 50, gives a remedy by action on the case to all who are aggrieved by the neglect of any duty created by statute. See 2 Inst. 486. And in Com. Dig., \"Action upon Statute\" (F), it is laid down that \"in every case where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of a wrong done to him contrary to the said law.\"\nOne cannot help wishing that this statement of the law had remained unchallenged. But it has not, and the only guide now left seems to be that laid down by Lord Cairns in Atkinson v. Newcastle Waterworks Co.[8], at page 448, adopted by the Court of Appeal in Groves v. Wimborne[9]. We must look, we are told, at\nthe general scope of the Act and the nature of the statutory duty.\nIt may be said that this was merely spoken of the difficulties arising from there being in the statute a special remedy such as penalty or other like provision. I agree that is so. But I observe that is just the feature of the judgment in Couch v. Steel[10], that was challenged, and it has been said such has been the challenge that it no longer stands as an authority.\nI am not prepared to assent to that in the sense that in every case or way the law was incorrectly laid down. I think no one can challenge the law as stated there, provided the statute to which it is applied is of the character that applying Lord Cairn's rule or suggestions to it one can found an action thereon.\nBut I go further and say that Lord Cairn's suggestions may well be applied to ascertain if we can found an action in a given case upon a given statute.\nNow I, using such test, come back to the point of difficulty in the law as to this statute.\nCan it be said that the persons it was to benefit are those who have to travel over the roads it binds appellant to repair ? I have come to the conclusion they are, notwithstanding the innumerable dicta to which appeal may be made in a contrary sense. Although such a wealth of dicta exists, there is, I venture to say, no decided authority to the contrary construing such an imperative and direct statute as this freed from entanglement such as existed in those giving rise to said dicta.\nWe have, moreover, the principle that must govern applied to the decision of analogous cases in such a way that I see no difficulty in the existence of such weighty dicta.\nBefore passing to the consideration of these cases, I must notice the argument for appellant founded upon numerous English cases, decided upon a variety of English statutes, designed to secure due repair of highways.\nI have referred to every one of the cases cited by counsel and numerous others, and, where analyzed and the grounds of the reasons given traced, we find the history to be this, or nearly this.\nBeginning with Russell v. The Men of Devon[11] we find the law to be that no action would lie at common law against the inhabitants; not, as sometimes said, because unincorporated, but because the only remedy recognized by law was the indictment.\nAs surveyors of highways, or other like authority, were appointed, or corporations created in substitution for other parochial authority, they were one and all found not liable to be sued for damages, though they might have neglected the duty of repair more or less directly cast upon them by statute. But why so ? Simply because the statute which imposed the duty of repair sometimes limited the resources given to pay for repair, sometimes permitted a discretion or exercise of some judgment, as limit of duty, sometimes merely gave the power without imposing duty, sometimes expressly defined the limit of liability to be that of the inhabitants and when transferred to counties or other corporate bodies had been defined to be that of its predecessor in duty; and when traced out their respective duties were bounded thus by the common law liability of the inhabitants.\nSometimes, as in the case of Maguire v. Corporation of Liverpool[12], with that city's peculiar and diverse origins of corporate source of existence and responsibility; and the case of Cowley v. Newmarket Local Board[13], by reason of the \"Public Health Act, 1875,\" having reached a state of development of municipal statute law that appeared to bear more directly on the corporate authority and responsibility, the courts were slightly troubled to reconcile the enactment of duties with this mode of construction.\nBut, I repeat, these and all such cases, however admittedly interesting and instructive as a study of the history of the law and its method of growth in England, are all beside the question raised here.\nOf course, we find the adoption, as in the last named case, of the rule I have referred to as that given by Lord Cairns, to consider the scope and purview of the statute.\nThe English cases, so far as bearing directly upon highways, being thus disposed of, we have Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert[14], pressed upon us; as arising in this country. But it turns upon the same kind of history with a difference in names though identical in principle and result with these English cases. The Orfila Case[15] is only another variation of the application of the same principles. Nor can I read Municipal Council of Sydney v. Bourke[16] as at all helpful when I pay heed to the reasons given, founded upon a construction of a statute that leaves it very unlike this simple, yet comprehensive and imperative, statute before us, freed from what I, for want of a better expression, have called entanglements, so apparent in the other statutes (giving rise to like inquiries), and their history and expression.\nHartnall v. Ryde Commissioners[17] is a very notable case. It gave the courts a great deal of trouble to fritter it away. But that it seemed good law to Willes J. in the case of Parsons v. Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green[18], where it was by him merely distinguished from others, by reason of the slight difference in the statute on which it rested, entitles it to respectful consideration.\nOur statute is still more advanced, if I may say so, and I will cherish the belief that if he had to interpret it he would have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that it can, without disastrous results, be interpreted as it has been below.\nI am the more encouraged to this by finding that it was Blackburn J., who with Crompton J. constituted the court that decided the Hartnall Case[19].\nIt is on great authority, that of Blackburn J., and the principle he laid down for the construction of such a statute in the case of The Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[20], at page 104, where he laid down the law to the effect that in every case the liability of a body created by a statute must be determined upon a true interpretation of the statutes under which it is created,\nthat the Chief Justice in the court below proceeded, and in which Mr. Justice Galliher concurred.\nIn this rule, Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in the case of Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila[21], concurred. That was a case arising out of an accidental falling of an overhanging road, for which it was claimed those in charge were liable.\nWe have thus, I say, Blackburn J., whose rule of construction is thus adopted, holding with Crompton J. the corporate body liable for damages arising from non-repair, as a proper construction of a statute, much less directly leading to liability than this one now in question; for there was in the statute in question an entirely different remedy given by way of indictment, and no right of civil action expressly given. We find that countenanced, as set forth above, by so great a lawyer as Willes J.\nIn this case the statute itself is not cumbered with any such statutory remedy as there, to raise doubts of the statute's meaning in this regard. We find in the Mersey Docks Case[22], the House of Lords adopting and applying the rule laid down by Blackburn J. when applied under a statute no wider and no narrower than this now in question.\nSurely under such authority and in the absence of express binding authority the interpretation put upon this Act was correct.\nI desire, however, to call attention to a case that to my mind is an express decision of the Court of Appeal in England, upon a similar statute relative to sewers involving also and only the question of omission instead of commission. I refer to the case of Baron v. Portslade Urban Council[23], upon section 19 of the \"Public Health Act, 1875,\" which reads as follows:\u2014\n19. Every local authority shall cause the sewers belonging to them to be constructed, covered, ventilated and kept so as not to be a nuisance or injurious to health, and to be properly cleansed and emptied.\nThe action was brought because by reason of this duty having been neglected, damages were suffered and they were assessed at \u00a375.\nThe nonfeasance rule was invoked in argument, but ignored in the judgment which was delivered by Lord Halsbury, concurred in by A. L. Smith and Vaughan Williams L.JJ. and the appeal dismissed.\nIt was also urged there that section 299 of that Act had furnished a remedy and thus precluded the action from lying on the statute.\nI submit the principle upon which the appellate court proceeded is applicable here, unless we can discover something in principle different in statutes dealing with highways from those dealing with sewers, or I may add, docks, in founding an action by those compelled to suffer from omission of duty relative to either one or the other on occasions where the public body, bound to a duty by statute, have neglected their duty.\nThe sooner the distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance as applicable to actions on a statute of which the plain language indicates it can be as grossly violated by an omission to do something, as by doing a wrongful act forbidden by it, is discarded, the better. And I would do it without resorting to metaphysical subleties the ordinary mind cannot follow easily.\nThe distinction can and does find a proper field of operation in some statutes, but not in this class, so far as I can see.\nI have, out of respect to counsel, considered the St. John and Montreal cases decided by this court, but must say there is nothing decided there binding us here.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The plaintiff while walking on a sidewalk, constructed by the Corporation of the City of Vancouver on a public highway within the municipal boundaries, tripped over a loose plank and in consequence suffered serious personal injuries. It was left to the jury by the learned trial judge to say whether or not the state of the highway was due to the negligent failure of the municipality to keep the sidewalk in repair and whether the condition of the sidewalk was the cause of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff; and these questions they decided against the corporation.\nThe statute in which the corporate powers and duties of the municipality (1900 B.C., ch. 54), are declared, imposes upon the municipality the duty of keeping highways in repair; and the controversy on this appeal turns upon the question whether this enactment confers a right to reparation upon an individual suffering a personal injury in such circumstances as those giving rise to this action, or whether, on the other hand, the enactment is, as the appellant municipality contends, declarative of a right which is only capable of being vindicated in proceedings instituted in the public behalf.\nIt is not denied, of course, in form, that this is a question which must ultimately turn upon the view one takes concerning the intention of the legislature as ascertained from the statute. The controversy is rather as to the effect of certain decisions (and certain dicta of very eminent judges) touching the responsibility of municipal corporations deriving their powers from other statutes passed by other legislatures in respect of negligent default in the matter of the repair of highways and as to the degree in which those decisions and dicta ought to be considered as regulating the construction of the special statute by which the appellant corporation is governed.\nIt is a general rule that where a duty rests upon an individual or a corporation of such a character that an indictment would lie for default in performing it, an action also will lie at the suit of a person who by reason of such default suffers some peculiar harm beyond the rest of His Majesty's subjects: Mayor of Lyme Regis v. Henley[24]; Sutton v. Johnstone[25]; Ferguson v. The Earl of Kinnoull[26]; McKinnon v. Penson[27]; Hartnall v. Ryde Commissioners[28]; Coe v. Wise[29]; Maguire v. Liverpool Corporation[30]. Where, nevertheless, the duty arises out of statute the rule cannot be thus absolutely stated. The Statute of Westminster (1 Stat. W. 13 Edw. I.), ch. 50, does indeed profess in terms to give a remedy by action on the case to all who are aggrieved by the neglect of any duty created by Act of Parliament. The effect of this statute, however, as stated in Comyn's Digest (\"Action upon Statute\" (F), is that\nin every case where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage or for the recompense of a wrong done to him contrary to the law.\nObviously, this leaves it to be determined in each case whether the alleged duty has or has not been created \"for the benefit\" of the person aggrieved; which, of course (if the duty be a public duty), is only another way of stating the question whether the enactment does or does not evince an intention on part of the legislature that a private remedy by action shall be available to a person suffering a special injury from the wrongful omission to observe its provisions.\nThere was at one time a disposition on the part of some very eminent judges to hold that public bodies charged with duties to be performed by them as trustees on behalf of, or for the benefit of the public, were not, in their trust or corporate character, answerable for the negligent acts or defaults of their servants; on the principle\u2014 which has been broadly applied in the United States in such cases\u2014that such bodies, in discharging their public duties, act as agents or instrumentalities of government, and as such are not answerable for the torts of their servants. See the speech of Lord Wensleydale in The Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[31], at pages 124, 125; and Lord Cottenham's judgment in Duncan v. Findlater[32]. This view concerning the responsibility of municipal and other bodies for negligence or default in the performance of the public duties imposed by statute was definitely rejected in a series of cases which culminated in the decision of the House of Lords in The Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[33]. There Lord Blackburn (then Blackburn J.) delivering the unanimous opinion of the judges, while adopting (p. 118) Lord Campbell's observation in the Southampton and Itchin Floating Bridge and Roads Co. v. Local Board of Health of Southampton[34], that\nin every case the liability of a body created by statute must be determined upon a true interpretation of the statute under which it is created,\nstated the proper rule of construction to be this:\u2014\nin the absence of something to shew a contrary intention, the legislature intends that the body, the creature of statute, shall have the same duties and its funds shall be rendered subject to the same liabilities as the general law would impose upon a private person doing the same things.\nThe canon of construction thus enunciated met with the approval of the House of Lords; and it is from the standpoint here indicated that, since the date of that decision, the courts have examined claims preferred against municipal bodies created by modern statutes and based upon an alleged violation of duties said to arise out of the provisions of such statutes. The question in each case is, of course, as already mentioned, in the last resort a question of the intention of the legislature to be collected from the enactment as a whole interpreted in the light of such circumstances as may properly be considered, and according to the canons of construction properly applicable. There are, however, I think, some well ascer- tained principles upon which the courts have acted in such cases. It might be stated broadly, I think, with the support of the great weight of authority, that the breach (by way of omission or nonfeasance) by a municipal body of a legal duty created by statute, gives rise to an action at the suit of an aggrieved individual where, (a) the default is of such a character as to be indictable, (b) the grievance suffered involves damages peculiar to the individual, (c) the damage suffered is within the mischief contemplated by the statute, and (d) where there is no specific provision excluding the remedy of action and the provisions of the statute as a whole, taken by themselves or read in the light of the history of the legislation, do not justify an inference that the legislature intended to exclude that remedy. In other words, I think the effect of the actual decisions is that where there is a legal duty having attached to it the sanction of indictment which has been created by statute and conditions (b) and (c) are present, then in general it rests with those who deny the remedy by action to point to something in the statute itself or in the circumstances in which it was passed indicating an intention to exclude the remedy. I think that is established by a series of decisions of high authority; but there are dicta of very eminent judges (I shall be obliged to refer to them more particularly) which appear to conflict with this proposition and it will be sufficient to take a narrower ground, which is quite broad enough for the purposes of this case, and is, I conceive, demonstrably conformable both to the authorities and to most of the dicta referred to. The ground upon which I think the liability of the corporation may be put consistently with every relevant decision and with almost if not quite all the dicta I have seen, is this: where a municipal corporation acting under powers conferred by the statute creating it, constructs a work for use of the public, and invites the public to use it, the corporation having the ownership of and full authority to control the work, and to regulate the use of it by the public; and the statute creating the corporation in express terms imposes upon it the legal duty and at the same time gives it full authority to take all the necessary measures to prevent that work becoming a danger to the public making use of it in the exercise of their right, and owing to the unreasonable neglect of the corporation to perform this duty the work does become a public nuisance, then, in order to resist successfully a claim for reparation by one of the public who has suffered a personal injury in consequence of the existence of the nuisance, (while properly using the work in the exercise of the public right,) the corporation must shew something in the statute indicating an intention on the part of the legislature that the remedy by action shall not be available in such circumstances.\nThere is a large number of authorities in support of the proposition that as a general rule a municipal corporation is, apart from express enactment, under a legal obligation to make such arrangements as may be necessary to prevent the works which are under its care becoming a nuisance, and that, prim\u00e2 facie, persons suffering a special injury from the failure of the corporation to fulfil this obligation, have a right of action against it: Re Islington Market Bill(1), at page 519; White v. Hindley Local Board(2); Blakemore v. Vestry of Mile End Old Town[35]; Corporation Bathurst v. McPherson[36]. We are, however, dealing with a case where the duty is created by express statutory enactment and as that relieves us from some of the difficulties which, in point of interpretation, have sometimes presented themselves, it will, perhaps, tend to simplify matters if we limit our attention to cases of a similar nature. In Coe v. Wise[37], the Court of Queen's Bench and the Exchequer Chamber had to consider the responsibility of drainage commissioners who had Parliamentary authority to make a cut and sluice and were required expressly by the statute from which they derived that authority to maintain the works when made. In the Court of Queen's Bench, Blackburn J., after quoting the section in which this duty was declared, said, at pp. 464 and 465:\u2014\nNothing has been pointed out in the argument, and I have not myself discovered anything to qualify this enactment, which certainly seems to me to cast upon the Drainage Commissioners the duty to maintain this sluice. The common law gives a right of action against those neglecting a duty cast upon them to those who, in consequence sustain damage. I entirely assent to the position that if the Legislature have shewn an intention to prohibit this right of action in the present case that will effectually prevent it, and I agree that such an intention need not be shewn in express words if it can be collected from the whole Act, but I think that the onus lies on the defendants to shew that it was intended to prevent the right of action, and not on the plaintiff to shew that it was intended to give it.\nThe majority of the judges in the Court of Queen's Bench having taken the view that there was no right of action, their decision was reversed in the Exchequer Chamber where it was held, following Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[38], that the action lay; and in delivering judgment the court (Erle C.J., Willes J. and Channell and Pigott BB.) after referring to that authority said, at page 720:\u2014\nAnd we further hold that the action is maintained for the reasons stated by Blackburn J. in this case in the court below.\nIn Meek v. The Whitechapel Board of Works[39], Lord Penzance, then Wilde B., held the defendants answerable in an action for a nuisance arising from their neglect of their statutory duty (sections 68 and 69 \"Metropolis Local Management Act\") to cause the sewers within their district to be kept clean. In Baron v. Portslade Urban Council[40], the Court of Appeal had to consider section 19 of the \"Public Health Act of 1875,\" which required the local authority in whom sewers should be vested to maintain them so that they should\nnot be a nuisance and to see that they are properly cleaned and emptied (p. 591).\nThe council was held liable to an action at the suit of a person specially damnified by a nuisance arising from neglect of this duty. In none of these cases was there anything in the enactment pointing to the intention to give a right of action beyond the provision creating the duty; and in each case reparation was awarded to a member of the public suffering special injury from a mischief which was one of the character the legislature intended to prevent, and which, of course, was attributable to neglect of the duty prescribed. In Maguire v. Liverpool Corporation[41], at page 782, Vaughan Williams L.J. said:\u2014 Are we to treat the liability which is imposed upon the corporation as a liability coming within the rule, where statutory duties are laid upon public bodies by statute, that in the case of any one suffering damage by reason of the neglect of such public body to perform the duties which are thrown upon it by the statute, an action will lie by the individual member of the public who sustains particular injury by reason of that neglect of duty.\nThe appellant corporation does not dispute the authority of these decisions or controvert the reasoning of Lord Blackburn in Coe v. Wise[42], at all events in so far as that reasoning applies generally to the responsibility of a public body for a nonfeasance giving rise physically to such a state of things as constitutes an indictable nuisance. The contention upon which the appeal is founded, as I have already indicated, is this: that according to the settled law of England the duty of maintaining a highway in a state of repair, where it is cast upon a municipal body, is (as regards the legal sanctions attached to it,) sui generis, and the fact that such a duty is imposed expressly or impliedly by an Act of Parliament does not, ipso jure, give a remedy by action for failure to perform that duty and, moreover, is not, in itself, to be taken to indicate an intention on the part of the legislature that the remedy by action shall be available, and that such remedy is not available unless the legislature has in some other way clearly indicated an intention that it should be so. It is, of course, contended that no such intention can properly be implied from the provisions of the Act we have to consider. Before referring to the authorities upon which this contention rests it will be convenient to note broadly the character of the powers conferred upon the corporation of Vancouver touching the management and control of streets. The highways in the municipality are (section 217) vested in the corporation; and by the same section it is provided that these highways \"shall not be interfered with\" without the permission of the city engineer in writing. The council of the municipality, under section 125, has very full powers over highways and the public rights in respect of them. It may pass by-laws\u2014, by sub-section 52, for\nopening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, widening, altering, diverting, stopping up * * * roads * * * and other public communications;\nby sub-section 82,\nTo regulate the width of new streets and roads, and for preventing the laying out or construction of streets and lanes unless in conformity with existing streets, etc., without the consent of the council first obtained;\nfor regulating plans level with surface inclination and material of the pavement, roadway, sidewalk of streets and roads (sub-section 83); for regulating roads, streets, bridges and driving and riding thereon (sub-section 84); for dealing with nuisances, including\nany structure or erection of any kind whatsoever * * * or any other matter or thing in or upon any * * * street or road.\nAnd finally, by section 219:\u2014\nEvery * * * public street, road, square, land bridge and highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation.\nThe decisions on which the appellants mainly rely are Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert[43], and Municipal Council of Sidney v. Bourke[44]; Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila[45], in the Privy Council, Cowley v. Newmarket Local Board[46], in the House of Lords, and Campbell v. City of St. John[47], and City of Montreal v. Mulcair[48]. Of these decisions the first in order of time is Cowley v. The Newmarket Local Board[49]. That decision turned upon the effect of sections 144 and 149 of the \"Public Health Act,\" which declared that the urban authority should have and be subject to all the powers, duties and liabilities of surveyors of highways, and should from time to time level, alter and repair the highways as occasion should require. It was held that an action could not be maintained by a person who in passing along a highway was injured by reason of its dangerous condition due to the negligent default of the Board to keep it in repair. The actual ground of the decision is thus stated by Lord Herschell (who took part in it) in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Municipal Council of Sydney v. Bourke[50], at pages 443 and 444:\u2014\nIn a series of cases ending with Cowley v. Newmarket Local Board[51], in which it has been held that an action would lie for non-repair of a highway the duty to repair was unquestionable, and it was equally clear that those guilty of a breach of this duty rendered themselves liable to penal proceedings by indictment or otherwise; the only question in controversy was whether an action could be maintained. The ground upon which it was held that it could not\u2014even where the duty of keeping the roads in repair had been in express terms imposed by statute on a corporate body\u2014was, that it had long been settled that though a duty to repair rested on the inhabitants subjecting them to indictment in case of its breach, they could not be sued, and that there was nothing to shew that the legislature in transferring the duty to a corporate body had intended to change the nature or extent of their liability.\nIn Maguire v. The Corporation of Liverpool[52], in applying the decision in Cowley v. The Newmarket Local Board[53], Vaughan Williams L.J. thus discusses it at pages 784 and 785:\u2014\nThat statutory obligation having been created, how is it that by the decision in Cowley v. Newmarket Local Board[54], escape is made from the general proposition that where a statutory duty is created of such a nature that indictment would lie, or a remedy by criminal law be good for neglect to perform the statutory duty, an action will lie at the suit of a subject sustaining particular injury \u2014 I say, how is it that that undoubted general principle is escaped from in the decision in Cowley v. Newmarket Local Board[55] ? According to my understanding of the judgments, both of Lord Halsbury and Lord Herschell, it is really escaped from by going back to what is the liability which is thrown upon the inhabitants of the parish in respect of liability to repair roads, and the limitation of procedure for neglect to perform that duty to procedure by the Crown. I arrive at the conclusion that this Act of 1846 was really mainly passed for purposes of convenience of remedy, and convenience of performing the duties in respect of a large aggregate of houses and streets such as one finds in the case of the Town of Liverpool. The object of the legislation merely being that sort of convenience, the object of the Act is that and that alone. It was not intended to alter the liability of those upon whom for convenience the carrying out of this work was thrown, but to leave it exactly as it was in cases where the obligation to repair was thrown upon the inhabitants of the parish.\nAt page 787, he states the principle to be deduced from this and other cases following it in these words:\nI think that, having regard to the legislation that has taken place and to the various decisions which have been given, we ought, in construing this Act of Parliament; to start with a prim\u00e2 facie presumption that in the transfer of the common law obligation to repair lying upon the inhabitants of the parish at large and on other bodies for the purpose of the public conyenience, prim\u00e2 facie it must be assumed that the legislature did not by such a transfer intend to impose any greater duty or any greater obligation upon the persons or bodies to whom the obligation, was transferred than that which would have existed before the transfer.\nTo the same effect is the judgment of Romer L.J., at page 790:\u2014\nFurthermore, I think that certain other principles are now established with reference to the Acts of Parliament which create new bodies, with duties and obligations cast upon them to do the repairs of highways in lieu of the inhabitants of the parish. Modern authorities shew that the question whether in such cases the liability to an action for damages for non-repair is thrown upon the new body created by the Act of Parliament such as I have mentioned, and such as those of 1830 and 1846 in the present case, is one to be gathered from the wording of the special Act. And it was pointed out in the case of Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert[56], at page 527, by Lord Hobhouse, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council in that case, that \"it must now be taken as settled law that a transfer to a public corporation of the obligation to repair does not of itself render such corporation liable to an action in respect of mere nonfeasance. In order to establish such liability it must be shewn that the legislature has used language indicating an intention that this liability shall be imposed.\" I need not go through these modern authorities in detail. I think the result of them, and in particular of the case of Cowley v. Newmarket Local Board[57], is accurately summed up by Mathew J., as he then was, in the case of Saunders v. Holborn District Board of Works[58], at page 68, where he says: \"The result of these decisions is plain \u2014 it is that in order to establish that a public body of this description is liable to an action for default in performing a duty imposed by statute it must be shewn that the legislature has used language indicating an intention that this liability shall be imposed, and unless such an intention on the part of the legislature is clearly disclosed, no action will lie.\" As I have said, those observations appear to me to accurately sum up the authorities, treating the observations of Mathew J. as being confined, as I think they were intended to be, to the question of the construction of such Acts of Parliament as those that I have been referring to.\nIt is obvious that the decisions in Cowley v. The Newmarket Local Board[59], and cognate cases, are regarded by these learned judges as creating an exception to the general rule and it is quite plain that the Corporation of Vancouver cannot claim exemption from the operation of that rule upon any such, grounds as those upon which these decisions rest. Vancouver was incorporated by an Act of the legislature in 1886 (49 Vict. ch. 32 [B.C.]), and sections 217 and 218 of the present Act are reproductions of sections 213 and 214 of that Act. It is clear enough that, at the pass- ing of the Act of 1886, the locality affected by it was not within the limits of an incorporated municipality, as the Chief Justice states in the court below. Mr. Lewis directed our attention to the preamble of the Act; but I do not understand it to be suggested that the Town of Granville there referred to was an incorporated municipality. The inference from the form of the preamble itself would be that it was not; and if there were any foundation for such a suggestion it would unquestionably have been put forward in the court below and we should have been furnished with positive information on the point.\nThere can, I think, be little doubt that the common law rule under which the inhabitants of parishes through which highways passed were responsible for their repair was never introduced into British Columbia. By proclamation of Governor Douglas, on the 19th November, 1858, issued under the authority of an order-in-council of 2nd February, 1858, passed pursuant to chapter 99 of 21 & 22 Vict., it was ordained that \"the civil laws of England as the same existed\" on the 19th November, 1858,\nand so far as the same are not from local circumstances inapplicable to the Colony of British Columbia are and will remain in full force in the colony till such time as they shall be altered\naccording to law. The local circumstances of the colony are pictured in the published correspondence between the Colonial Office and Governor Douglas in the years 1858 (the year in which the colony was established) to 1861, which correspondence has been a good deal considered in the last few years in the course of judicial proceedings in British Columbia. The colony owed its establishment to the influx of population due to the discovery of gold in the interior; and the correspondence makes it clear that one important duty of the detachment of engineers which was early sent out, under the command of Colonel Moody, was the construction of roads and trails. The Government \u2014 of necessity \u2014 assumed the maintenance of these highways. The same necessity, (arising partly out of the physical character of the country and partly out of the fact that great stretches of uninhabited territory had to be traversed in passing from one settlement or centre of population to another,) explains the fact that down to the present time the duty of constructing and maintaining roads and other highways outside the limits of municipalities has always been assumed and carried out by the Government of the colony or that of the province. The common law rule has never been acted upon and was, in 1858, and still is, \"from local circumstances inapplicable.\" There is, therefore, no presumption arising from the state of affairs at the passing of the Act which can bring this case within the reasoning upon which the decision in Cowley v. The Newmarket Local Board[60] proceeded. Lord Herschell suggested, in his judgment in that case, that there was another ground upon which the decision might stand, and that suggestion it is hardly necessary to say requires the most careful consideration. I will return to it after discussing the other decisions upon which the counsel for the corporation more particularly rely. The next in order of date is Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert[61]. The statute under consideration in that case was the \"County Incorporation Act,\" a statute of the Province of Nova Scotia, passed in 1879. Lord Hobhouse in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council points out first that the common law of Nova Scotia was the same as that of England in imposing upon the inhabitants the legal duty of maintaining highways while not subjecting them to liability in an action for non-observance of that duty. Of the statute in question he observes (page 529) :\u2014\nThe first observation that occurs on these provisions of law is, that under the Act of 1761, the liability to maintain road and bridges lay upon the inhabitants, and that this liability is preserved by the \"County Incorporation Act,\" which contemplates the enforcement of statute and highway labour.\nIt is to be observed further that the statute does not in terms impose any obligation upon the municipality to repair the roads or bridges. It confers upon the council powers and authorities which extend to those objects; but the powers and authorities are conferred in precisely the same terms with reference to objects with regard to which the powers clearly must be discretionary and not matters of obligation.\nThese observations (which seem to give the gist of the decision) have no application to the statute before us. In Municipal Council of Sydney v. Bourke[62] the statute which the Privy Council had to examine contained no provision expressly imposing upon the municipal authority the duty to keep the highway in repair; and the effect of Lord Herschell's judgment is that that authority was charged with no duty in respect of such repair which the courts could take cognizance of. This is manifest from two paragraphs, on page 439 of the report, which I quote:\u2014\nAttention has already been directed to the fact that the provisions of section 82 of the 43 Vict., relating to the maintenance of highways, are empowering only, and do not purport to impose a duty. The terms of the section make it manifest that this was the intention of the legislature. The council have conferred on them in a single sentence power to alter, widen, divert, and improve public ways, as well as to \"maintain and order\" them. It is obvious that the alteration, widening, diversion or improvement are matters left absolutely to the discretion and judgment of the council, and that there is no binding obligation enforceable by law to do any of these things. It is impossible to hold that whilst as to these matters a power only is conferred and no obligation imposed, the case is different as regards the maintenance of the highways.\nThere is no doubt, in a certain sense, a duty incumbent on the council to see to the maintenance of the highways. It is for them to exercise the powers conferred upon them by law for the benefit of the community. In these matters they represent the citizens, and ought to have regard to their interests. For their discharge of these duties they are responsible to those whom they represent. The members of the council are the choice of the citizens, and if they do not use their powers well they can be displaced. But if they fail to maintain in good repair the highways of the city, it is not a matter of which the courts can take cognizance, or which can be the foundation of an action if any citizen should be thereby aggrieved.\nHere again it is obvious that the reasoning of the Judicial Committee cannot be resorted to as governing the determination of the question before us.\nLastly, the ratio of the decision of the Privy Council in Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila[63], in so far as it affects the question under discussion is stated, at pages 412 and 413 of the report, in the following passage of Lord Watson's judgment:\u2014\nThe only duty laid upon them with respect to retaining walls is to maintain and repair them for the safety of passengers and ordinary traffic. And, lastly, it is expressly provided that, in executing the order, they must conform to any rules and regulations which the Governor may think fit to make.\nTheir Lordships are, in that state of the facts, unable to resist the conclusion that the Government, in so far as regards the maintenance of retaining walls belonging to it remains in reality the principal, the commissioners being merely a body through whom its administration may be conveniently carried on. They do not think that it was the intention of the Crown, in giving the sanitary body administrative powers subject to the control of the Governor, to impose upon it any liability, which did not exist before, in respect of original defects in the structure of the retaining wall which supported the Castle Road.\nIt is not argued that the Corporation of Vancouver can. escape on the ground thus stated; and it is plain that the actual decision cannot afford any support to the appellant's contention. Some stress is laid, however, upon Lord Watson's language at page 411 in the following sentence:\u2014\nBut in the case of mere nonfeasance no claim for reparation will lie except at the instance of a person who can shew that the statute or ordinance under which they act imposed upon the commissioners a duty toward himself which they negligently failed to perform.\nIt is impossible to contend that by this language Lord Watson meant to convey that \"the duty towards himself\" must be declared in express words; the remainder of the passage, in which he quotes Lord Blackburn's canon in The Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[64] as authoritative, shews that he intended to express no such idea. The passage means, I think, nothing more than this, that an intention to impute such a duty must be discoverable in the statute. I am not overlooking Mr. Macdonald's reference to the passage in the judgment of Matthew J., in Saunders v. Holborn District Board of Works[65], at page 68. The observations on which Mr. Macdonald relies must be taken, I think, to be confined as Romer L.J. points out in Maguire v. Corporation of Liverpool[66], at page 790, to Acts of Parliament such as those under discussion : viz., Acts which create new bodies with duties cast upon them to repair highways in lieu of the inhabitants of the parish.\nIt remains to consider the observations of Lord Herschell in Cowley v. Newmarket Local Board[67], at page 352, in which he suggests that the case falls within the scope of a remark of James L.J. in Glossop v. Heston and Isleworth Local Board[68]. With the greatest possible respect for even a passing suggestion of Lord Herschell, I am constrained to think that there is no parallel between the statutory duty to provide a sufficient number of sewers for a given district, imposed by section 15 of the \"Public Health Act\" (which was the case to which the attention of James L.J. was directed), and a statutory duty to keep a highway, or if you like, an existing system of sewers, from becoming a nuisance. The first may to so great a degree rest in the discretion of the authority charged with it, that it would be difficult for a court of law to take cognizance of it at all; and in fact, since the decision in Cowley v. Newmarket Board[69], it has been held that the sole remedy for non-performance of the duty imposed by the enactment in question was provided by the enactment itself and was an appeal to the Local Government Board. The difference between the two classes of cases was pointed out by Kennedy L.J., in Dawson v. Bingley Urban District Council[70], at page 311; and earlier, by Lord Halsbury, in Baron v. Portslade Urban District Council[71], at page 590, in these words:\u2014\nThere seems to be a wide difference between the obligation or duty to construct a new system of drainage and the obligation on the local authority to use sewers that are vested in them in a proper and reasonable manner.\nThat observation appears to indicate the distinction between the case referred to by Lord Herschell and the present case.\nThe statute which this court had before it, in Campbell v. City of St. John[72], contained no pro- vision expressly imposing any duty upon the municipality in respect of repair of highways, and, having regard to the passages already quoted from Lord Herschell's judgment in Sydney v. Bourke[73], it is doubtful whether any duty, the breach of which could be the subject of an indictment, could be held to be implied. A decision that such a statute does not give a right of action for a special injury arising from non-repair, cannot, I think, properly be held to be conclusive of the interpretation to be placed upon a provision in another statute expressly imposing such a duty.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should fail.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The question which confronts us in this case is whether the corporation of the City of Vancouver, which is required by a mandatory provision of its statutory charter to keep in repair highways within its limits, is or is not liable to pay damages at the suit of a person injured while lawfully using one of such highways owing to its being in a state of disrepair.\nAlthough there was some evidence upon which this case might have been presented as one of misfeasance \u2014 defective original construction \u2014 that aspect of it was not submitted to the jury by the learned trial judge. No exception was taken to his charge on this, or any other ground. In the provincial Court of Appeal the case was apparently treated by all the judges as purely one of nonfeasance, two of them expressing the opinion that the question of misfeasance was not open to the plaintiff. Under these circumstances the respondent should not be allowed now to invoke the ground of misfeasance in support of his judgment.\nIf it were necessary in an action based on non-fulfilment of a statutory duty to make out a case of actual or imputed notice of the existence of conditions amounting to a breach sufficient to sustain a charge of negligence, the judgment for the plaintiff could not, I think, be successfully attacked on the ground that evidence of facts warranting an inference of such notice is lacking.\nThe real question, however, presented for our determination is whether the general rule that a person, for whose benefit as an individual, or as a member of a class, a statute is enacted, shall have a personal remedy for a breach of it which causes him injury (per Farwell and Kennedy L.JJ., in Dawson v. Bingley Urban District Council[74], has no application to statutes imposing duties on public bodies representing the public, or whether the application of this rule to these public bodies is excluded only where circumstances exist which shew that Parliament did not intend to impose upon them such a liability. The latter is, in my opinion, the correct view.\nAn analysis of the comparatively numerous English authorities of the class of which Cowley v. The Newmarket Local Board[75], is perhaps the leading example, makes it tolerably clear \u2014 notwithstanding some broader judicial statements, probably made inadvertently, which lend colour to the opposite view \u2014 that the real ground upon which many English municipal bodies charged by statutes with highway repair have been held not liable to travellers for injuries sus- tained by them in consequence of failure to discharge that duty, was that, in enacting the various statutes imposing the obligation of repairing highways on these municipal corporations, Parliament intended merely to transfer to them an existing duty which rested on the inhabitants without changing the nature or the extent of the liability to be incurred upon failure to discharge it : Municipal Council of Sydney v. Bourke[76], at pages 443-444. A recent instance of exemption on this ground of an English municipal corporation from civil liability is furnished by the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Maguire v. Corporation of Liverpool[77]. In many of the English cases the statutes dealt with will, upon examination, be found to be merely empowering or permissive; and several of them have for that reason been held not to impose a duty on the corporation. By other statutes the character and extent of the repairs required to be made is left to the discretion of the municipal body. In Campbell v. City of Saint John[78], there appears not to have been any such statutory duty to repair as we have in this case. In no case that I have found where the statute either in express terms or by necessary implication imposed on the municipal corporation an absolute duty to repair has it been held not civilly liable, unless the duty could be properly regarded as having been merely transferred to it, without change in its nature or incidents, from individuals or another body not subject to civil liability for its non-performance. Upon this ground the application of the general rule above stated has frequently been excluded. No doubt in certain statutes Parlia- ment has otherwise indicated its intention that the imposition of a statutory duty shall not entail civil liability to a person injured in consequence of a breach of it. But in the absence of some sufficient ground enabling the Court to say that the legislature intended to exempt the body upon which a statutory duty is imposed from civil liability to a person, who is within the class for whose benefit such duty was created and who has been injured by its non-fulfilment, the general rule should, in my opinion, be applied and the injured person should be accorded his remedy in damages.\nI find nothing in the statute now before us which suggests that the legislature did not intend that the present defendants should be civilly liable to any lawful traveller who may sustain injury on their highways owing to their having been negligently allowed to be in a state of disrepair; The duty to repair is created in mandatory and imperative language. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the duty thus imposed was transferred to the defendants from any other body \u2014 nothing to shew that there was any pre-existing common law obligation to repair lying upon the inhabitants of the territory incorporated as the City of Vancouver. The learned Chief Justice of the provincial Court of Appeal, speaking no doubt with full knowledge both of the local history of Vancouver and of the municipal legislation, public and private, in British Columbia, says:\nBefore the incorporation of the defendant the locality now included within its limits was not organized, nor was it within the limits of any organized district. The Act, therefore, did not transfer common law powers and liabilities from the inhabitants of a district to an incorporated body, but the powers granted and liabilities imposed were original. In this statement Mr. Justice Galliher concurs. The dissenting judges do not question it. There being nothing in the record to cast the slightest doubt upon it, we would not be justified in assuming it to be in accurate. The statutory duty of the defendants to repair highways should, therefore, be treated as \"original and not transferred.\"\nIn the absence of something to shew a contrary intention, the legislature intends that the body, the creature of the statute, shall have the same duties, and that its funds shall be rendered subject to the same liabilities, as the general law would impose on a private person doing the same thing. Mersey Docks and Harbour v. Gibbs[79]; Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila[80].\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that the defendants were rightly held liable and that their appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

In this case, however, Davies and Idington JJ. contra, the company failed to make such proof.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (23 Ont. L.R. 342) reversed, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nIn the year 1905 the appellant was part owner with one Ostrom of certain interim copyrights for six forms of insurance policies. The Monarch Life As- surance Company advertised that they were the exclusive owners of these forms. On the 7th September, 1905, the Assurance Company not having paid for the said copyrights, the appellant instituted proceedings against the said Ostrom and the Assurance Company claiming an injunction restraining the company from publishing the said advertisements, and the sum of $5,000 damages. This action came on for trial before the Hon. Mr. Justice Clute, and after the case had been partially tried was adjourned to enable the parties to effect a settlement. After considerable negotiations and correspondence it was agreed that Mackenzie should receive twenty-five fully paid up shares of the capital stock of the Monarch Life Assurance Company, and should transfer his interests in the copyrights to Ostrom, the manager of the company, and the action against both parties should be dismissed without costs. This settlement was arranged by Senator J.K. Kerr, apparently acting for the company, and by Mr. D.C. Ross, apparently acting for T. Marshall Ostrom, the managing director of the company. A certificate representing the stock issued under the corporate seal of the company and signed by its proper officers was handed over and the action was dismissed.\nThe company then repudiated the certificate and denied that the plaintiff was the owner of any shares and this action was brought to compel the company to register the plaintiff as owner of the twenty-five shares. The case came on for trial before the Honourable Mr. Justice Riddell at Toronto, who after the conclusion of the evidence, stated that the facts appeared to be as follows:\u2014 1. That Senator J.K. Kerr represented that he was acting for the company.\n2. Every one acted in good faith.\n3. Mr. Wilson, the company\u2019s solicitor, knew the terms of the proposed settlement.\n4. The company received consideration for the shares.\n5. That there was no resolution approving of the settlement of the action or the issue of these shares.\nHis Lordship subsequently dismissed the action upon the ground that the settlement was made with Ostrom acting on his own behalf and that the company were not bound by his actions in so doing. An appeal was taken from the said judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and was dismissed with costs upon the same grounds, the Honourable Mr. Justice Magee dissenting. From this judgment the appellant appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBain K.C. and Gordon for the appellant. The authorized officers having signed the certificates bearing the company\u2019s seal the company is bound by their act. Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vol. 5, page 294. Royal British Bank v. Turquand[2]; In re Land Credit Co. of Ireland[3].\nIn Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated[4] the certificate was not signed by the proper officers, but were forged, and the company were held not liable. The remarks of their Lordships, however, support the position of the appellant in this case. And see also Bloomenthal v. Ford[5]; Duck v. Tower Galvanizing Co.[6]; In re Coasters, Limited[7]; McKain and Canadian Birkbeck Co., in re[8].\nThe onus was on the company to prove facts sufficient to defeat plaintiff\u2019s claim; D\u2019Arcy v. Tamar, Kid Hill and Callington Railway Co.[9]; County of Gloucester Bank v. Ruddy, Merthyr Steam, etc., Colliery Co.[10]; In re Hampshire Land Co.[11]; and they have not done so.\nMatthew Wilson K.C. for the respondents. Ostrom, the managing director, had no shares of his own to transfer to the plaintiff and no authority to issue the certificate. George Whitechurch, Limited v. Cavanagh[12]; Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated[13].\nThe company never, by resolution, by-law or otherwise, authorized the issue of this certificate and cannot, even as a trading corporation, be estopped from denying its validity.

Bank of England[15].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Ontario, in dismissing the appeal in this case to the Appeal Court of Ontario from the judgment of the trial judge, Riddell J., in which reasons Garrow and Maclaren JJ.A. concurred, and also for the reasons stated by Meredith J.A., which substantially agree with those given by the Chief Justice, and to which I do not desire to add anything, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant sues for a declaration that he is the holder of twenty-five fully paid-up shares in respondent company and to have it ordered to register him as such.\nOn the facts set out by the learned trial judge and again more fully by the Chief Justice of Ontario in the Court of Appeal, which are not disputed, it is clear that in law there never was any subscription for such shares, or allotment or other issue thereof by the only authority competent to so direct.\nIt is admitted by the appellant he never paid the company anything nor had any contract with the company which would enable its board of directors to issue paid up stock even if we could assume it competent for the company to so contract.\nHe contends such a bargain is possible and that in course of executing it the managing director and the vice-president of the company would be the proper officers, by force of the Act of Incorporation and the parts of the \u201cCompanies\u2019 Clauses Act\u201d included thereby in such Act, and of the by-laws made thereunder, to issue such certificate as this action is founded upon.\nThe certificate is as follows:\u2014\nThis certifies that Ewan Mackenzie is the owner of twenty-five fully paid-up shares of the capital stock of the Monarch Life Assurance Company (upon which shares $2,500 has been paid, together with $625 on premium), transferrable only on the books of the corporation by the holder thereof in person or by the attorney upon surrender of this certificate properly indorsed and with the consent of the directors.\nIn witness whereof the said corporation has caused this certi- ficate to be signed by its duly authorized officers and to be sealed with the seal of the corporation this 3rd day of May, A.D. 1906.\n(Seal)\nT.H. GRAHAM, T. MARSHALL OSTROM,\nFirst Vice-President. Managing Director.\nHe says this was issued to him under such facts and circumstances as to induce him to rely thereupon and accept it in settlement of an action brought against the man Ostrom, who signed, and the company, and that he so induced, and so relying, consented to the dismissal of his action and therefore the company is estopped from denying the validity of the certificate.\nI will assume that his present action is so constituted that even if there were no shares available either existent or within the power of the company to create to answer his demand, he, if entitled to recover at all, might recover alternatively damages for the failure to do so.\nI desire his claim should be presented in the broadest possible way it can be put, in order to give effect to this alleged estoppel, if it can exist and then examine the facts on which it is alleged to rest. But presently therewith I must also examine the power of the company to issue such shares and consider the bearing thereof on said facts.\nThe action (of which the dismissal is the basis of any right appellant can have herein) was brought to enforce as against Ostrom a contract one Stevenson had made with him to sell some copyrights to him for a large consideration of which shares in the company formed a part, and to have the company restrained from using the copyrights. The one-fourth of the rights acquired by Stevenson, the vendor of said copyrights, had passed to appellant. The purpose of both was to have the company acquire said copyrights. In his statement of claim therein, appellant alleged that the company by virtue of the contract with Ostrom and the latter\u2019s dealings with his company, had used said copyrights but had not implemented the bargain.\nThis was answered by the company denying the allegations, and amongst other things pointing out that it had never become organized and hence such a bargain was in law impossible for provisional directors to make.\nThe company had in fact, up to the trial, never been organized, and its provisional directors clearly had no power to do aught but get shareholders to subscribe upon a basis that could not extend to include as part of the considerations moving to subscription a contract binding it to acquire and use such copyrights, or anything of that nature.\nAs against the company, save possibly the right to enjoin it from using or bargaining for use of such copyrights, the action seemed as hopeless a thing as ever was presented to any court.\nAnd there is no evidence that at any time after said action was entered for trial the company ever did anything that would have touched appellant\u2019s rights in that regard, if he had any.\nThe trial was postponed from February, when first opened, to be taken up some later day if not settled.\nThe company got itself organized on the 21st of March, following this.\nThe appellant must have known from the company\u2019s pleadings and due consideration thereof, that the foundation in law for any bargain of which the fruits were to be shares in the company, did not exist. He must, therefore, when thus put upon inquiry, be held bound to act cautiously and reasonably in relation to any proffered arrangement that implied carrying out what was illegal and improper for this man Ostrom to have attempted. He ought to have realized that before he could reckon upon shares in the company coming through such a channel, he must see that they were duly and regularly issued.\nBut it has been assumed by appellant that even conceding the power of the provisional board doubtful, once the company became organized, it could issue paid-up shares as result of a bargain such as in question. It seemed also to be assumed in appellant\u2019s argument that the directors could make such a bargain and validly issue such shares. It seems to me that is a fundamental error. And as the duty of appellant, and his correlative right to set up an estoppel on the facts, about to be adverted to, must to a certain extent depend upon, or be influenced by, a correct view of the legal position in this regard, of the powers of the company or its board, let us here consider that.\nTo appreciate the appellant\u2019s position and contentions, and especially that dependent upon his claim of estoppel, we must bear in mind that this is not a trading company, but an insurance company, incorporated by an Act of Parliament which embraces in the Act the provisions of the \u201cCompanies\u2019 Act\u201d so far as not excepted in the incorporating Act, but only so far as not inconsistent with the incorporating Act or the \u201cInsurance Act.\u201d\nI think we must also bear in mind the nature of the business to be embarked in, and the policy of the then existent legislation relative to such insurance companies.\nLet us turn to the provisions of the incorporating statute and its auxilliary, the \u201cCompanies\u2019 Act,\u201d and see if there is any warrant for assuming that anything but money can be received for payment of shares in such company.\nThe capital stock was fixed at two million dollars and, by section 4, it was enacted\nso soon as two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of the capital stock of the company have been subscribed and ten per cent. paid, etc.,\na meeting of those\nwho have paid not less than ten per cent. on the account of shares subscribed for by them\nshall elect a board, etc.; and, by section 6,\nthe shares of the capital stock subscribed for shall be paid by instalments, etc.,\nand\nthe company shall not commence the business of insurance until sixty-two thousand five hundred dollars of the capital stock shall have been paid in cash into the funds of the company\nand\nthe amount so paid by any shareholder shall not be less than ten per cent. of the amount subscribed by such shareholder;\nand, by section 7, the increase of capital is made dependent on the vote of\nat least two-thirds in value of the subscribed stock of the company, etc.\nNo one but those having subscribed, or those claiming under them, or the profit participating policyholders, seems contemplated by the Act as having any right to do with its affairs.\nLet us turn to the \u201cCompanies\u2019 Clauses Act\u201d and see if this enlarges that view.\nThe \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d defines the shareholder to mean \u201cevery subscriber to or holder of stock in the company\u201d which does not help us much, for obviously a transferee of stocks might not be \u201ca subscriber\u201d yet \u201ca holder of stock\u201d and the latter might be such without either being subscriber or transferee if otherwise power given to create stock without a subscription and without cash payment.\nWhen we consider each and every section of that Act I think the utmost that can be said relative to the scope thereof, is that there is nothing expressly giving power to create stock otherwise than by subscription and payment in cash. We must bear in mind that the purpose of the Act is to supply a standard set of clauses which will subserve any legislation relative to all the joint stock companies Parliament can create, save as to railway, banking or insurance companies.\nYet when by section 17 of the company\u2019s incorporating Act the \u201cClauses Act\u201d is adopted save as to specific sections, it guards that adoption by adding thereto the words,\nin so far as the said Act is not inconsistent with any provisions of this Act or of the Insurance Act.\nWe are thus thrown back upon the sections I have quoted from the incorporating Act, the general purview thereof and of the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d and the clear principle which though daily repeated is sometimes lost sight of, that corporate bodies are only endowed with such powers as the creating legislature has given them. There may, however, be implications in the creations to give them activity.\nNor should we overlook the fact that having regard to such implied purpose there are numerous cases which at an early stage of the operation of the English Act of 1862, the courts held the power existed of accepting payment of moneys worth, instead of cash.\nThat Act was general and intended to be most comprehensive in its terms and operations, and unless such elasticity was given it would have largely failed of its purpose. At the outset the most useful thing it could be put to was to create corporate bodies to take charge of existent properties used for business or connected therewith or the goodwill thereof.\nThe situation which thus arose was of an entirely different character from that existent at and surrounding the creation of this company. The purpose to be executed was entirely different. And there the result was soon specifically guarded against in the Act of 1867.\nOn the whole I conclude that the Act of incorporation here in question, does not contemplate the issue of stock for anything but money, and at all events is not a thing that can be done by the directors exercising only the usual powers of management assigned them.\nWhether possible to be directed upon due consideration by the shareholders or not, it is not necessary for me to determine beyond this, that I do not think such a case was presented to them as to entitle them to delegate both the right to act for them in the making of such a contract and the determination of all the details of such a bargain as the manager, Ostrom, induced a meeting in April to attempt, and the reference did not include any issue of such stock to appellant.\nIf no power exists, of course, there is an end of this case.\nBut there is another aspect of the matter and that is that the question of the power of the company to make a bargain at all, and of the board in that respect, and of the grave doubt that must exist to put it no higher, are all matters lying open for the appellant to have considered and are not mere matters of the internal regulation of the company\u2019s mode of transacting business, and thus hidden from any one having dealings with the company. This appellant was not, therefore, in this case, of necessity restricted to the measurement of the authority of this company\u2019s officers, by what it was clearly apparent the company had held them out to the world as having power to do in the way of binding the company. He had the statutes for his guide and a warning in the pleadings.\nI am also strongly impressed in this particular case with the facts that the appellant\u2019s whole claim rested upon his dealings with the manager, Ostrom, personally, and that in such a case it was his bounden duty to have ascertained not only that Ostrom had discharged his full duty by making to his employers the complete disclosure that for him in his situation, dealing for and with them, was necessary to found any contract between him and them, but also had given due consideration for that he must have professed to have acquired from them the right to transmit to appellant. Nothing can be clearer than that Ostrom neglected his duty in these regards, acted without any, or even the shadow of any, authority, and that upon the most casual sort of investigation, such as I have indicated was required of this appellant, he never could have been deceived or in any way misled.\nNor was this the less incumbent upon him because he saw the signature of one purporting to act as vice-president attached to this certificate he rests upon.\nI cannot understand how any one dealing with such an issue as was presented for trial could assume without more information that the company had changed its front and policy so suddenly as to have matured any scheme that would have justified in law the issue of such stock as this certificate professes to evidence. And that he was alive to this is pretty evident from his counsel\u2019s letter three weeks after the alleged settlement, appearing in Mr. Kerr\u2019s letter of the 6th of March, 1906.\nIt is as follows:\u2014\nMarch 31st, 1906.\nA.W. Holmestead, Esq.,\nBarrister, etc.,\nToronto.\nMackenzie v. Monarch Life.\nDear Sir,\u2014There does not seem to be any prospects of the Monarch Life issuing shares in this matter, and I understand that the shareholders have refused to agree to the proposition which Mr. J.K. Kerr assured me would be satisfactory. Had we better not see about getting the case again placed on the list for trial?\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) JAS. BlCKNELL.\nBut more than that the appellant must have known from the very nature of things he was doing and being a party to, that neither he nor any one else had given the company anything, and that they could not be compensated for such a transaction by a release to Ostrom such as appears unsigned, but dated May 4th, 1906, and seems the true consideration as proposed for the issue of such stock.\nHaving regard to all these things and everything implied therein, we are tempted to ask: What could the payment to Ostrom of the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for such an illusory thing as the alleged copyrights be, but a plan for exploiting a company that seemed to have had for two years a desperate struggle to come up to the standard needed to get organized, and to justify the issue of a license to entitle it to enter on its proper business? Such being the general features of the material circumstances presented to appellant\u2019s mind up to said date, let us see if we can, accurately, just what did happen out of which there could spring an estoppel of such grave import as we are presented with here.\nThe case was again entered on the trial list. Matters so far as we can see, unless some illegal resolutions, stood as they had done quite unchanged from the view presented to Mr. Bicknell\u2019s mind, on the 31st of March, 1906.\nThen in some way, but how brought about is unexplained, Mr. Kerr sends the following telegram from Ottawa:\u2014\nMay 2nd, 1906.\nTo James Bicknell, K.C.,\nBicknell & Bain, Barristers, Toronto.\nTried to see you when in Toronto; have arranged with Ostrom for transfer of shares as per agreement signed by me and will be approved of by directors at first meeting to be called for that purpose, as soon as possible. Kindly let case stand over, and oblige.\nJ.K. KERR.\nThis may have been relied upon by appellant, but if so by its very terms he has to get the adoption of the board as basis for the issue of stock. Any undertaking to do so, even if broken, does not furnish ground of estoppel but action for a breach of the contract expressly made. We have, however, no evidence of any right in Mr. Kerr to act for respondent. And the minute book put in evidence and freely referred to by counsel on the argument, discloses no meeting from the 15th of April to the 19th of May, of either shareholders, directors or executive committee. In presence of such a record in evidence referred to by all parties, I fail to see how it can now be questioned as inadmissible. Nor can I understand, when such record shews no meetings were had, how, as is argued, the respondent was driven to call any or perhaps the whole of the twenty-five former directors of previous three years to attend; scattered as the record shews they were from Montreal to Winnipeg.\nMoreover, the record shews the company had resolved to move its headquarters to Winnipeg, before this telegram from Mr. Kerr. The telegram from Mr. Kerr, so far from misleading, put appellant on his guard and imposed the duty on him of seeing before venturing to act on the alleged stock certificate that the directors had met and sanctioned it.\nOn the 14th of May the parties signed the following consent of dismissal of the action:\u2014\nEwan Mackenzie,\nPlaintiff;\nand\nThe Monarch Life Assurance Company and T. Marshall Ostrom.\nDefendants.\nWe hereby consent that this action be dismissed without costs.\nDated at Toronto, this 4th day of May, A.D. 1906.\nJAMES BICKNELL,\nFor plaintiff.\nD.C. Ross,\nFor defendant Ostrom.\nMATTHEW WILSON,\nFor defendant company.\nThis had to be substituted for another of a very different import, because the company\u2019s counsel very positively refused to sign the other or take part in such proposals of settlement as it indicated might be on foot. Such rejection must be held to have been known to the appellant. That rejected form of settlement, and its rejection being so known he cannot pretend fairly he was ignorant of the cause thereof, reads as follows:\u2014 This action is settled as follows:\u2014\n1. The defendant, T. Marshall Ostrom, delivers to the plaintiff twenty-five fully paid\u2011up shares of stock in the defendant company.\n2. The defendant, T. Marshall Ostrom, in addition to the amount already paid, will pay $50 in full of any remaining costs of the plaintiff.\n3. Except as above there shall be no costs to either party.\n4. The plaintiff will release to the defendant Ostrom or to the company as his nominee any interest which he has under the assignment in question herein from one George Stevenson in the interim copyrights in question herein.\nDated this 4th day of May, 1906.\nJAMES BICKNELL, Counsel for plaintiff.\nCounsel for Monarch Life.\nD.C. Ross, Counsel for T. Marshall Ostrom.\nNow we have presented for redemption or adoption three years later, this certificate bearing date, let it be well noted, the 3rd of May, 1906, undoubtedly in existence and I think handed over to appellant\u2019s solicitor before the final consent to the dismissal was signed.\nMr. Kerr\u2019s telegram of the 2nd of May, could hardly have been supposed to have been implemented by the directors\u2019 meeting and with marvellous despatch producing this thing on the 3rd of May. The most casual inquiry would have disclosed the twenty-five directors were so widely scattered that such a thing was impossible. And careful inquiry would have disclosed the facts that the seat of business for such meetings had to be Winnipeg.\nHow can it be said this evidence proves what constitutes an estoppel in conformity with any legal definition thereof?\nHow can it be said the company did anything that misled appellant?\nHow can he plead reliance on its acts or alleged acts as consistent with this certificate, in face of the positive refusal to sanction such a settlement as might have implied the countenancing of the issue of said stock?\nHow can he, who is told the stock will be transferred with the approval of the board of directors in the future, pretend he acted upon the fact of its issue having been already made as if approved?\nHow can he pretend to ignorance of the prerequisite of approval of shareholders or board placed before him in such divers ways?\nHow can he claim these officers had ever been held out as possessing the right to so issue certificates of this kind which on their face presuppose the cash had been paid?\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The questions arising on this appeal depend, it seems to me, upon considerations of very wide application; the weight to be attached to these considerations in the courts of law being, I should think, a matter of no little importance to the very large number of people who have dealings in the shares of joint-stock companies.\nThe facts are hardly in dispute. The appellant received through his solicitor a share certificate in the ordinary form stating that he was the owner of 25 shares of fully paid-up stock in the defendant company. This certificate had been received by his solicitor from the solicitor of one Ostrom, the managing director of the company, in settlement of an action then pending between the appellant as plaintiff and Ostrom and the company as defendants. The action had been brought to establish that the appellant was entitled to an interest in certain copyrights of insurance plans which Ostrom had professed to assign to the company. The plaintiff alleged that the company was advertising and otherwise making use of these plans in violation of his rights as part owner of the copyrights and he claimed an injunction accordingly. The action having come on for trial was adjourned (according to the note of the presiding judge) to enable a settlement to be carried out. There was some delay, but eventually it was arranged that Ostrom was to transfer twenty-five fully paid-up shares to the appellant in satisfaction of his claim, and the certificate in question having been delivered by Ostrom\u2019s solicitor the action was by consent dismissed. In point of fact the appellant was not registered as the holder of any shares. Ostrom had transferred none to him, and had no fully paid-up shares to transfer; the issue of the certificate, moreover, had not in fact been authorized by the directors. The appellant contends that he, having acted upon the certificate by consenting to the dismissal of his action (thereby altering his position) the company is estopped from disputing the truth of the statement contained in it, viz., that he was at its date the registered holder of the shares mentioned.\nIt was not disputed on the argument, or at all events but faintly disputed, that this consequence follows if the statement in the certificate must in law be taken to be the statement of the company. The good faith of Mr. Bicknell, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, in accepting and acting on the certificate, is expressly found by the learned trial judge. \u201cThere is no charge of bad faith against any person except Ostrom,\u201d he says. The learned judge, as appears from his manner of dealing with the question raised, indubitably meant to relieve Mr. Bicknell from any suggestion that he had any suspicion touching the propriety of Ostrom\u2019s conduct in delivering the certificate. It was upon the same basis of fact that the case was considered in the Court of Appeal, and I cannot find that any imputation against the good faith of the appellant has been made by counsel for the respondent throughout the case. It seems clear, therefore, that it is on that basis that the appeal must be determined; but as some point is now made against the plaintiff in this connection, there is one observation which I think ought not to be omitted. It was Mr. Bicknell who on behalf of the appellant carried on the negotiations with Senator Kerr\u2014whom he believed, as the learned trial judge has found, to be acting for the company. Senator Kerr foresaw no difficulty in carrying into completion the arrangement that Ostrom was to transfer twenty-five shares (fully-paid) to the appellant; Ostrom\u2019s solicitor, Mr. Ross, a reputable member of the profession, filled in the body of the certificate with his own hand, and obviously saw no difficulty. Mr. Wilson, the counsel for the company in the action (who, as the books in evidence shew, had been acting as the company\u2019s general solicitor,) was made fully acquainted with the terms of the settlement, and, (in view of his attitude I am bound to assume,) had no suspicion that Ostrom, in proposing to transfer fully paid-up shares to the appellant, was contemplating any juggling with the company\u2019s books, or any improper use of the company\u2019s name or seal; nor, it is perhaps needless to add, does any misgiving appear to have crossed the mind of Dr. Graham. In the minds of these four gentlemen, presumably much more fully acquainted with Ostrom\u2019s relations with the company than Mr. Bicknell, an outsider, could be, the settlement excited no suspicion or apprehension of impropriety. In these circumstances if any point was to be made against the plaintiff\u2019s good faith, it ought to have been made, and distinctly made, at an earlier stage in the litigation. The question is then: Is the company bound by this statement as its own statement? I think it is bound by it.\nThe powers of the directors in respect of such certificates appear in section 13 (a) of chapter 118, R.S.C. (1886):\u2014\n13. The directors of the company may, in all things, administer the affairs of the company, and may make or cause to be made for the company, any description of contract which the company may, by law, enter into; and may, from time to time, make by-laws not contrary to law or to the special Act or to this Act, for the following purposes:\u2014\n(a) The regulating of the allotment of stock, the making of calls thereon, the payment thereof, the issue and registration of certificates of stock, the forfeiture of stock for non\u2011payment, the disposal of forfeited stock and of the proceeds thereof, and the transfer of stock.\nIn the execution of these powers the directors passed by-law X.(d) in the following words:\u2014\n(d) Certificates shall be issued for stock after payment of at least ten per centum of the par value, and each certificate shall shew upon its face the number of shares and the amount paid upon the stock represented by such certificate at the date of such certificate, and all such certificates shall be signed by the president or a vice-president and the manager and be sealed with the seal of the company; but, unless by special resolution of the directors, no shareholder shall be entitled to receive a second or subsequent certificate until he shall have delivered up to the company all prior certificates received by him from the company for the same stock.\nThe persons thus appointed to sign and attest the attaching of the corporate seal to stock certificates are the persons who by another article of the by-laws are charged with the general duty of executing documents on behalf of the company. The certificate in question here was signed by one of the vice-presidents \u2014Dr. Graham\u2014and by the managing director. It was stated in argument and not denied that the book of stock certificates which by leave of the court was returned to the respondent company after the trial, shews the vice-president in question and the managing director to have been the officers who down to the time of the transaction in question usually performed the duty of issuing such certificates. The minute book in evidence, moreover, shews that Dr. Graham usually presided at the meetings of the directors and of a committee called the executive committee to which the directors had professed to delegate their powers of management.\nThere can be no doubt that under the by-law set out above the vice-president and the managing director would be acting within their powers in issuing certificates to persons holding shares upon which the minimum amounts had been paid. There can equally be no doubt that they would be acting beyond their powers in issuing such a certificate in the name of a person not a stockholder. But if in such circumstances, they issue a certificate, I do not think it is necessarily a nullity. Share certificates, as everybody knows, are acted upon as documents of title. Speaking broadly, they do not in themselves confer ownership\u2014they are only evidence of ownership and perhaps apart from statutory enactment evidence only against the company itself; but in practice they are treated as documents of title and the courts have so far recognized their character as such as to hold that the deposit of a certificate may create an equitable mortgage of the shares to which they relate. As representing those shares they constitute a most important part of the movable commercial securities of the country. Now for such purposes a certificate (I am assuming it to be genuine in the sense that it is executed by the proper persons, the persons who, if the statements contained in it were true, would be the persons to execute it and give it forth to the world), would be perfectly valueless unless the statements certified to are to be taken to be the statements of the company itself. In commercial usage that is what a share certificate means\u2014a statement not by an officer of the corporation, who may or may not be mistaken, but a statement by the corporation itself upon the faith of which the public are entitled to act. If before acting upon the statements you must first at your peril investigate them what purpose does the certificate serve? Such a view of the effect of share certificates would, I think it is no exaggeration to say, quoting the language of Lord Cairns in Burkinshaw v. Nicolls[16], at page 1017,\nparalyze the whole of the dealings with shares in public companies.\nThe representations then, contained in such documents, as to the title to the shares and the amount paid upon them are representations which it is expected will be acted upon, and the object of the by-law authorizing certain named officers to execute such certificates is to place in the hands of shareholders documents upon the faith of which the public may act without further inquiry than to ascertain that they have been executed by those officers.\nThe statute left it optional with the directors whether they should or should not make provision for such certificates. But in making such provision, and providing that every shareholder on whose shares 10 per cent. had been paid should be entitled to such a document, they must be taken to have intended to arm the shareholder with a document which when executed by the proper officials should carry with it all the authority of a certificate given by the company.\nIt may be noted that the persons appointed for the purpose mentioned were not merely servants. The signatures of the manager and of the president or one of the vice-presidents were required. It is not easy to see how a stranger to the company could expect to verify a statement as to the contents of the company\u2019s books by obtaining any assurance which would be more conclusive than a statement so authenticated. In point of fact, (whatever may be said about a document executed by officers whose duties are well-known to be ministerial only,) no ordinary business man would think in ordinary affairs of business of refusing to accept and act upon\u2014as the certificate of the company\u2014a share certificate under the company\u2019s seal and signed as this was by such officers as a vice-president and a managing director when by the by-laws of the company those officers had been appointed to exercise, and regularly did exercise, the function of authenticating the execution of such instruments on behalf of the company.\nThe respondent\u2019s position rests upon two cases, Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated[17]; and George Whitechurch, Limited v. Cavanagh[18]. The distinction between this case and both those cases lies on the surface. In the first the certificate was not signed by the persons appointed to sign such documents. Their signatures were forged. The House of Lords held that the secretary who had countersigned it was not authorized to warrant the validity of the certificate. It does not appear to have been doubted that if the signatures had been genuine the company would have been bound. At page 447 Lord James of Hereford expressly says that in such a case the certificate would be binding. It is surely one thing to say that the persons authorized to execute such a document are thereby authorized to warrant in the name of the company the truth of the statements contained in it, or in other words that the public is invited to act upon a document executed by them, and a very different thing to say that the public is invited to act upon the signature of one of them only. That is the difference between the appellant\u2019s contention here and the unsuccessful contention in Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated17. In George Whitechurch Limited v. Cavanagh18 it was held that the secretary had no authority to guarantee the truth of the representation contained in his certification. The distinction is pointed out in all the judgments between a certification such as was there in question, and a certificate under the seal of the company; pages 126, 134. That persons empowered to execute documents of the latter character have (as necessarily implied in the power to execute such documents) the authority to warrant on behalf of the company the truth of the statements made in them was assumed throughout. The authority to give a certification of transfer on the other hand, does not imply (for the reasons pointed out by Lord Macnaghten) any invitation to the public to act upon it.\nIf I am right in thinking that by placing in the hands of the officers in question the authority to issue such certificates and permitting them to exercise such authority, the company invited the public to act upon the faith of certificates authenticated by them, then I think no difficulty arises from the fact that Ostrom was acting fraudulently for his own purposes. In Mahony v. East Holyford Mining Co.[19] the directors were acting fraudulently for their own purposes and so were the agents whose acts were in question in Bryant, Powis and Bryant v. La Banque du Peuple[20], and Hambro v. Burnand[21].\nI should perhaps add this. It was not argued that the vice-president and managing director were not the proper persons to issue certificates, on the application of the holder of shares in proper cases, or that they had not full authority to execute them in such cases. Indeed, the authority is admitted in the respondent\u2019s factum. If it should be suggested that they could attach the corporate seal only under the authority of the directors the answer is: assuming that to be so\u2014I think that is clearly not the true construction of the by-laws\u2014it is plain that these are the persons who are to authenticate the affixing of the seal. The by-laws quoted make that plain, and having that authentication a stranger is entitled to act upon it: Montreal and St. Lawrence Light, Heat and Power Co. v. Robert[22], at pp. 202 and 203.\nIt is proper also to mention the suggestion that certificates of shares in this company differ in effect from certificates of shares affected by the \u201cCompanies Act 1862,\u201d inasmuch as there is no enactment (corresponding to the provision in that Act) making the certifi- cates of the respondent company prim\u00e2 facie evidence of title. That, I think, is not material. If the statement in the certificate in question is to be treated as the statement of the company, then the doctrine of estoppel comes into play. That the English decisions upon the subject do not depend on this provision of the Companies Acts is clear from this. In many of the cases it is not the title to the shares, but the liability to pay calls upon them that is in question. On this point there is no statutory provision; but the estoppel operates notwithstanding its absence.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I agree with Meredith J.A. that, upon the evidence in the record, and especially in the absence of proof of the authority of Mr. J.K. Kerr to represent the Monarch Life Assurance Company, it must be held that:\nSo far as the defendants are concerned the only settlement made, of the former action, was that it should be dismissed, as it afterwards was, as against them without costs; that they were in no way parties to the settlement made between the plaintiff and their co\u2011defendant Ostrom, in that action.\nI find myself, however, unable to concur in the view which prevailed in the Ontario Court of Appeal as to the value of the certificate produced by the plaintiff as evidence that he is a shareholder in the defendant company, or as to the proper conclusion upon this question from the evidence adduced at the trial.\nI express no opinion upon the issue of estoppel, which was much discussed at bar. When and how far such a document as the certificate held by the plaintiff, regular in form, creates an estoppel against the company whose officers have signed it and whose seal it bears is, upon the authorities, a question of some difficulty, which, in the view I take of the pre- sent case, it is not necessary to determine. That this case does not fall within the line of decisions of which County of Gloucester Bank v. Ruddy, Merthyr Steam, etc., Co.[23] is an example, but should be held to be governed by the principles on which the judgment in Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated[24] proceeds, I am not wholly satisfied. There is at least one marked distinction between the facts in Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated24 and those now before us.\nIt is quite true, as stated by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, that\nthere is nothing in the special Act incorporating the defendants, 4 Edw. VII. ch. 96, or in sections of the \u201cCompanies Clauses Act\u201d (Dom.) R.S.C. (1886), ch. 118, which are declared applicable to the defendant company, similar to the provisions contained in the \u201cImperial Act,\u201d 8 & 9 Vict. ch. 6, amended by various other acts, requiring the defendants to deliver to a shareholder a certificate of proprietorship which is to be admitted in all courts as prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the title of the person named in it.\nWe have no provision corresponding with section 23 of the \u201cImperial Companies Act of 1908,\u201d which declares that \u201ca certificate under the common seal of the company specifying any shares or stock held by any member shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the title of the member to the shares or stock.\u201d But these statutory provisions would appear to be merely declaratory of what would without them be held to be the law. For, as pointed out by Magee J.A., such a document as the certificate produced by the plaintiff is, apart from any statutory enactment, \u201cprim\u00e2 facie evidence of its truth.\u201d\nIn Hill v. Manchester and Salford Water Works[25], Denman C.J. says, at p. 874:\u2014 The plaintiff proved that the common seal of the company was affixed to the bond by the officer who had legal custody of it, and so threw upon the defendants the burden of proving clearly that it was not set by their authority.\nIn D\u2019Arcy v. Tamar Kid Hill and Callington Railway Co.[26], Bramwell B., at p. 162, says:\u2014\nIt is not to be presumed that what has been done is ultra vires and therefore when the bond is produced under the seal of the company it is prim\u00e2 facie to be taken that the seal was properly affixed.\nAnd Channel B. adds:\u2014\nOn production of the bond under the corporate seal it is prim\u00e2 facie to be assumed that it is valid.\nIn North-West Electric Co. v. Walsh[27], Sedgewick J. delivering the judgment of the court, says at p. 50:\nThe fact that the respondent held a paper which upon its face stated that she held so much stock paid in full, while evidence of the statement, was not conclusive evidence of it.\nSee, too, Montreal and St. Lawrence Light and Power Co. v. Robert[28], at pages 202-3.\nBy the production of his stock certificate, therefore, the plaintiff established a prim\u00e2 facie case entitling him to relief. How is that case met by the defendant, upon whom the burden was thus cast of proving that the plaintiff is not the holder of the shares mentioned in his certificate?\nIts plea is that:\u2014\n1. If the plaintiff holds a stock certificate as alleged, the same was not issued by the defendant and the amount thereof was not paid up to the defendant, and the defendant did not consent thereto.\n\u2014The substance of this plea is that the issue of the stock which the plaintiff claims to own was not sanctioned by the board of directors of the defendant com- pany, who alone had power to authorize it. In support of this allegation counsel for the defendant cross-examined Dr. Graham, the vice-president of the company, who was one of the signatories to the certificate. His evidence on this point is summed up in the following question and answer:\u2014\nQ. Then there has never been any authority from the board of directors at all for you to sign this certificate? A. I do not know about that.\nHe was not asked if he had attended all the directors\u2019 meetings; nor was he or any other competent witness asked whether the minutes produced by another officer of the company were a true record of all that had transpired at the directors\u2019 meetings. He had no recollection of how he came to sign the certificate.\nDo you remember anything about it?\nA. No.\nHis Lordship: You are not in the habit of signing things just because they are put in front of you?\nA. When they are filled up and signed by the managing director, I would take it for granted they are right.\nQ. You have no recollection?\nA. No, sir.\nNo other director of the company gave evidence. The defendant called the present general manager of the company, Mr. Stewart, who took office in November, 1906. The transactions leading up to the plaintiff obtaining his stock certificate occurred in March and May, 1906, and the certificate bears date the 3rd May, 1906. Mr. Stewart was unable to give any evidence as to what had transpired before he became manager. He produced certain books of the company. Mr. Vansickle, a bookkeeper with the defendant, was also called. He had no part in the management and gave no evidence of any value. The defendant did not call any other witness. Mr. Stewart produced the stock ledger, the stock certificate book, the stock application book, and the minute book of the company. These books contained no record of anything which would indicate that the plaintiff had become a shareholder in the company.\nSuch of these books as the company is required, by R.S.C. ch. 79, sec. 144, to keep are, by section 175 of that Act (one of the companies clauses provisions made applicable to the defendant company by 4 Edw. VII. ch. 96, sec. 17), declared to be\nprim\u00e2 facie evidence of all facts purporting to be therein stated.\nThey are not, however, made negative evidence of the non-existence of the facts not therein stated. Moreover, books which the statute does not require the company to keep, e.g., the minute book of directors\u2019 meetings, are not given any evidentiary value greater than they possess at common law. At common law such books are not admissible for the corporation as against a stranger. Neither, in my opinion, can the corporation without statutory authority put them in evidence when the question at issue is whether the opposing party is a member of it or a stranger to it; Marriage v. Lawrence[29]; Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.), sec. 1781\u2014whatever might be the case were he by common consent a member.\nThe company might have called some of its directors of 1906 as witnesses and by them established, if such were the fact, that at no directors\u2019 meeting was there an allotment of the shares claimed by the plaintiff. It has not seen fit to do so. It is consistent with the evidence in the record that the board of directors may have sanctioned the issue of the shares in question and that, by accident or design, a record of their action may not have been made. Counsel for the defendant contented themselves with cross-examining one director, called by the plaintiff, who was unable to negative the existence of the requisite authority for the issue of the shares claimed by the plaintiff and with tendering in evidence its own books\u2014some of them probably inadmissible\u2014none of them affording the evidence which it was bound to supply.\nThe prim\u00e2 facie case made by the plaintiff, therefore, remains unanswered. The evidence of Dr. Graham sufficiently establishes that other certificates for shares were signed by him after that given to the plaintiff. It is thus made reasonably clear that when the plaintiff received his certificate the defendant held unissued shares to meet it; indeed, the defence of an over issue has not been suggested.\nI am, with great respect, of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to the declaratory judgment for which he asks, and that his appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bicknell, Bain, Strathy & Mackelcan.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Wilson, Pike & Co.\n[1] 23 Ont.

Wilkinson, (1911) 45 S.C.R. 263\nDate: 1911-11-06\nBritish Columbia Electric Railway Company (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nAnnie Louisa Wilkinson (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1911: October 5; 1911: November 6.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nNegligence \u2014 Carriers \u2014 Operation of railway \u2014 Defective system \u2014 Gratuitous passenger\u2014Free pass\u2014Limitation of liability\u2014Employer and employee\u2014Fellow-servant\u2014Evidence\u2014Onus of proof.\nThe plaintiff's husband was an employee engaged as a mechanic in the company's workshops and was travelling thither to his work on one of the company's passenger cars, as a passenger, without payment of fare. A freight car became detached from a train, some distance ahead of the passenger car and proceeding in the same direction; it ran backwards down a grade, collided with the passenger car and the plaintiff's husband was killed. The manner in which the freight car became detached was not shewn. On the body of deceased there was found a permit or \"pass,\" which was not produced, and there was no evidence to shew any conditions in it, nor over what portion of the company's lines nor for what purposes it was to be honoured. On the close of the plaintiff's case the defendants adduced no evidence whatever, and the jury found that the company was at fault, owing to a defective system of operation of their trains, and assessed damages, at common law, for which judgment was entered for the plaintiff.\nHeld, that there was a presumption that deceased was lawfully on the passenger car and, in the exercise of their business as common carriers of passengers, the company were, therefore, obliged to use a high degree of care in order to avoid injury [being caused to him through negligence; that there was nothing in the evidence to shew that deceased occupied the position of a fellow-servant with the employees engaged in the operation of the trains which were in collision; and that, in the absence of evidence shewing any agreement, express or implied, or some relationship between the company and deceased which would exclude or limit liability, the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages at common law.\nJudgment appealed from (16 B.C. Rep. 113) affirmed. Nightingale v. Union Colliery Co. (35 Can. S.C.R. 135) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment at the trial by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiff, the widow of Archer Samuel Wilkinson, deceased, on behalf of herself and of a minor child, for the recovery of $25,000 damages suffered through the death of her said husband caused, as alleged, by the negligence of the defendants. The circumstances in which deceased met his death are stated in the head-note. On the verdict of the jury judgment was entered for $8,000 damages awarded to the plaintiff, for herself, and $3,000 for her infant daughter. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from, Mr. Justice Irving dissenting.\nThe principal grounds urged on behalf of the appellants were: (1) That no evidence was supplied by the plaintiff as to the circumstances under which the deceased was upon the car of the company. (2) That there was sufficient evidence that deceased was an employee of the company and was being carried to Westminster as such employee. (3) That there was some evidence that the deceased had a pass in his pocket when killed. (4) That the address of plaintiff's counsel to the jury proceeded upon the assumption that the deceased was travelling upon a pass. (5) In his charge to the jury, the trial judge pointed out that there was no evidence that deceased \"was in the position of an ordinary passenger under con- tract for carriage. There is no evidence of payment of fare and there is evidence of the fact that he had in his pocket-book a pass.\" (6) That there is no evidence whatever as to the cause of the accident. (7) That the onus was upon the plaintiff to prove all that was necessary to obtain a verdict and that onus was not discharged.\nEwart K.C. for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. agreed with Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014The deceased husband of the respondent was a passenger on the appellants' railway car when, by reason of its servants' negligence, he met his death.\nPrima facie, his widow, who sues as his personal representative, on behalf of herself and her children, is entitled to recover as any other, in like circumstances, might recover.\nIf there were any specical circumstances to differentiate this case from that which the outstanding facts present, it devolved upon those claiming such exemption to have proven the facts to support it. Mr. Ewart's suggestion of there being a duty devolving on a plaintiff in such cases to negative or explain is clearly unfounded. Who ever heard of such negative proof being tendered in such a case? It would require in each accident case that the passenger injured proved he never had a pass.\nThe bare statement that, after his death, the respondent found a pass in her deceased husband's clothes, without shewing for what or where, or that by the terms of the pass or conditions upon which it issued he assumed all risks, or even that he had presented it to the appellant's conductor on the occasion in question in answer to a demand for fare, goes for nothing.\nEven a man travelling upon an unconditional pass cannot be killed with impunity by such gross negligence as apparent here on the part of those carrying deceased.\nIt is suggested that he was a fellow-servant of those guilty of the negligence and, hence, by reason of the doctrine of common employment, no recovery can be had at common law.\nIf so employed there is no evidence that he was where he met his death by reason of that employment.\nHe was, for all we know, entitled to get by any means he chose to the place where he had to work for the appellants.\nUntil he entered on that employment and was actually engaged therein, how can he be said to have fallen within the principle of the doctrine of common employment?\nThat doctrine rests upon the implication that a person employed is presumed to have undertaken the risks incidental to such employment.\nThis case is not brought within this fundamental reason for the doctrine, and hence, it cannot apply.\nThere may arise questions of a nice character in this regard when, if ever, it is shewn in such a case that the terms of the contractual relation between employer and employee establish that the employment began when the employee stepped into the employer's carriage.\nI do not desire to express any opinion on such a case till it actually arises. I merely refer to a possibility which has not arisen here, but which the ingenuity of counsel suggested might be inferred by another jury.\nI do not think when, as here, the proof of anything tending to raise a mere suspicion was made by appellant and then the further relative facts peculiarly in its own hands are withheld or avoided with care, that it can fairly ask any court to exercise its discretion to prolong such litigation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The deceased, Archer Samuel Wilkinson, met his death in a collision while travelling in one of the appellant company's passenger cars from Vancouver to New Westminster. The inference that the collision was due to a want of ordinary care on part of the officers or servants of the company is indisputable. The company seeks to escape liability on the ground that the evidence fails to shew facts which enable us to say whether this absence of care involved any breach of duty for which the company is answerable to the respondent.\nWilkinson, who resided in Vancouver, was employed in the shops of the company at New Westminster, and was on his way thither on the morning when the accident occurred. It does not appear whether he did or did not pay his fare. It is suggested that he may have been carried gratuitously; and this suggested possibility is made the ground of the contention upon which the appeal was mainly based, viz.: that since we are ignorant of the character in which Wilkinson was on the appellant's car \u2014 whether, that is to say, as a passenger paying his fare, or as a passenger travelling free, or as a servant being carried to his work; and, since we are equally ignorant of the character of the negligence out of which the collision arose, the plaintiff must fail as we obviously cannot, in these circumstances, affirm either the existence of the gross negligence alleged to be necessary to attach liability to the company in the second case, nor the existence of negligence other than that of a fellow-servant which is necessary for success in the third.\nThis contention appears to me to be without substance.\nI do not agree that in such an action as this it is necessary to prove that the traveller who has been killed had paid for his carriage or had entered into a contract to pay for it or that he was not being carried in the character of fellow-servant of those responsible for the accident. The appellants are a railway company carrying on the business of common carriers of passengers. The obligation to take reasonable care to carry safely arises out of the acceptance of the passengers. The law as settled is stated in the passage quoted by Mr. Chrysler from the treatise on carriers in the \"Laws of England,\" art. 80:\u2014\nThe duty of a railway company (speaking, of course, of a railway company when in the exercise of its trade of common carriers of passengers), to use a high degree of care towards its passengers does not depend on any contract with the passenger; it is bound not to injure by negligence any person lawfully on its railway, whether such person has made a contract with it or not. The case of Nightingale v. Union Colliery Co.[2], cited by Mr. Ewart, is not a relevant decision. There the person injured was not being carried in a public conveyance by a railway company in the course of its business of common carrier of passengers. He was travelling on a locomotive attached to a freight train and was there in violation of an express rule of the company. In the case before us the presumption is that Wilkinson was lawfully on the car and the rule above stated applies unless something is shewn (some agreement, express or implied, or some relationship between the passenger and the company) which excludes or limits the application of it.\nThe doctrine of common employment or more accurately the doctrine of Priestly v. Fowler[3], was invoked; but there is nothing in the evidence to justify the application of that doctrine. Wilkinson's work was in the shops; at the time he met with the accident his day's work was not begun; and the risk of injury on the railway can not, therefore, be regarded as a risk incidental to his service, unless it be shewn that he was being carried by the appellants not in the character of common carriers, but in that of employers \u2014 in other words, under some arrangement which was part of or ancillary to his contract of service. (See Coldrick v. Partridge, Jones & Co.[4].) Of this there was not the slightest legal evidence and there was, consequently, on this head, no question which could properly be left to the jury. The sole point, therefore, upon which the jury had to pass was the amount of damages to be awarded; and, on that point, there is no adequate reason for disturbing their verdict.\nAnglin and Brodeur JJ. agreed with Duff J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McPhillips & Wood.\nSolicitor for the respondent: B.

VIT. c. 64 (Man.)\u2014\"Winnipeg City Charter\"\u2014Construction of statute.\nA municipal by-law for the diversion and closing of certain highways and the transfer of the land to a railway company provided that it should \"come into force and effect\" on the execution of a supplementary agreement between the municipal corporation and a railway company \"duly ratified by council\"; it also determined the classes of persons and property entitled to compensation in consequence of being injuriously affected by the diversion and closing of the streets. The statute (3 & 4 Edw. VII. ch. 64, sec. 708, sub-sec. c (1)), conferring these powers, gave persons dissatisfied with the determination the right to appeal to a judge \"within ten days after the passage of the by-law.\" Another by-law was subsequently enacted by which the first bylaw was \"ratified and confirmed and declared to be now in force.\" The defendants, who had been excluded from the class of persons to receive compensation, appealed to a judge, under the section of the statute above referred to within ten days after the enactment' of the second by-law.\nHeld, that the terms \"within ten days after the passage of the bylaw\" in the statute had reference to the date when the by-law affecting the streets and determining the classes entitled to compensation became effective; that the first by-law did not come into force and effect in such a manner as to injuriously affect the defendants until it was ratified and confirmed by the subsequent by-law, and, consequently, the defendants' appeal came within the time limited by the statute. Judgment appealed from (20 Man. R. 669) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (1), reversing the decision of Mathers C.J., in the Court of King's Bench, by which an injunction had been granted restraining the defendants from proceeding to an arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of the \"Winnipeg City Charter,\" to determine the amount of compensation in damages to which they might be entitled in consequence of the diversion and closing of certain highways by a municipal by-law.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C., O. H. Clark K.C. and Christopher C. Robinson for the appellants;\nAikins K.C. and C.P. Wilson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The question here is: Was by-law 4264 passed in September, 1907?\nBy \"passed\" I presume is meant that at that date the by-law was so complete in itself that it effected the purpose for which it was intended, although, possibly, it might not be brought into force until a later date.\nThe object in view was the closing of certain streets. Can it be said that within the four corners of the by-law, as it then stood, could be found the authority necessary to close the streets the result of which would be to injuriously affect the plaintiffs' property without any further step being taken except to bring the by-law into force? Distinguishing between that which is necessary to make a by-law complete and effective and' that which is necessary to bring it into force, it seems to me clear that the first by-law was not completed and never became effective until the second by-law was passed confirming the supplemental agreement.\nThe argument for the appellant is that when the supplemental agreement was executed it had retroactive effect. If the by-law was not complete, inasmuch as it did not effectively accomplish the purpose for which originally it had been made until the second agreement was executed\u2014within what delay would appeal lie? From the date of the by-law or the date of the supplementary agreement?\nUntil such a by-law effectively closing the street was passed the respondents had no interest upon which they could found a judicial proceeding. They could not be affected by something that was not done.\nThe second by-law purports to close the street. Otherwise what is the meaning of this expression in the agreement of the 24th of August, 1907? The words used are:\u2014\nNow, therefore, in consideration of the premises and in consideration of the city passing a by-law closing up the streets and lanes referred to in its said agreement, dated the 20th day of October, 1906, the company hereby declares as follows; etc.\nIf the streets had been closed by the first by-law, why insert that provision in the supplemental agreement? On the whole, I agree with my brother Idington, and, for the reasons which he gives, I would dismiss this appeal. Davies J.\u2014The substantial question to be determined in this appeal is whether a certain by-law of the City Council of Winnipeg, No. 4264, professing to ratify and confirm an agreement made between the city and the Canadian Northern Railway Company for (inter alia) the closing up of certain streets of the city and the construction by the company of a subway under one of the streets of the city was \"duly passed\" within the meaning of sub-section c (l), of section 708 of the Winnipeg Charter on the day the by-law bears date, the 30th day of September, A.D. 1907, when it formally passed the council, or on the 20th day of July, 1908, when a second by-law was passed, No. 5050, ratifying and confirming by-law 4264.\nIf by-law No. 4264 was so duly passed on the day of its date, 30th September, 1907, then, so far as the question is concerned, the defendants, respondents, were too late in appealing to Chief Justice Dubuc on the 28th July, 1908, and this appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba should be allowed.\nIf, on the contrary, the by-law No. 4264 was not duly passed within the meaning of sub-section c (l), until the 20th July, 1908, when by-law 5050 ratifying and confirming the supplemental agreement and the original agreement as amended by the supplemental one and also ratifying and confirming by-law 4264 and declaring it \"to be now in force,\" then this appeal must be dismissed and this action brought to have it declared that the order of Chief Justice Dubuc of the 8th October, 1908, adding the names of the defendants to the names of those determined by the by-law 4264 to have been injuriously affected by the exercise of the powers contained therein was ultra vires must be dismissed. The original agreement made between the city and the railway company was entered into the 20th October, A.D. 1906. The by-law 4264, as to the day of the legal passage of which the controversy turns, sets forth the agreement of 1906 in full and in its enacting part: (1) ratifies and confirms the agreement; (2) grants to the company the privileges of entering upon the streets and building a subway specified in section one of the agreement; (3) stops and closes up those portions of public streets bounded as therein specified; (4) provides for the conveyance of the closed-up streets to the company; and, (5) limits the persons who might be injuriously affected by the exercise of the powers contained in the by-law and in the said agreement and who were entitled to compensation for damages by reason thereof under the provisions of the Winnipeg Charter to those having an interest in any part of\nreal estate fronting on that part of Pembina street occupied or opposite the subway and its approaches.\nThe defendants (respondents) not being within this class of persons were, therefore, excluded from claiming damages for any injurious affection of their lands.\nThen follows the clause on the construction of which the controversy centres.\n6. This by-law shall come into force and effect on the execution of the supplementary agreement dated the 24th day of August, A.D. 1907, by the Canadian Northern Railway Company and the City of Winnipeg and duly ratified by council.\nDone and passed in council assembled this 30th day of September, A.D. 1907.\nTo complete the chronological statement of the important facts I may here state that this supplemental agreement dated the 24th August, 1907, was, at the date of the passing of by-law 4264, under consideration of and awaiting the decision of the company and the city. Beyond the fact that it materially changed, in one respect at least, the obligations of the company to the city with respect to the construction of the via-duct it had no direct bearing upon the compensation to which the defendants, respondents, might be entitled.\nThe supplemental agreement having eventually been executed by the company and the city, the city council, on the 20th July, 1908, passed by-law 5050, (1) ratifying and confirming the supplemental agreement and also ratifying and confirming the first agreement of 20th October, 1906, as amended by this supplemental agreement, and further declaring\u2014\n(2) That the by-law No. 4264 is hereby ratified and confirmed and declared to be now in force.\nIn my judgment the by-law of 30th September, 1907, No. 4264, cannot be said to have been \"passed,\" within the meaning of the statute in that regard, as to persons it excluded from those entitled to compensation for injurious affection of their lands, until the 20th July, 1908, when by-law 5050 ratified and confirmed both the supplementary agreement and by-law 4264 and declared the latter \"to be now in force.\"\nIf by-law 4264 was clearly not in force until bylaw 5050 so declared it, there would seem to me to be an end to the question. Formally and technically passed, it might have been, but, as so passed, it was without life or force and could not be said to authorize the injurious affection of any lands or the vested rights of any one.\nClause 6 of the by-law made it clear that before it ever could have any efficacy or operation, the supplementary agreement of 20th August, 1907, modifying the original one set out at length in the by-law, should not only be executed, alike by the company and the city officials, but that such by-law 4264 and the execution of the agreement supplementary by the city officials should be duly ratified by council.\nIt does not seem to me that any application on the part of the defendants could have been successfully made to a judge to have their names added to the class of persons declared to be injuriously affected by the by-law No. 4264 within the ten days following this formal passing through council. Such applicants would be at once met by section 6,, declaring that such by-law was not in force and might not ever come into force and that, as it stood, it did not and could not operate to affect any person injuriously. To do so required further action alike on the part of the company and the city\u2014action which might never take place, but was essential to give life and vitality to the by-law.\nThe limit of time imposed upon parties who claimed that their properties were injuriously affected by the city by-law closing up streets, etc., and who desired to appeal from a determination excluding them from the class of persons entitled to compensation was short;\u2014only ten days.\nBut, in my judgment, that limitation is applicable only to a by-law which was only really effective and which did or might in its operation injuriously affect other lands than those declared in it to have been affected. It could not have application to the case of a by-law such as this, which not only was not in operation or effective when formally passed, but was expressly stated on its face not to have any effect until certain named contingencies occurred which might, as a fact, never occur.\nWithout expressing any opinion, therefore, upon the question whether or not the Chief Justice in hearing the appeal of the defendants, respondents, was acting as judge of the court or as persona designata, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant is a municipal corporation of which the powers that it enjoys are set forth in its amended charter, 3 & 4 Edw. VII. ch. 64.\nOne of the amendments therein relates to the power to close streets, and convey same, or part thereof, to a railway company, and is for our present purpose fairly abbreviated as follows:\u2014\n(c) For diverting or closing up any roads, streets * * * or lanes * * * or any part or parts thereof * * * and for conveying the same or any part thereof to a railway company * * * or to any person * * * and a conveyance to a railway company or to any person, made in pursuance of such by-law, shall absolutely vest in the company or person the fee simple in the land intended to be or purporting to be conveyed by the city to the company or person, and for determining what persons or classes of persons (if any) are injuriously affected by the exercise of the powers contained in this sub-section, and are entitled to compensation for damages by reason thereof, and no other persons or classes of persons shall be so entitled unless such determination shall be amended, on appeal to a judge of the Court of King's Bench) as hereinafter provided, and any advantage which the real estate, trade or business of any person may derive from the exercise of such powers * * * shall be deducted from such compensation and the amount of any claim for compensation by any person, entitled, as above provided, which shall include any damage to trade or business, shall, if not mutually agreed upon, be determined by arbitration under this Act.\n(cl) If any person be dissatisfied with the determination as to persons, or classes of persons, injuriously affected, as above mentioned, he may appeal therefrom to a judge of the Court of King's Bench, in which case he shall, within ten days after the passage of the by-law, apply to a judge sitting in chambers and produce to the judge a copy of the by-law and shew by affidavit that he is interested and such facts and circumstances as he claims entitle him to succeed upon such appeal. The judge, after service upon the city of a summons to shew cause in such behalf, may change, add to or diminish the persons or classes of persons so determined by the by-law, or may dismiss such appeal, and, according to the result of such an appeal, may award costs for or against the city. The decision of such judge shall be final and conclusive, and shall not be appealed from or moved against by any party.\nThe mayor, treasurer and comptroller of the appellant, professedly acting on its behalf, executed an agreement dated 20th October, 1906, which the vice-president and secretary of the Canadian Northern Railway Company also executed apparently on behalf of latter. This agreement recited that said company had asked the city to close certain streets and lanes which the company required to be closed in order that it might establish principal workshops there, and that the company had agreed to construct a subway and overhead bridge according to terms and stipulations thereinafter provided. Thereby the city, in consideration of the premises, granted permission to the company to enter upon Pembina Street (one of those to be closed) and thereon construct a subway sixty-six feet wide, and the company agreed to construct accordingly as specified, that the construction should be commenced in seven months from date thereof and completed within sixteen months from said date, but, if the company raised the grade of its road and yard, the city was to extend the term limited for completion for six months.\nThe agreement provided for a number of details, incidental to this project, which need not be referred to.\nThen the company covenanted to establish upon. the ground indicated and forever there maintain the principal buildings and workshops of its system between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains. The buildings were specified and the work of construction was to begin forthwith and be completed in two years from said date. The company agreed to indemnify the city\nfrom all actions, causes of actions, claims, damages and compensation to or in respect of any real estate (if any) injuriously affected by the construction of the subway and the overhead bridge, and the closing of said streets and lanes including damages (if any) to trade or business carried on thereon by reason of or resulting from anything done thereunder, which the city might be obliged to pay.\nBut it was thereby declared and determined, pursuant to sub-section (c) of section 708 (being that above abbreviated), that no person or class of persons were injuriously affected by the exercise of the powers contained in said sub-section, in respect of the closing of said streets and lanes, or entitled to compensation for damages by reason thereof.\nIt was graciously stated, in the closing part of the sentence setting this forth, that nothing therein\ncontained should affect the rights conferred by said sub-section of appeal to a judge of the Court of King's Bench.\nThe irony of this gracious concession becomes more apparent when we observe that there is, in the subsection named, no such right of appeal conferred, but only is by another sub-section not named in the entire agreement.\nBy what authority the appellants mayor and other officers executed this, nowhere appears before us. And when questioned in argument here and it was pointed out from the Bench that the transaction of any such business by appellant must be authorized by a by-law, as required by section 472 of the charter, it was only faintly suggested in answer that there probably existed a by-law of appellant authorizing and directing the agreement. Let us for the moment presume there was such a by-law, in conformity with said section 472, which is as follows:\u2014\n472. The jurisdiction of the council shall be confined to the city, except where authority beyond the same is expressly given; and the powers of the council shall be exercised by by-law when not otherwise authorized or provided for.\nThe declaration and determination set forth above, as in the agreement must, by the very nature of the contract and of the by-law power given, be presumed to have been duly and judicially reached and determined by such by-law.\nThe business was ended. The later steps and bylaws were useless. Are the questions now raised thereanent to be treated as academical? Why, when presumably determined by a by-law adopting the judgment set forth as above, did the city council not let it rest? How could they revise, as it will presently appear they did, the work so done? They, on the theory of a by-law authorizing and directing the agreement with this declaration, were functi officio.\nThe appellant has failed to take any such position heretofore and can hardly hope to take it now in such a proceeding as this. Yet it is the true position and answers any one choosing to refer to and rely upon the agreement and by-law No. 4264 (to be referred to presently) as anything but an offer. And hence the story I have related has a direct bearing on what has been argued before us as will presently appear.\nThe said agreement further provided\nthat the city in so far as it has authority, will duly stop and close up those streets and lanes, etc., etc.,\nand convey them to the company. This, it is to be noted, is a something to be done in the future. Time was to be deemed to be the essence of the agreement.\nAgain the company binds itself thereby, as soon as it has commenced any of the works contemplated, to promptly and diligently carry on the work to completion.\nBy paragraph 12, near the close of the agreement, it was provided as follows:\u2014\nShould the company fail or neglect to carry out the covenants or conditions or any of them in this agreement contained, then on such default on the part of the company the streets and lanes or parts of streets and lanes hereby contracted to be conveyed to the company shall revert to and be vested in the city, and the city is hereby authorized at the costs and expenses of the company to do all things necessary to restore said streets and lanes, or parts of streets and lanes to the original condition before the execution of these presents.\nThere does not seem to have been anything more done by any one until the 24th day of August, A.D. 1907, when we find another agreement of that date purporting to be made between the city and the company. This recites an alleged error in the above mentioned agreement, and that the company agreed to amend it and also to provide a permanent crossing to be used in case of necessity.\nThe suggested amendment was evidently important and the new proposition perhaps much more so. Both were to be carried out by putting in the two clauses now appearing in this new agreement. And, following them, it was provided that this agreement should be read and construed as and part of the said agreement of 20th October, 1906.\nThe attestation clause indicates a complete execution, but it is frankly admitted that, at least, the company did not execute until some time in the summer of the following year. Chief Justice Mathers, the trial judge, states it was not executed until the 20th of July, 1908, and he says, in the next sentence, that on that day another by-law, No. 5050, upon which respondents rest their claim, was passed. I infer the date may have been stated by counsel before him and that he has given the correct date.\nOn the 30th September, 1907, a by-law, No. 4264, had been read by the city council in which the agreement of the 20th October, 1906, to which I have so fully referred, was set out in full, and the council therein proceeds to enact, first, that the agreement thereinbefore set out is ratified and confirmed; secondly, that the city grants the right and privilege in the first paragraph of the agreement so set out, and thirdly,\nthere is hereby stopped and closed up those portions of public streets and lanes contained within the areas bounded as follows:\u2014\nand then describes the land. The fourth section of the by-law enacts that:\u2014\nThe city by deed executed by its proper officers shall convey to the Canadian Northern Railway Company the respective parcels of land occupied by the portions of streets and lanes hereinbefore described and directed to be closed up, any of which the city by said agreement agreed to convey to the company under paragraph eight, and to and at the time agreed upon.\nSections 5 and 6 are as follows:\u2014\n5. It is hereby determined that persons who are, or may be injuriously affected by the exercise of the powers contained in this by-law and in the said agreement, and who are entitled to compensation for damages by reason thereof under provisions of the Winnipeg Charter, are all persons having any estate or interest to the extent of such estate or interest in real estate hereafter described, or any part thereof, that is to say, as follows:\u2014\nReal estate fronting upon that part of Pembina street occupied or opposite the subway and its approaches.\n6. This by-law shall come into force and effect on the execution of the supplementary agreement dated the twenty-fourth day of August, A.D. 1907, by the Canadian Northern Railway Company and the City of Winnipeg and duly ratified by council.\nLet us observe that this section 5 is quite inconsistent with the adjudication set forth in the agreement presumably adopted by a missing by-law.\nThis by-law, it is now strongly contended, was passed on the day it bears date, within the meaning of the word \"passage\" in the amended charter, subsections (c) and (c1) relative to the by-laws thereunder, and must be held to mean in law that this inchoate and incongruous business was so ended then and there that the respondents were bound to have appealed to the judge within ten days from date of said by-law.\nBefore considering that fully I will continue the story. The deferred execution of the agreement having taken place on the 20th July, 1908, by-law No. 5050 was passed. Its enactments are as follows:\u2014\n1. The supplemental agreement dated the twenty-fourth day of August, A.D. 1907, between the City of Winnipeg and the Canadian Northern Railway Company respecting the amendment to the agreement between the said parties dated the twentieth day of October, A.D. 1906, is hereby ratified and confirmed, and said agreement dated the twentieth day of October, A.D. 1906, is hereby ratified and confirmed as amended.\n2. By-law No. 4264 is hereby ratified and confirmed, and declared to be now in force.\nWithin ten days of the passage of this by-law the respondents appealed, under the amendment first quoted above, to the then Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba, who then issued a summons which was served on appellant, and on its hearing the latter appeared as the order recites and the learned Chief Justice made an order putting respondents on the list of those entitled to have damages assessed. It seems no objection was specifically taken to the jurisdiction of the learned Chief Justice, but an argument was made that the time must be computed from the date of by-law No. 4264, and not from that of No. 5050.\nThe order made curiously enough refers to the former by-law, but not to the latter.\nNothing more was done until the 10th of November, 1910, when notice was given by respondents to appellant, naming an arbitrator under the Act, to determine the damages owing the respondents.\nNo explanation is given for the delay, but I assume it probably was felt by the respondents that until the works had been proceeded with the injury might not be properly appreciated.\nThereupon the appellant moved for an injunction to restrain the respondents from proceeding.\nThe motion was, by consent, turned into one for judgment and Chief Justice Mathers ordered as applied for. From that order an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal and the order reversed.\nThe appellant now seeks by this appeal to have the order restored. Is it not clear that the first agreement was in fact abandoned and the situation as if it had never existed? Is it not also clear it had been broken and become impossible of execution?\nThe question raised is whether the words \"the passage of the by-law\" are to be confined to the date of by-law No. 4264, or the date of by-law No. 5050, when the former first became effective, according to the conduct of the appellant and its very language in the latter by-law.\nThe appellant's claim is certainly remarkable and most unjust. The language of by-law No. 4264 seems to indicate that that by-law was not to be passed or considered so until ratified by the council, as it was by the later by-law No. 5050.\nIt is urged the language used in the former refers to a then ratification by the council of the amending agreement. It can only be reasonably claimed, at the most, that the language is so very ambiguous that the conduct of those using it may well be looked at as a guide to its meaning, and if so their appeal seems hopeless.\nFor nothing can be clearer than that the later by-law is that which the council of appellant rested upon to give vitality to the whole business about which they were concerned.\nTest the issue raised by the obvious legal position that by-law No. 4264 left the matter in.\nIt would have been most hopeless for the respondents to have acted on the assumption that by-law No. 4264 had been passed.\nHow could they have ventured to nominate an arbitrator to settle their damages ? How could they have approached any judge to ask him to name another, if the appellant's council had refrained from appointing, or a third, in case driven to resort to the provision in that behalf, to fill up the board of arbitrators ? How could they appeal to any judge, as the very sections first above quoted require and entitle until they could present him a complete and valid by-law? It would have seemed as hopeless an attempt as ever was launched to have tried any of these things.\nBut if the court had taken such a view and constituted the board, how, it may be asked, could its award be enforced? What authority could the appellant's council have to levy and pay such damages? Yet these might all have been the realities produced if the respondents had promptly proceeded in the Autumn of 1907, as it is now urged was their legal duty, and got put on the list, and had an arbitration. Nor does the absurdity end there if we look at the long history I have set forth. The appellant's mayor and, if legally authorized, its council, also had determined in October, 1906, no one entitled to claim for injury ; and a year later tentatively reversed this finding whilst waiting for the railway company to decide whether to accept the new offer or not.\nThe times named in the original agreement for the company to proceed had long since elapsed. Their contract, if such it was, had been broken, and the hypothetically closed streets had, as the agreement provided for, automatically reverted to the city by virtue of the terms I have quoted.\nThe power of the city had become exhausted by the terms of the first agreement if we assume a by-law had been properly passed, to direct and authorize it.\nThe adoption, in by-law No. 4264, by the city of this broken contract, was a most questionable proceeding. But until the matters involved in said contract had been rehabilitated by the mutual agreement thus alleged, by-law No. 4264 stood entirely as an offer.\nThe facts demonstrate of necessity that everybody concerned must concur in restoring the broken contract, or in re-creating it in an amended form. And if the old one was to be used, then, in doing so something had to be done by mutual consent to waive the breaches already apparent and accede to the amendments submitted and insisted on. I will not say such a thing was impossible; but I do say that in my opinion it was quite impossible for one party thereto to do that which not only needed waiver, but an entire abrogation of the terms of the agreement then become absolutely impossible when No. 4264 was read, and the farce gone through of calling it a by-law which was to adopt an impossible contract.\nThe clear truth is, nothing could be done, and everything attempted by by-law 4264 was a nullity, until the parties to the contract had mutually agreed. This stage, for reasons that do not appear on the surface, had never been reached.\nNo by-law could, under this statute, be held to be within the proper competence of the council until a railway company and the city had mutually so agreed that the council could pass such a by-law as required to close the streets. Indeed, I think the by-law for the latter purpose could only be properly passed after such an arrangement was come to as could justify closure of streets. In default of a by-law to direct the first agreement, it was null and, in my opinion, no such by-law can in law be presumed, though, for argument's sake, assumed above. Thence no proper foundation existed for by-law No. 4264 to rest on in the way of closing of streets.\nIt is entirely beside the question to point to cases where there may be a by-law properly passed dependent upon the happening of a named event or lapse of time.\nThe foundation for this appellant's council's power to pass a by-law closing streets as provided, had not been laid when this alleged by-law 4264 was read.\nIts first effort, if ever carrying sparks of vitality, had proved abortive. Its second had no justification in law unless and until there had been reached a mutual agreement. It is quite obvious that there was not only a hitch in arriving at such an agreement, but that it never was supposed by the council there was anything to be hoped for until the company had yielded and acceded to the much more onerous terms than those originally proposed to them.\nSuppose all those whom the council finally declared, (contrary to their first declaration and determination), entitled to damages, had proceeded and had them assessed between September, 1907, and July, 1908, I suspect they and appellant's council would have realized the absurdity of the present contention.\nHowever much the curative section 525, to which we are referred, may help over the vicious first step of adjudging as was done and of which I say nothing save to note the gross impropriety of such a proceeding, it cannot help to render competent that which was entirely incompetent.\nI may remark we have no evidence of the proceedings having been taken to render said curative section operative.\nI have the gravest doubt as to the propriety of this whole proceeding. The question of jurisdiction was not properly raised as it should have been, if doubted, and then been followed by an appeal or prompt application for prohibition, or default that the question raised before the judge when the time came for a judge to nominate an arbitrator. As an application for an injunction it raises a question of the discretion of the court, in cases of application for injunction, wherein the imperative requirements of settled practice have not precluded such discretion, and if discretion ever was to be exercised it certainly does not appear on these facts a proper case for exercising it to perpetrate an injustice. Moreover, the restraining an arbitration which has, on appellant's theory, no legal foundation and can determine nothing has been refused. See North London Railway Co. v. Great Western Railway Co.[1]. As this feature of the case was not fully argued I do no more than express my doubts.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. agreed with Davies J.\nAnglin J.\u2014In my opinion the phrase \"the passage of the by-law\" in sub-section c(l), of section 708, of the Winnipeg Charter (3 & 4 Edw. VII. ch. 64, sec. 15 (Man.) ), means a final enactment of the by-law by the municipal council such that no further action by it in the nature of confirmation or ratification is requisite in order to make the by-law operative or effective. Where a by-law provides that it shall come into force only upon its being subsequently ratified or confirmed by the council \"the passage of the by-law\" is consummated only when such ratification or confirmation is had. The concluding clause of by-law 4264 of the plaintiff corporation is as follows:\u2014\n6. This by-law shall come into force and effect on the execution of the supplementary agreement dated the twenty-fourth day of August, A.D. 1907, by the Canadian Northern Railway Company and the City of Winnipeg and duly ratified by council.\nAlthough ungrammatical, however read, having regard to all the circumstances, including the subsequent action of the council in passing by-law 5050, this provision of by-law 4264 was, I think, intended to make the efficacy of that by-law for any purpose dependent entirely upon its subsequent ratification by the municipal council. This ratification was given by by-law 5050 and the time for the appeal provided for by clause c(l), of section 708, ran only from the date of the enactment of that by-law.\nIn this view of the case it seems quite unnecessary to refer to the other matters presented in argument.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Theodore A. Hunt.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Aikins, Fullerton, Coyne & Foley.\n[1] 11 Q.B.D. 30.\n"

By the judgment appealed from the award was declared irregular, but damages, once for all, were assessed in favour of the plaintiff for $225, recourse being reserved to him in respect of any further right of action he might have for the demolition of the dam, etc. On an appeal being taken by the defendants the plaintiff did not move to quash, as provided by Supreme Court Rule No. 4, but took objection, in his factum, to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain the appeal.\nHeld, that the only issue on the appeal was in respect of damages assessed at an amount below that limited for appeals from the Province of Quebec. The appeal was, consequently, quashed, but without costs, as objection to the jurisdiction of the court had not been taken by motion as provided by the Rules of Practice. Price Brothers & Co. v. Tanguay (42 Can. S.C.R. 133) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Quebec, by which the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Beauce (H. C. Pelletier J.), was reversed and the plaintiff's action was maintained in respect of damages with costs.\nThe conclusions of the plaintiff's demande, as amended, asked that an award of arbitrators, by which he was given $300 for damages suffered on account of his lands being flooded in consequence of the defendants increasing the height of their dam at the outlet of Lake Saint Francis, in the County of Beauce, should be ratified; that the defendants should be condemned to pay him the amount of damages so awarded for the period between the 31st of October, 1907, and the date of the action (8th May, 1908); that the dam complained of should be demolished, and that the defendants should be enjoined from troubling him in the enjoyment of said lands and should cease using the right of servitude they had, under the statute, in regard to the use of improvements made in the watercourse for industrial purposes. The action was dismissed at the trial, but, on an appeal by the plaintiff, the Court of Review reversed this judgment, declared the award irregular, assessed damages to the plaintiff in the amount of $225, once for all, and entered judgment in his favour for that amount, with costs, at the same time reserving to him any recourse he might have in respect of demolition of the dam, etc. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe respondent, in his factum, took objection to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain the appeal, but made no motion to quash, as provided by Supreme Court Rule No. 4, and, on the appeal coming on for hearing, the same objection was made.\nJ. H. Kelly for the respondent. This is an action solely for the recovery of damages awarded at $300, and only $225 have been allowed; the demande for demolition and in respect of troubles de possession are merely subsidiary and alternative in the event of the defendants refusing to pay damages. Undoubtedly the defendants have the right to the use permitted by the statutes relating to the improvement of watercourses, but that right cannot be exercised except upon compensation for injuries thereby caused. We simply deny the right unless compensation for injury is made. The respondent has accepted the award made by the judgment of the Court of Review, which has been affirmed by the judgment appealed from. The only question in issue is whether or not the amount of that award should be reduced. We refer to section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" and to that part of the judgment under appeal which refuses adjudication in respect of the claims for demolition and injunction; as to which recourse has merely been reserved in the event of further action being taken.\nStuart K.C., for the appellants, contended that the form of the action was negatoria servitutis, and that some interest in real estate and the use thereof was involved in the appeal.\nStuart K.C., for the appellants,\nJ. H. Kelly for thie respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In the respondent's factum objection is taken to the jurisdiction of this court. The question in issue between the parties is with respect to the right of the appellants to build on their property a dam which backs up the water of a stream and floods the lands of the respondent. In the court below it was decided that the defendants, now appellants, had the right to erect the dam upon payment of such damages as might result, but the right to renew the demand, if the conditions were altered, was reserved to the respondent. The only question in issue in this court is as to the amount of the damages which are not within the appealable limit.\nWe are all of opinion that the court is not competent to hear this appeal. As to costs, I think we must follow the rule laid down in Price Brothers & Co. v. Tanguay[1]. The appeal should be quashed without costs as the objection was not taken by the respondent as provided by the Rules of Practice.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Talbot & Guindon.\n[1] 42 Can.

W. then executed a written agreement purporting to sell these other to S., for the sum of sixteen thousand dollars, acknowledged then and there to have been received by the vendor; bound himself to convey them to the purchaser, with a clear title, within one year from the date of the agreement, and time was stated to be of the essence of the contract. Upon default by the vendor to convey the lands, according to the agreement, the plaintiff sued to recover the $16,000, as money had and received for which no consideration had been given. In his defence, W. contended that the consideration mentioned in the agreement was not actually in cash but consisted merely of lands to be conveyed in exchange at a valuation fixed at that amount and, consequently, that the (plaintiff could recover only damages to be assessed according to the value of the lands which he had failed to convey.\nHeld, that, in the absence of evidence of any special purpose as the basis of the agreement, the terms of the contract in writing governed the rights of the parties that the consideration mentioned in the agreement should be regarded as a price paid in money and consequently, the plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought. Judgment appealed from (20 Man. R. 562) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] affirming the judgment of Robson J., at the trial[2], by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note.\nA. G. Galt K.C. for the appellant.\nHugh Phillipps for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by my brother Idington.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant and the late T. R. Snider owned together a farm and equipment, and the latter sold his interest in their joint property to the former for considerations fixed by the bargain at nineteen thousand dollars. Part of this price was liquidated by notes and otherwise, but the details thereof do not concern this appeal. The balance of sixteen thousand dollars it was agreed might be satisfied by the conveyance of a section of land in Saskatchewan which the appellant was bound by contract in writing to convey to the deceased.\nThis part, of the transactions had between the said parties, took the shape of an agreement (dated 15th October, 1908), which, on its face, purports to witness the sale by the appellant to the deceased, as purchaser of the said Saskatchewan land.\nat and for the sum of sixteen thousand dollars in gold or its equivalent to be paid to the vendor at Winnipeg.\nThat sum the appellant, the vendor, acknowledged thereby to have received.\nHe bound himself to have the said land conveyed to the deceased within one year from the date of the agreement so that he should have a clear title to the property within said one year from date.\nIt was expressly stipulated that time should in every respect be the essence of the agreement.\nThis latter provision, as well as the main purpose of the contract, was so far disregarded that the land was not conveyed as agreed when this suit was launched, on the 11th of May, 1910.\nThe deceased had, in his lifetime, transferred to the respondent all his interests in the purchase money for sale, of his interest, to appellant and securities therefor, and, amongst others, his rights under said appellant's contract of sale of said Saskatchewan land.\nThe respondent sued to recover from the appellant the said sum of sixteen thousand dollars and some other balance alleged to have become due on account of other dealings between deceased and the appellant.\nThe latter claims have been so disposed of that we are not now concerned therewith.\nThe respondent recovered judgment for said sum of sixteen thousand dollars and interest.\nThereupon appeal was taken by the present appellant to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, and his appeal was dismissed with costs[3].\nIn appealing here he urges that in fact the entire dealings between him and deceased in truth constituted one bargain which was an exchange whereby deceased agreed to transfer his interests in the farm and equipment first mentioned to the appellant for the said Saskatchewan land and the notes, money and other considerations which were to make up the balance.\nHe claims that on such a bargain for exchange all the respondent can recover by way of damages is the value of this land in Saskatchewan which has not been conveyed and is all that the respondent has lost by the breach of contract now in question.\nI do not think it is necessary to enter upon any inquiry here as to what the measure of damages might be in such a case of exchange, for I can find no sufficient evidence to support the appellant's contention. All that appears is a sort of halting statement in his discovery examination put in evidence against him wherein he describes, without shewing how, the transaction as an exchange.\nI cannot set aside the written document which this contradicts. Its terms are clear and concise as I have recited. And if I were to draw an inference from those terms and such of the facts as are put before us I would be inclined to say this bargain was independent of the other, and was an afterthought, though possibly immediately after the first agreement.\nAt all events it may well have been so, and, if not, it rested on the appellant to shew clearly and explicitly what is alleged by him.\nIf the agreement was of the nature he contends for, then it should have been made to appear in this now in question.\nI prefer to take the document as it is and the facts that are admitted as to what preceded its execution. Doing so I see nothing in the appellant's contention as to damages.\nHe owes sixteen thousand dollars and interest for the balance of the price he agreed to give to deceased for what he got from him.\nI see no reason to trouble ourselves with nice questions suggested as arising on the agreement by which the appellant bound himself to convey to the deceased the Saskatchewan land. Suffice it to say deceased never executed that document, nor relinquished therefor what he was to get from the appellant; that the latter had a chance given to him to satisfy the balance thereof, but failed to do so, and has failed to shew any good reason why he should have further indulgence.\nHis conduct throughout seems inexplicable. His attempt to get a new trial has been met by the Court of Appeal in its discretion refusing him that indulgence. It is the settled jurisprudence of this court not to interfere with such exercise of mere discretion unless it involves some question of law or a clear denial of natural justice.\nIt is consoling to know that in this case, even if the appellant has at last left on his hands the clear title to the land it lies in a country exhibiting meantime such remarkable rises in land values that if his alleged dealing was a fair one he cannot suffer.\nI think this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The transaction (it was agreed by the parties) was to be treated as a sale for cash. There is no evidence that this agreement was entered into for any special purpose which would prevent us treating it as governing all the rights of the parties or, at all events, such rights as are in controversy in this action. That being so, the executed consideration must be regarded as money paid for which the consideration has wholly failed. The evidence discloses no equity which could properly be held to disentitle the plaintiff to relief.\nAnglin J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by my brother Idington.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tupper, Galt, Tupper, Minty & McTavish.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

The plaintiff claimed damages for the wrongful seizure and sale of his goods by the defendant assuming to act in virtue of powers contained in a chattel mortgage. The circumstances in which the sale was made are stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.C. for the appellants. The judgment appealed from is erroneous in respect of the facts in controversy; there was no tender nor any waiver by the appellants of the necessity for tender. Even if the sale took place prior to the hour of sale mentioned in the notice, it was, nevertheless, valid inasmuch as the appellants were not bound to await the expiry of time given voluntarily and without consideration. If the judgment in appeal can be so construed as to hold that the sale was improvident or that the appellants wrongfully seized goods which are not included in the mortgage, then, such findings cannot be justified upon the evidence.\nWe refer to Ex parte Danks[1] ; per Cranworth L.J.; Halsbury, vol. 7, pp. 419, 420, note (q) ; Hawkins v. Ramsbottom[2]; Major v. Ward[3] ; Williams v. Stern[4] ; Blumberg v. Life Interests and Reversionary Securities Corporation[5].\nTravers Lewis K.C. and Ladner for the respondent. The trial judge erred in finding that the respondent did not offer to redeem in time, and in refusing him damages suffered by reason of the appellants preventing redemption, or in the alternative, damages by reason of improper exercise of the power\nOf sale; also in refusing damages for the sale of goods of respondent which were not included in the chattel mortgage. Reference is made to Bac. Ab. 7, 722; Exparte Danks[6]; Harris on Tender, pp. 69-70; Major v. Ward[7]; Kennedy v. De Trafford[8] ;Latch v. Furlong[9]; Aldrich v. Canada Permanent Loan and Savings Co[10] ; and Ex parte Moore[11].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).I have nothing to add to what my brother Idington says as to the legal rights of a mortgagee who sells the property mortgaged under his power of sells the property mortgaged under his power of sale.His obligation to exercise that right in perfect good faith is fully established by the authorities to which he refers, if authority be required to support that proposition.\nOn the facts, I would add: The only question is whether or not we should reverse the provincial Court of Appeal on evidence from which we must, at least, admit, putting it at the very lowest, admit, putting it at the very lowest, one may fairly infer that the respondent, on receipt of the notice of the appellant's intention to sell, by private sale, the goods and chattels covered by the chattel mortgage, placed himself in a position to redeem them, and, being in that position did actually offer to redeem them within the stipulated time. Mr. Wallbridge swears very positively, and his memory is refreshed by entries in his day-book made at the time, that on the morning of the first of May he went to the office of the appellants' solicitors prepared to redeem and that he was then told by Garrett that it was too late. It is quite true he is not so positive that he asked for a statement of the amount due on the mortgage; but he swears that\nthey were not in a position to give a statement at the time anyway.\nIn my opinion, the basic fact upon which all turns is that the respondent had at his disposal, or could procure the amount required to redeem before the delay to do so had expired. The value of the property covered by the chattel mortgage was worth at least double the amount at which it was offered by private sale, and it was, probably, worth more to the respondent in his logging business than to any one else. In these circumstances, it is not reasonable to suppose that he (the respondent) would allow the property to be sacrificed when it was possible for him to redeem it. I am much impressed by an incident which occurred at the trial when counsel for the respondent, on an objection made by the appellants, abstained from putting in some evidence which it was desired to introduce to shew that Ishitaka was actually in a position to redeem the mortgage. The trial judge then declared that there were negotiations to raise 1,500 on Kato's property and that he, Kato, was willing to let that go in as security for the loan and, on that ground apparently, he maintained the objection to the evidence. That this point, upon which so much depends, namely, the ability to redeem the mortgage, should have been and would have been, were it not for this objection, investigated further is obvious, and I am satisfied that the trial judge refused to admit the evidence because, with all the facts fresh in his mind, he was of opinion that the respondent's contention that he then had the money under his control was sufficiently established. As to the sufficiency of the tender, it is not argued that what Mr. Wallbridge did constituted a legal ten der; but, if a debtor tells his creditor that he comes to pay his debt and the creditor says that he is too late, or for any other reason refuses to accept the money, the actual production of the money is dispensed with.\nEven if there was doubt as to which of the two views of the evidence should prevail, it seems to me that this court should not disturb the judgment of the provincial Court of Appeal which apparently adopted that view of the evidence which the trial judge entertained at the time of the trial and when the witnesses were all before him. The inherent probabilities are that, in view of the intrinsic value of the property, the respondent was able to raise the money he wanted, that the solicitor was instructed to redeem and that the solicitor did his duty in the circumstances.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Martin says:\u2014\nThis is a case in which I feel I must bring myself to say, with all deference to the learned trial judge, that the weight of evidence is clearly against his finding, and the facts respecting the important interview between the solicitors, when the plaintiff was endeavouring to redeem the. mortgage, must be found substantially as testified to by the plaintiff's solicitor.\nChief Justice Macdonald accepts Mr. Wallbridge's evidence as correct, and says:\u2014\nThe evidence of Mr. Garrett falls far short of contradicting that of Mr. Wallbridge, and that of Mr. King, his partner, does not touch upon this point because he was not present when this conversation took place.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDAVIES J. \u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting). \u2014Want of good faith on the part of the mortgagee selling under a power of sale is sufficient, if the vendee a party to it, to entitle the mortgagor to have the sale set aside. Short of setting the sale aside he has also a right to recover from the mortgagee damages suffered by reason of the existence of want of good faith.\nSome indirect motive on the part of the mortgagee operating to the detriment of the mortgagor is sufficient foundation for such an action. As pointed out by Jessel M.R., in Nash v. Eads[12] mere indirect motives, such as anger, that lead only to a properly conducted exercise of the power, are not such as I refer to. In that case Jessel M.R. added, in speaking for the Court of Appeal, consisting of himself and Cotton and Lush L.JJ., as follows:\u2014\nHe, like a pledgee, must conduct the sale properly, and must sell at a fair value, and he could not sell to himself.\nA sale at such a gross undervalue as to lead to the proper inference that a fraudulent purpose existed is also held by all the authorities quite sufficient ground of attack.\nIn kennedy v. De Trafford[13], in appeal (1897), Lord Herschell sets forth the principle to be observed, as follows:\u2014\nLindley L.J., in the court below, says that \"it is not right or proper or legal for him either fraudulently or wilfully or recklessly to sacrifice the property of the mortgagor.\" Well, I think that is all covered, really, by his exercising the power committed to him in good faith. It is very difficult to define exhaustively all that would be included in the words \"good faith,\" but I think it would be unreasonable to require the mortgagee to do more than exercise his power of sale in that fashion. Of course, if he wilfully and recklessly deals with the property in such a manner that the interests of the mortgagor are sacrificed, I should say that he had not been exercising his power of sale in good faith. It is quite clear that when a man has given anotheran absolute power to sell his goods, in a given, event,he must be entitled to presume that it will be exercised honestly and with a proper regard to what honest conduct implies.\nOn the other hand, he given such a power clearly never was intended to subject himself to be hampered in the business or harrassed by reason merely of the goods having brought less than might under other and more favourable conditions have been realized.\nIn every case I have seen, and I have read all that have been referred to, the court has been (when the case turned on the question of sale at underprice) careful to observe whether or not there was anything but mere underprice; and, I think, in measuring the effect of a sale at less than the goods might have been sold for, regard must be had to all the circumstances in each case.\nA man selling at public auction, after due advertisement and proper effort at the sale to realize the best possible price, might be able to justify to the full a sale to a single bidder at a price he could not be able to justify if, he being absolutely ignorant of the value of the goods over which he had such power, had rushed into the street and sold the same goods at the same price to the first man he met.\nIn this case, the goods mortgaged had, a year and a half before the sale, cost over twice as much as the mortgagee sold for; what, it was assumed, were the same goods.\nThe mortgage had been taken to secure eighteen hundred dollars, at six per centum per annum.\nThere was paid before the proceedings in question, a total of $719, according to respondent, and, accord- ing to an officer of the appellants, only $674. I assume the latter correct and that, as he puts it, with interest there was $1,274 due.\nThe appellants allege in evidence the respondent had broken his promises of payment and then a distress warrant was given on 19th April, 1909, to seize.\nRespondent having learned in some way not clear, of this, went on the 22nd or 23rd April, 1909, to appellants' office to get a statement of what was due in order to raise the money. When there he was served by appellants' agent with a notice that bears the date of 21st April, 1909, and says that they had entered into possession of all the goods covered by the chattel mortgage, and proposed to sell same by private sale on the first of May, 1909, at twelve o'clock noon, for the sum of $1,500, and that, unless all moneys due on the mortgage were paid on or before the first of May, 1909, the said sale would be consummated and possession transferred to the purchaser for the said sum of $1,500. I may observe that the notice was not addressed to the respondent, but to the original mortgagors.\nOne Allman, who was with the respondent, says it was after three o'clock in the afternoon, and too late to search the records that day, but next day he would have been ready to pay the amount and take the security offered, and asked for that delay, but was told there was no alternative but paying before eight o'clock that night.\nThe result seems to have been to discourage and delay respondent and negotiations with Allman fell through. Later he seems to have approached one Kato and arranged with him to raise the money; possibly, I infer, on more moderate terms than Allman was inclined to give. Kato was examined and, I infer, was quite willing to have raised the money, but, when asked the question, was met by an objection of the appellants' counsel to it as evidence. Without ruling on this, the court seemed to intimate such a reliance on previous evidence relative to such negotiations that the question remained unanswered.\nI may remark here that, when the solicitor through whom that loan was to have been made was called to speak thereto, similar objections were raised and were met by a suggestion on the part of respondent's counsel that he supposed Mr. Wallbridge's statement was accepted.\nThe court replied the solicitor could not know about that. I merely note these tenderings of evidence on this head and will refer thereto and to the objections later when dealing with Wallbridge's alleged intention to tender.\nThe appellants had sold the outfit to one Bowes for $1,500 on the 18th or 19th of April, to become operative if title could be made on the 1st of May. Bowes paid $ 100 to bind the bargain. He had never seen the goods and so far as appears knew nothing of them except from the list. He had agreed with the appellants, as part of his agreement to purchase, to go up to where the goods were, with an officer, and take and keep possession till the time had elapsed for his purchase to become operative.\nIt cannot be said that such a conditional sale was ipso facto invalid unless we discard the authority of Wigram V.C., in Major v. War[14]. But certainly, in observing that case and its authority, we must not overlook what the learned judge there said, at page 604. He said :\u2014\nI do not give any opinion how it would be, if an undervalue or any special circumstance were suggested, calculated to impeach the sale.\nThis purchaser pretends that what he paid was a fair price, but yet admits his purchase was \"a highly desirable one.\"\nThe officer was instructed to put the goods, when seized, into the possession of the purchaser.\nThe whole proceeding tended much to damn respondent's chances of raising the money which a delay of a day, as it impresses me, would, in all probability, have enabled him to do without the expenses being multiplied.\nIt was a case of one man entirely ignorant of what he was selling, bargaining with another equally ignorant of what he was buying, but willing to gamble upon it.\nAnd even though he does not seem to have got all the goods covered by the mortgage he does not complain.\nWe have no satisfactory explanation of why such haste was made to prosecute the seizure by sending out an expensive expedition in face of negotiations on the 22nd or 23rd to raise the money though the warrant was issued on the 19th and its execution delayed till these later dates, or why the transaction assumed the form it did when both parties were in the dark as to what they bargained about or its value.\nAnd we have no evidence of any disinterested person to speak on behalf of the appellants as to value and none is given discrediting estimates adduced on behalf of respondent. The bargain was for the sale and purchase of the goods covered by the chattel mortgage. Strangely enough the bill of sale to Bowes to carry it out assigns goods in a list of which some never were covered by the chattel mortgage and a number of things covered by the description of the goods as given in the mortgage do not appear in this list of goods as assigned. And thus the respondent is left liable for a balance yet payable on the chattel mortgage though, evidently, Bowes would gladly have paid enough to relieve him.\nIn the absence of evidence of value of these omitted or those wrongfully included this feature of the case is only of some importance as shedding light on the recklessness with which the whole business was transacted.\nAnother significant thing is that the officer seizing says, he was to give up the goods if paid $ 1,500 and his fees.\nWhat is meant by this? There was no such sum as $1,500 due on the mortgage apart from his fees and expenses.\nWas the officer only concerned as to his fees? And had Bowes, in fact, managed all the rest, including the vessel's hire and that of the men?\nA cheque was passed afterwards to the sheriff inconsistent with that but why if these instructions were in accord with, and suitable to the actual facts?\nThe sale would have been hard to maintain in face of the reckless sacrifice made, and the arrogant conduct and contemptuous disregard of the appellants, in their conduct, and all the attendant circumstances here related, of all fair consideration for respondent's rights in the premises; but, when we find, as I think we ought, that early in the forenoon of the first of May respondent's solicitor when calling upon the appellants' solicitors to pay them off was told he was too late, that the goods had been sold, I cannot see how such a transaction should be maintained.\nIt is as clear as anything can well be in this case that respondent, on the 22nd or 23rd of April, as I have taken to be the date of service of notice upon him (though the 23rd or 24th is more frequently given as the time) was negotiating to pay off the appellants, having learnt elsewhere or otherwise of some proceedings being on foot to enforce the mortgage, and that upon receiving this notice he relied thereon and became by virtue of its terms and the circumstances leading up to and surrounding it entitled to rely thereon as giving him the time named to redeem.\nIt is because of bad faith evinced in all I have shewn on the part of the appellants that the transaction sought to be impeached can be successfully attacked. And if we have to add to that mass of evidence the further finding of a breach of common honesty in violating good faith by withdrawing such a proposal knowing the party was given, both orally and thus in writing, the assurance it shews, can we think of the whole business but as a fraudulent device to defeat the just rights of the respondent?\nThe case of Williams v. Stern[15], so much relied upon, seems beside the point raised here entirely. It was held there that there had been no such reliance put upon the defendant's promise as to furnish binding consideration. That cannot be said here. Indeed, I think respondent's misfortune was to have this notice thrust upon him when, in fact, he was negotiating with a man who would have relieved him next day if that had been the term.\nThe fatal tendency of some people is to put off till tomorrow for any excuse what should be done today.\nAnd respondent does not seem to have been an exception to that class and put off till the last day.\nAnd then, by reason of his solicitor having been told he was too late, nothing more was done.\nI think, from expressions of opinion of the learned trial judge he, evidently, at the trial, was impressed with the correctness of Mr. Wallbridge's evidence, though, later in his judgment charitably covering the incident as a misunderstanding.\nIt is quite likely this latter is correct finding, but it does not displace what Mr. Wallbridge states, or his client's rights. And the Court of Appeal has so found consistently with any theory of honest error on the part of the appellant's solicitor. I do not think the appellate judgment should be disturbed. It rests on ground which is distinctly taken in the pleadings and the notice of appeal and on the facts, apart from the doubt as to time of tender, ought to remain undisturbed.\nI may say a word as to the question of Mr. Wallbridge being in a position to carry out his tender. If a man goes with a cheque or anything not legal tender to offer another he is entitled, if the other broadly refuses to accept anything, to act thereon. If the other refuses because of want of legal tender the opportunity to remedy that can be made use of if time permit, and here the time existed, I infer, before noon.\nAnd, short of proof that the tender has been a sham, I see no answer that can let him, peremptorily declining in broad terms, escape the consequences of his refusal. The case of Jenkins v. Jones[16], where tender of the debt without costs, which had not been ascertained, was held sufficient, may well be looked at in this connection and, especially, in light of what Mr. Wallbridge says he was prepared to do.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.The grounds of action relied upon at the trial were: First, that goods not comprised in the bill of sale were sold by the appellant company: and, secondly, that the sale was made after the amount of the mortgage debt had, in effect, been tendered. As to the first of these grounds of action I think the weight of evidence supports the conclusion of the trial judge. As to the second I think the respondent, in order to make that ground the basis of a successful contention that the sale was in violation of his rights must shew either that he made a tender or that the mortgagees, being apprised of the fact that he (the mortgagor) was in a position and ready to pay the amount secured by the mortgage, refused to accept payment.\nThe learned trial judge obviously entertained no doubts as to the good faith of either Mr. Wallbridge or Mr. Garrett; and, I think the conclusion to which he ultimately came after considering all the circumstances, namely, that there had been a misunderstanding, is the most probable explanation of the conflict of testimony which unfortunately occurred. Mr. Wallbridge appears to have had in his mind and to have been only prepared to tender a sum considerably less than the amount which in fact was required to pay off the mortgage and, in such circumstance, one need not be surprised that he and Mr. Garrett should now prove to have been at cross-purposes.\nThe mortgage debt had been in arrears for something like six months. Various extensions of time had been granted and, finally, about ten days before the 1st of May, the respondent had been informed that payment must be made before noon on that day. Further requests for extensions continued, but it is not suggested that the respondent actually informed the mortgagees that he was ready to pay the debt until less than two hours before the hour fixed. The onus was on the respondent to shew that he tendered the amount due or that he distinctly and unmistakably made the mortgagees' agents aware that he was ready then and there to pay it and that, thus informed of his readiness to pay, they refused to receive it. In this, I think, he has failed.\nA further ground of action was relied upon in the Court of Appeal \u2014 that the property was sold at an undervalue owing to the absence of such steps as the mortgagees were bound to take in order to protect the interest of the respondent in securing the best price. It is to be observed that the duty of a mortgagee in exercising a power of sale (as touching the measures to be taken to secure a good price for the property sold), has in recent years been stated by a very high authority, (Kennedy v. De Trafford[17], Lord Herschell, at page 185; Lord Macnaghten at page 192; Nutt v. Easton[18], per Cozens-Hardy J., at pages 877 and 878. The sum of the matter appears to be this. He is bound to observe the limits of the power and he is bound to act in good faith, that is to say, he is bound to exercise the power fairly for the purpose for which it was given. \/If the mortgagee proceeds in a manner which is calculated to injure the interests of the mortgagor and if his course of action is incapable of justification as one which in the circumstances an honest mortgagee might reasonably consider to be required for the protection of his own interests; if he sacrifice the mortgagor's interests \"fraudulently, wilfully or recklessly,\" then, as Lord Herschell says, it would be difficult to understand how he could be held to be acting in good faith. But that is a vastly different thing from saying that he is under a duty to the mortgagor to take, (regardless of his own interests as mortgagee,) all the measures a prudent man might be expected to take in selling his own property. The obligation of a trustee, when acting within the limits of the power, would be no higher, Learoyd v. Whiteley[19], at page 733, and it is clear that in exercising his power the mortgagee does not act as trustee. The evidence quite fails to establish any violation of the respondent's rights according to these principles. There is not a word in the evidence as to the selling value of the property at the date of the sale. Apart, moreover, from the inadequacy of the evidence as it stands there is a fatal objection based upon the principle that, as a rule, a litigant. who intends to rely upon a charge of bad faith must bring it forward distinctly at the trial. Such evidence as was relied upon in the Court of Appeal and in the respondent's factum was not put forward with the object of establishing any such cause of action and was not sifted in cross-examination with a view to its bearing on a claim of that character. Of bad faith or recklessness in the sale as constituting in itself a ground of action there was not, at the trial, from first to last, a single word.\nANGLIN J.\u2014A careful perusal of the evidence of his solicitor has satisfied me that the plaintiff was not, at any time prior to noon on the first of May, 1908, in a position to redeem the defendants' mortgage. For this purpose $1,604.92 ($1,283.65 exclusive of costs) was required. Mr. Wallbridge was, not improbably, misinformed by his client as to the amount due. The latter appears to have assumed from some entries, which he says he saw in some book of the defendants, that about $1,100 was the sum needed for redemption. Negotiations by and on his behalf to raise money for this purpose proceeded on this basis for several days prior to the first of May. Mr. Wallbridge's evidence has convinced me that the money available to the plaintiff for redemption, on the first of May, was only about $1,100\u2014 at the most $1,150. There never was an offer to pay to the defendants, or their solicitors, more than this amount. If Mr. Wallbridge was informed by Mr. Garrett before noon on the first of May, as he says he was, that the sale had been already concluded \u2014 a fact which I should certainly hesitate, upon the evidence before us, to find had been satisfactorily established \u2014 in the absence of proof that he was in a position to redeem, the plaintiff has not, in my opinion, made out a case entitling him to damages for a premature sale. Unless he was actually able to redeem he, in fact, sustained no such damage.\nWithout at all determining that it is so as a matter of law, I proceed on the assumption that the notice given by the defendants to the plaintiff operated as a waiver of their right to sell without notice and entitled the plaintiff to redeem at any time prior to noon on the first of May, 1908.\nI agree with Irving J. that the plaintiff failed to prove that his chattels were sacrificed by the mortgagees or that the sale was recklessly improvident. Neither did he shew that property not covered by the mortgage was seized.\nWith respect, I would allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and would restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nBBODEUR J.\u2014The respondent has instituted an action in damages against the appellants for an illegal sale of goods subject to a chattel mortgage.\nHe claims that he offered the amount due on the mortgage before the hour given in the notice, viz., before noon on the first of May.\nThe only question of fact involved is as to whether or not, on the morning of the first of May, a sufficient tender of the whole amount due was made.\nThe respondent's solicitor says, in his evidence, that he went on the morning of the first of May to the office of the appellants' solicitor; that he asked him for the amount that was proper to redeem the mortgage, and that he was willing to give him a cheque, and he was informed that the chattels had been sold.\nThe appellants' solicitor does not remember having seen the other solicitor, but that, after 12 o'clock, he was telephoned to by him about making a tender and he answered him it was too late.\nIf the circumstances are such as narrated by the respondent's solicitor, he should have made a quick rejoinder and taken the necessary steps to shew that he was still in time to make the offer. But he said nothing.\nBesides he does not prove that he was ready to pay the whole amount due. The evidence shews that the amount due was over $1,500. However, the respondent's solicitor says that he was\nwilling to give a cheque for $1,100, and if they said they could not make up an exact statement to $25 or $50, I would have given it,\nand his own statements go to shew that he did not expect that an amount of $300 or $400 more could be claimed under the mortgage.\nThe tender, if made, was not sufficient, and the appellants were justified in making the sale.\nIt has been stated that the sale was improvident and that the price obtained was not high enough.\nIn the notice for sale served upon the respondent he was told that the chattels would be sold for $1,500 if the mortgage was not paid. It was, evidently, the best price that could be obtained. It did not even cover the whole amount due.\nIt was then for the respondent to find out some purchaser at a better price, and I cannot say that the sale was improvident.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McPhillips & Wood.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge.\n[1] 2 DeG.

The complaint made to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada by the respondents was, in effect, that as similar proportionate rates were not provided in respect of freight, etc., to points west of the Province of Manitoba there was unjust discrimination operating to the prejudice of shippers, etc., to and from the western points. On questions submitted for the consideration of the Supreme Court of Canada, Held, that the facts mentioned are circumstances and conditions, within the meaning of the \"Railway Act\" to be considered by the Board of Railway Commissioners in determining the question of unjust discrimination in regard to both railways; that such facts and circumstances are not, in law, conclusive of the question of unjust discrimination, but the effect, if any, to be given to them is a question of fact to be considered and decided by the Board in its discretion. (Gf. The Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. v. The City of Montreal (43 Can. S.C.R. 256).)\nAPPEAL, by leave of the board, under section 56(3) of \"The Railway Act,\" from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, dated 10th December, 1910, by which the railway companies were directed to publish and file new tariffs removing the discrimination, declared to exist, in the tariffs then in force to points in the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta from Fort William, Ont., Port Arthur, Ont., and points east thereof, in favour of Winnipeg, Man., and other points in the Province of Manitoba, by reducing the rates from Fort William, Port Arthur and points east thereof to Regina and Moose Jaw, in Saskatchewan, and other points west of the said favoured points.\nThe order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, granting leave for the appeal, was as follows:\u2014\n\"It is ordered that the said railway companies be, and each of them is, hereby granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, from the said order, dated December 10th, 1910, upon the questions hereinafter stated, which, in the opinion of the board, are questions of law, subject to and upon the terms and conditions following:\u2014\n\"1. That the applicant undertake to set the appeal down for and expedite the hearing thereof at the next sittings of the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\"2. That if the appeal be not argued at the said sitting of the Supreme Court, for any reason for which the applicant may be to blame, then, the appeal shall not operate as a stay of the said order dated the 10th of December, 1910, unless this board shall otherwise order.\n\"3. That the questions for argument upon the said appeal arise out of the following facts:\u2014\n\"1. (a) In the year 1888, an agreement was made between the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company and Her Majesty the Queen, represented by the Railway Commissioner for the Province of Manitoba, and was approved and ratified by the Legislature of Manitoba, by chapter 2 of the statutes passed during the second session of 1888. By that Act, the company was empowered to acquire and complete the Red River Valley Railway, located between the International Boundary and the City of Winnipeg, and certain other branches and extensions as therein set forth, and by the agreement, which is Schedule \"A\" to the Act, among other things, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the said province agreed to aid the construction of the railway, by guaranteeing the bonds of the company to the extent of $6,400 per mile of railway, and by giving to the company certain other benefits and advantages, as set forth in the said agreement, and in consideration of the benefits and advantages agreed to be granted to and conferred upon the company by the said agreement, it was agreed by the company that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the said province shall always have full power to fix, regulate and determine from time to time the freight rates and charges for transportation upon the said lines of railway, as by reference to the said Act and agreement will more fully appear. \"(b) This agreement was modified by another agreement, made between the same parties in the following year, and approved by the Legislature of the Province of Manitoba, by chapter 17 of the statutes of 1899, as by reference to the said statute and agreement will more fully appear.\n\"By clause 8 of the amending agreement, it was provided:\u2014\n\"That the power to regulate, fix and determine rates, conferred upon the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, by section 19 of said schedule, for railways of the Province of Manitoba, shall be limited so that the tolls, rates, and charges shall not be revised so long as the net earnings of the railway companies shall produce less than 10% per annum of the capital actually expended in the construction and equipment of the railway line, but no reduction shall be made unless the net income of the company shall be greater than 10% upon the capital so actually expended, exclusive of the aid given by the province.\n\"(c) At that time, the Canadian Northern Railway Company was not in existence, nor was there any line between Fort William and Winnipeg, except the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. On the opening of the line of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway, from Duluth to Winnipeg, by the direction of the Manitoba Government, rates were fixed by that company, which were lower than the rates of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from Fort William to Winnipeg.\n\"(d) Between Port Arthur and Fort William and the under mentioned points, under Canadian Pacific Railway Company tariff No. 62, May 1st, 1887, the following rates had been in effect for some years:\u2014 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nWinnipeg, Emerson, Morris \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n133\n112\n92\n69\n63\n491\/2\n35\n351\/2\n391\/2\n29\nPortage la Prairie \u2026...\n141\n118\n84\n71\n64\n54\n38\n271\/2\n54\n311\/2\nBrandon \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n158\n132\n105\n79\n71\n601\/2\n42\n41\n601\/2\n351\/2\n\"After the 'Northern Pacific and Manitoba Government' agreement was assented to, on the 4th of September, 1888, the following rates were printed by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, in their tariff No. 118, October 25th, 1888 :\u2014\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nWinnipeg, Emerson, Morris .\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n116\n98\n80\n66\n57\n47\n35\n35\n35\n27\nPortage la Prairie \u2026\u2026..\n125\n105\n85\n69\n59\n511\/2\n38\n37\n391\/2\n291\/2\nBrandon \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n142\n119\n96\n77\n66\n58\n42\n401\/2\n46\n331\/2\n\"But no reduction was made in the Regina rates by this tariff, which left those rates, as they had been for some years before, as follows:\u2014\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nRegina \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026....\n197\n164\n131\n99\n89\n\"And the board has found, as a fact, that the above mentioned reductions in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's rates in Manitoba, were caused by the action of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, in reducing its rates between Duluth and Winnipeg, which, in turn, was brought about by the said agreements with the Manitoba Government.\n\"(e) Afterwards, the Canadian Northern Railway Company was incorporated and acquired the lines of railway of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, in the Province of Manitoba, subject to the agreements with the Government of the Province of Manitoba above referred to.\n\"On the 11th of February, 1901, an agreement was made between the Government of the Province of Manitoba and the Canadian Northern Railway Company, confirmed by the Legislature of that province, by chapter 39 of the statutes of 1901. By the terms of the last mentioned agreement, the Government of the Province of Manitoba agreed to guarantee the bonds of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, to the amount and upon the terms mentioned in the agreement, and to grant and confer upon the said company certain valuable franchises, benefits and advantages as in the agreement and statute is more fully set forth, and as the consideration therefor the Canadian Northern Railway Company agreed to make a reduction amounting to about fifteen per cent, of the tariff rates then in force, for the carriage of all freight (other than grain), from and to points in Manitoba, and from and to points in Manitoba from and to Fort William and Port Arthur. By the same agreement, the Canadian Northern Railway Company was empowered to lease from the Government of Manitoba and to acquire and operate the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway line.\n\"(f) The Canadian Northern Railway was completed in February, 1902, from Port Arthur to Winnipeg, and in the company's tariff, April 21st, 1902, the following rates to Manitoba points were established.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nFort William to Winnipeg \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n89\n75\n60\n45\n40\n34\n25\n25\n20\nPortage la Prairie \u2026...\n105\n88\n70\n53\n48\n40\n28\n29\n23\nBrandon \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n120\n100\n80\n60\n54\n46\n32\n32\n27\n\"(g) These are the rates in effect at the present time, and owing to the competition existing between the two railway companies were adopted by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, in its tariff, dated May 10th, 1902.\n\"(h) The Canadian Pacific Railway Company was not a party to any of the agreements above mentioned, and was not legally bound to make the reductions it did, in the Province of Manitoba, but in order to hold its business, as a result of competition, it did, in fact, reduce its rates.\n\"(i) Subsequently, the Canadian Northern Railway Company, having obtained authority from the Parliament of Canada, extended its lines beyond the confines of the Province of Manitoba, and constructed lines of railway in the Province of Saskatchewan, which entered into competition there with the lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in that province, at many points, the City of Regina being one of the points common to both lines.\n\"(j) In the present case, the City of Regina has complained that the rates to Regina, from Port William, are higher in proportion than the rates from Fort William to Winnipeg and are, therefore, unjustly discriminatory as between localities.\n\"The said rates are, in fact, higher in proportion.\n\"The board has held that it was not the intention of Parliament, in passing section 315 of the 'Railway Act,'to permit railway companies to create different circumstances and conditions by entering into a contract with some one and so defeat the intention of the section, and that the circumstances and conditions which, if not substantially similar, may justify different treatment of different localities, must be traffic circumstances or traffic conditions, not circumstances and conditions which may be artificially created by contract.\n\"The board has also held that it has been proved that the Special Class Freight Tariffs of the Canadian Northern Railway Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company between Port Arthur and Fort William and points west thereof, unjustly discriminate in favour of Winnipeg and other points in the Province of Manitoba, to the prejudice and disadvantage of Regina and Moose Jaw, and other points west of that province, and that the companies should be required to reduce their rates so as to remove this discrimination by publishing and filing new tariffs.\n\"The questions for the consideration of the Supreme Court of Canada are: Were the facts set out above and more fully referred to in the record herein, circumstances and conditions within the meaning of the 'Railway Act,' which justify the existence of lower rates from Fort William to Winnipeg than to Regina: (a) With regard to the Canadian Northern Railway Company; (5) with regard to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company?\"\nThe issues raised on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.\nEwart K.C. and George F. Macdonnell for the appellants, the Canadian Northern Railway Co.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. and Orde K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners has found as a fact, which is not open for argument, on this appeal, that the special class freight tariffs of the appellants in question unjustly discriminate in favour of Winnipeg and other points in Manitoba to the prejudice and disadvantage of Regina, Moose Jaw and cities or towns, generally, west of Manitoba.\nIt was contended by the railway companies that this discrimination was justified by certain agreements between one of the railway companies and the Manitoba Government. The question submitted on this appeal is:\u2014Are those agreements \"circumstances and conditions\" within the meaning of those words as used in section 315 of the \"Railway Act\" to be taken into consideration by the Railway Commissioners upon a complaint of unjust discrimination made by the Board of Trade of Regina, that city being a shipping point affected by those freight tariffs? That those agreements are \"circumstances and conditions\" to be taken into consideration by the Board of Railway Commissioners, in considering the question of unjust discrimination, cannot, it seems to me, be doubted; but it is for that board to decide what effect is to be given to them in the circumstances and I am entirely at a loss to understand what is the question of law involved. It is for the Board of Railway Commissioners to say, having taken the agreements into consideration as relevant facts, if they will give any and what weight to them.\nThe statute ((D.) 1 Edw. VII. ch. 53, sec. 3) confirming the agreement specially says that it shall not be construed so as to create discrimination:\u2014\nNothing in this Act or in the indentures contained in the schedules hereto, or done in -pursuance of this Act or of the said indentures, shall\n(c) authorize the Canadian Northern Railway Company, contrary to the meaning of \"The Railway Act,\" to charge or demand any discriminating rate for the carriage of freight or passengers, or to allow or make any secret or special tolls, rebate, drawbacks or concession, or any higher rates for the carriage of freight or passengers than those heretofore or hereafter fixed under the authority of existing or future legislation of the Parliament of Canada, by the Governor in Council, or by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, or by any commission or other authority.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014In answer to the questions submitted herein I am. of opinion that the facts set out in the case stated by the assistant commissioner of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada do not constitute and are not \"circumstances and conditions within the meaning of the \"Railway Act,\" which, of imperative legal necessity, justify the existence of lower rates from Fort William to Winnipeg than to Regina, either by (or \"with regard to\") the Canadian Northern Railway Co. or the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.\nI cannot read the questions submitted as counsel for the railway companies contend they must be read; and, therefore, try to make my meaning clear by the interposition of the words \"of imperative legal necessity.\" In any other sense than that I thus adopt I do not consider any question of law, such as can be submitted to this court is involved. In other words, notwithstanding the facts set out, the Board of Railway Commissioners is not as a matter of law (such as may be submitted in appeal to us as provided by the statute) required to permit the continuation of such discrimination.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.-The question whether in the circumstances presented in this case there has been unjust discrimination is, in my opinion, committed to the Board of Railway Commissioners for decision as a question of fact by section 318 of the \"Railway Act.\" That board, in deciding such a question, is, of course, to act judicially and, consequently, to have regard to all relevant facts. Since the decision of this court in Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. v. City of Montreal[1], it is, I think, not open to dispute here that the \"circumstances and conditions\" referred to in the question submitted are facts relevant to the point in issue. It is impossible, therefore, either to affirm or to deny as a proposition of law that those \"circumstances and conditions * * * justify\" (in the language of the question) \"the existence of lower rates from Fort William to Winnipeg than to Regina.\" Whether that is so or not is a question of fact; and the Board of Railway Commissioners is the tribunal appointed by law to pass upon it.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners has, under sub-section 3 of section 56 of the \"Railway Act,\" given to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian Northern Railway Company leave to appeal to this court from its decision requiring these two companies to remove\nthe discrimination at present existing in the tariffs to points in the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, from Fort William, Port Arthur, and points east thereof, in favour of Winnipeg, and other points in the Province of Manitoba, and against points west thereof by reducing the rates from Fort William, Port Arthur, and points east thereof, to Regina, and Moose Jaw, and other points west of the said favoured points,\nupon the following question, stated by the Board of Railway Commissioners as being, in its opinion, a question of law:\u2014\nWere the facts set out above, and more fully referred to in the record herein, circumstances and conditions within the meaning of the \"Railway Act,\" which justify the existence of lower rates from. Fort William to Winnipeg than to Regina: (a) With regard to the Canadian Northern Railway Company; (6) with regard to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company?\nSection 315 of the \"Railway Act\" is, in part, as follows:\u2014\n315. All such tolls shall always, under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, in respect of all traffic of the same description, and carried in or upon the like kind of cars, passing over the same portion of the line of railway, be charged equally to all persons and at the same rate, whether by weight, mileage or otherwise.\n4. No toll shall be charged which unjustly discriminates between different localities.\n5. The Board shall not approve or allow any toll, which for the like description of goods, or for passengers carried under substantially similar circumstances and conditions in the same direction over the same line, is greater for a shorter than for a longer distance, within which such shorter distance is included, unless the board is satisfied that owing to competition, it is expedient to allow such toll.\n6. The Board may declare that any places are competitive points within the meaning of this Act.\nAlthough Winnipeg is admittedly a competitive point, which feature of the situation, it is conceded, is not now material to the question with which we are asked to deal.\nUnfortunately, as too frequently happens in these cases, counsel are unable to agree upon the scope and purview of the question submitted.\nAre the words, \"which justify,\" to be taken to mean, \"which may justify,\" \"which do justify,\" or \"which conclusively justify\"? The first or the third form would raise a question of law; the second would raise a question of fact, and on that ground must be rejected, if any other interpretation is admissible. For the appellant railway companies it is contended that we are asked to determine whether the \"facts\" referred to in the question submitted are or are not \"circumstances and conditions\" which may justify a discrimination in rates and which the Board of Railway Commissioners should, therefore, receive in evidence and take into account in deciding, as a question of fact (\"Railway Act,\" sec. 318), whether \"the circumstances and conditions\" under which traffic is carried to the several points mentioned in its order are or are not \"substantially similar.\" Counsel for the company stated that the Board of Railway Commissioners treated the \"facts\" referred to as irrelevant and practically inadmissible.\nA passage in the notes of the assistant chief commissioner certainly lends colour to the contention of the appellants as to the meaning of the question submitted. He said, at pages 183-4:\u2014\nThe board has held that it was not the intention of Parliament, in passing section 315 of the \"Railway Act\" to permit railway companies to create different circumstances and conditions by entering into a contract with some one and so defeat the intention of the section, and that the circumstances and conditions which, if not substantially similar, may justify different treatment of different localities, must be traffic circumstances or traffic conditions, not circumstances and conditions which may be artificially created by contract.\nApart from the statutory provision, to which I shall presently refer, and which, apparently, was not brought to the attention of the Board of Railway Commissioners, the question, as interpreted by counsel for the companies, is the same as that dealt with by this court in Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. v. City of Montreal[2]. Because unwilling to assume that, with this very recent judgment before it, the Board of Railway Commissioners would again propound to us the very question there answered, I think the interpretation put upon the question by the appellants cannot be in accordance with the intention of the board. If, however, that be its meaning, clause (c) of section 3 of chapter 53, of the Dominion statutes, 1 Edw. VII, would probably prevent the companies from relying upon the agreements ratified by that Act in justification of any discrimination in rates. But, holding the view that the question submitted should not receive the interpretation put upon it by counsel for the appellants, I find it unnecessary now to decide the question as to the scope and effect of the statutory provision referred to.\nFor the respondent it was submitted that the Board of Railway Commissioners meant to ask this court whether the \"facts\" referred to (which counsel maintained had been received by the board in evidence and had been duly considered by it, but in determining the question of similarity of circumstances and conditions had been deemed by the board insufficient to warrant a finding of such dissimilarity as would justify a discrimination in rates) necessarily justify a discrimination and compel the board, as a matter of law, to hold that they establish a case of dissimilarity in \"circumstances and conditions\" which would justify some discrimination.\nTo the question so interpreted the answer should, in my opinion, be \"no.\" The \"facts\" referred to do not per se and as a matter of law conclusively establish such a case of dissimilarity in circumstances and conditions as necessarily justifies the maintenance of some discrimination in rates. It follows from the decision in the Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. v. City of Montreal[3], that, unless excluded by the statutory provision above adverted to, the \"facts\" referred to in the question submitted are relevant to the inquiry which the statute contemplates the Board of Railway Commissioners shall make, and that they are, therefore, admissible in evidence and should be duly taken into account. But the weight to which they would be entitled, if any, must be determined by the board itself and is, in my opinion, the very kind of thing which Parliament intended that body to decide finally as a question of fact.\nBecause satisfied that the interpretation put upon the question submitted by counsel for the respondent was that intended by the Board of Railway Commissioners, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014A contract by a railway company with a province cannot interfere with the duty of the Board of Railway Commissioners to prevent any discrimination in freight rates affecting a city in another province.\nIf a province or a locality chooses to give to the railway companies some bonuses or favours for the purpose of securing some reduction in their charges it should be done in conformity with the provisions of the \"Railway Act,\" and these companies could certainly not rely on such contracts to justify a discrimination against some other localities.\nIn this case, where the railway company made the contract in question with the Province of Manitoba, it was then under the legislative authority of that province.\nLater on it became a federal company under the control of the \"Railway Act.\"\nWhen application was made to Parliament for the purpose of confirming that contract concerning freight rates a special declaration was made in the statute of 1901 (1 Edw. VII. ch. 53, sec. 3), that the Canadian Northern Railway Company, which was assuming that contract, would not be authorized to charge any discriminatory rate.\nAn agreement between a railway company under federal charter and an individual or a group of individuals giving to any persons or to any locality a preferential rate constitutes discrimination under the \"Railway Act.\"\nThe \"circumstances and conditions\" which, if not substantially similar, may justify different treatment to different points, and which are enunciated in section 315 of the \"Railway Act,\" must be traffic circumstances or traffic conditions, not circumstances and conditions that may be created by contract.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners has found that the rates from eastern points to Winnipeg and to Regina were discriminatory in favour of the former city. But it was urged that these rates had to be given to Winnipeg under the above contract and that the Board of Railway Commissioners was bound to give effect to such a covenant. Of course, the question was considered by the Board of Railway Commissioners; but it was not bound to sanction a discrimination which Parliament itself had declared would not be confirmed.\nThis appeal should be dismissed. There is no reason for interfering with the discretion of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nOn the 22 December, 1911\u2014\nChrysler K.C., on behalf of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., moved for a direction as to the settlement of the minutes.\nGeo. F. Macdonnell, for the Canadian Northern Railway Co., appeared in the same interest. Orde K.C. contra.\nThe court, after consideration, pronounced judgment on the motion, as follows:\u2014\n\"The registrar shall certify on behalf of the court to the Board of Railway Commissioners in answer to the question submitted that in the opinion of this court the facts therein set out are circumstances and conditions within the meaning of the \"Railway Act\" to be considered in determining the question of unjust discrimination with respect to both railways; such facts and circumstances are not in law conclusive of the question of unjust discrimination, but the effect, if any, to be given to them is a question of fact to be considered and decided by the Board in its discretion.\"\nSolicitors for the appellants, The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.: Chrysler, Bethune & Larmouth.\nSolicitor for the appellants, The Canadian Northern Railway Co.: George F.

Banton (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1911: October 9; 1911: December 6.\nPresent: Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN\nVendor and purchaser\u2014Condition of agreement\u2014Sale of land\u2014Payment on account of price \u2014 Cancellation \u2014 Notice \u2014 Return of money paid\u2014Rescission\u2014Form of action\u2014Practice.\nAn agreement for the sale of lands acknowledged receipt of $600 on account of the price and provided, in the event of default in the payment of deferred instalments, that the vendor might, on giving a certain notice, declare the agreement null and void and retain the moneys paid by the purchaser. On default by the purchaser to make payments according to the terms of the agreement the vendor served him with a notice for cancellation which incorrectly recited that the contract contained a stipulation for its cancellation, in case of default, \"without notice,\" and concluded by declaring the contract null and void \"in accordance with the terms thereof as above recited.\" The vendor, subsequently, refused a tender of the unpaid balance of the price and re-entered into possession of the lands. In an action by the purchaser for specific performance or the return of the amount paid, rescission was not asked for.\nHeld, that, as the vendor had not given the notice required by the conditions of the agreement he could not retain the money as forfeited on account of the purchaser's default; that, as the payment had not been made as earnest, but on account of the price, the purchaser was entitled to recover it back on the cancellation of the contract, and that, as the relief sought by the action could not be granted while the contract subsisted, a demand for rescission must necessarily be implied from the plaintiff's claim for the return of the money so paid.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, affirming the judgment of John stone J., at the trial, by which the plaintiff's claim for specific performance of a contract for the sale of lands was refused and a direction was made for the repayment to him of the sum of $600 paid, on account of the price of the lands, at the time of the execution of the agreement for sale.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nJ. B. Coyne for the appellants.\nC. D. Livingstone for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought by respondent for specific performance of an agreement for the sale of certain lands to him by the appellants and, in the alternative, for the recovery of a part of the purchase money paid by him at the time the agreement was entered into.\nThe trial judge dismissed the claim for specific performance on the ground of delay on the plaintiff's part in carrying out his part of the agreement, namely, in making the payments it called for. No appeal was taken from his judgment on this point. The learned judge, however, gave judgment for the plaintiff for the $600, part of the price of the land, paid by him.\nFrom that judgment the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, which court unanimously dismissed the appeal, and the appellants now appeal to this court.\nThe simple and only point for our decision is whether, in the circumstances, the plaintiff was entitled under the pleadings and facts to a return of the instalment of the purchase moneys paid by him, or whether that payment had become forfeited to the vendors.\nI take it as clear that in all cases the question of the right of the purchaser to the return of moneys paid by him \u2014 whether by way of deposit only, or \"by way of deposit and as part payment of the purchase,\" or as part payment of the purchase money only\u2014 is a question of the conditions of the contract, and the intention of the parties as expressed in or to be implied from those conditions.\nIf the money has been paid as deposit simply or, as in the case of Howe v. Smith[1], \"as a deposit and in part payment of the purchase money,\" unless the agreement contains something shewing a contrary intention, the payment is held to be a guarantee for the performance of the contract by the purchaser, who cannot recover the money' back in case of his failure within a reasonable time to perform his contract. In order to enable the vendor, however, to retain, even moneys paid as a deposit, there\nmust be acts proved on the part of the purchaser which not only amount to delay sufficient to deprive him of the equitable remedy of specific performance, but which would make his conduct amount to a repudiation on his part of the contract,\nper Cotton L.J, at page 95.\nThe reason, however, for holding that moneys paid either as a deposit simply, or \"as a deposit and in part payment of the purchase money,\" cannot be recovered back where the contract goes off by default of the purchaser, namely, that they are held as having been paid \"as a guarantee for the performance of the contract\" has no application, to the case where moneys are paid simply on account of and as part of the purchase money. Moneys so paid, have not the character of a guarantee and, upon rescission of the contract, the consideration for the payment being extinguished, in the absence of language in the agreement shewing a clear intention of the parties that the moneys should be forfeited, restitution must be made: Cornwall v. Henson[2], and on appeal[3]; Labelle v. O'Connor[4].\nIn the case now under consideration in my opinion the agreement did not contain any language from which such an intention could be drawn.\nOn the contrary it provided in express terms the conditions under which the vendor was entitled to hold the moneys paid as forfeited.\nThe clause of the agreement reads as follows:\u2014\nIf the purchaser shall fail to make the payments of principal or interest aforesaid or any of them, or the taxes, strictly at the times above limited, or shall fail in the performance of any of the covenants or agreements herein contained then and in such case the vendor shall have the right at any time to declare the whole amount remaining unpaid upon this contract due and payable and to take action to collect the same and to deliver to the purchaser a deed to the said land when all of the said sums are collected or in the place of the foregoing, to declare this agreement null and void by giving thirty days' notice in writing to that effect, personally served upon the purchaser or, mailed in a registered letter addressed to him at the post office named below, and all rights and interests hereby created or then existing in favour of the purchaser, or his approved assigns, or derived under this agreement shall, thereupon, cease and determine and the premises hereby agreed to be conveyed shall revert to and re-vest in the vendor without any further declaration of forfeiture or notice or act of re-entry, and without any other act by the vendor to be performed or any suit or legal proceeding to be brought or taken and without any right on the part of the said purchaser or his assigns to any reclamation or recompensation for moneys paid thereon.\nThis clause, I think, fairly expresses the intention of the parties to have been that there should not be forfeiture of any instalments of the purchase moneys paid on the contract unless and until the expiration of the thirty days' notice in writing therein provided to be given to the purchaser and failure during these thirty days by the purchaser to carry out his contractual obligation.\nAs a fact no such notice was ever given to the purchaser, but, on the contrary, a written notice was given him on the 6th April peremptorily declaring the contract to. be \"now null and void.\" This notice was evidently given under a complete misapprehension of the real contract which the parties made.\nIf the contract made had contained the stipulations which the notice of the 6th April recited it did contain, and if it had vested in the vendor power in case of default in payment of any instalment or of the interest or of the taxes, as the notice recited it did, summarily to \"declare the contract null and void without notice to the purchaser\" and had given the vendors the right in that case to \"retain any payments that might have been made on account of such contract as and by way of liquidated damages,\" a very different condition would have been created. It is unnecessary, perhaps, to say that no stipulations of the kind recited in the notice did exist in the agreement, the only stipulations being those set out in the clause of the agreement which I have inserted above.\nMy conclusions agree, therefore, with what I understand to be those of the court below that, under this contract of sale and in the absence of any notice to the purchaser in default, such as that expressly provided for, the mere neglect and delay on the part of the purchaser, while sufficient, to deprive him of his right to specific performance, did not operate as a for feature, of the instalments of the purchase moneys paid. These moneys not having been paid as a deposit and not having been forfeited under the agreement of sale, and the defendants being unwilling to accept the balance of the purchase moneys and convey the land on the ground claimed by them that the agreement was at an end and rescinded and the plaintiff having been refused by the trial judge specific performance of the agreement on account of his delay, I am of opinion that the judgment on his alternative claim awarding him a return of the $600 paid by him was correct.\nIt was suggested that the alternative claim made by the plaintiff for a return of the $600 did not expressly ask the court for a rescission of the contract, but I agree with Lamont J., that it is necessarily implied in the claim made for a return of the money for the court could not grant the relief asked for while the contract was still a subsisting one.\nIt appeared in evidence that, after the refusal of the appellants to accept the tender made to them of the unpaid purchase money, the respondent vacated possession of the land and the appellants entered into possession of it. They have declared the agreement null and void and have acted as if it was so. The respondent failing to obtain specific performance then makes his alternative claim that the agreement be rescinded by the court and his payments refunded to him.\nUnder all the circumstances I think the judgment appealed from is right and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The rule seems tolerably clear that a purchaser who has never in fact abandoned or receded from his contract, but yet been by reason of laches or otherwise,, from causes not falling within abandonment or recession, deprived himself of the right to specific performance, is in case the vendor refuse to accede to specific performance prim\u00e0 facie entitled to a return of the deposit or part payment; unless some facts are shewn that would render this inequitable.\nThe respondent sought herein specific performance which the present appellants resisted and the court, thereupon, holding specific performance could not be decreed, and that there was no abandonment of the contract by respondent, ordered a return of the first payment, of $600,\nThis was upheld by the appellate court.\nIt is now too late to raise nice questions of pleading or relative to the accuracy of view taken of the law by the learned trial judge or expressed by him.\nHe was substantially right in law if we look at the results he reached; and could have amended the pleadings if need be to carry out his judgment.\nThere was not such an abandonment or recession from the contract as contended for.\nNor can it properly be said there is anything inequitable in the result,\nThe appellants had the matter entirely in their own hands.\nIf they had submitted to specific performance they would have got the balance of their money and interest, which is all they ever were entitled to, or a properly framed judgment for specific performance which, when worked out, would have left them with the money already paid and the land, if later default made in the payment of the balance. They tried to grasp too much and have failed in getting all. And I have no doubt that the result will leave them, so far as the mere money to be got from the land (apart from costs of their fruitless litigation) is concerned, the gainers in the long run.\nI think their appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. concurred with Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

VII. c. 32, s. 1.\nNotwithstanding provisions in an agreement under which a private industrial spur or siding has been constructed entitling the railway company to make use of it for the purpose of affording shipping facilities for themselves and persons other than the owners of the land upon which it has been built, the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, except on expropriation and compensation, has not the power, on an application under section 226 of the \"Railway Act,\" (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37), to order the construction and operation of an extension of such spur or siding as a branch of the railway with which it is connected. Blackwoods Limited v. The Canadian Northern Railway Co. (44 Can. S.C.R. 92) applied, Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL, by leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, upon the question of the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada to order the construction and operation of an extension to the appellants' private industrial spur or siding across their lands. The circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. H. Leech K.C. and W. L. Scott for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondents.\nDavies J. agreed with Anglin J.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants had the usual agreement with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company for a siding which was built pursuant thereto on the appellants' land. The agreement was terminable on two months' notice by either party to it.\nThe respondent, Humberstone, desired siding accommodation at a point beyond this siding built for the appellants.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners, on his application, ordered the said railway company to construct, maintain and operate the said proposed extension of the appellants' siding across their lands, taken up thereby, to and upon the Humberstone Coal Company's lands.\nIncidentally to such order and to enable the said railway company to execute it, the order provided that the strip of land required for the said extension, so far as owned by the appellants, should be expropriated.\nThe appellants claim that this order is beyond the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners and rely on our decision in the case of Blackwoods Limited v. The Canadian Northern Railway Co.[1], which was given after this order, now questioned. I think the appellants are quite right.\nThe principle upon which that case was decided was that the Board of Railway Commissioners had no jurisdiction to enforce the construction of an isolated bit of railway which was entirely independent of and not connected with, or to be a branch of the main line or branch there from.\nThe principle is as clear as can be. The Board of Railway Commissioners, in this regard, can only act within the section 221 to 226, inclusive, of the \"Railway Act.\" These sections countenance nothing else than a piece of railway to be constructed in strict accordance with the terms, of the said sections and what others are implied therein as applicable. It is idle to contend that this order can be maintained by virtue of a mere, temporary private agreement such as invoked herein, even if the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company has a right thereby, to use the-temporary siding for its own purposes and to permit others to use. it. Indeed, when closely examined, the order, whatever it may imply, says nothing as to operating that siding, then existent, and fails to declare this, with the extension, one complete branch line or siding. It was because the Board of Railway Commissioners seemed confessedly to rely on analogous private or personal rights that I failed to find any jurisdiction for what they had ordered in the Blackwoods, Limited v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[2]\nAnd the majority of the court seemed to agree that the power to make such an order must be within the sections I refer to. The private right of a railway company to the use of the private siding was the basis, in each case, upon which the order rested.\nAn alleged equitable right by way of estoppel to supplement this was set up in Blackwoods Limited v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[3], and here the terms of the private bargain of the railway company to permit others to use its acquisition of right is relied upon.\nBoth are entirely apart from the powers given relative to branch lines which give jurisdiction to the board in such cases to direct or authorize branch lines, and need no supplementing of the kind in question in these cases.\nIt was not suggested in argument, but I have since considered the possible question of whether or not authority might be found by implication in the wide powers of the board respecting accommodations or facilities for shipping, to direct as it has done.\nI, however, fail to see how they can be used in aid, save by and through the sections I refer to.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I entertain no doubt that, under article 6 of the agreement between the appellants and the railway company, the company is entitled to use the existing spur for the purpose of affording such facilities for shipping and taking delivery of freight as it may be their duty to give to persons other than the appellants. That being so, I can see no reason why, under the authority of section 226 of the \"Railway Act,\" the Board of Railway Commissioners may not order such facilities to be furnished by means of an extension of the spur. The case radically differs from the case of Blackwoods Limited v. 'The Canadian Northern Railway Co.[4]. There (according to the state of facts presented to this court) the rights of the railway company in respect of the spur which it proposed to make part of its branch were limited to the use of it for the purpose of supplying facilities to the owners of the land on which it was constructed. The application was one by the railway company for approval of a branch line and the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, consequently, if it was to be treated as an authority to construct a branch capable of being worked in connection with the railway had the effect of the imposing of an additional servitude upon the lands of the Blackwoods without compensation. That we thought the Act did not authorize. The order now before us leads to no such result; and I am unable, with great respect, to understand why it is not a valid exercise of the powers conferred by section 226 of the \"Railway Act.\"\nI ought, perhaps, to refer to the point made by Mr, Scott, that the use of the appellants' spur for the purpose of affording facilities to the respondent is necessarily incompatible with the observance by the company of the condition prescribed by article 6 of the agreement that the use of the siding by or for the benefit of other persons \"shall not interfere with the proper use\" of it \"for the business\" of the appellants.\nIt may be observed in this connection that, under section 26 (a) (8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, sec. 1), the Board of Railway Commissioners is invested with the fullest powers respecting the enforcement of such contractual stipulations. Whether there is any incompatibility between the order under appeal and the provisions of article 6 of the agreement appears to me to be peculiarly a question of fact for the board.\nI may say, further, with reference to the construction of article 6, that the construction now put forward was not relied upon at the hearing before the Board of Railway Commissioners, and, indeed, seems to be an afterthought suggested by the decision of this court in the case of Blackwoods Limited v. The Canadian Northern Railway Co.[5].\nAnglin J.\u2014Assuming the respondents' construction of the agreement between the appellants and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company to be correct, I think this appeal should, nevertheless, be allowed upon two grounds \u2014 the first, that the spur, of which an extension has been ordered, is not part of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, but is a mere private siding or branch; the second, that the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners either purports unlawfully to deprive the appellants of the right of removing this spur or siding reserved to them by the agreement under which it was constructed, or, if this be not its effect, that the order directs the construction of a branch or siding not itself connected with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and which can only be reached by using the appellants' spur, which, under their agreement with the railway company, the appellants may remove at any time upon giving two months' notice. Upon the former construction of the order there has been an unwarranted interference with the appellants' contractual rights; upon the latter, no permanent or sufficient provision is made for connecting the extension of the siding or branch line directed to be constructed and operated with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway.\nAs I read the agreement under which the appellants' siding was built, it does not contemplate any extension of it. It contains, several provisions inconsistent with the idea of an extension, notably that authorizing the removal of their spur by the appellants, and that reserving to them a paramount right to make any proper use of the siding at all times for their business. In view of these terms of the contract, the provision for the use of the siding by the railway company and that for its use by third parties on payment of compensation to the appellants must, I think, refer to such uses as may be made of it as constructed under the agreement and without extension. Several such uses were suggested in the course of the argument. It was practically conceded that, if this be the proper construction of the agreement, this appeal should succeed.\nBut, if the provisions for use of the appellants' siding by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company and by third parties should 'be held, as Mr. Chrysler contended, to have been made in contemplation of an extension of the siding and, therefore, to preclude objection by the appellants to a proper order for such extension being made, they do not suffice to uphold the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners to make the order now before us. As pointed out in the case of Blackwoods Limited v. The Canadian Northern Railway Co.[6] \u2014more particularly in the judgment of my brother Duff, at pages 96 et seq. \u2014 the appellants' spur, constructed solely under the authority of their agreement with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, must be treated as a private siding or branch, not in any sense part of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. Its connection with the railway, because lawful without authorization by the Board of Railway Commissioners, raises no presumption that such authorization was obtained. As a private siding the board, in my opinion, had not jurisdiction to order its extension, unless it first provided in a proper and legal manner for its becoming part of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. This it might have done by directing the expropriation by the railway company of the land on which the siding is constructed. That would, of course, involve compensation to the appellants.\nIf the order of the board deprives the appellants of their contractual right upon notice to remove their siding, it in effect makes that siding part of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway without any provision entitling the appellants to compensation for the land thus taken. If, notwithstanding the unqualified order for the construction and operation of the extension, the appellants still have the right to remove their spur and thus to destroy the connecting link with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, upon their exercising that right the extension would have no connection with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and, without some further order or provision, its operation by the railway company would be practically impossible. For these reasons, I am of opinion that, in making the order in appeal the Board of Railway Commissioners exceeded its jurisdiction and that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Leech, Leech & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Emery, Newell, Ford, Bolton & Mount.\n[1] 44 Can.

The employer may delegate that duty to competent persons, but, where compensation is sought for injuries sustained by an employee owing to neglect to give such instructions and warning, the onus rests upon the employer to shew that the duty was delegated to a person qualified to discharge it or that other adequate provision was made to ensure protection against unnecessary risk to the employees. The failure of the employer to take reasonable care in the appointment of a properly qualified superintendent, to whom the duty of selecting persons to be employed is entrusted, amounts to negligence involving liability for damages sustained in consequence of the acts of incompetent servants. Young v. Hoffman Manufacturing Co. ((1907) 2 K.B. 646) applied; judgment appealed from (21 Man. R. 121) affirmed. In this case, as the risk incident to the employment of an incompetent foreman was not one of those which are assumed by an employee, the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages at common law. Judgment appealed from (21 Man. R.121) reversed. The limitation of one year, in respect of actions to recover compensation for injuries sustained \"by reason of the construction or operation\u201d of railways, provided by section 306 of the \"Railway Act\" (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37) relates only to injuries sustained in the actual construction or operation of a railway; it does not apply to cases where injuries have been sustained by employees engaged in works undertaken by a railway company for procuring or preparing materials which may be necessary for the construction of their railway. Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson ([1911] A.C. 739) applied; judgment appealed from (21 Man. R. 121) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], varying the judgment, at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nAt the trial, before Cameron J. with a jury, judgment was entered upon the findings of the jury in favour of the plaintiff for $7,000, assessed by the jury as damages at common law. By the judgment appealed from the judgment entered at the trial was sustained except in respect of the amount of the damages awarded which were reduced to the sum of $1,200, assessed under the \"Workmen's Compensation for Injuries Act,\" R.S.M. 1902, ch. 178.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C., O. H. Clark K.C. and Christopher C. Robinson for the appellants.\nJ. B. Coyne for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The facts of this case are fully explained by Mr. Justice Duff and I agree with him as to the general effect of the evidence. The fair inference from all that evidence is: By the exercise of reasonable care in the choice of their servants and appliances the appellants could have prevented, or greatly decreased the dangers incident to the work in which Anderson was engaged, the thawing of frozen dynamite. The trial judge, in his charge, clearly put the question of contributory negligence and of assumption of risk, the two main defences, to the jury; they found that there was no negligence on the part of the respondent and that he was ignorant of the danger to which he was exposed, and there is abundant evidence to support these findings. This verdict was subsequently, on appeal, set aside in part and judgment entered for $1,200 damages under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" Hence the appeal and cross-appeal. I will deal only with the cross-appeal and the verdict awarding the respondent $7,000 damages at common law. I would have dismissed the main appeal without a word.\nMay I say it with all respect: The judgment of the majority in appeal is wrong, in my opinion, in that it fails to distinguish between the liability which attaches to the master in the case of an accident to a servant caused by the negligent act of a competent fellow servant, and his liability for an accident which results from and is attributable to the employment of a fellow servant who is incompetent. It must be accepted as settled law, under the English system, es I understand it, that the master is not responsible to his servant for an accident resulting from an isolated act of negligence of an otherwise competent fellow servant. Cribb v. Kynoch, Limited[2], approved of in Young v. Hoffman Manufacturing Co.[3]. But it is equally well established by the authorities that the risk incident to the employment of an incompetent servant is not one of those which an employee assumes. If the injury could have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care in the choice of his servants, and he fails in that respect, the master is liable: I can see no difference in principle between the liability, which attaches in the case of an accident to his servant, due to the employment of an incompetent foreman, as was undoubtedly the case here, and that to which a master is subject in case he provides a defective piece of machinery for the purpose of that servant's employment. Whether the accident is due to a defective system or to defective machinery the liability is the same. In Johnson v. Lindsay & Co.[4], Lord Herschell, at page 378, states the rule which, in my opinion, is applicable here:\u2014\nIt must be remembered that whilst a servant contracts with his master to be at the risk of the negligence of his fellow servants, there is, as has been more than once laid down, a corresponding duty on the part of the employer to take care to select competent servants; and it would be most unreasonable to hold that he is exempt from liability for his serious negligence in any case when he is not under this obligation.\nThe neglect of the master to exercise proper care in the choice of servants competent to perform the duties assigned to them is, therefore, a source or cause of liability in the case of an accident properly assignable to that neglect. In other words, to make my meaning clear, I quite agree that no case of principle can be found in English law subjecting an individual to liability at common law for an act done without fault on his part; but it is equally certain that the master owes his servant the duty of reasonable care in the choice of his fellow servants, that the\nduty differs in degree with the nature of the employment and with the experience of the servant,\nand for a breach of that duty there is liability. The degree of care required from the employer by the common law of negligence adopted as the basis of treatment of accidents of industry when the mule and the spinning jenny were unknown, the canal boat and the stage coach the only means of communication and men dug and delved by the exclusive aid of pick and shovel, must be determined by a different standard in this age of flying machines, motor cars and dynamite.\nLegal principles remain unchanged, but their application is to be changed with the changing circumstances of the times.\nIt occurs to me that there is another aspect in which the principle of legal liability involved in this case may be considered. The master must use all reasonable and proper precautions to safeguard his servant from dangerous conditions of his property, machinery and tools; and it is certainly well established by the authorities that the law takes notice that there are things which, in their nature, are so highly dangerous that, unless they are managed with great care, they are likely to injure people with whom they come into contact; and, while there is no disability on the master to utilize those dangerous substances for his profit and advantage in the prosecution of his work, there is a clear duty upon him to adopt every reasonable precaution which science and experience provide to reduce the risk of accident to the workmen who are obliged to handle them; and there can be no doubt that, on the evidence here, the respondents failed in that duty. Citizens Light and Power Co. v. Lepitre[5]. No advantage results from the use of unnecessarily harsh language, but the evidence of the foreman has left with me a most disagreeable impression. I deem it my duty to say this much: One can hardly conceive it to be possible that, in our day and in this country, so little regard is had for human life on the works of construction that are being carried forward in so many places, not only in mines, railroads and factories, but in all the trades. The employment of such men as road-master Campbell in the general superintendence of work which involved at times the use of dynamite, a dangerous agency of which he was totally ignorant, gives us an explanation of the enormous toll of life and limb levied on their employees by railway companies. The risks of modern industry necessarily incidental to the complicated conditions under which reasonable regard for efficiency and economy oblige men and women to labour should not be increased by the employment of negligent or incompetent foremen. I trust this word of warning may serve to create a greater sense of responsibility on the part of corporations and other great employers of labour.\nI was much troubled by the objection raised by the appellants as to the effect of section 306 of the \"Railway Act\" based on the Statute of Limitations; but, on the whole, I agree with the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Duff. If this short statutory prescription is applicable to a case of common law liability, a point which I consider it quite unnecessary to decide now, at least it must be made abundantly clear that the facts bring the case clearly within the statute. On the evidence, it appears that the respondent was engaged in a pit at a place called Bird's Hill, distant from the main line of railway, digging sand which was used for various purposes other than the construction of the railway. In this country where the activities of railway companies are multifarious, should we hold this section applicable, for instance, to a workman in a stone quarry from which stone is being extracted to build a hotel intended to be used for the purposes of the railway? That is an extreme case, but it is by such cases that the applicability of a principle may be most effectively tested.\nI would dismiss the main appeal and allow the cross-appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal raises several important questions of law upon which I confess I have had difficulty in reaching a satisfactory conclusion.\nThe plaintiff sued for damages sustained by him while blasting hard-pan with dynamite for the defendants in their quarry. He had been employed by one Campbell, a road-master in defendants' employ, and the jury found, in reply to questions put to them, that the injuries he sustained were caused by the negligence of the defendant company in\nnot employing competent men and not furnishing proper appliances and storage for explosives.\nThey further found against contributory negligence on plaintiff's part, and that plaintiff's injuries\nwere caused by his ignorance of the material he was using.\nNow, the material was frozen dynamite which required to be thawed before being used to blast the hard-pan. The thawing of dynamite so as to use it for blasting purposes unless carried out in what seems to be recognized as the proper way is most dangerous work.\nThe trial judge directed judgment to be entered on the findings of the jury, for the damages found at common law. On appeal, the Court of Appeal, Chief Justice Howell dissenting, set aside that judgment and entered judgment for the smaller damages found under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" The defendant company appealed from that judgment on the ground that there was no evidence of negligence of the company or its employees which would justify the findings of the jury and for which the company was responsible, and that in any event the claim was barred by the 306th section of the \"Railway Act.\"\nThe plaintiff cross-appealed to have the judgment of the trial judge for common law damages restored.\nThe substantive questions before us, therefore, are these two. Does the 306th section of the \"Railway Act\" apply to this case and bar plaintiff's claim, and, if not, is there evidence to sustain the findings of the jury, and if so is the plaintiff entitled to recover the common law damages found, or is he limited to those awarded under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\"? As to the proper meaning and application of this 306th section of the \"Railway Act\" I have entertained grave doubts. In the case of the Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson[6], I held the view that the acts there complained of, namely, the wrongful removal, in 1904, of the siding-track facilities which the complainant, Robinson, enjoyed and the continued operation of the railway without these facilities until September, 1906, when they were restored by the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, were within this section and that damages resulting from the operation of the railway denying the complainant those rights were prescribed at the expiration of a year from the wrongful act of the railway company.\nOn appeal to the Privy Council, however, Their Lordships held[7], at page 745, that the \"operation of the railway\" referred to in the section seemed to signify the process of working the railway as constructed.\nThe refusal or discontinuance of facilities for making a siding outside the railway as constructed and connecting it with the line does not appear to be an act in the course of operating the railway itself.\nIt would appear, therefore, that, in Their Lordships' opinion, these special provisions limiting the time of bringing actions of certain classes to a period of a year from the origin of the cause of action do not apply to a case of refusing or discontinuing facilities on a siding such as were those in question and that the acts covered by the section were only such as were done in the course of operating the railway itself. Applying the principle underlying that decision it seems to me that operations carried on in \u00e0 \"borrowing pit\" by the railway's servants in obtaining sand for the ballasting of a railway are not within the terms \"construction of the railway\" as used in the section. To come within that section the act or omission complained of must be directly connected with the actual construction of the road and not indirectly or incidentally so connected.\nIt is manifest that some limitation must be placed upon the words of the section. \"The construction of the road\" can hardly be held applicable to work carried on by the company such as the manufacture of rails for the road or the procuring of ties for it from the woods nor can I extend the construction of the section to the case before us, namely, the operations of blasting hard-pan in a pit, some distance, it matters not what, from the actual railway for the purpose of obtaining sand for ballasting the road. I admit the difficulties surrounding the construction of the section, but following what I understand to be the view of Their Lordships of the Privy Council in the case of The Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson[8], I conclude that it must be confined to what would be deemed the actual construction of the road itself and not extended to incidental or indirect or outside work or operations of the company in the obtaining or manufacture or procuring of material or plant to be used in such construction.\nHaving reached this conclusion, I pass to the next question, whether there is evidence to sustain the findings of the jury, and especially that one which says that the plaintiff's injuries were caused by the negligence of the company\nby not employing competent men and by not furnishing proper appliances and storage for explosives.\nI have carefully gone through the evidence, especially that of Campbell, the foreman, and the plaintiff, and am of the opinion that there was ample evidence to justify that finding. Campbell, according to his own evidence, knew little or nothing of the proper way to prepare frozen dynamite so that it might be used with safety as an explosive for the purposes required. He gave no instructions to the plaintiff apparently because he felt himself not competent to give them. He may have been fully competent as a road-master pure and simple, but the duties he had to discharge involved the use of dynamite, sometimes frozen, in blasting operations, and he frankly confesses his own ignorance in the matter of thawing frozen dynamite, and his consequent failure or inability to instruct the plaintiff as to what he should do and what he should avoid doing in thawing out the dynamite. The plaintiff himself was found by the jury on ample evidence to have been \"ignorant of the material he was using,\" that is, frozen dynamite, and the crude and ineffective efforts made by him first to improvise or construct a method of thawing the dynamite, and on these efforts failing in placing the sticks of dynamite under or alongside of a hot stove, is evidence, I think, not of recklessness but simply of ignorance.\nIt was contended that, in any event, it was Campbell's negligence, in not applying to the company for proper materials to thaw the dynamite and in not fully instructing Anderson with regard to it, that caused the accident, and that, they being fellow-workmen, the doctrine of common employment covers the case and relieves the company of responsibility for damages caused by such negligence.\nI agree that the parties stood towards each other in the position of fellow-workmen and that at common law the company would not be liable to any of the workmen standing in that relation for injuries caused to them by such negligence of Campbell, assuming his competency for the discharge of the dangerous duties intrusted to him to have carried out. But, as I find ample evidence to justify the finding by the jury of his incompetence to instruct those under him as to the proper way and method of; thawing dynamite and as to the danger of attempting to thaw it in the fatal manner Anderson in his ignorance followed, I cannot accept the conclusion that the company are absolved from liability.\nI find the evidence of Campbell's incompetence with respect to this special class of dangerous work which Anderson, uninstructed, was ordered to carry out, in Campbell's own confession of ignorance with regard to the handling and thawing of frozen dynamite.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba based their judgment upon the absence of any such evidence.\nThe question then is, for me, reduced to one of the onus of proof as to the discharge by the company of its duty. That duty is, as laid down by the Court of Appeal in two late cases of Cribb v. Kynoch Limited[9], and Young v. Hoffman Manufacturing Co.[10], to give the necessary and proper instructions to young or inexperienced or ignorant workmen employed by them in dangerous work to guard against preventable dangers or accident, but such duty is one which the company or employer may delegate to a competent foreman and the negligence of the foreman is a risk which the fellow servant takes upon himself.\nThe foreman, however, or person to whom such duty is delegated must be a person competent to rightly discharge the duty. If that competency is proven then the employer's duty is discharged even where the delegate fails through neglect in the discharge of the delegated duty. But, in the case of delegation to an incompetent foreman (by intermediate superior officers of the company who were, themselves, not shewn to be incompetent), as in the case now under consideration\u2014does the onus lie upon the workman injured and suing for damages of disproving their competency also; or has he discharged all the law requires of him, prim\u00e0 facie, when he proves incompetency on the part of the official whose negligence caused the injuries for which compensation is claimed? In my opinion, on every ground of reason and, I venture to think, of authority also, the latter is and should be the law. If it is not so, then mere appointment will imply competency and an onus will be cast upon injured workmen which in most cases it will be quite impossible for them to discharge. The law casts the duty upon the employer, whether a person or a company, of taking due and proper care in the appointment of his or its officers. That is all. The appointee may turn out to be quite incompetent, but that result throws no liability upon the company if it is shewn that due and proper care in his appointment was taken.\nWhen the workman proves incompetency, on the part of a subordinate foreman, resulting in the injuries he complains of he makes, in my humble opinion, a prim\u00e0 facie case and throws the onus on the company of proving affirmatively that it has discharged the duty the law casts upon it, but which it has elected to delegate. That duty, when delegated, is only discharged by delegation to competent persons, and it is not an absolute duty warranting competency on the part of the appointee, but is satisfied by shewing due and proper care in its exercise. The appointment, however, of an incompetent officer gives rise to the presumption that due and proper care was not exercised in his appointment. I gather that to be the opinion alike of the Master of the Rolls, at page 657, and of Kennedy L.J., at page 659, of the report of the case of Young v. Hoffman Manufacturing Co.[11]. The same opinion is expressed with convincing reasoning by Palles C.B. in Skerritt v. Scallan[12], at page 401, and is called the \"better opinion\" by Mr. Beven in his book on Negligence (Can. ed., 1908), at page 648,\nIn the present case we have the necessary findings; incompetence of Campbell who employed the plaintiff, absence of proper instruction in the thawing of the dynamite, and absence of contributory negligence by plaintiff. These findings cast upon the defendant company the onus of proving the exercise of due and proper care in Campbell's appointment. That onus was not discharged simply by proof that Campbell was appointed by an intermediate officer. There still remained upon the company the duty of proving either that due and proper care had been exercised in the appointment of such officer, or that he was a man fully competent to discharge the duties delegated to him.\nMy opinion, therefore, is to dismiss the main appeal, allow the cross-appeal, vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and restore that of the trial judge, with costs to the plaintiff in all the courts.\nIdington J.\u2014The limitation of action contained in section 306 of the \"Railway Act\" certainly does not seem to have much to do with an action of negligence in operating, long after construction of the railway, works in a sand-pit. The only change made in amending the old \"Railway Act\" was to make the amended section conform to the usual interpretation the courts had put on that section.\nI do not think the long struggle over that should now be given a new starting point to run it over again. I see no ground in this or any other point taken for allowing the appeal.\nAs to the cross-appeal I think it ought to be allowed.\nThe law, as laid down by Lord Cairns, in Wilson v. Merry[13], seems strangely forgotten in many places.\nI have no doubt there exists a very wide if not an entire disregard of the terms upon which masters are there held to be absolved from a personal discharge of the duties they owe to their servants.\nLord Cairns, at page 332, of the report of that case stated as follows:\u2014\nThe master has not contracted or undertaken to execute in person the work in connection with his business. * * * But what the master is, in my opinion, bound to his servant to do, in the event of his not personally superintending and directing the work, is to select proper and competent persons to do so, and to furnish them with adequate materials and resources for the work. When he has done this he has, in my opinion, done all that he is bound to do, and if the persons so selected are guilty of negligence this is not the negligence of the master.\nThe master's duty in the premises existent herein was to instruct, to warn, and to protect when setting his men at a dangerous employment.\nThe appellant company chose to substitute for itself to discharge these duties, a man about as ignorant of dynamite its dangers and the proper means for avoiding and averting them, as any man could be in these later times when the destruction it has wrought, largely through incompetent foremen, has awakened the dullest of men.\nThe company knew all these things so well that they properly paid an extra wage for the higher degree of skill needed at this work than the ordinary workman possesses.\nThe foreman selected does not seem to have so realized even what that meant as to be put on inquiry or get such men\nThe jury has found herein and, to my mind, would have failed to discharge their duty if they had not found herein that the man in charge superintending and directing the work in question was incompetent.\nHe never should have been for an hour permitted to hold his position when the conditions of operating had become such that the work to be done involved a superintending for which he had never been fitted. He had by reason of changed conditions become, if ever fit, then unfit.\nI think it unnecessary to pursue the subject further. The evidence quoted by Chief Justice Howell makes it clear that the jury had ample ground to find as they did and the reasons he assigned need not be repeated here. I agree therein.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. I think the cross-appeal should be allowed, with costs throughout, and that the judgment of the learned trial judge be restore.\nDuff J.\u2014In this case I am to deliver the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin and myself. The defendants appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba holding them liable to the plaintiff in the sum of $1,200, assessed by a jury as damages under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" At the trial the jury made findings which, in the opinion of the trial judge, entitled the plaintiff to recover at common law and he accordingly entered judgment for the sum of $7,000, the damages assessed by the jury on the basis of common law liability. This judgment the plaintiff by a cross-appeal seeks to have restored.\nThe findings of the jury, in so far as they establish liability of the defendants under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" on the ground that the plaintiff's injuries are properly attributable to the negligence of road-master Campbell, and not to his own blameworthy departure from such instructions as Campbell gave him, cannot be disturbed. They are supported by evidence upon which a jury might properly act.\nThe defendants also seek to escape liability under the limitation provision of section 306 of the \"Railway Act,\" the action having been brought more than a year after the plaintiff was injured. Although, in one sense, the injury complained of was sustained by the plaintiff \"by reason of the construction\" of the defendants' railway, it was not so, in our opinion, within the meaning of those words as used in section 306 of the \"Railway Act.\" The plaintiff was engaged in the work of procuring or preparing materials for the construction of the railway rather than in the work of construction itself. If the section of the \"Railway Act\" relied upon should be held applicable to such a case as this, it is difficult to perceive what limits should be placed upon its application when the rail- way company itself undertakes the procuring or manufacturing of materials of whatever kind requisite for the construction of its works. Having regard to the recent decision of the Judicial Committee, affirming the judgment of this Court in Canadian Northern-Railway Co. v. Robinson[14], we think it is reasonably clear that an injury sustained under circumstances such as those of the present case is not within the purview of section 306.\nWe have not overlooked the argument of counsel for the plaintiff, although it was based on evidence somewhat meagre, that because gravel taken from the pit in question by the defendants was sold or given to contractors to be used for purposes not connected with the railway, or the works which it includes under the statute, the pit itself cannot be deemed to have been part of the railway, and that it is not established that the material, for the taking out of which the plaintiff was preparing when he was injured, was intended to be used upon or in connection with the railway. But, in the view we have taken of the purview of section 306, it is unnecessary to determine these questions and because of the unsatisfactory character of the evidence it seems undesirable to do so if it can be avoided.\nIt follows that the defendants' appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe cross-appeal raises quite another question. The respondent was injured by an explosion of dynamite, at Bird's Hill, Manitoba, when in the employment of the appellant company. In the course of removing sand from a sand-pit with a steam shovel, in September, 1907, a party of the employees of the company encountered a bed of hard-pan, which proved intractable to ordinary methods and had to be broken up by means of dynamite. The party was subject to the orders of one Campbell, a road-master of the company, who, having procured some dynamite from some persons engaged in taking sand and gravel from an adjacent gravel pit, directed, the respondent (according to his evidence) to take charge of the operation of blasting. To this the respondent (accepting his own account) objected, protesting his ignorance of dynamite and inexperience in the manipulation of it. The road master (still following the respondent's story) then peremptorily ordered him to proceed with the blasting (telling him that he would be dismissed if he did not) and advising him, at the same time, to consult one of the workmen engaged in the neighbouring pit as to the proper method of handling it. The respondent says the person to whom he was thus referred was unable to give him any instructions except to shew him how to connect the fuse with the explosive; but that, being face-to-face with the alternative of obeying orders on the one hand and dismissal on the other, he chose the former and proceeded as well as he could with the work he had been directed to do. In mid-October the respondent left the employ of the company but, in the last few days of that month, was again engaged to work in the company's yard at Winnipeg by Campbell who, a day or two afterwards, directed him to proceed to Bird's Hill to resume the work of blasting, telling him at the same time that he must thaw the dynamite\u2014which would be frozen. This the respondent (who according to his own story had no experience and no knowledge pf the proper or usual method of thawing dynamite) first attempted by a process (it is unnecessary to describe it) which according to his evidence proved to be altogether too dilatory, and afterwards by placing the sticks of dynamite (on end) around a stove in a box car which the party was using. An explosion resulted killing one person and destroying the respondent's sight. The action was brought to recover damages on the ground that this explosion was due to negligence for which the company is responsible. The jury acquitted the respondent of the charge of contributory negligence and found negligence against the company in two respects.\nBy not employing competent men and by not furnishing proper appliances and storage for explosives;\nthey also found as follows:\u2014\n(5) If the injury was so caused by the negligence or improper con duct of any person having superintendence over the plaintiff, did the defendants use reasonable and proper care and caution in the selection of such person for the position he occupied?\nA. No.\nThe question on the cross-appeal is whether there is or is not evidence which, in law, is sufficient to support these findings.\n\"It does not appear to me to admit of dispute that at common law,\" said Lord Watson in Smith v. Baker & Sons[15], at page 353,\na master who employs a servant in a work of a dangerous character is bound to take all reasonable precautions for the workman's safety.\nIn the same case Lord Herschell said, at page 362:\u2014\nIt is quite clear that the contract between the employer and .the employed involves on the part of the former the duty * * * so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk. It is a corollary from these principles that where warning and instruction are necessary to enable persons employed in circumstances involving danger to appreciate and protect themselves against the perils incident to the duties in which they are engaged it is the duty of the employer to take reasonable care to see that such warning and such instruction are given.\nOn the evidence adduced in this case the jury were clearly entitled to find that the respondent was without experience or knowledge of the process of thawing dynamite and that, a workman thus ignorant and inexperienced having had the work of thawing dynamite assigned to him, it would be a precaution obviously necessary for the protection of the workman himself as well as of his fellow employees to see that, before undertaking the operation, he was properly informed as to' the risks attending it and instructed as to the best methods of avoiding or diminishing those risks. The jury were, moreover, entitled to say that the obligation to take reasonable care to see that such information and instructions should be given involved the duty (if no other adequate steps to that end were taken) to see that the official who was charged with the responsibility of selecting persons to be entrusted with work such as that assigned to the respondent should be a person competent to discharge the obligation. There was ample evidence, to shew that Campbell, the road-master, was not qualified in this respect and that no steps had been taken by the superintendent who appointed him or otherwise to ascertain whether he did or did not possess such qualification. In these circumstances the real question for determination appears to be this: On the evidence in this case, can the company properly be held responsible for the lack of instructions found by the jury to be due to the failure to take proper care in respect of the appointment of the official charged with selecting persons to be entrusted with the duty of thawing dynamite?\nWe think the decision of the Court of Appeal in Young v. Hoffman Manufacturing Co.[16] is authority for the proposition that, once it is shewn that an employee has had assigned to him work of a character such that a duty arises on the part of the employer to take reasonable care before permitting him to undertake it, to see that he has the necessary knowledge and experience to protect himself from injury in the course of it, and it further appears that the employee (being incompetent in that respect) has been permitted to enter upon his duties without any steps having been taken, in fact, to ascertain his competency\u2014those conditions being satisfied, it lies upon the employer to establish to the satisfaction of the jury that he has committed the duty referred to some competent delegate or has made some other adequate provision for fulfilling it. In the case just mentioned the material facts, are stated at page 646 of the report as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff, a boy of fifteen, was injured through his arm being caught by a circular saw while working in the defendants' engineering works. The jury found that there was negligence on the part of the defendants in not sufficiently instructing the plaintiff in the working of the machine. They found that the foreman, to whom the duty of instructing the plaintiff was delegated by the defendants, had not fully instructed or cautioned the plaintiff. The defendants at the trial desired to raise the defence that they were not liable to the plaintiff for the negligence of their foreman, which was not their negligence. Ridley J. declined to allow this point to be taken, on the ground that it was not pleaded, and gave judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed. The principles applied in that case are stated, at page 659, by Kennedy L. J., in these words:\u2014\nIf it be the duty of the employer, in order that he may discharge his obligation to use reasonable care in order to prevent injury to his servant in handling the machinery upon which the servant is employed, to instruct him as to the safe and proper method of working, may that duty be discharged by delegating the business of instruction to a competent person\u2014call him foreman or overlooker or what you will \u2014 so that, if an injury happens to the servant from the failure of the delegate to give any instruction, or adequate and proper instruction, the negligence causing the injury is, in point of law, the negligence, not of the master, but of the foreman or overlooker, who is a fellow servant with the injured person?\nI agree with the Master of the Rolls that the contractual duty of the master to instruct may be discharged in this manner, and, further, that such delegation may be either an express delegation or implied as a part of the known and recognized duties of the delegate \u2014 whether styled foreman or overlooker or anything else \u2014 in the course of his service. Whether in the particular case such delegation, either express or implied, existed; whether the directions of the employer, if expressly given to the delegate were sufficiently precise and explicit; whether the delegate was or was not competent to understand and to fulfil the delegated duty\u2014all these, just as in the case where the employer gives instruction personally or by written or printed notice the adequacy of such personal direction or of the notice, are matters proper for the consideration of the tribunal which, whether judge or jury, has to decide the issue of fact upon which depends the question of the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of the employer's duty to use reasonable care to avert danger to his servant employed about the machinery, and consequently the question of his liability or non-liability for the injury to the servant.\nAt the conclusion of his judgment at page 651, the Master of the Rolls says this:\u2014\nIn my opinion the case must go down for a new trial. If it is established that a competent foreman was employed by the defendants whose duty it was, either by reason of express directions or by reason of directions implied from the nature of his employment, to give proper instruction, regard being had to the plaintiff's age and other circumstances, the defendants will not be liable for the omission of the foreman to give proper instruction. Unless this is established, the defendants will be liable, assuming that, as in the first trial, contributory negligence on the part of the boy is negatived.\nIn effect the decision of the court is that the duty referred to may be delegated; but, it having appeared that the thing which it was somebody's duty to do for the protection of the workman has not been done, then the employer, in order to discharge himself, must shew that the default is not his default.\nHere the plaintiff has carried his case one step further forward and has proved (as the jury have found) that the lack of instructions to him was due to absence of care in respect of the appointment of his superior.. On the principle above mentioned the burden of shewing that for this absence of care the company is not responsible is cast upon it. We have not overlooked the fact that, in the course of the plaintiff's case, Campbell was shewn to have been appointed by Wilcox, the Divisional Superintendent. The passage quoted from Kennedy L.J. makes it quite clear that in such circumstances the employer must satisfy the jury that he has done all that can reasonably be asked of him and that the neglect of duty leading to the injury complained of was that of an employee for whose negligence he is not responsible. It appeared, indeed, in Young v. Hoffman Manufacturing Co.[17], as the statement of facts above quoted shews, that the duty of giving instructions had been delegated and, nevertheless, it was held to be a necessary part of the employer's defence to shew that the delegate was competent.\nThe cross-appeal should be allowed with costs.\nBrodeur, J,\u2014I agree with the views expressed by the Chief Justice. The main appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal maintained with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clark & Sweatman.\nSolicitor for the respondent: George A.

An hour later his body was found some 350 yards east of a crossing of the Grand Trunk Railway, nearly opposite his house. There was no witness of the accident, but it was shewn on the trial of an action by his widow and children, that shortly after he was last seen an express train and a passenger train had passed each other a little east of the crossing, and there was evidence shewing that the latter train had not given the statutory signals when approaching the crossing. The jury found that G. was killed by the passenger train, and that his death was due to the negligence of the latter in failing to give such warnings. This finding was upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, that the jury were justified in considering the balance of probabilities and drawing the inference from the circumstances proved, that the death of G. was caused by such negligence.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note. D.L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellants.\nMcClemont for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Assuming that Griffith was run down, as found by the jury, at the level crossing on Kenilworth Avenue, he was there in the exercise of his right to cross the railway at a place made and provided by the company for that purpose. A train of cars comes to the same place with a right to cross that highway, subject, however, to the statutory duty of observing certain precautions with respect to the use of the bell and whistle. There was failure to perform that statutory duty. The bell was not rung and an accident resulting in the death of the deceased happened. There can be no doubt that, on these facts, a jury might say that negligence on the part of the company ought to be inferred. Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer[1]; North Eastern Railway Co. v. Wanless[2].\nThe answer of the company is that the deceased was also guilty of negligence in that he failed to take the precautions which ordinary prudence suggested as he approached this admittedly dangerous place. For twenty-five yards before reaching the track, Griffith, whose duty it was in the circumstances to exercise reasonable care, was in full view of the track and could see and hear the train approaching, if he was alert as he should have been. It is quite true that the approaching train might have been seen by the deceased as he came to the track, if there was no obstruction, and the noise of the train might have given him warning if nothing interfered. But the train which caused the accident was, as I read the evidence, shut out from his view by a freight train going the opposite way\u2014the track being double at this point\u2014and the noise of the train approaching the crossing, and which admittedly caused the accident, might well be confounded with that made by the train going in the other direction and from which latter there was no danger to apprehend. Under these circumstances, the question is:\u2014Ought the jury to infer, as they did, that the accident was caused by the absence of the statutory signal rather than by the failure, on the part of the deceased, to distinguish, in the confusion of noises caused by both trains, something to warn him of the approaching train and which warning he failed to observe? I think that in view of the opinions expressed in the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[3] we would not be justified in interfering with the verdict. In a note referring to that case, Sir F. Pollock goes so far as to say \u201cthat Their Lordships did not conceal their opinion that the verdict was a perverse one.\u201d I do not think that such criticism might fairly be applied to the verdict in the present case.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014There was such evidence of facts and circumstances tending to prove the respondents\u2019 case that they were entitled to have it submitted to the jury.\nIt is not necessary in any such case to have the evidence adduced demonstrate that a jury must find a verdict. In the great majority of cases similar to this men may reasonably differ in regard to the conclusion to be reached.\nWe are asked to make a ruling in this case that would absolutely prevent recovery in any accident case unless it was supported by the evidence of eye witnesses.\nI do not say that counsel presenting his case fairly as usual, in so many words asks us so to rule.\nBut I do say, that the logical result founded upon the various arguments put forward would be that.\nNo one who has heard or read many of these cases arising from some person having been killed at a railway crossing can fail to have often doubted whether or not under the given circumstances in which the deceased person was placed at the time of the accident, he or she would have heard the statutory warnings if given. It may in a small percentage of such cases be that the person killed was stone deaf or hopelessly drunk and from that or other like proof, courts and juries would be debarred from drawing the inferences they do draw in such cases.\nAssuming the person killed possessed of the ordinary human faculties and of the reason and sense springing from the use of such faculties, courts and juries do infer the use thereof has been made, as a matter of self-preservation.\nGiven the proof that no statutory warning was given, they go a step further and infer that if such warnings had been given, the needed care would have been taken, and the accident have been averted. I may doubt in any such case if the absolute truth has been reached. However, I can see nothing wrong in law or sense in that mode of reasoning. In this case where the man killed was one who, as a matter of precaution, habitually took a longer road than he might, and thus spent daily twenty minutes more than his neighbouring fellow-workmen, in going to and returning from his work, this mode of reasoning seems peculiarly apt.\nI was a member of this court when we dismissed the appeal in the Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer[4], and I certainly think this well within what was decided there.\nNo two cases will ever present exactly the same facts and circumstances.\nThe same confusion arising from coming and passing trains must have operated there as here. The unfortunates in either case might not in fact have been any better off had the law been observed.\nHuman insight is so limited that reaching absolute truth in regard to anything in everyday life relating to any accident is almost impossible. We must strive to reach as near as we can to the truth without being either too self-confident or bold and presuming too much or conjuring up as timid men do sometimes, more or less shadowy doubts to avoid responsibility.\nThis case seems to have been most fairly tried and I can see no reason to complain of the result reached.\nI am glad to find from the learned trial judge\u2019s charge there was no appeal to passion or prejudice.\nI agree in the mode of reasoning which the several learned judges supporting the verdict and judgment have applied to the case.\nI should not indeed have added a word but for the strong argument made for appellant and for support of which, I think, expressions here and there of high legal authorities can easily be found, but which are not maintained by the great general mass of authoritative decisions on the subject.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The body of the deceased James A. Griffith was found beside the railway track of the appellants, the Grand Trunk Railway Company, near Hamilton, about an hour after he left his place of work for his home on the evening of the 29th December, 1909. At the trial of the action (brought by the respondents, Griffith\u2019s widow and children) out of which the appeal arises, the jury found that he had been run down by an eastbound passenger train of the appellants at the Kenilworth Avenue crossing about 350 yards west of the place where his body was found and that the accident was due to the negligence of the appellants\u2019 servants in not giving the statutory signals as the train approached the crossing. It is not denied that Griffith\u2019s death was due to his being struck by the train in question, but the verdict is impeached in two respects: 1st, That there is no evidence properly leading to the conclusion that Griffith was at the crossing when he was struck down; and 2nd, there was none from which the jury could determine with any reasonable certainty that Griffith came into collision with the train as the result of this default on the part of the company\u2019s servants.\nIt will be convenient to deal first with the second ground of appeal and for the purpose of dealing with it I shall assume that the deceased was crossing the track at Kenilworth Avenue, when he met his death; and that as the east-bound train approached the high- way the bell of the locomotive was not ringing as the statute requires. The question arising on this topic is whether the plaintiff has shewn facts which justify the inference that Griffith\u2019s presence on the eastbound track at the moment he was struck by the train was due to the fact that the statutory signal referred to was not given?\nBefore examining the facts with a view to answering this question there are two general observations which I think ought to be made. The first of them is this. When a plaintiff in such a case as this proves facts justifying the conclusion that the default of the defendant has materially contributed to the accident in the sense that without that default the accident would not have happened he thereby establishes a prim\u00e2 facie case\u2014unless the facts disclosed fairly and reasonably viewed make it impossible in the absence of further evidence to escape the conclusion that the negligence of the injured person has also been a factor in producing the harm complained of.\nI dwell upon this because I think the able and interesting argument of Mr. McCarthy did to some extent involve the fallacious assumption that the plaintiff must as a necessary element in his case exclude the hypothesis of the victim\u2019s contributory negligence. The plaintiff must fail if he cannot connect the injury complained of with the defendants\u2019 negligence without at the same time proving facts which no reasonable tribunal could hold to be consistent with the absence of contributory negligence on the part of the victim; but he is entitled to succeed if he convinces the jury on facts reasonably leading to that conclusion that the defendants\u2019 negligence has materially contributed to the mishap and if at the same time the jury may reasonably find and do find that the defendants have failed to discharge the onus placed on them to shew that there has been such contributory negligence. This appears to me to be quite conclusively demonstrated by the judgment of Lord Watson in Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co.[5], in which Lord Blackburn concurred, and by the judgments in the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[6] which Lord Watson mentions.\nI will not put in my own words the second observation; but will quote the words of the Lord Chancellor in Richard Evans & Co. v. Astley[7]:\u2014\nIt is, of course, impossible to lay down in words any scale or standard by which you can measure the degree of proof which will suffice to support a particular conclusion of fact. The applicant must prove his case. This does not mean that he must demonstrate his case. If the more probable conclusion is that for which he contends, and there is anything pointing to it, then there is evidence for a court to act upon. Any conclusion short of certainty may be miscalled conjecture or surmise, but courts, like individuals, habitually act upon a balance of probabilities.\nIt is quite unnecessary, doubtless, to say so\u2014but if it should be supposed that the principle thus stated by the Lord Chancellor involves any new departure all doubts on that point may be allayed by referring of Lord Cairns\u2019s judgment in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery6, at pages 1166 and 1167, Lord Selborne\u2019s judgment in the same case, at pages 1190 and 1191, and Lord O\u2019Hagan\u2019s judgment at page 1184; to the judgments of Lord Esher, and Lopes and Kay L.JJ., Smith v. South Eastern Railway Co.[8], at pages 183, 185 and 188, Lord Her- schell, in Peart v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[9], as well as to the judgments of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[10] (Lord Macnaghten) at page 76, and in Toronto Railway Co. v. King[11] (Lord Atkinson) at pages 264 et seq.\nIn this case the relevant facts in evidence are\u2014I am proceeding on the assumption above mentioned\u2014that there were two tracks at the crossing in question; that at the time the accident occurred, about 5 o\u2019clock of a December evening, two trains were approaching the crossing, one eastbound on the south track, and the other westbound on the north track and these trains met and passed each other almost immediately after the eastbound train had cleared the crossing; on the train approaching from the east the bell was ringing, on the other the bell was not ringing. It is important to add that as Griffith walking south came to the railway line his view towards the west would be cut off by a high fence until he reached a point twenty-five yards north of the line and that after reaching that point his vision towards both the right and the left was unobstructed. The first question we have to decide is whether from this state of facts the conclusion could fairly be deduced that the accident would not have happened if the bell had been rung.\nI think the jury might properly consider that as Griffith approached the crossing he would see the west-bound freight train and hear its bell and that until he passed the fence on his right he could not see the eastbound passenger train; and that hearing no bell from the west he would be thrown off his guard in respect of trains approaching from that side and would naturally give his attention exclusively to the train he both saw and heard on his left.\nIt is clear that if after Griffith had passed the fence which was on his right he had glanced along the line westward from that side of the crossing he must have seen the eastbound train; and on the hypothesis that he did so, it is equally clear it would be impossible to justify the conclusion that the failure to ring the bell had anything to do with his death. If the deceased saw the passenger train and either rashly attempted to cross in front of it or was led to attempt to cross by his own error in miscalculating the position or speed of the train\u2014in either case there could be no ground for connecting the failure to ring the bell with the accident; and the important question appears to be whether the jury could properly infer that the eastbound train was not observed by the deceased until at all events it was too late to enable him to save himself. I think they might do so. I think they might properly consider that in the circumstances hearing no bell from the east and having his vision in that direction obstructed by the fence on that side while the freight train at the same time was in full view west of the crossing, he not unnaturally might and probably did proceed without thought of possible danger from the opposite direction.\nThe other hypothesis\u2014that seeing the eastbound train he was led into attempting to cross by an error of judgment as to the position or speed of the train might no doubt, considered in itself, be a possible explanation of what occurred. But I do not think the examination of these two rival hypotheses could properly be withdrawn from the jury. They presented a question for the jury in my opinion for this reason. The first proceeds upon the theory that that happened which in the ordinary course of events would be likely to happen as the result of the failure to ring the bell assuming Griffith to have acted in a way in which according to common experience the jury might reasonably consider it unlikely that an ordinary person having experience of the railway practice respecting signals for highway crossings would act. The other involves the assumption that Griffith acted in a way in which the jury might properly think only a very rash man would act. I think the plaintiff having thus connected the accident with the fault of the defendants by proving such negligence on their part as was calculated according to the common course of experience to result in just such an eventuality as that which happened in fact it was for the jury to consider the weight of any suggestion that the victim brought disaster upon himself by an attempt to do something in itself extraordinary or something which in the particular circumstances the jury would be entitled to think an ordinary person would be unlikely to do. The plaintiff\u2019s case appears to be in that position and that I think is sufficient to bring it within the principle stated by the Lord Chancellor and already quoted.\nEach of the cases referred to above affords an illustration of this method of dealing with such questions. In Slattery\u2019s case the victim had been killed while attempting to pass in front of a train which he could not have failed to see if he had looked in the direction from which it was approaching. Nobody knew whether he saw the train or not. There was evidence from which the jury might have inferred that he knew it was the practice of trains before passing the locality in question to give warning of their approach by whistling and there was evidence that at the moment of crossing he was in a preoccupied state of mind. The majority of the Law Lords held it to be a question for the jury whether he was put off his guard by the failure of the train to whistle or whether on the other hand he saw the train but rashly or through excusable error of judgment attempted to pass before it. In Smith v. South Eastern Railway Co.[12] nobody knew whether the victim had or had not seen the train which ran him down; but the practice was (as the man who was killed might be supposed to know) that when a train was approaching the crossing at which the accident occurred the gate-keeper stood there and informed the driver by signal whether or not the line was clear; and the train which caused the death of the victim passed the crossing immediately after he had left the gate-keeper sitting in his cottage. It was considered by the Court of Appeal that from these circumstances the jury might infer that the victim had been led into a sense of security by his knowledge that the gate-keeper was not at his accustomed post when a train was about to pass and that he had not seen the train until it was too late to escape. In Toronto Railway Co. v. King[13] there is another example of a similar mode of reasoning. In Dominion Cartridge Co. v. McArthur[14] the injury complained of arose from an explosion in a cartridge factory. One of the machines had defects which might have been expected to lead to such an explosion, notwithstanding the absence of any carelessness on the part of the victim who at the time of the explosion was engaged in working it. There was no suggestion of negligence on his part, and it was held to be a proper inference that the explosion arose from the defects proved. I may add that in Crouch v. P\u00e8re Marquette, recently decided in this court, (where it was shewn that the signals given by a train approaching a highway were calculated to mislead and that the signpost had been removed from the crossing), it was held that the jury might infer that the death of the victim, a traveller on the highway, was due to his being misled by the signals or deceived as to the point at which the track crossed the highway; and that it was for them to say whether the rival suggestion that the victim\u2019s horse had taken fright when approaching the railway line was to be accepted or rejected.\nIf the jury considered the weight of probability to favour the conclusion that Griffith did not see the passenger train in time to escape it, then it seems clear that the question of contributory negligence could not be withdrawn from the jury. The considerations to which the majority of the Law Lords give effect in Slattery\u2019s case and which prevailed in Smith v. South Eastern Railway Co.[15], and in Toronto Railway Co. v. King[16], appear to be entirely applicable.\nI quote in extenso two passages from the judgments in Smith v. South Eastern Railway Co.15 At pages 185 and 186 Lopes L.J. says:\u2014\nThen it was said that this case fell within the authority of Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co.[17], because the circum- stances under which the deceased came by his death were not known, and that the evidence given for the plaintiff was at the best equally consistent with the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband having been caused by his own negligence as with its having been caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence. It was said that the train carried lights, that it could be seen more than 600 yards off, and that the driver sounded his whistle; and, therefore, that the deceased man must have been guilty of contributory negligence by reason of the reckless way in which he crossed the line. Of course, if that could be established, the argument which the defendants\u2019 counsel based upon Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co.[18] might be sustained. The question is whether on this point the case could have been withdrawn from the jury. Can it be said that the evidence was equally consistent with the view that the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband was caused by his own negligence as with the view that it was caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence? I have felt some difficulty on this point; but on consideration the case strikes me in this way. The deceased appears to have known the crossing and the practice there with regard to the signalling of trains. Was it not a question for the jury whether the deceased, finding that the signalman remained sitting at his lodge and was making no attempt to signal any approaching train, might not reasonably have supposed that he could safely cross the rails without taking the precaution of looking up and down the line or listening for the whistle of a train? On consideration I have come to the conclusion that on this question there was evidence for the jury, and, if I had been trying the case, I do not think I could have withdrawn it from them.\nThe observations of Lord Esher at pages 183 and 184, are to the same effect:\u2014\nThe deceased man lived in the neighbourhood, and had been at the crossing on previous occasions. I think there was evidence from which the jury might infer that he knew that Judges had to perform the services which I have mentioned for the company, whenever a train was passing over the crossing; and, that being so, they might on the evidence, take the view that, under the circumstances, it was not a want of reasonable care on the part of the deceased to presume that, as Judges remained in his house, no train was coming, and, therefore, he might go over the crossing in safety without taking the precaution of looking up and down the line, or any other such precaution as might otherwise be necessary. If that be so, there was evidence for the jury upon the question whether there was any want of reasonable care on his part. In saying this, I think I am acting on the view expressed by Lord Cairns in the case of Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[19]. He seems in that case to have thought that, if a man had a right to suppose from his knowledge of the practice at the station that an approaching train would whistle, the jury might come to the conclusion that the absence of whistling had thrown him off his guard, and had produced in him a state of mind in which he might not unreasonably suppose that it was unnecessary for him to look out before crossing to see whether a train was coming. So here, I think, in the ease of a man who knew the practice at the crossing, the jury might say that the fact that the signalman remained in his house produced in his mind a sense of security which would prevent its being a want of reasonable care not to look up and down the line to see whether a train was coming. Therefore, without entering into all the questions which have been discussed during the argument, I think the considerations which I have mentioned are sufficient to determine this case, and to entitle the judge at the trial to decline to withdraw the case from the jury.\nThe remaining question stands thus. There was evidence from which the jury might conclude that Griffith habitually avoided the railway. There is no reason for supposing that on the occasion in question he did not follow his usual practice except the fact that his body was found a considerable distance from the crossing. I think the question whether the situation of the body was so inconsistent with the supposition that he was on the crossing when he was struck as to lead to the inference that he was killed while walking on the track or to leave the whole matter too doubtful to justify any conclusion upon it was a question of fact which could not be withdrawn from the jury; and I think it is quite impossible to say that their verdict on this point was an unreasonable one.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendants appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario upholding a verdict against them for damages for the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband. The plaintiff\u2019s case is that, while lawfully crossing the defendants\u2019 railway track on Kenilworth Avenue in the City of Hamilton in returning from his work to his home on the evening of the 29th December, 1909, her husband was struck and killed by a train of the defendant company which had failed to give the requisite statutory warning of its approach, and that this omission of duty was the cause of the accident.\nAt the trial and in the Court of Appeal the defendants contended that it was not established by the evidence whether the deceased had been killed by the train in question or by a train which had gone over the crossing shortly before, as to which no proof of breach of statutory duty had been given. The jury found against the appellants upon this point; the Court of Appeal confirmed the finding; and it was expressly accepted by counsel for the appellants at bar in this court\nIn support of their appeal the defendants now take two grounds: first, that there was no evidence to sustain the finding that the deceased when struck by the train was on the highway crossing; and secondly, that, although the omission of the statutory signal had been proved, upon the evidence it was a mere surmise or conjecture and not a legitimate inference that this was the cause of the accident.\nThere was no eye witness of the accident. The train which must now be taken to have struck the deceased was travelling in an easterly direction. His body was found some 350 yards to the east of Kenilworth Avenue crossing; his dinner can and a mitten were picked up some fifty yards farther west than the body, and at the latter point there were also found traces of blood and hair upon the rails. There is no evidence of any indicia of the accident nearer to the crossing. Several of the plaintiff\u2019s fellow-workmen testified that it was his habit in returning to his home not to walk along the railway as other workmen did, but to cross it at Kenilworth Avenue. He was never known to have followed the railway track in going home. There was some evidence by two of his fellow-workmen, who, on the night in question, were walking home along the railway track, that, at a point about 110 yards to the west of Kenilworth Avenue, they were overtaken by the train which killed the deceased, and that looking up the track they did not see any person on the railway right of way either at the crossing or beyond it. The plaintiff also stated in evidence that she had warned her husband of the danger of walking upon the track and that he had assured her that he never did so. I, however, exclude this latter piece of evidence from consideration, as I think its admissibility very doubtful.\nHaving regard to the other evidence to which I have alluded and to the fact that it should not be assumed that an illegal act, such as trespassing upon the railway right of way would have been, was committed by the deceased, would a jury be justified in inferring that he was on the crossing when struck by the train; or does the mere fact of his body being found 350 yards east of the crossing preclude that inference? Had the body been found only a few yards from the crossing the jury\u2019s finding could not, I think, have been questioned. That the deceased was carried some distance by the engine is manifest from the fact that his can and mitten were found 50 yards nearer to the crossing than his body. That the bodies of men and of animals struck by railway engines are sometimes carried by them for considerable distances is well known. There was no evidence given of anything in the condition of the body or in its position with regard to the railway tracks when found which would indicate whether it had or had not been carried any considerable distance. In these circumstances it was, I think, for the jury to determine what weight should be given to the fact that the body was found where it was. It was for them to say whether, it being clear that the body had been carried for some distance, it was reasonable in the circumstances to infer that it had been carried the whole 350 yards. It was within their province to decide whether the inference that the deceased had followed his usual course in returning home on the night in question and that he had, therefore, been struck on the crossing was rendered unsafe and improper because of the distance from it at which the body of the unfortunate man was found. The jury having drawn this inference, although the case is certainly a very close one, I am not prepared to say that their finding, affirmed by the provincial Court of Appeal, should now be set aside.\nUpon the second question two considerations are pressed on behalf of the defendants; first, that a person coming towards the crossing, as the deceased did, could have a clear and unobstructed view of an approaching train for 25 yards before he reached the rails and that, had he looked when at that distance, or at any time thereafter before he crossed the tracks, Griffith could not have failed to see the train; it is, therefore, urged that his death should be ascribed rather to his failure to take ordinary care than to the defendants\u2019 omission of their statutory duty; in the second place, it is said that the train, when approaching the crossing, was ascending a grade, and that in doing so the engine made so much noise that, as the plaintiff herself says, it was audible to her standing in her doorway half a mile east of the crossing; and she adds that she also saw the light from the fire-box reflected on the escaping smoke and steam. The appellants maintain that it is, therefore, a pure conjecture that Griffith would have heard the omitted signal, had it been given.\nIn support of his contention that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury Mr. McCarthy urged that the fact that the accident might be attributed to failure of the deceased to look or listen before crossing the railway rendered it impossible for the jury to find, except as a mere guess or surmise, that breach of duty on the part of the defendants was the cause of the accident. The conduct of the deceased is primarily of importance upon the issue of contributory negligence. With that issue the jury must deal, the burden of proof being upon the defendants. It certainly cannot be laid down as an absolute rule that failure to look and listen before crossing a railway must in every instance and in all circumstances be held to be contributory negligence sufficient to debar relief. There may be circumstances which wholly excuse that omission. That the deceased might have been in a flurried state of mind owing to anxiety to procure a ticket for a friend was deemed a consideration which could not have been withdrawn from the jury in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[20]. In the present instance the evidence establishes that when Griffith reached the Kenilworth Avenue crossing, assuming him to have been struck on that crossing as found by the jury, there was a freight train approaching from the east. This train, it is proved, gave the statutory signals for the crossing, and it is quite possible that his attention may have been so absorbed by it that, for that reason, he failed to hear or observe the train coming in the opposite direction. It is for the jury to determine whether, in these circumstances, his failure to look to the west when about to cross the tracks amounted to contributory negligence.\nThen it is urged that, having regard to the presence of the freight train and to the fact that the deceased presumably failed to hear the great noise made by the engine of the passenger train which struck him, it must be the veriest conjecture or surmise to say that if the latter train had given the statutory signals they would have attracted the attention of the deceased and prevented the accident. This method of presenting the defendants\u2019 case is certainly captivating. We have, however, the fact that Parliament has deemed it wise to enact that railway trains approaching highway crossings shall give certain signals not for the purpose of attracting the attention of those who are already on the alert and need no warning, but for the purpose of arousing those who are distracted or whose attention is absorbed owing to whatever cause and who, therefore, need warning. Parliament has specified the particular signals which in its judgment are best fitted to serve this purpose. Where it is clearly proved that those signals have been omitted and that an accident, which the giving of them might have prevented, has occurred, it must, I think, always be within the province of a jury to say whether or not, having regard to all these circumstances, the breach of statutory duty should be taken to be the determining cause of the accident. The moment the decision is reached that the statutory signals, if given, might have prevented the accident and there is evidence of their omission, it is not proper for the trial judge to withdraw the case from the jury, (unless, indeed, what is incontrovertibly contributory negligence is admitted or is so clearly proved in the plaintiff\u2019s own case that it would be proper to direct a jury to find it) and if, upon the case being submitted to them, the jury see fit to draw the inference that the omission of the signals was in fact the cause of the accident, it is not competent for an appellate court to disturb that conclusion. Had I been trying this case without a jury I am by no means satisfied that I should have reached the conclusion at which the jury arrived. But, as has been pointed out time and again an appellate judge should not, for that reason, interfere.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed.

The agent filled in one of the blank notes and used it for his own purposes. In an action by the holder W. swore, and the trial judge found as a fact, that the notes were not to be used until he had been notified and authorized their use. He also found that the circumstances attending the discount of the note by the agent were such as to put the holder on inquiry as to the latter\u2019s authority. The first finding was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (24 Ont. L.R. 122), Fitzpatrick C.J. dubitante, that secs. 31 and 32 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d did not apply and the holder could not recover.\nHeld, per Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014The finding of the trial judge that the circumstances never arose upon which the agent had authority to use the note was not so clearly wrong as to justify a second appellate court in setting it aside.\nHeld, per Idington J.\u2014The finding of the trial judge that the holder was put on inquiry as to the agent\u2019s authority was justified by the evidence and bars the right to recover.\nHeld, per Duff J.\u2014The evidence establishes that the agent had no authority to use the note.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants. The facts of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nBicknell K.C. for the appellants. In Smith v. Prosser[2] the note was negotiated before completion. That case, therefore, does not apply here.\nThe defendant is estopped from denying his agent\u2019s authority. See Ewing v. Dominion Bank[3]; Lloyd\u2019s Bank v. Cooke[4].\nChoppin for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I grant that a man in his dealings with those in whose honesty he has reason to repose confidence is not expected to take such precautions as make the commission of a crime, which he has no reason to anticipate, impossible; but, on the other hand, all men are under the obligation to exercise, in their relations with their fellow men, the care and caution of \u201can average prudent and intelligent man,\u201d which is equivalent to saying that we are all subject to \u201ca duty to take care.\u201d In the special circumstances of this case, the nature and extent of that duty \u201cto take care\u201d must be considered with reference to the provisions of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d to which I refer later, passed to protect the commercial public against the reckless carelessness of men in the management of their affairs and to facilitate business intercourse. The question to be decided here is whether, in view of that Act, the respondent should escape liability as the signer of the note which is the basis of this action on this, among other grounds, that, though his carelessness may have caused the appellants harm, he was guilty of no breach of duty towards them.\nThe respondent, a man of some education and means and, if we may judge by his answers to the questions put on his examination as a witness, with considerable knowledge of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d living at Newmarket near Toronto, purchased some built on property at Port Arthur, through one Thompson, who, after the purchase, continued to manage it for him. Anticipating the probability that some repairs would be necessary to his houses, the respondent signed several ordinary lithographed bill forms with blank spaces for names, amounts, etc., and delivered them to Thompson with instructions to fill up the blanks and issue them as completed notes if and when it became necessary to procure money to pay for the anticipated repairs. After some time, Thompson filled up one of the blank forms for the sum of $1,000, making of it a note payable on demand, and, in breach of his duty to the respondent, issued it in its completed form; the appellants are now holders in due course of that note. I believe the majority of the court are agreed that there is no evidence to support the finding of the trial judge that the appellants did suspect, or had any reason to suspect, fraud. The sections of the Act upon which the appellant relied at the argument are sections 31 and 32:\u2014\n31. Where a simple signature on a blank paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates as a prim\u00e2 facie authority to fill it up as a complete bill for any amount, using the signature for that of the drawer or acceptor, or an indorser; and, in like manner, when a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has a prim\u00e2 facie authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.\n32. In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given: Provided that if any such instrument, after completion, is negotiated to a holder in due course, it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.\nOn the whole evidence it is apparent that the authority to fill up and issue was given contemporaneously with the delivery of the signatures on the blank forms and there is no clear finding to the contrary. To bring this case within the decision in Smith v. Prosser[5] an evident attempt was made throughout the examination of the respondent to shew that the express authority to fill up and issue the bills was not to be exercised by Thompson until the respondent was communicated with for further instructions; but that the latter tacitly acquiesced in the fraud practised by his agent on the appellant, with full knowledge of all the facts, cannot be doubted. The respondent was also guilty of gross negligence when he placed Thompson in possession of the blank bills with the knowledge which he must be presumed to have had that possession carried with it prim\u00e2 facie authority to fill up the blanks for any amount. In so doing the respondent was guilty of a clear breach of duty towards any one who might subsequently become a holder in due course, if the proviso to section 32 does not cover the case. The only material finding of fact is that the condition subject to which the express authority to issue was given never arose.\nDoes the fact that the express authority to fill up and issue, given contemporaneously with the delivery of the instrument, was conditional destroy the prim\u00e2 facie authority vested by the statute in the person to whom it was delivered to convert it into a bill enforceable in the hands of a holder in due course against the maker? I am strongly inclined to doubt that it does on the facts of this case. By the evidence of the respondent seeking to escape liability, in the absence of Thompson to whom the notes had been delivered, the presumption is rebutted to this extent only. The authority to fill up and issue is admitted to have been given contemporaneously with the delivery of the instrument; but the respondent says the note was not to be used until the necessity arose to make provision for the payment of such sums as might be required to make repairs to the houses in Port Arthur, which were in the discretion of the agent Thompson. I would have been disposed to hold that in issuing the note the agent did not act in accordance with the authority given to him, but that the instrument was originally delivered that it might in his hands form the basis of a negotiable instrument; that the statute gave him prim\u00e2 facie authority to fill it up as a complete bill and, as a consequence, the proviso to section 32 would operate to protect the appellant. Otherwise what is the effect of that proviso? In every case hereafter the banker, instead of being able to rely upon the prim\u00e2 facie presumption resulting from possession, will be put upon inquiry and, if it appears that the note offered for discount was signed or indorsed in blank, it will be his duty to ascertain whether in fact the maker or indorser authorized the filling in or the issuing of the note absolutely and without any secret restrictions at the time it was delivered to the person in possession. The prim\u00e2 facie presumption created by the statute will be no longer of much, if of any value; because it may be destroyed by the evidence of the maker or indorser seeking to escape liability in the absence or death of the party to whom the instrument was originally delivered, on the ground that the authority to issue was conditional upon an event which never happened. The proviso will cease to be of any practical use because the note is not valid and effectual and cannot be enforced by the holder in due course, notwithstanding the statutory presumption, if the authority to issue was given subject to an unfulfilled secret condition. It may embarrass the ordinary commercial man to distinguish between limited authority, which would be covered by the proviso, and authority which is conditional upon the happening of a future event. I presume that the theory is that, failing the event, authority never existed. I would have adopted the judgment of Mr. Justice Meredith; but out of deference to the opinion of the majority of my colleagues who hold that this case is governed by the judgment in Smith v. Prosser[6], I do not enter a formal dissent.\nDAVIES J.\u2014If the findings of fact of the learned trial judge confirmed as they are by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, are not disturbed by this court, it is difficult to see how in the face of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the recent case of Smith v. Prosser6, this appeal could be allowed.\nThe trial judge found as a fact \u201cthat the defendant never intended nor authorized the paper sued on to be filled up as a promissory note; that the circumstances never arose upon which only the agent Thompson was authorized to fill the same up, and that what was done by Thompson was without authority and in fraud of the defendant, and that the paper sued on never in fact by the defendant\u2019s authority became a promissory note.\u201d\nThese findings of fact were based upon the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of the evidence of the defendant. He was a very old man in feeble health and with a somewhat impaired memory and his evidence, owing to his inability to stand the fatigue of travelling to attend and give evidence at the trial had been taken by commission. While there were very many facts connected with his dealings with Thompson generally and especially with respect to the note sued on which he had signed in blank and given to Thompson upon which his memory failed him, the old man was singularly clear and emphatic upon the crucial point that he had delivered it to Thompson to retain in his custody until he had notified the witness, respondent, that monies were required by Thompson to pay for the repairs of some houses in Port Arthur belonging to the witness, for which Thompson was agent, in which case, if the witness had not the money to send Thompson then the latter could fill up and use the note, but not otherwise. The note was deposited with Thompson, so respondent gave evidence, for safekeeping and was only to be filled up and used by him if and when he received information from respondent Willson that he could not provide and send the monies required by Thompson for the repairs of the houses. The note was one of several so deposited by Willson with Thompson, but the one sued on was the only one Thompson attempted to use.\nThis crucial finding of the trial judge has been confirmed by the Court of Appeal, Meredith J. dis- senting. I confess I have strong doubts whether I should have made the same finding on the somewhat unsatisfactory evidence produced. At the same time I have not such a clear conviction that it is erroneous as would justify me in reversing it. In a late case in the House of Lords of Johnston v. O\u2019Neil[7], Lord Macnaghten, at page 578, stated the rule which governed that House with respect to two concurrent findings of fact as follows:\u2014\nIn such a case the appellant undertakes a somewhat heavy burden. It lies on him to shew that the order appealed from is clearly wrong.\nIn a Scotch case, Gray v. Turnbull, in 1870[8], where there was an appeal from two concurrent findings of fact in a case in which the evidence was taken on commission and neither court saw the witnesses, Lord Westbury, after referring to the practice in courts of equity to allow appeals on matters of fact, makes this observation: \u201cIf we open the door to an appeal of this kind, undoubtedly it will be an obligation upon the appellant to prove a case that admits of no doubt whatever.\u201d In an English case, Owners of the P. Caland v. Glamorgan Steamship Co.[9], Lord Watson expressed himself as follows:\u2014\nIn my opinion it is a salutary principle that judges sitting in a court of last resort ought not to disturb concurrent findings of fact by the courts below, unless they can arrive at\u2014I will not say a certain because in such matters there can be no absolute certainty\u2014but a tolerably clear conviction that these findings are erroneous, and the principle appears to me especially applicable in cases where the conclusion sought to be set aside chiefly rests upon considerations of probability.\nWe have adopted and followed in this court of last resort in Canada the rule substantially as Lord Watson states it.\nAccepting, therefore, the findings of fact on the question of the intention with which the blank note signed by respondent Willson was left with Thompson is the case concluded by Smith v. Prosser[10] above cited? The facts with regard to the intention with which the signed blank notes were left in the hands of a third party as custodian were substantially the same in that case and this, and in each case the custodian had filled up and negotiated the blank note with a third party, who for the purposes of my argument may be held to have been a \u201cholder in due course\u201d without any instructions from the defendant authorizing him to do so.\nSections 31 and 32 of our \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d R.S.C. 1906, ch. 119, are practically transcripts of the 20 and 21 sections of the English Act. The only difference is that the latter only applies to paper bearing a stamp which has been signed in blank.\nThe criticism of Mr. Bicknell upon the case of Smith v. Prosser[11] was that it was a decision upon a question of fact only and that the court there held the provisions of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d inapplicable and decided the case upon the common law doctrine of estoppel. It is true that the court did hold the sections of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d inapplicable because the note in that case was not stamped when negotiated, but they also held that the passing of that Act which codified the then existing law\ndid not alter in any respect material to that case the law as laid down in the prior authorities. Vaughan Williams L.J. says, at page 744:\u2014\nI do not desire to rest my judgment on that ground\u2014(that is, that the holder of the note had notice that Telfer, the party who negotiated the note with him, was acting under a power of attorney, and that the plaintiff ought to have made inquiries)\u2014nor do I rest it on the ground that there was no stamp, impressed or adhesive, on the note when Telfer assumed to negotiate it.\nThe learned Justice then goes on:\u2014\nI propose to deal with the case in this way. Here is a document which was in an incomplete state at the moment of its negotiation. If that note, being in that condition, had been handed to Telfer (and I leave out of consideration for this purpose the fact that Telfer and Wilson were joint attorneys) for the purpose of his making use of it, and for the purpose of its being issued as a negotiable instrument, I am of opinion that prim\u00e2 facie the defendant would have been responsible to a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value who had purchased the note from Telfer as the plaintiff did. In my judgment it is of the very essence of the liability of a person signing a blank instrument that the instrument should have been handed to the person to whom it was in fact handed, as an agent for the purpose of being used as a negotiable instrument, and with the intention that it should be issued as such.\nFletcher Moulton L.J., after first holding that under the special circumstances of that case the action must fail, said, p. 752:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that the same conclusion will follow if it be considered upon the broad grounds upon which Vaughan Williams L.J. has based his judgment, in which I entirely concur. The law stands thus. If a person signs a piece of paper and gives it to an agent with the intention that it shall in his hands form the basis of a negotiable instrument, he is not permitted to plead that he limited the power of his agent in a way not obvious on the face of the instrument.\nAnd at page 753:\u2014\nThe essential fact which is necessary to enable the plaintiff to establish his case is, therefore, absent. The defendant never issued the documents with the intention that they should become negotiable instruments;\nand\u2014\nIn my opinion section 20 is based upon the doctrine of common law estoppel as it existed at the date of the Act, and, therefore, the presence of the condition as to its operation shews that the legislature realized that the intention that the document should be converted into a bill of exchange was essential in order to render the maker liable.\nBuckley L.J. bases his judgment on the same ground, namely, at page 755, that\nthe promissory notes never became negotiable instruments, the reason being that the defendant never issued them nor authorized any one else to issue them as negotiable instruments.\nThe true construction, therefore, of sections 31 and 32 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d so far as the protection of third parties holders in due course is concerned, limits that protection to cases where the signer intended the instrument signed by him to become a bill or note, and authorized its issue for that purpose. Where that intention is proved it matters not whether his instructions to the person he delivered it to were exceeded or not. He is liable upon it. If on the contrary that intention is disproved and it is shewn the instrument signed was not intended to be issued or became a bill or note, but was left for safe custody in some agent\u2019s hands to await further instructions as to its issue he is not liable if the bill or note is fraudulently issued by the agent or holder without such further instructions.\nOur duty is to expound the law as we find it, and doing so, I am of opinion that on the findings of fact in this case which I am unable to conclude are clearly wrong, the appeal must fail and be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am not entirely free from doubt regarding respondent\u2019s version of the facts which led him to entrust his signatures to Thompson.\nIt is difficult to understand why such an expedi- ent should have been resorted to merely to anticipate repairs on his buildings.\nMy doubt, however, is not of such a nature as to entitle me to reverse the findings of fact by two courts below. I am clear the respondent was trying to tell the truth. And though possibly in error in assigning possible repairs as the subject-matter he had in view, it is extremely improbable that he is entirely mistaken in saying Thompson had no right to use the signature for his own purposes.\nTaking the view of the facts that the courts below have done it seems impossible to hold otherwise than they have done without discarding the reasoning upon which the judgments in Smith v. Prosser[12] proceed.\nIt is to be observed, however, that the reasoning adopted was entirely unnecessary on the facts presented for the decision of that case and hence binds no one save so far as the reasoning adopted may. I do not think, however, this case requires us to adopt or discard the reasoning.\nThe exact shade of fraud involved in Thompson\u2019s misconduct is not to my mind so clearly and accurately determined as to apply or rather say we must apply the reasoning adopted in Smith v. Prosser12.\nAll I am here, however, concerned with is, whether or not there is ground for finding a fraudulent use of the respondent\u2019s signature. I do so find. Whether the fraud is exactly of the kind dealt with in Smith v. Prosser12, or more akin to the class of case needing the application of such reasoning as adopted in the case of Lloyd\u2019s Bank v. Cooke[13], matters little. The appellants are on such finding of fact bound to shew that they are holders in due course, which, I think, involves both good faith and valuable consideration.\nAnd assuming that but for want thereof they would have on any ground been able to claim to recover on the note Thompson made out of his improper use of respondent\u2019s signature, I fail to see how they can succeed here or hope to succeed here in face of the finding of the learned trial judge.\nHe finds as fact that the plaintiffs \u201chad reason to suspect and did gravely suspect the bon\u00e2 fides of Thompson as the holder of the note.\u201d At least two of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal accept this finding as well founded.\nCare in taking a negotiable security is surely not too much to exact from those asking and in proper cases enjoying immunity as holders thereof. And I may add that bankers ought to preserve some record of such transactions where they in the course of such business can hardly be expected to remember every detail of their every day dealings.\nThe onus of proving they are holders in due course and in the sense I attribute thereto rests on them taking the security.\nThe appellants are not able to shew satisfactorily where they got this note or what they paid for it, or what it in fact was collateral to if taken as collateral at all.\nThe appellants were both on the witness stand. The only one who professes to know the details of the transaction professes it was got as incidental to the needs of Thompson to pay a hundred dollars to the Union Bank, which held it as security therefor and was pressing for its payment.\nThe court adjourned the case for some hours to en- able him to produce his books and papers and I infer if he had chosen he could have brought the officers of that bank as well as his own books and papers to establish the facts.\nWhen the books were produced he could not put his finger on anything to clearly corroborate his story or fix the time or fact of payment which he alleged he had made.\nThere is no record indeed of his having the note except an entry made two months at least after the Thompson account seems to have been closed, and that is an entry in his register of bills for collection, of this and two notes of another party upon which he seems to have placed according to his evidence little, if any, value.\nHis story of how they came to be there recorded suggests rather he had found himself possessed of things he had forgotten.\nHe says he had continued to press Thompson for payment, but it never seems to have occurred to him to demand payment of this note (a stale security when got by him) from the maker for four months after getting it and for two months after it was placed among bills for collection. Why? What was he afraid of? It was a demand note, a class, he admits, they would not deal in usually.\nHe admits he knew the Union Bank might have demanded it and thus rendered it an overdue bill when he got it, yet he never inquired as to the fact.\nWhy did he so shut his eyes? He seeks to claim it as collateral. He tells three times over the story of how he got it.\nThe first time he says:\u2014\nI told him if he would go to the Union Bank and bring the note in I would pay the Union Bank and hold it against everything he owed us.\nNot a word in this as to future advances, yet he thinks it was on the 18th of May and, after more dealings meantime the account closed the end of June.\nWe have no explanation beyond the ledger debiting after the 18th of May of items amounting to a total of four to five hundred dollars and discounts crediting to amount of eight hundred dollars and yet a gradually rising debit balance.\nWhat right could he have on such a statement of how he was to have held it to apply it to these dealings?\nBesides, it is rather curious he does not venture there to swear Thompson agreed to what he said. It is left in a case of this kind to mere inference or surmise which might be most misleading.\nOn the second version of the story in reply to the learned trial judge interrogating him as to what took place, he is still more vague and does not refer to holding it as collateral to anything.\nIf this version, as it stands, is the true statement, then he had no right to hold it for anything but the advance proposed to redeem it by the Union Bank.\nIt is quite consistent with the idea of a mere hope that something more than expressly stipulated for might come from its collection.\nOn a third attempt to explain the transaction in answer to the learned trial judge asking him to state what took place when Thompson delivered the note, he repeats the story of Thompson\u2019s having been pressed by the Union Bank and wanting money to pay it off and take the note, and then adds: \u201cI asked him if he would give it to me as collateral for all he owed me and he said yes,\u201d and proceeded to speak of a lot of things to remember, etc.\nI have compared this statement with the answer given to the identical question some time before.\nThey do not look much alike. The learned judge saw the witness, and was in an infinitely better position than I am to draw the proper conclusion to be drawn from variations of the story.\nThere was a statement also made by the witness between his first statement to his own counsel and the first statement to the learned trial judge in which he refers to a note of another party for which Thompson was responsible and he says, speaking of what he held this note for: \u201cthere was a note of a man named Williams whom I did not consider good and I told him so, and I told him I wanted collateral for that.\u201d\nThis is not introduced in any of the other three statements I have referred to.\nI cannot help observing that in each of these three versions which I have specially referred to, the witness uniformly states the facts relative to the Union Bank holding the note for a hundred dollars and pressing for payment, and Thompson needing funds to pay it off, in substantially the same terms, but where, speaking of the question of holding the note for collateral purposes, the story varies most remarkably.\nAgain the whole business is in one place alleged to have taken place in one day. He did not know Willson. He says one place as follows:\u2014\nQ. Did you make any inquiries as to who Willson was, when you took this note?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you know beforehand who he was?\nA. I don\u2019t know that I did; I don\u2019t remember whether the question ever came up. Q. So you knew of no transaction with Willson until this came up?\nA. That\u2019s all.\nThe desperate financial condition in which Thompson was, he admits knowing all about, from Thompson\u2019s telling him in confidence.\nIt was hopeless to have expected anything from him and yet this stale demand note is not demanded until after Thompson had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors to this witness, and as I infer, had left the country or at all events that part of the country.\nThe exact date of his leaving is not fixed, but the witness says:\u2014\nQ. Or whether it would become due upon demand?\nA. When I presented it at the Bank of Montreal at Port Arthur, I protested it.\nQ. How long after Thompson went away was it you deposited it at the Bank of Montreal?\nA. I could not say; a short time afterward.\nThe estate realized about three cents on the dollar. The note was a demand note filled up by Thompson and was about a year old when appellants got it, then stamped on its face with the Union Bank, \u201cB.C.\u201d stamp.\nI cannot hold, under such circumstances as shewn throughout in the evidence I have referred to and other evidence in the case, that the learned trial judge erred in his finding, from which I have quoted above. I, therefore, think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the instrument sued upon was a simple forgery and that the appellants are not within the protection of sections 31 and 32 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act.\u201d\nI agree with the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal that Thompson had possession of the paper entrusted to him by the respondent as custodian only and that he had no kind of authority to convert it into a negotiable instrument for any purpose whatsoever. I think sections 31 and 32 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d have no application to such a case; that their operation is confined to those cases in which there is a limited or conditional authority to convert a signature attached to a blank paper into a negotiable instrument or to convert an incomplete instrument into a complete instrument and that authority has been exceeded or abused.\nThe design and effect of the sections in question are, I think (if I may say so with respect), stated with accuracy by Fletcher Moulton L.J. in Smith v. Prosser[14], at pages 753 and 754, in these words:\u2014\nIn other words, both the common law and the statute realized the possibility of two rival dangers\u2014on the one hand, a person who did nothing more than sign a blank stamped paper might find himself in the position of being a maker of a bill or note; on the other hand, a man might issue an incomplete bill or note and place it in the hands of an agent with a limited authority to fill it up, and the agent might fill it up without due regard to the limitations of his authority and put it in circulation and thereby injure innocent persons. They, therefore, drew the line as regards the protection of third parties in the following very reasonable and intelligible way: If the signer intended it to become a bill, it was for him to see that it was issued in accordance with his intentions, and if he did not do this, third parties would not be affected; on the other hand, if he did not intend it to become a bill, there would be no such duty incumbent upon him, and he would be in the same position as if he had signed it as an autograph. There would, in that case, be no animus emittendi, and he would, therefore, not be liable for the act of a bailee who turned the document into a negotiable instrument. The present case sharply raises the question of the line of demarkation, and, as I think that the signed forms were in the possession of Telfer as custodian only, and not as the defendant\u2019s agent with an intention on the defendant\u2019s part that he should issue them as promissory notes, the defendant is not estopped from saying that he was not the maker of the notes sued upon.\nMr. Bicknell, in his able argument, naturally invoked the famous dictum of Ashurst J. in Lickbarrow v. Mason[15]. But that dictum can be safely made the ground of decision in particular cases only in so far as it has taken shape in the form of a definite principle of law. Farquharson Brothers & Co. v. King & Co.[16], at pages 712 and 713, and in the House of Lords[17], at pages 336 and 337; Rimmer v. Webster[18], at page 169; Scholfield v. Earl of Londesborough[19], at pages 521 and 522; Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Marshall[20], at page 565; Imperial Bank of Canada v. Bank of Hamilton[21], at page 54.\n\u201cMy Lords,\u201d said Lord Cairns, in Cundy v. Lindsay[22], at page 463,\nyou have in this case to discharge a duty which is always a disagreeable one for any court, namely, to determine as between two parties, both of whom are perfectly innocent, upon which of the two the consequences of a fraud practised upon both of them must fall. My Lords, in discharging that duty, your Lordships can do no more than apply rigorously the settled and well known rules of law.\nTwo further points require notice. First, as to estoppel, it is very clearly shewn in the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclaren that the appellants suffered no prejudice in consequence of the respondent\u2019s silence after becoming aware of the forgery, and the appellants, therefore, cannot succeed on that basis. Secondly, as Thompson was not, in committing the forgery or in negotiating the forged instrument, acting for the benefit of the respondent, nor professing nor intending to act in his behalf, the doctrine of ratification by acquiescence alone has no application. H\u00e9bert v. La Banque Nationale[23]; Keighley, Maxsted & Co. v. Durant[24], pages 246 and 247.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The material facts of this case and the substance of the evidence bearing upon them are fully and satisfactorily set out in the judgments of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario and Maclaren, J.A.[25] The evidence is most unsatisfactory on the two principal questions of fact involved\u2014the one, whether the blank note form with his signature upon it was handed by the defendant to his agent Thompson merely as a depositary or custodian, with instructions not to fill it in or use it in any way until directed to do so by the defendant, or whether, without any further assent of the defendant, he had some authority to fill it in and to use it on the defendant\u2019s account; and the other, whether the plaintiffs took the note with serious suspicions of Thompson\u2019s good faith, which they made no effort to clear up, thus failing to discharge the burden cast upon them by section 58 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act.\u201d It would perhaps be difficult to say upon which point the evidence is less convincing. The observations upon it of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal are fully justified.\nBut on the question of the nature of Thompson\u2019s mandate in respect of the paper signed in blank which was entrusted to him, although as a trial judge I should probably have found against the defendant, for the reasons given by Moss, C.J.O., and Maclaren, J.A., I am of the opinion that the finding of Clute, J., that Thompson was a mere custodian of it with no authority to use it until directed to do so by the defendant was rightly affirmed in appeal. Moreover, where such a judgment has been affirmed by a provincial appellate court it is the settled practice of this court to decline to interfere unless the appellant clearly demonstrates that the conclusion reached is absolutely wrong. Weller v. McDonald-McMillan Co.[26]; Mayrand v. Dussault[27]; George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard[28]. See, too, Johnston v. O\u2019Neil[29], at p. 578, per Lord Macnaghten. In their attempt to perform that difficult task the present appellants have not succeeded.\nAs a mere custodian of the paper, Thompson, in fraudulently filling it in and using it, did not merely abuse or exceed his authority; he acted without any authority. In either case at common law the defendant could be made liable only by estoppel: Nash v. De Freville[30]. But the estoppel against the principal which arises in a case of abuse or excess of authority by his agent\u2014of which Lloyd\u2019s Bank, Limited v. Cooke[31], furnishes a recent instance\u2014lacks its essential basis where the alleged agent, entirely without authority, disposes of a non\u2011negotiable security or fills in and disposes of a document thus converted by his wrongful act into what is in form a negotiable instrument. In order to sustain the confidence of the commercial community in the title obtained by the bon\u00e2 fide holder of a negotiable instrument, it has been conclusively established that, if the maker or owner of it entrusts it in complete and negotiable form to a broker or agent, a person taking it from him for value and in good faith\u2014although in parting with it he acts without any authority or in breach of express instructions\u2014acquires an incontestable title and right of property. London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[32]. But the person who merely deposits with a custodian a blank form of note bearing his signature does not issue it \u201cintending it to be used.\u201d Baxendale v. Bennett[33]. The deposit is in fact of a non-negotiable document and, therefore, does not \u201ccontain any invitation to any other member of the community to do any act from which a duty to him can be inferred.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s v. Grace, Smith & Co.[34], at pages 509-10.\nIt is of the very essence of the liability of a person signing a blank instrument that the instrument should have been handed to the person to whom it was in fact handed, as an agent for the purpose of being used as a negotiable instrument and with the intention that it should be issued as such. Smith v. Prosser[35], at page 744, per Vaughan Williams L.J.\nThe promissory notes never became negotiable instruments, the reason being that the defendant never issued them nor authorized any one else to issue them as negotiable instruments.\nIbid. per Fletcher Moulton L.J., at page 753.\nIf we are to measure the estoppel by the physical possibility of deception, section 20 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d (our section 31), would contain something which would be absolutely irrelevant, and which yet is made a condition of the section being applicable. That section commences with the words: \u201cWhere a simple signature on a blank stamped paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill\u201d; in other words, the intention that it shall be converted into a bill is made a condition of the operation of the section. In my opinion section 20 is based upon the doctrine of common law estoppel as it existed at the date of the Act, and, therefore, the presence of the condition as to its operation shews that the legislature realized that the intention that the document should be converted into a bill of exchange was essential in order to render the maker liable. In other words, both the common law and the statute realized the possibility of two rival dangers\u2014on the one hand, a person who did nothing more than sign a blank stamped paper might find himself in the position of being the maker of a bill or note; on the other hand, a man might issue an incomplete bill or note and place it in the hands of an agent with a limited authority to fill it up, and the agent might fill it up without due regard to the limitations of his authority and put it in circulation and thereby injure innocent persons. They, therefore, drew the line as regards the protection of third parties in the following very reasonable and intelligible way: if the signer intended it to become a bill, it was for him to see that it was issued in accordance with his intentions, and if he did not do this, third parties would not be affected; on the other hand, if he did not intend it to become a bill, there would be no such duty incumbent upon him, and he would be in the same position as if he had merely signed it as an autograph. There would in that case be no animus emittendi and he would, therefore, not be liable for the act of a bailee who turned the document into a negotiable instrument.\nAlthough Smith v. Prosser[36] might undoubtedly have been disposed of on other grounds, we must accept it as an authority for the propositions of law on which the Lords Justices have seen fit to rest their opinions. New South Wales Taxation Commissioners v. Palmer[37].\nApart from the effect of the proviso to section 32, upon which great stress was laid in argument, the case against the defendant fails.\nAssuming the plaintiffs to be \u201cholders in due course,\u201d I agree with the construction put upon that proviso by Maclaren, J.A., who said:\u2014 It is argued that here the plaintiff can recover as a holder in due course under the proviso of section 32, which provides that \u201cif any such instrument after completion is negotiated to a holder in due course, it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.\u201d It will be observed that this applies only \u201cto any such instrument,\u201d that is, to such instrument as is mentioned in section 31, and one which has been \u201cdelivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill,\u201d and does not apply to an instrument like this, delivered to a bailee or custodian merely to be held until further instructions are received from the signer. It is not pretended that such instructions were ever given, so that the instrument never became a note for want of a proper delivery.\nI concur in the opinion of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that \u201cthere is nothing in the subsequent conduct of the defendant to create liability,\u201d either by ratification or by estoppel.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the views expressed above by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.E.

(B.C.) ch. 34, sec. 15, municipal councils subject to those statutes had no power to hold meetings for the transaction of any administrative, legislative or judicial business of the municipal corporation at a place outside of the territorial boundaries of the municipality.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ\u2014 Courts of revision organized under the British Columbia municipal statutes, have no power to exercise their functions as such except at meetings held within the territorial limits of the municipality where the property, described in the assessment rolls to be raised by them, is situate\nSection 15 of \"Municipal Amendment Act, 1894,\" inserted in the \"Municipal Act,1892'' (B.C.), a new provision, section 83(a), as follows: ''All meetings of a municipal council shall take place within the limits of the municipality, except when the council have unanimously resolved that it would be more convenient to hold such meetings, or some of them, outside of the limits of the municipality.\"\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that there was no proof of such a unanimous resolution as the statute requires.\nThe. council of the respondent municipality, without any formal resolution as provided by the amended statute, held its meetings during several years at a place outside the limits of the municipality, and organized courts of revision there. These courts held all their meetings at the same place as the council and assumed to revise the municipal assessment rolls at those meetings. The council approved the rolls so revised and enacted by-laws, from year to year, levying rates and authorizing the collection of taxes on the lands mentioned in the rolls, and, after notice as provided by the statutes, sold lands so assessed and alleged to be in arrear for the taxes so imposed.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the assessment rolls were invalid, that the by-laws levying the rates and authorizing the collection of taxes on the lands mentioned therein were null and void, and that the sales of the lands so made for alleged arrears of taxes were illegal and of no effect.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ., Brodeur J. contra.\u2014 The default in payment of taxes, by the appellant, and his subsequent inaction and silence, while aware of the fact that his lands had been sold for alleged arrears of taxes, did not disentitle him from taking advantage of the' statutory procedure respecting the contestation of sales for arrears of taxes either by estoppel, acquiescence or laches. The provisions of section 126 (3) of the \"Municipal Act, 1892,\" (now R.S.B.C. 1897, eh. 144, sec. 86(2),) have no application to invalid by-laws enacted by municipal councils on occasions when they could not perform legislative functions.\nThe judgment appealed from was reversed, Brodeur J. dissenting, on the ground that, as the council had held its first meeting in each year within the limits of the municipality and adjourned for the purpose of holding its next meetings at the place outside of the municipality where all other meetings were held, the by-laws approving of the assessment rolls and those levying rates and authorizing the collection of taxes were valid and the sale of the lands in question for arrears of such taxes was legal and effective.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming the judgment of Clement J., at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiff impeached the sale of certain lands, in which he claimed an interest, purporting to have been made by the municipality for alleged arrears of taxes: the other defendants claimed the lands through the tax-sale purchaser, to whom the alleged tax-sale deed had been delivered in due. course.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nA. H. MacNeill K.C. for the appellant.\nEwart K.C, for the respondent, Balston.\nW. H. D. Ladner for the respondent, Fleming.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. \u2014I entirely agree in the conclusion reached by my brother Idington.\nIDINGTON J. \u2014The appellant rightly claims that respondents, setting up a tax title, must show that each step taken to impose the taxes in question and to sell the land in question, has been in conformity with the statutory powers given for such purposes. Indeed, this does not seem to be denied. Nor does it seem to be seriously denied that in several instances there exist departures from the mode pointed out by statute for doing what was done, but the respondents excuse them either by claiming they were in respect of unimportant matters or merely directory provisions, or that they have been cured by statutory provisions applicable thereto, or that the appellant, by reason of his failure to assert his claim earlier, cannot now be heard to complain, and that in any event these errors were each and all merely irregularities and did not result in producing nullities.\nThe gravest of all these infractions of laAv is the entire disregard during the years in question, being 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896 and 1897, for which the taxes were claimed, by the courts of revision, of the proper place to hold their sittings, and almost equal disregard during the same time by the council of the proper place to hold its sittings.\nThe usual necessary proceedings, by way of by-law or resolution of the council, or resolution or other act of the courts of revision, upon the respective validity of which must rest the imposition of these taxes and of the council's acts founding and authorizing the sale of the land to enforce same, were each and all transacted at meetings held outside the limits of the municipality.\nIf these proceedings, or any one of them, were null, then I think the sale must be held void.\nThe municipality was incorporated in 1892, and derived its powers from, and was thenceforward subject to, the provisions of the \"Municipal Act\" of 1892, of which section 103, defining the jurisdiction of municipal councils, is as follows: \u2014\n103. The jurisdiction of every council shall be confined to the municipality the council represents, except where authority beyond the same is expressly given.\nIt has been said this is merely objective. In a sense that is true, but it does not cover the whole truth. If nothing else had been enacted and the council had bought (as an exercise of a power clearly given to erect or procure a town-hall for corporate use) a hall outside the municipality's limits and sought to constitute that the municipal town-hall and seat of . the corporation's business, does any one suppose they could have levied a rate to pay therefor ? Or from the strictly objective point of view, could the council have acquired title to this land outside the limits of the municipality ? I had always supposed such councils could not, except where expressly authorized by statute, buy a foot of land outside the municipal limits, for a graveyard, or a sand-pit, or a toll-bar, or anything else, no matter how urgently needed.\nIf the councillors, or reeve and councillors, of such a municipality had done so I have no doubt they could have been personally made to return into the municipal treasury its funds so used.\nIf they could not buy, no more could they rent.\nIndeed, the power of acquisition, outside the municipal limits, was actually given later for some of these specified purposes, but none to acquire town\u2014hall or seat or home for the council to use.\nThe discharge of their duties at home, in some chosen seat there, is implied in the legal history of such corporations,. and in reading the language of statutory enactments creating them. or empowering them, such history must be duly regarded. Thus read both sense and colour or a shade of meaning are given to the language of restriction just quoted. And along with that there must never be disregarded the oftrepeated legal principle that corporations being but the creatures of statute have no power but what the statute has given and much less has the council or other body the statute gives and directs as a means of corporate activity.\nThe presumption is entirely in favour of the legislative or administrative acts of such a corporation being confined within its territorial limits unless where, by reason of some necessary implication requiring it in order to enable it effectually to discharge the duties its constituent Act has cast upon it to do, something must be done beyond such limits. On the 7th of May, in the year 1892, the council then in office held a meeting within the municipality's limits at which a resolution was carried\nthat the next meeting be held at the office of Shannon and McLaughlin i. on the 21st inst. at 1 p.m.\nThis place was on Hastings Street in an adjoining municipality.\nIt thus began a long course of illegal conduct. Of that I have not a shadow of doubt. The only doubt I have in that regard is whether illegal acts so done were nullities or mere irregularities.\nThe council had to appoint the assessor, and, when he had done his work, had to constitute a court of revision, by naming five of its members, if more than five, to be the court of revision.\nThis council consisted of a reeve and five councillors.\nThe language of the Act then in force is not as clear as it might be. It provides apparently for the council revising the roll, but that, being read in connection with other sections, I think merely means it shall see that duty is discharged by the methods given in the Act which consist of the council constituting a proper court and, as provided by section 157, appointing a time and place for the hearing of all complaints against the assessment.\nIt will be observed this power seems to indicate a power to name a place. Does that enable it to name a place outside the municipality for holding a court of revision ? I think not. The nature of the court, the duties it has to discharge, the nature of the complaints to be heard and means of hearing and adjudicating upon them properly, as well as facilities furnished for the members of the court and for those concerned being in attendance with witnesses for whom no conduct money was to be allowed but only a per diem allowance, all seem to forbid the thought of the court being held outside of the limits of the municipality for if it could go a mile beyond it could go twenty or\" more. And when the council is given power to name the place of which notice has to be published it must be held to be bound to name a place within said limits.\nBut, in each year in question, these appointments of persons to form the court and of naming a place and time for their doing so were all directed by a council sitting outside its jurisdiction. Until the statute was changed such meetings could have no authority, and then only on complying with the conditions precedent to such authority, as given in later years of the period in question, to enable them to hold such sittings. This condition never was complied with. Hence their appointment of the members to hold the court and their selection of a time and place for its sitting were all illegal.\nThe next duty falling upon the council was to receive the roll and see that it had been duly revised and certified. Anything done in this regard was done in the same illegal fashion. And the rate by-laws all seem to have been passed in the like disregard of the law at sittings outside the municipality's limits; unless in the later years when the Act was changed, to which I will presently refer, we can presume authority.\nIn 1897 the council, from a resolution I accidentally notice, seems merely to have directed the clerk to advertise the time, and possibly did so in other years.\nAn attempt was made in argument to show that, as the council and court of revision consisted of same members, the power given by legislation to the council on so resolving to fix meetings outside it, impliedly rested thereby in the court of revision. But this is an error of fact as well as law, for the council consisted of six members and this court of only five of them.\nThe courts of revision in question all sat outside the municipality. They are supposed to be courts of justice, but to try thus to enable the members thereof to sit outside the jurisdiction given them seems to be something very like constituting courts of injustice.\nI know not how it operated in the peculiar circumstances of this municipality, nor do I, as a matter of law, here need to care. But I am quite sure that to sanction as legal, such a proceeding as the constitution of these courts by such methods, and the giving of directions involved in the councils fixing a place outside' their jurisdiction as the only one for them to sit, would be fraught with danger to our municipal systems which are nearly all, in their main features, and especially in this regard, after the same pattern.\nTo hold such a thing legal would be, in the results, intolerable. To hold it a mere irregularity would be to open the door to reckless spirits of whom there exist only too many willing to take the risk. Indeed, our admirable municipal systems depend on all such men being sharply taught law and order.\nIn this connection I may say that if any one who had made a study of our whole frame of government were asked to point out in what single feature it is most distinguishable from all forms that have gone before he would put his finger on the distribution and decentralization of its powers and the localization thereof so as to bring each part, in such measure as may be practicable, as near to the people to be served as it is possible to do. Such is the spirit of our frame of government and of the municipal part thereof especially. It would be grossly violating it to enable any bare quorum of five or six busy or lazy men to throw aside the law.\nCourts of revision framed after this pattern were, from experience in Ontario, found possible of improvement.\nThe weaknesses of the pattern need not be intensified by countenancing such a departure from law and custom as respondents try to maintain here.\nLet us look at the powers given for summoning witnesses and getting documentary and other evidence before such a court sitting where it never was intended to sit. How could it be enforced or he suffering from disobedience of the witness get relief ?\nOn the 11th of April, 1894, the council was given a power it had not hitherto possessed by the enactment of the following:\nThe \"Municipal Act, 1892,\" is hereby amended by inserting the following as section 83a:\n83a. All meetings of a municipal council shall take place within the limits of the municipality, except when the council have unanimously resolved that it would be more convenient to hold such meetings, or some of them, outside the limits of the municipality.\nThis, in 1897, by chapter 30, section 2, was substituted by the following:\n28. All meetings of a municipal council shall take place within the limits of the municipality, except when the council have resolved that it would be more convenient to hold such meetings, or some of them, outside the limits of the municipality.\nThe council of the municipality in question never acted on either of these provisions. Legislators might doubt, but this council was undaunted. Their then clerk improperly seeks in his evidence to say they did resolve but when challenged in cross\u2014examination, he is forced to admit the minute book contains all the resolutions, yet no such resolution exists but the one of 1892 above quoted, and which could have no relation to this new power.\nWe are asked to presume they did, though it nowhere appears on the record which they were bound by statute to keep and permit any one to inspect.\nThen we are asked to presume it existed in the procedure by-law, which is not produced.\nI find, since argument, in each of the first three successive years a procedure by-law was passed, but none of them have been produced.\nA curiously worded provision exists in section 137, prohibiting a resolution or by-law of council from being in force for more than a year. I suspect this (which was no doubt intended to restrain councillors, for a year, from trying improperly to bind their successors) gave rise to the succession of procedure bylaws, but why are none of them produced, or if lost, why is the loss not proven and contents not shown by secondary evidence ? It was incumbent on respondent if possible to have proved thereby acts done in such an unusual way had at least the sanction of such a by-law. Good faith if nothing else in this regard made it desirable.\nAn inspection of the minute book, in order to see if it could give rise to a right to act on legal presumption, so far from helping me in that regard destroys any possibility of my doing so. The book is, on the whole, well kept and shows the minutes of each previous meeting were read and confirmed or corrected, except in the case of minutes of special meetings which were read along with those of the preceding regular meeting. The provisions for the council's meeting outside the limits of the municipality were not intended to create or sanction such an abuse as the court of revision also doing so, but to meet emergencies which are easily conceivable. Indeed, I observe that in England the power of some councils meeting within or without its seat of jurisdiction has been given by the \"Municipal Corporations Act.\"\nThat sort of legislation tends to show the supposed need of special enactment in that regard and, if we can conceive of such an irregularity being tolerated there, possibly it prevents us from having judicial authority directly bearing on the point.\nThe courts of revision, however, are, when duly constituted, courts of an inferior and essentially local jurisdiction confined to that jurisdiction.\nWe are thus driven to answer the inquiry of whether or not the acts of these councils, and especially of these courts, done whilst sitting beyond their territorial limits must be held null.\nExcept the case of The Queen v. Inhabitants of Totness[1], and the general principles laid down in Paley, we are not referred to authority. Relying thereon it seems clear the courts of revision could not act out of their jurisdiction and acts so done must be held invalid.\nThe council had no authority to direct them to act elsewhere, though they may have presumed to do so, and hence I think, their acts null, and, consequently, all that rested upon same also null.\nThe assessment rolls never were duly completed. The act of ratifying them and constituting them legal when once passed by the court of revision has never operated. It only ratifies that supposed to have been done in the course of a due exercise of power.\nAll the other curative provisions are of no effect, for it was not competent for the council to do what followed.\nThe competency of the council is a condition precedent to the application of the curative Acts invoked.\nAnd if we try to suppose there was a de facto court of revision its acts beyond its jurisdiction are still null.\nThe analogy to be drawn from acts of a council improperly or imperfectly constituted, yet to be held valid because a council de facto, does not apply here. The court of revision although constituted of some of the members of the council is essentially another body acting within its own rights and powers which it can neither limit nor extend, and over which when constituted, the council has no power save naming place for its sitting which I have already dealt with and shown must be a place where by law it could sit.\nThe council could, after the Act was amended, resolve to sit outside, but was never given power to direct its courts of revision to so sit.\nThe council never attempted even when the law permitted it to exercise a power, to sit elsewhere. It is quite clear it did not try to do so on the few occasions it sat within the'municipal limits. And when sitting outside, without such authority, it could not give itself authority for sitting there.\nThe case in many features is so curious I tried to find light from many sources. I found the acts of corporators when not all summoned and that in due form (and place being impliedly in question) as in the cases of Rex v. May[2] :Smyth v. Darley[3] : Musgrave V.Nevinson[4] : Rex v. Hill[5] : Rex v. Langhorn[6] : Rex v. Mayor of Liverpool[7], and others cited in these, were held null.\nIncidentally the meeting place is only referred to as the proper or usual place and seemingly essential part of the foundation on which to rest acts of a corporation as such. But in the Musgrave Case(3) above, a case of meeting in a tavern instead of the moothall was held bad.\nIn the American municipal cases there seems a dearth of precedent as to the place of meeting, and I have found only one case where the revising court outside the municipal limits was the direct cause of Kansas, in the Board of Commissioners of Marion County v. Baker[8], had the very point presented to it and held the sale void.\nDillon, in section 264, or 505 of 5th edition, refers to cases that imply the doing so would be void, and Elliott on Public Corporations,, 2nd ed., page 171, cites substantially the same cases.\nBut in the larger field of private corporation there is abundant authority to show the corporation must not sit or attempt to act as. such, outside its parent State, which is looked upon as its home and limit of jurisdiction, and acts done elsewhere are void.\nSee the cases of Miller v. Ewer[9] : Ormsby v. Vermont Copper Mining Co.[10] : (11 Sickels Reports) in appeal at 625, and numerous like cases where other authorities are cited, and the curious can trace out the law there in such regard.\nOf course some cases exist of directors being upheld in acting beyond the state, but that is put upon the ground that they are only agents of the corporation and so within the leading case of The Bank of Augusta v. Earle[11] entitling corporations to act abroad in the sense there in question.\nOf course the analogy between the private and the public corporation is not close, but there is much less to be said or implied in favour of a local representative body going beyond its jurisdiction than for a business concern.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J. \u2014The validity of the respondent's tax sale deed is impugned on the grounds (1) that the conditions had not arisen under which alone the defendant municipality had laAvful authority to sell the lands in question and (2) that in professing to sell them the municipal officers acted without the sanction of a legally effectual by-law by which alone they could acquire authority to majie such a sale on behalf of the municipality.\nThe authority of the municipality to sell lands for the recovery of unpaid taxes at the time of the sale which is here in question was derived from section 50 (135) of the \"Municipal Clauses Act,\" R.S.B.O. 1897, ch. 144: which enactment is in these words: \u2014\n50. In every municipality the council may, from time to time, make, alter and repeal by-laws for any of the following purposes, or in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter mentioned, that is to say: \u2014\n(135) For the sale at public auction of land, or improvements, or real property, for all municipal taxes remaining unpaid at the date of the passing of such by-law: Provided there shall be taxes in arrears in respect of the said land, or improvements, or real property, for two years prior to the passing of the said by-law, and for providing for the municipality purchasing the real property when the price offered at such sale is less than the amount of arrears.\nThe sale was made ostensibly under the authority of a by-law alleged to have been passed by the municipal council in July, 1898. This instrument purporting to be a by-law passed in exercise of the power conferred by the enactment quoted, professed to direct the collector of the municipality to prepare a list of \"the lands or improvements, or real property,\" upon which or in respect of which municipal taxes had been unpaid and in arrears for thespace of three years prior to the passage of the by-law: and provided that upon the list being duly authenticated by the reeve and the reeve's warrant being issued in that behalf the collector should sell the properties included in it in the manner therein prescribed. It is quite clear, therefore, that the authority of the collector to sell the property in question as well as the authority of the council to authorize the sale, both rested upon the condition that there should be at the time of the passing of the by-law \"taxes in arrear in respect of\" it for a period of two years. The contention of the appellant is that there were no taxes in arrear for such period because the taxes due in respect of this property for the years 1891 and 1892 were paid and no taxes were validly levied in respect of it in the years 1893,1894,1895 and 1896. It is not denied that, in form, such taxes were levied: but it is said that the meetings of the municipal council at which the pro- ceedings essential to the validity of such levi of the municipality and it is contended that such meetings were not been complied with and that anything done at them could not take effect as having been done in exercise of the legal powers of the council.\nUnder the statute referred to two requirements are essential to the lawful imposition of a tax in respect of land, first, an assessment of the property which is finally consummated only when the assessment roll prepared by the assessor has been passed upon by the council,' sitting as a court of revision and secondly, the passing of a by-law fixing the rate according to which the tax is to be levied. The assessment made in exercise of the statutory powers conferred upon the municipality, and the rate fixed by a by-law passed in exercise of those powers, are both elements which enter into and are essential to the constitution of a valid tax on real property.\nI postpone for the moment the question whether it is now open to the appellant to impugn the validity of the various proceedings in which the council or the members of the council professed to effect such assessments and to prescribe such rates for the years mentioned, the first point to consider being whether, assuming these proceedings to be open to attack in this action, the appellant's property was or was not, by virtue of them, lawfully subjected to the burden of the taxes alleged to have been thereby imposed. It is not disputed that the meetings at which these proceedings took place were held outside the boundaries of the municipality, and the first point to be determined is what is the effect of that circumstance upon the legal validity of those proceedings. It is convenient to consider the proceedings in the years 1893 and 1894 separately from those which took the place in the years 1895 and 1896. The statutory provisions under which the municipal council derived its powers for the first two years are to be found in the \"Municipal Act\" of 1892, which is chapter 33 of the statutes of that year. There is in that statute no enactment expressly dealing with the matter of the locality where the sittings of the council are to be held: and it does not appear to me to be necessary to decide whether or not it is a proper implication from the provisions of the Act that no sitting of the council for the effectual transaction of municipal business could be held except within the municipality it appears to me to be clear that at least when acting as a court of revision it could not sit elsewhere. Section 103 enacts as follows: \u2014\n103. The jurisdiction of every council shall be confined to the municipality the council represents, except where authority beyond the same is expressly given.\nI think it is indisputable that these words when applied to the sittings of a court of inferior jurisdiction deriving all its powers from statute, must be read as limiting the area in which it can act in the exercise of its jurisdiction. One of the powers, for example, of the council, when sitting court of revision (section 165) as one would expect, is the power to summon witnesses and to take their evidence under oath. With reference to such a jurisdiction, shall be confined to the municipality ?\" think the fair construction of this language is that the jurisdiction is to be exercised not only for, but within the municipality. The Act was amended in 1894 by an Act passed on the 11th of April of that year, and in respect of subsequent sittings of the council it will be necessary to consider the effect of that amendment but in the years 1893 and 1894 (the sitting of the court of revision, in 1894 the members of the council while professing to perform the duty of passing upon the assessments for those years were governed by the Act of 1892 and they were, I think, not exercising the powers in that behalf derived from that Act, for the simple reason that, in professing to do so, they were sitting outside the limits within which alone they could laAvfully exercise those powers. For those years, therefore, no tax became lawfully leviable in respect of real estate because there had been no valid assessment. In respect of the years 1895 and 1896 we must ascertain the effect of the amendment of 1894, which was as follows: \u2014\nThe \"Municipal Act, 1892,\" is hereby amended by inserting the following as section 83 a:\u2014\n83a. All meetings of a municipal council shall take place within the limits of the municipality, except when the council have unanimously resolved that it would be more convenient to hold such meetings, or some of them, outside of the limits of the municipality.\nBefore referring to the evidence bearing on the question whether the holding of the meetings of the council outside the municipality in the years under consideration can be justified by this enactment, it will be convenient to discuss what the enactment means by prescribing, as a condition of the legality of meetings so held that it would be more convenient, etc.\" Mr. Justice Clement thinks this provision does act of holding the meetings coupled with \"unani- mity of sentiment\" on the part of the members of the council that such a course is convenient: and that the existence of this \"unanimity of sentiment\" could be inferred from the fact that the meetings, as in this case, uniformly took place outside the municipality. The Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal seems to take the same view. I think that view cannot be sustained. It is to be observed that what the statute requires is not that the members of the council as individuals shall unanimously \"resolve,\" but that the council shall \"resolve.\". A \"resolve\" to \u2014adhere to the words of the Act \u2014 by the council as a body is necessary. I do not think a representative body in the exercise of legislative powers whether plenary or subordinate, can \"resolve\" in a practical sense upon a matter such as that which the section deals with without giving collective expression in some form to a decision upon it. I think is clear that, before they can take advantage of this provision, they must, as a council, express a judgment that it is more convenient to hold their meetings outside the municipality and they must express that judgment while professing to act as the council of the municipality and in circumstances in which the law permits them as the organ of the municipality to transact business.\nIt is beyond dispute that if the council had, in that sense, passed upon the question of holding meetings outside the municipality some record of their determination upon it ought to have appeared in the minute book in which their proceedings were recorded (\"Municipal Act, 1892,\" ch. 33, sec. 97) : and I have not the slightest doubt that it would have appeared there. There is no record of any action having been taken in that direction in 1895 or 1896 except the record of the adjournment of the initial meeting in each year. At each of those meetings the council adjourned to meet in Vancouver: but in either case nothing was said about subsequent meetings. These were held at regular intervals of a month without a thought, apparently, of the provisions of the \"Municipal Act.\" I am not able to escape the conclusion that the proceedings which took place at these meetings municipal council.\nIt is said in one of the judgments of thecourt below that the consequences of this construction condemn it. Now, when considering a legislative provision of doubtful meaning, the respective consequences of rival constructions as these consequences may be supposed to have presented themselves to the legislature in passing the enactment may, of course, properly be looked at: but that is a very different thing from saying that the actual consequences of a given construction in a particular case are necessarily conclusive or even relevant. The enactment in question was not framed with reference to the special circumstances of South Vancouver, but applied generally to the municipalities of British Columbia. If preponderance of convenience is to be a governing ingredient in passing upon the construction of the provision, then it is the general convenience we must consider. In this provision be it observed the legislature was prescribing a condition which, when complied with, was intended to have legal and practical consequences that might in some cases be' of considerable importance: and if considerations of general convenience are to be weighed I should have thought the balance to be clearly in favour of the view that the legislation re- quired not an unexpressed concurrence of \"sentiment\" merely, the existence of which might be incapable of direct proof, but some pronouncement or proceeding which, at least, should be susceptible of being ascribed to a definite occasion and of being noted in the public records of the council. The construction, indeed, for which the contend must come to this in its practical operation: that the legislative require ment is satisfied if the members of the council as individuals consent expressly or tacitly to holding meetings outside the municipality. If that was what the legislatur intended it is not easy to see how the legislature could have avoided saying so. I do not think anybody wishing to enact a provision having that anybody wishing to enact a provision having that effect would have used the language we have to construe.\nI may add that I do not see any good reason for thinking section 83a does not apply to the sittings of the court of revision. As I read the Act, it is the council which exercises the judicial or quasi-judicial functions of the court of revision. When the number of the council for ordinary purposes exceeds five, then those who are to exercise those functions are to be nominated by the council as a whole and, for the purposes of passing on the assessment roll, the council consists of the members so nominated. It appears to me to be clear that a sitting of the court of revision is properly described as a sitting of the council: and that all sittings of the council, whether for the exercise of legislative, administrative or judicial functions are within the purview of the provision in question. It is clear, however, if I am right in views above expressed, that not only the assessment but the \"rate by-laws\" (so called) of the years 1895 and 1896 were never in operation: and it also follows that the by-law professing to authorize the sale in question (which was passed at a meeting held outside the municipality and in the absence of any resolution, within the meaning of the statute sanctioning such a course) was on that ground alone apart from other grounds already mentioned wholly without legal effect.\nThe next point is whether, notwithstanding the absence of legal validity in the proceedings referred to, the appellant is precluded, by reason of certain statutory provisions, from relying on the objections he raises. Clement J. thinks he is precluded by section 126(3) of chapter 33, \"Municipal Act, 1892,\" R.S.B.C. (1897), ch. 144, sec. 86(2),' which continued in force until 1899. That section reads as follows:\u2014\nIn case no application to quash a by-law is made within one month next after the publication thereof in the British Columbia Gazette, and notice as provided in section 125 of this Act, the by-law, or so much thereof as is not the subject of any such application, or not quashed upon such application, so far as the same ordains, prescribes, or directs anything within the proper competence of the council to ordain, prescribe, or direct, shall, notwithstanding any. want of substance or form, either in the by-law itself, or in the time or manner of passing the same, be a valid by-law.\nIn my judgment this enactment applies only to bylaws passed by the council as a council on an occasion when it could lawfully transact business as the legislative organ of the municipality. It has, I think, nothing whatever to do with proceedings so fundamentally defective as those we have to consider in this appeal.\nThere remains the question whether the appellant has precluded himself by his own conduct from impeaching the proceedings and transactions in question. In considering that question the character of the action and the circumstances out of which it arose are important. The sale took place on the 6th October, 1908. On the 21st June, 1901, a deed was delivered to the purchaser. In October, 1906, an application was made for the registration of the purchaser's title which remained in abeyance until 1908 owing to the fact that the purchaser's deed had not been acknowledged as required by the \"Land Registry Act.\" In 1908, the appellant received a notice from the registrar under chapter 31, section 3, statutes 1901, requiring him to contest the claim to register the purchaser's title within the time prescribed by the statute. Within the prescribed time a caveat was filed by the appellant and an action commenced. This action was not proceeded with, but a second action (out of which this appeal arises) was begun some months later: the first action not being dismissed, but apparently remaining technically on foot until the present time. I shall deal later with a point raised for the first time on the argument before this court that the second action was barred by the provisions of the statute last mentioned. That enactment is as follows:\u2014\nIn case of applications under tax sales, the registrar shall not take notice of any irregularity in the tax sale or in any of the proceedings relating thereto, or inquire into the regularity of the tax sale proceedings, or any proceedings prior to or having relation to the assessment of the land, but a certificate from the proper officer of the Government, or the municipality, shall be furnished, showing the years for which there were taxes due and in arrear for which the land was sold at such sale, and the registrar shall satisfy himself that the sale was fairly and openly conducted, and he shall also cause to be served upon all persons appearing by the assessment roll of the district in which the lands are situate, or by the records of the land registry office, to be the persons who, other than the tax purchaser or his assigns, are interested in such land, a notice requiring them within the time limited by such notice, to contest the claim of the tax purchaser, and in default of a caveat or certificate of Us pendens being filed or in default of redemption, before the registration as owner of the person entitled under such tax-sale, all' persons so served with notice, * . * * forever estopped and debarred from setting up any claim to in respect of the land so sold for taxes, and the registrar register the person entitled under such tax sale as owner of so sold for taxe's.\nThere is no provision here for the determination of the question in dispute by the Registrar of Titles and it seems quite clear that either party, the applicant for registration under the tax sale or the contestant, could take proceedings to submit the question of title for judicial decision. I entertain no doubt that the Supreme Court would have jurisdiction to and would entertain a claim on part of either for a declaration of his or her legal rights without any demand for specific relif. In this case it was the contestant who invoked the decision of the court. He prayed for an injunction, but the substance of his claim was to have a declaration that his title ought to. prevail over that of the applicant. His own title had not been registered and the result of the action would determine whether the applicant or himself was to be registered as owner. I emphasize this for the purpose of pointing out that the appellant's action is not in substance a claim for equitable relief. It is an action occasioned and justified by reason of the situation created by the Act of 1901 and the substantial relief claimed is the special statutory relief of a declaration of rights. This latter is not equitable relief and not subject to the peculiar incidents of such relief. Chapman v. Michaelson[12].\nThe rights, moreover, which the appellant asserts are legal and not equitable rights. Prior to the tax-sale, October, 1898, he was the undisputed owner owner of a legal estate in fee simple, as tenant in common with another, of the land in question. If the sale \u2014 by reason of the proceedings essential to its validity being ineffectual in law\u2014 was in itself inoperative his title could not be affected by it. The sole question in the action is whether the pretended sale had or had not any legal effect and that question could have been raised in an action for the recovery of possession of the land as well as in the present proceedings. Something was made of section 153 of chapter 37, \"Municipal Act,\" 1896, which is as follows:\u2014\nThe deed to the purchaser of any land or real property sold under the provisions of any by-law passed under the authority of this Act, shall have the effect of vesting such land or real property' in the purchaser, his heirs or assigns: in fee simple or otherwise, according to the nature of the estate or interest sold,' and no such deed shall be invalid for any error miscalculation in the amount of taxes or interest thereon in arrear, or on account of the property having been assessed as land. And the registrar\u2014general, or any district registrar of titles, as the case may be, upon production of the deed and application in the usual form, and upon payment of the usual fees, shall register or record the same in the usual manner.\nThis section, however, applies only where the sale has been made under a \"by-law passed under the authority\" of the \"Municipal Act.\" It can have no effect where in point of law there has been no by-law and so we are again thrown back upon the question of the competence of the council to pass legally effectual bylaws while sitting outside the municipality. The appellant is, therefore, not a suitor seeking to enforce equitable rights or claiming equitable relief and consequently laches in itself would not disentitle him from maintaining his action. Garden Gully United Quartz Mining co. v. McLister[13] ,' Clarke v. Hart[14]. Has the appellant then by anything he has done or refrained from doing precluded himself from alleging that the sale was in law ineffectual to deprive him of his property? In considering this point it is, of course, to be presumed that, disregarding the statute of 1901, the sale in itself under which the respondent, Mrs. Fleming, claims was inoperative to affect the appellant's. title. I shall assume also that. the appellant knew of the sale in fact,' and that he deliberately refrained from taking advantage of the provisions of the \"Municipal Act\" entitling him to redeem the property.\nThe reasoning on which the learned judges in the courts below proceeded appears to be this: The appellant paid no taxes from 1893 to 1898, he had notice of the proposed sale in 1898 and at that time he stated to the collector that he did not know whether the property was worth the taxes: that he came forward to dispute the purchaser's title only when the value of the property had become very much increased. Referring to these circumstances the Chief Justice says:\nWhere there is, as I think there is here, conduct from which an abandonment of his property rights can with reasonable certainty be inferred a court of equity ought not to assist the plaintiff at the expense of innocent persons who have been guilty of no laches.\nI have pointed out that the appellant's action is not based upon equitable grounds nor is the substantial relief claimed equitable relief and we, consequently, have nothing to do with laches or with the principles upon which a court of equity deals with suitors who are compelled to seek assistance of a kind which equity alone can give.\nIt is perhaps a little confusing to speak of a process by which the beneficial owner of a legal estate in fee simple in land becomes divested of his property as \"abandonment.\" Certainly the intention, however deliberately formed, not to pay taxes and to permit his property to be sold for the payment of taxes followed by the most absolute knowledge that it has been sold, will not themselves suffice to vest it In a supposed purchaser at a tax sale if no taxes have in law become exigible in respect of it and the sale itself is in law inoperative. The circumstances mentioned may be of great importance in showing that the owner has by his conduct precluded himself from impeaching the proceedings resulting in the supposed sale, but in themselves they could never deprive the owner of his title.\nThe principle applicable to this branch of the case appears to be this: An owner of land in fee simple may be precluded by his silence or inaction from denying the authority of a third person to deal with his property, although this latter is a mere stranger and has no interest in the property and in law and in fact no authority whatever in respect of it; but in such a case inaction and silence in themselves are not sufficient to deprive the owner of his property unless, at all events, his conduct in the circumstances amounted to a representation to those dealing with the property that he would not assert his. rights, and they have acted on that representation, or his subsequent assertion of his rights would constitute a fraud on his part. That such is the principle is, I think, clear from the authorities. In 1723 in Savage v. Foster[15], the owner was held to be estopped from setting up his rights, \"for it was apparent fraud in him not to him not to give notice of his title to the intended purchaser.\" Another illustration of the method in which the court deals with such cases is afforded by the judgment of Fry L.J. in Willmott v. Barber[16], at pages 105 and 106. He says:\u2014\nIt has been said that the acquiescence which will deprive a man of his legal rights must amount to fraud, and in my view that is an abbreviated statement of a very true proposition. A man is not to be deprived of his legal rights unless he has acted in such a way as would make it fraudulent for him to set up those rights. What, then, are the elements or requisites necessary to constitute fraud of that description ? In the first place the plaintiff must have made a mistake as to his legal rights. Secondly, the plaintiff must have expended some money or must have done some act (not necessarily upon the defendant's land) on the faith of his mistaken belief. Thirdly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal right must know of the existence of his own right which is inconsistent with the right claimed by the plaintiff. If he does not know of it he is in the same position as the plaintiff, and the doctrine of acquiescence is founded upon conduct with a.knowledge of your legal rights. Fourthly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must know of the plaintiff's mistaken belief of his right. Fourthly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must know of the plaintiff's mistaken belief of his fights. If he dose not, there is nothing which calls upon him to assert his own rights. Lastly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must have encouraged the plaintiff in his expenditure of money or in the other acts which he has done, either directly or by abstaining from asserting his legal right. from exercising it, but, in my judgment, nothing short of this will do.\nTried by these tests the respondent's case on this branch utterly fails. Nobody suggests that theappellant knew or suspected that the taxes for the years mentioned had not been lawfully levied and were not exigible. Where, then, was the fraud ? Emphasis is placed on the fact that the appellant appears to have known the meeting of the court of revision was held in Vancouver in 1894. But it is obvious that the appellant never suspected that this circumstance vitiated the assessment of his property: and the muni- cipal officers certainly knew and for all that appears in evidence the purchaser (who seems in the purchase to have acted on behalf of the mortgagee) may have know much more about the affairs of the municipality than the appellant. The contention really comes to this, that the owner of real estate having failed to pay taxes demanded of him and having had his property sold to pay them is acting fraudulently if after having discovered that no taxes were ever lawfully levied he resists a claim of the purchaser to register his title. Does the failure to pay taxes alone disentitle an owner of land from insisting that he can only be deprived of his property according to law ? That appears to me to be an extreme view and a novel view as well. The purchaser at a tax sale has the same opportunities of examining the validity of the proceedings prior to the sale as the owner of the property sold. Why should the owner suppose that the proposed purchaser, still less the municipality, is acting upon the assumption that he will not take advantage of his legal position whatever it may be ? If there is a fatal defect in the proceedings of which both purchaser and owner are ignorant how can the purchaser complain if the owner (who has been no party to the proceedings and has done nothing calculated to throw him off his guard) discovering the defect later takes his stand on his strict legal rights ? If the purchaser cannot complain still less can the municipality. I should make a reference to Jones v. North Vancouver Land and Improvement Co.[17] and Prendergast v. Turton[18], which appear to have influenced the opinion of the court below. The principle of these decisions is thus stated in Clarke v. Hart[19], by Lord Wensleydale:\u2014\nNow, it appears to me that the principle to be. deduced from Prendergast v. Turton[20] and Norway v. Rowe[21], is, that if a partylies by, and by his conduct intimates to the other partners in the concern that he has abandoned his share; they may deal with it as they please; if his conduct amounts to a representation of that sort, he is estopped by it and cannot afterwards complain. Then the question is, whether upon the facts stated in this case the respondent is in that situation. * * * In that case the interpretation putupon the conduct of the parties, * * * was that they had laid by and pursued a course which was tantamount to saying, \"You may go on with the concern at your own risk and for your own benefit; I will have nothing more to do with it.\" If the conduct of the party has amounted to that, it is, no doubt, a perfectly just principle that he shall be held estopped, and not afterwards be entitled to claim a share of the profit made by those persons to whom he has made that representation.\nIn all these cases it will be observed that the fact that the parties were co-adventurers had no small influence in determining the decision of the court that the conduct of the plaintiff had had the effect thus described by Lord Wensleydale. Conduct which would be most unfair and even dishonest as between persons thus associated may be unimpeachable where the parties concerned stand in no business relation to one another and have always been at arms' length. I do not think any good purpose would be served by going minutely over the facts of those cases. The question is whether the facts of this ,case bring it within the principleapon which those cases proceeded. In Colls v. Home and Colonial Stores, Limited[22], at pages 191 and 192, Lord Macnaghten said:\u2014\nSpeaking for myself, I doubt very much whether it is a profitable task to .re\u2014try actions which depend simply on questions of fact, or to review an endeavour to reconcile or distinguish a number of cases that naturally enough contain some statements which, taken by themselves and apart from the context, may seem to be contradictory, but which must all proceed upon the same principle. It would only be another link in the embarrassing chain of authority, or, if I may venture to say so, only another handful of dust to be cast into one scale or the other when the claims of opposing litigants come to be weighed in the balance. I think there is much more sens in the observations of Brett L.J. in. Ecclesiastical Commissioners v. Kino[23] : \"To my mind,\" said his Lordship, \"the taking of some expression of a judge used in deciding a question of fact as to his own view of some one fact being material on a particular occasion as laying . down a rule of conduct for other judges in considering a similar state of facts in another case, is a false mode of treating authority. It appears to me that the view of a learned judge in a particular case as to the value of a particular piece of evidence is of no use to other judges who have to determine a similar question of fact in other cases where there may be many different circumstances to be taken into consideration.\"\nIt is possible, no doubt, to present some aspects of this case in such a way as to cause them to assume a superficial resemblance to the most striking features in the cases referred to. But examining it fairly as a question of fact, in light of all the facts disclosed by the evidence, it seems to me to be a very extravagant view that there was anything fraudulent in the appellant's conduct or that his silence or inaction was calculated to lead or did in fact lead anybody into shaping his course of action upon the belief that the appellant would refrain from asserting any right of which he had not been deprived by due process of law.\nIt was argued also that the action was too late. This defence is not pleaded and was not raised at the trial or in the Court of Appeal, and on that ground, I think, it ought not to be considered. Admittedly a writ was issued within the time prescribed by the Act of 1901 and the action so commenced for all that ap- pears was on foot at the time of the trial. The object of commencing the second action appears to have been to avoid the expense of amending the first writ by adding some necessary parties. If the defence now put forward had been raised in the statement of defence the actions might have been consolidated or the second action discontinued and the first proceeded with and if the point had been taken at the trial the learned trial judge would probably, if he had thought it necessary, have made an order to consolidate the actions, or adjourned the trial to enable such an order to be made. In these circumstances it is clearly too late now to give effect to the point.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff seeks a judgment declaratory of the nullity of proceedings taken by the defendant municipality for the sale for arrears of taxes of certain lands, in which he had a half interest, and consequential relief, alleging that the taxes said to be in arrear had not been validly imposed and also irregularities in the sale proceedings.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action. He held that the taxes were valid and that there had been no fatal irregularity in the sale proceedings. He was further of the opinion that, if there was irregularity in the imposition of the taxes, the plaintiff was debarred from relief because proceedings to quash the taxation by-laws had not been taken within one month after each of them was promulgated. (B.C. \"Municipal Act,\" 1892, sec. 126.) Any irregularity in the sale proceedings he thought would be covered by certain curative provisions of the same statute. Moreover, in his opinion, the defendants had established laches and acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff sufficient to defeat the action. On appeal Macdonald C.J. agreed with the trial judge that no fatal irregularity in the sale proceedings had been shown and that the objections to the validity of the taxes themselves, based on the facts that the meetings of the municipal council, at which the by-laws imposing the rates were adopted, and of the court of revision at which the assessment rolls were passed, had been held outside the territorial limits of the municipality, failed, because, in his opinion, \"the so-called court is merely a sitting of the council\" and there was sufficient proof that the council had \"unanimously resolved that it would be more convenient to hold (its) meetings * * * outside of the limits of the municipality,\" as it was authorized to do by 57 Vict. ch. 34, sec. 15. He also thought a case of laches and acquiescence had been made out. Galliher J.A. concurred, but upon the last mentioned ground only.\nIrving J.A. would have allowed the plaintiff's appeal on the grounds that no resolution providing for the holding of council meetings 'outside the municipality had been proved; that no authority existed for holding meetings of the court of revision without the municipal limits; that notice of the sale to the plaintiff had not been established; and that the curative sections invoked were inapplicable. Acquiescence in his opinion was not established. Martin J.A. found no evidence of any resolution authorizing meetings of council outside the municipal limits and no proof of acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff.\nFrom this affirmance, by an equal division in the Court of Appeal, of the judgment dismissing his action the plaintiff appeals to this court.\nFor the meetings of council held outside the limits of the municipality prior to the amendment of 1894 (57 Vict. ch. 34, sec. 15) there was no statutory authority whatever. As to the meetings held after that amendment, became law, I agree with Irving and Martin, JJ.A., that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that the municipal council unanimously adopted a resolution, formal or informal, giving the authority requisite under 57 Vict. ch.34, sec. 15, for the holding of its meetings outside the municipality. I think the onus was on the defendants to prove such a resolution or to establish facts from which it might be fairly inferred. But, if the burden..was upon the plaintiff to show that such a resolution had not in fact been passed, the evidence, in my opinion, warrants that conclusion.\nThe \"Municipal Act\" (section 97) requires that\nthe minutes of the proceedings of all meetings of the council shall be drawn up and fairly entered into a book to be kept for that purpose and shall be signed by the. mayor. etc.\nThe minute book was produced. It contains no entry of any such resolution. This would probably suffice to establish its non-existence. Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.), par. 1781.' But, if not, the evidence of the municipal clerk, Martin, to the effect that, all resolutions of the council passed' during his term of office appear in the minute book and that a resolution fixing Vancouver as the place of meeting would, if passed, appear in the minutes, makes complete the proof that there was no such resolution. In the face of this evidence it seems to me impossible to infer, merely from the fact that the council held practically all its meetings outside the municipality, that the requisite resolution had been passed. It would be still more difficult to infer that it had been passed unanimously. Notwithstanding the dearth of authority on the point, due probably to the rarity of such a departure from normal and eminently reasonable practice as would be the holding of meetings of municipal councils outside the limits of the municipality without special statutory authority, I entertain no doubt that the meetings held in the City of Vancouver, because not specially authorized by statute (e.g., vide \"Ont. Mun. Act, 1903,\" sec. 265), were illegal and that the taxation by-laws enacted at them were not merely irregular, but were null and void. There appears to be no English or Canadian authority. Paffard v. County of Lincoln[24] may be referred to. But Board of Commissioners of Marion County v. Barker[25] seems to be the only case directly in point. See, too, Harris v. State[26] ; Re Hill and Walsingham[27], at page 312.\nBut if an inference that such a resolution had been passed might be drawn from the course pursued by the council subsequently to the Act of 1894, that would not, in my opinion, authorize the holding of sessions of the court of revision outside the limits of the municipality. I am, with respect, unable to accept the view that \"this so-called court is merely a sitting of the council.\" In many, perhaps in most cases, the personnel of the municipal council and that of the court of revision may be the same. (B.C. \"Municipal Act, 1892, sec. 160.) But, notwithstanding the form of the opening paragraph of section 157 of the statute, they must be deemed distinct entities, at least to this extent\u2014that the statutory provision authorizing the holding in certain circumstances of meetings of the council outside the limits of the municipality is inapplicable to the sessions of the court of revision. The complainants against the work of the assessor are obliged to attend these sessions either in person or by agent and nothing short of a direct and explicit statutory enactment would suffice to take away their right to have them held within the limits of the municipality.That the court of revision and the municipal council are not the same body is, I think, made abundantly clear by section 161 of the \"Municipal Act\"\n161. If the council consists of more than five members, such council shall by resolution appoint five of its members to be the Court of Revision.\nThe body discharging the functions of the Court of Revision might have a personnel entirely different from the council. Of this the cities of Ontario afford examples. (Ont. \"Assessment Act,\" 4 Edw. VII. ch. 23, sec. 57.) That councillors act as members of the court is due mainly to considerations of convenience, or it may be of economy.' When sitting qud court of revision the members of it, although it should have the same personnel as the council, can exercise none of the legislative or administrative powers of the latter body: neither can the council, when sitting as such, discharge any of the judicial functions of the court of revision. The notice prescribed by section 157 of the Act leads to this conclusion. The procedure provided by section 158 is consistent with it.\nThat the Court of Revision is a court of limited jurisdiction constituted to discharge judicial functions is, I think, the proper conclusion from the provisions of sections 162, 164, 165 and 166 of the B, C. \"Municipal Act\" and from such authorities as Toronto Railway Co.v. City of Toronto[28] ; Re Crow's Nest Pass Coal Co.'s Assessment[29] ;Sisters of Charity of Providence v. City of Vancouver[30], at page 37; and .Re Rosbach and Carlyle[31]: that its jurisdiction is territorially restricted by the limits of the municipality is undoubted. In the absence of express statutory authority permitting it to hold its sessions beyond the territorial limits over which it holds jurisdiction, such a court can validly exercise its powers only when sitting within that territory. The Queen v. Inhabitants of Totness[32] ; Ex parte Graves[33] ;Phillips v. Thralls[34]. But if the sittings of the Court of Revision should be deemed meetings of the council, for reasons already given, they could not lawfully be held outside the municipality.\nThe \"passing\" of the assessment rolls at legal sessions of a duly constituted court of revision was, I think, essential to their validity. In the absence of rolls so \"passed\" there was no power in the municipal council to enact the by-laws imposing the rates complained of. It follows that the taxes in question were not legally or validly imposed or levied.\nThere is no curative provision in the statute which overcomes such an objection. The section invoked by the learned trial judge, which declares the validity of every by-law not moved against within one month after its publication, is restricted in its application to by-laws \"within the competence of the council.\" The taxation by-laws impugned in this action were not within the competence of the council. Without. valid assessment rolls duly \"passed\" by the Court of Revision it was not competent for the council to enact them. They were nullities.. Proceedings to quash them were unnecessary.\nUnless debarred by estoppel, acquiescence or laches, the plaintiff is, in my opinion, entitled to the relief he seeks.\nThe plaintiff is asserting a legal, not an equitable right. Mere laches, as distinguished from acquiescence or estoppel, will not preclude his recovery. De Bussche v. Alt[35] ; In re Madever[36].\nThere is no evidence of any actual representation or of any voluntary act on his part calculated to induce a belief that the defendant municipality was in a position to make a valid sale of the property in question for arrears of taxes, or that the plaintiff assented to or acquiesced in the sale. This case is, therefore, clearly distinguishable from Toronto v. Russell[37], much relied upon at bar. Neither was there any conduct of the plaintiff from which a purchaser could reasonably infer an intention on his part not to enforce his rights \u2014 if, indeed, that would suffice. Chadwick v. Manning[38] \u2014 or that he had no rights. The defendant municipality certainly had all the facts now relied upon to render the assessment invalid; appears, had the same means of knowledge; and there is nothing to show that they had not quite as much actual knowledge of these facts as the plaintiff had. The plaintiff 's own knowledge of them is very doubtful; and that he was aware of their effect on the validity of the taxes there is not a tittle of evidence. Although misleading action in ignorance of rights may in some circumstances give rise to an estoppel, Sarat Chunder Dey v. Gopal Chunder Laha[39] , a party cannot, because of mere silence or inaction, be held to have acquiesced unless he was fully cognizant of his adverse right. Earl Beauchamp v. Wine[40] ; Willmott v. Barber[41]. If he be ignorant of his right, the duty to speak, upon the failure to discharge which the equitable estoppel is based, does not arise. \"Silence is innocent and safe where there is no duty to speak.\" Chadwick v. Manning[42]. The evidence that the plaintiff knew of the intended sale is somewhat dubious. But, if he did, and if he was fully cognizant of his own rights, his duty to intervene is by no means clear haying regard to the vendor-corporation's actual knowledge of the facts on which objection to the validity of the taxes for which the lands were to be sold is based and its public character\u2014and to the means of knowledge available to the defendant purchasers and the absence of any evidence that they were, or that the plaintiff had reason to believe they were ignorant of such facts, or that he knew that his land would be purchased under a mistaken belief as to his rights. Willmott. v. Barber[43] ; Proctor v. Bennis[44]. I am unable to see how the plaintiff's inaction can be said to have been culpable, or to have induced the defendant municipality to sell or its codefendant to purchase. That was the case which the defendants undertook to make out under their defence of acquiescence or estoppel. They have, in my opinion, failed to establish it.\nIt follows that this appeal should be allowed and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff with costs throughout.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting). \u2014By his action the appellant wants to set aside a tax sale that had taken place more than ten years before.\nIt was dismissed by the Superior Court of British Columbia, and, the Court of Appeal of that province being equally divided, the judgment of the Superior Court was not disturbed.\nSeveral questions have been raised before this court, but they can be reduced to the two following: \u2014\n1st. Did the municipal council of South Vancouver impose a valid taxation and was the tax-sale valid although the council sat outside of the municipality ?\n2nd. Did the appellant acquiesce in the validity of the proceedings of the council and of the tax sale ?\nI will state the facts as briefly as possible.\nIn 1892 the municipality of South Vancouver was created by proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the provisions of the general municipal Act (55 Vict. B.C. ch. 33).\nIt was a rural municipality covering a large terrify around the City of Vancouver.\nIt was sparsely settled, just a few houses here and there. Most of the residents had their business in the adjoining city and a large number of property owners were living and residing also in that city.\nThe communications between those different settlements were rather difficult, though all of them had an easy access to Vancouver. One of the first questions that the municipal council had to decide was' the selection of the locality where they would hold their meetings.\nThey had met for the purpose of organization on the 7th May, 1892, at a school house in the municipality. That school house was not, however, their property nor under their control.\nThey unanimously decided \"that the next meeting be held\" at 623 Hastings Street, in the adjoining City of Vancouver.\nFrom that date the clerk of the municipality had his office at that place, the council sat there for their ordinary meetings and for their meetings as a court of revision. All the by-laws, including assessment, rate or tax sale by-laws were passed there and published in newspapers in Vancouver (since none were published in the municipality itself) and in the official Gazette; and those advertisements generally contained the. above address, 623 Hastings Street, as being the place of business of the municipality and the place where the council had its meetings.\nIf notices had to be given to individuals they contained the same information.\nIt was then notoriously known that the council was sitting in the city.\nThe appellant himself, one day in 1894, appeared before council sitting as the Court of Revision, at that place, to appeal against assessment put on the property in dispute in this case.\nHe never raised the objection that the council, or the Court of Revision, was not holding its meetings at a proper place, though a decision adverse to his request was then rendered.\nNeither the Attorney-General nor the provincial authorities ever objected as to their holding their meetings outside of the municipalities\". Until 1894 no provision was inserted in the \"Municipal Act\" as to the places where the councils should sit. In that year an amendment was made which should be interpreted in favour of the validity of the councils' action. It declared that the meetings of the council should be held in the municipality unless the councillors unanimously resolved to hold them outside. We have in the municipal code in Quebec a similar provision (art. 106).\nThat amendment was interpreted by the clerk as meaning that the council of South Vancouver should hold its first meeting in January each year in the municipality and we see that in the next years they used to meet at a railway station in the municipality and pass a resolution to hold their meetings in Vancouver, always at the same place, 623 Hastings Street.\nIt is true that the resolutions are not as formal as should be desired, but we must not expect that the minutes of proceedings of those rural municipalities should be absolutely regular and formal.\nThose proceedings were carried in good faith. They were notorious and known to the appellant.\nIt would be contrary to the welfare of our municipal institutions to allow a person to come after sixteen years and say that those proceedings were null and void.\nThe appellant knew his property was assessed for the payment of the municipal taxes. He was supposed to see in the official Gazette and in the local newspapers that the meetings of the council were held in Vancouver.\nHe never paid his taxes and even after the property was sold he never inquired for the payment of the taxes. He received, until the property was sold for taxes, from the assessor and from the collector, notices showing the assessment and the amount due for taxes. He claims that when the tax sale was made he did not receive the notice that the law provided.\nIt is one of the disputed facts of this case. The appellant relies a great deal upon the absence of such notice to maintain his appeal.\nThe evidence may be conflicting; but it is one of those cases where the trial judge, who had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses, is in a better position to express his opinion than by the mere reading of the evidence. I may add, however, that the hesitations of the appellant, in his evidence, convinced me that he received in due time that notice and I concur heartily in the finding of the trial judge that the appellant knew that the lot in which he was interested was advertised for sale to satisfy the taxes against it, and that he duly received a notice to that effect. In spite of his denial of the knowledge of an actual sale, he must be taken to have known that the advertised sale was duly carried out and that his land was sold.\nWhy then did he not move ? The explanation of his silence is given to us by the clerk of the municipality who happened to meet him and the appellant told him\nthat he did not think the property was worth very much at the time. He did not know whether it was worth the taxes or not.\nIt may be added that the lot was then in the bush and that there was no access to it whatever. The appellant admits that he visited that lot only once. The property was sold for the amount of the taxes and purchased practically by the mortgagee of the property who, I suppose, wanted to protect his interests.\nThe appellant, who knew of the existence of that mortgage and the depression of the land market in the locality, was satisfied to let the lot be sold.\nTen years later, when the property had largely increased in value, and was worth perhaps $20,000, he comes and asks the courts to declare the tax-sale null and void because the council sat in the City of Vancouver, in the city where he was himself living. I think that the proceedings of the council should be held valid and that the appellant, by his actions, his declarations and his conduct generally in what has been done, is estopped by such acquiescence from setting up any title to the property.\nI would not feel disposed to maintain his action.\nIn declaring all the proceedings of the council null and void we would simply create a state of chaos and confusion and cause the ruin of many innocent persons.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacNeill, Bird, MacDonald & Bayfield.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Ralston: Russell, Russell & Hannington.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Fleming: W.

Anglin J. dissenting.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The broker is not liable under the above conditions if he pledges the stock believing that his arrangement with his client so authorized.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The dealings complained of were in accordance with the ordinary practice of brokers in Toronto in respect to stocks being carried \u201con margin,\u201d and the proper inference from all the evidence was that such dealings were authorized by the arrangement between the parties.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The broker must at all times be in a position to hand over the stock to his client and if, as the result of his pledging it, he puts himself in a position where he may not be able to do so, he is guilty of conversion.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (20 Ont. L.R. 611), affirming that of the Divisional Court (19 Ont. L.R. 545) affirmed. Conmee v. The Securities Holding Co. (38 Can. S.C.R. 601) distinguished.\n(Leave to appeal to Privy Council was refused, 13th Dec. 1911.)\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of a Divisional Court[2] by which the verdict at the trial in favour of the defendants was sustained. The facts are stated in the judgment of the Divisional Court as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe plaintiff brings this action to recover damages from the defendants because of their alleged dealings in respect of certain stocks known as the Sao Paulo, and Louisville and Nashville stocks, which the plaintiff engaged them to purchase for her on margin, as the term is. The learned trial judge disposed of the case adversely to the plaintiff, on the ground that she had failed to shew damage. Against this judgment she has appealed to this court.\n\u201cHer complaint as to the Sao Paulo stock is that the defendants, without her consent and in breach of their duty towards her, hypothecated it together with other stocks in which she had no interest, for a bulk sum exceeding many times the amount of her indebtedness to them, and that this conduct operated as a conversion. As to the Louisville and Nashville stock she charges that the defendants did not in fact purchase it for her, but, nevertheless, represented to her that they had done so. Ultimately, upon demand, they delivered to her agent for her the shares of the two stocks to the amount ordered by her; but, she says, did not inform her of the facts now complained of; that in ignorance of these facts she paid for and accepted the stocks and disposed of them; that on discovering the facts she considered herself entitled to damages, and accordingly brought this action.\n\u201cIt is beyond question that the defendants purchased for the plaintiff the Sao Paulo shares in accordance with the terms of her instruction, she paying them a small portion of the purchase money therefor, and owing to them the balance, the defendants being entitled to hold these shares until the plaintiff paid them the amount owing in respect thereof. The defendants admit that they borrowed on the security of these shares, and of other stocks a sum of money greatly in excess of the amount owing by the plaintiff.\n\u201cAs to the Louisville and Nashville stock, on the day of the plaintiff ordering its purchase, the defendants telegraphed instructions to a firm of brokers in New York to make the purchase, and in due course that firm sent to the defendants a bought note for the amount of shares thus ordered, whereupon the defendants represented to the plaintiff that her instructions had been complied with. It was, however, contended before us that if the New York brokers made the purchase of the Louisville and Nashville stock for the plaintiff, they the same day, sold it, and that thereafter no Louisville and Nashville stock was held for her by the defendants or their agents. On this point it may be observed that even if the New York brokers did sell the plaintiff\u2019s stock, still the defendants, so far as appears, were wholly unaware of the fact, and acted in perfect good faith in representing to her that the stock had been purchased and was being held for her. However, we think that the evidence shews that the New York brokers purchased for defendants in pursuance of the plaintiff\u2019s instructions to them the number of shares ordered for her, and that, although they sold the particular shares so purchased, still they always held either free from hypothecation or hypothecated, the number of shares which the defendants had ordered them to purchase, and on account of which she paid to them a sum of money by way of margin. In this transaction, the New York brokers seem to have known the defendants only, and were carrying for them many other stocks, all of which, including the plaintiff\u2019s Louisville and Nashville shares, were being held by them as security for the whole indebtedness of the defendants to them, being an amount greatly in excess of the plaintiff\u2019s indebtedness to the defendants. After the lapse of some months the plaintiff applied to the defendants for both stocks, viz.: the Sao Paulo and the Louisville and Nashville, and at once, upon her paying the amount of the defendants\u2019 claim, they were transferred to her order.\u201d\nNesbitt K.C. and Wood for the appellants. The respondents were bound to purchase and then to carry the shares for the appellant. Robinson v. Mollett[3], at pages 815, 836, 838; Johnson v. Kearley[4], at pages 527 to 529; Parsons v. Hart[5].\nRespondents were agents of appellant and when they converted the shares she could demand their value at the market price on that day. Stubbs v. Slater[6].\nHellmuth K.C. and Long for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have no doubt that this appeal should be dismissed. The appellant brought an action to recover from the respondents damages for breach of an agreement to purchase for her certain shares of stock in these circumstances:\u2014\nThe appellant is a spinster admittedly familiar with the usages and practice of the stock market and the respondents are brokers and members of the Toronto stock exchange. Instructions to purchase on margin a certain number of shares of Sao Paulo and of Louisville and Nashville stock were given verbally by the appellant and when the orders were executed a notice called a bought note was sent to her in each case to inform her that her order was executed and setting forth the conditions subject to which the purchase was made.\nThe purchase of stock on margin through a broker necessarily involves an advance by the latter of a sum which added to the amount of the margin put up by the customer will be sufficient to enable the broker to pay for the stock. It is proved beyond doubt that to procure this money the broker is entitled, according to the well established usage of the stock exchange both in Toronto and New York, to re-pledge en bloc the stock bought by him on margin. To enable this re-pledging to be done in a way most advantageous for both parties and to avoid all misunderstanding as to the authority of the broker, this term was inserted in all the bought notes:\u2014\nWhen carrying stocks for clients, we reserve the right of pledging the same or raising money upon them in any way most convenient to us.\nIt is admitted that the broker did in the case of each purchase make the necessary advances for his customer, the appellant; but the latter contends that while the broker had the stocks in his possession they were pledged by him to raise a sum of money in excess of what was then due to him by her with respect to each block of stock and that such a dealing constituted a conversion of the stocks to his own use and that he must account for their full value at that date notwithstanding that he acted in perfect good faith.\nThere can be no doubt, as both parties admit, that the broker had the right to hypothecate the stock of his client so long as he did not pledge it for an amount in excess of what was due him by the client in connection with the purchase and the trial judge finds as a fact\nthat the stock which was for a good deal of the time unpledged was never at any time pledged by the respondents beyond the amount due them by the appellant for that portion of the purchase made which they had advanced.\nIf not sufficient to justify this finding which, of course, puts an end to the plaintiff\u2019s claim the evidence is very conclusive that the brokers had at all times control over the stock and could deliver it to the appellant, as they did on her first demand, on payment of the amount due on each purchase. When she did ask for delivery of the stocks the certificates were partly in respondents\u2019 vaults and partly in the possession of their agents in New York, subject to their order; and her directions with respect thereto were immediately complied with and the stocks were never at any time dealt with by the brokers to the damage of the appellant and to the profit of the respondents. On the contrary it is clear on every line of the evidence that the brokers acted with the utmost good faith, in strict accordance with the usages and customs known to the appellant and with reference to which she is properly presumed to have made her contract.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed upon the ground that there was no evidence whatever that the plaintiff (appellant) had sustained any loss by reason of the alleged conversions of her stock of which she complains. The respondents were brokers and had purchased stock for the appellant on the margins advanced for the purpose by the appellant. They had pledged this stock so purchased together with other stock of other clients with one of the banks not only to raise the difference between the margins put up by the appellant and the purchase price of the stocks, but also to cover their general indebtedness to the banks which was, of course, much greater than the sum owing to them upon the appellant\u2019s stock. The appellant contends that the manner in which the pledge was made constituted in law a conversion of her stock and entitled her to recover the damages she claimed.\nThe facts proved shewed that the alleged conversion was in accordance with the ordinary practice of the respondent brokers in their dealings with the banks respecting the hypothecation by them of stocks of their customers, and that although they had hypothecated the appellant\u2019s stock or shares together with other stocks for a sum of money greatly in excess of the amount owing by the plaintiff on her stock, the moment she demanded her stock her demand had been complied with and her stock duly transferred to her, accepted by her and then sold by her. The alleged conversion by the improper manner of hypothecating the shares brought no profit to the brokers nor any loss to the appellant. It was not till long afterwards that plaintiff brought her action.\nOn the ground, therefore, that although the brokers were not under the terms of their contract with the appellant as I construe it justified in pledging her shares in the manner they did, yet as they delivered the shares to the appellant immediately she demanded them and that she did not suffer any damage whatever from the alleged impropriety I think this action cannot be sustained.\nOwing to some observations made in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal I think it desirable to say that further argument of the question of the legal meaning of the foot-note to the bought and sold notes of the brokers under which they claimed the right to hypothecate these shares for a larger sum than was due to them upon the shares by their owner has not tended to weaken or alter the opinion I expressed with regard to its meaning in the case of Conmee v. Securities Holding Co.[7], namely, that its language does not justify the broker in pledging the shares for a sum greater than that due from the customer to him.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondents contracted with the appellant to purchase and carry for her certain stocks. In the course of the business she claims they had pledged or hypothecated such stocks in such a way that she is entitled to charge against them the then market value of said stocks, though much depreciated in value when she received a transfer to her of said stocks or the like stocks and disposed of them, and hence suffered loss.\nI am somewhat at a loss to know exactly on what legal grounds the claim is put.\nIf we are to treat the stocks in question as transferable in such a way that they can be looked upon as chattels susceptible of conversion for which an action of trover would lie and this as if such an action, we are met with the legal difficulty that it has always been competent for the court in an action of trover to stay the proceedings for damages upon a delivery up of a chattel.\nThat is what has happened by the act of the parties, and how can damages rest on that ground?\nIt has sometimes been competent for the owner of the chattel wrongfully converted, to waive the tort and sue for price or proceeds of goods and recover. This option could only be exercised upon the complete abandonment of any right to, or interest in, the chattel, which is impossible on the facts here.\nIn either of such alternatives as I present, the property in the thing in question is presumed in law to have become by the judgment of recovery, vested in the wrongdoer or party meddling with another\u2019s property. Hence no such ground of action is conceivable here.\nAgain, trusteeship is spoken of as a possible ground. How it can be invoked in such a case or made to operate is unexplained. Even if so a trustee having power of disposal pretending to exercise it by a circuitous method so that he ultimately becomes apparent owner as result of such transactions, has been held bound at the option of the cestui qui trust to account upon the footing of his alleged sale or whilst being tentatively held thereto to have the property put up for sale and the chances of a better bid being got given the cestui que trust. See Ex parte Hughes[8] (1802), and Ex parte Lacey[9] (1802).\nShort of some such situation as that, I know of no legal principle upon which the courts have ever acted to charge a trustee or agent improperly dealing with the trust estate with the value thereof; unless same or part thereof, debited has been lost as the result of such improper dealing.\nThe evidence in this case falls short of anything in any of these conceivable cases.\nI am also unable to understand how our decision in the Conmee Case[10] has any bearing on the issues raised herein.\nI would not for a moment say a word to weaken what we held in so plain a case as that was. Yet even if appellant had before accepting delivery to her of the stocks in question, made her alleged discovery of the facts herein relative to the pledging or hypothecation of the stocks in question and sought to make respondents responsible therefor, I would not be quite sure that she had brought herself within the said decision.\nThe hypothecation or pledging of the property of another beyond what that other authorizes, may have in many ways serious results that are not apparent in this case where no damages are shewn to have in fact resulted from the act complained of.\nAgain it is claimed as to the stock bought in New York that in fact there never was a purchase of that stock. The learned trial judge found that there was in fact such a purchase. The Divisional Court in appeal therefrom, also found there was such a purchase.\nThough not expressly dealing with the point the Court of Appeal for Ontario must also be taken to have held the same way.\nIt is too late for us to reverse such findings of fact on such conflicting evidence as exists herein. The utmost that can be said with a full assurance that we are not infringing upon the rule as to concurrent finding of fact by courts below is this, that the stock alleged to have been purchased in New York, passed by reason of some sort of understanding between the respondents and their New York agents, into a body of mingled securities pledged or hypothecated for a very large balance due from respondents to their New York agents in respect of similar transactions.\nNow I am not at all prepared to hold that a broker in Toronto retained to buy stocks in New York, has completely executed the business entrusted to him, when he has by the same act of buying so called, so bound the alleged purchase as to subject it to the common charge (exceeding his advance in the purchase) covering it and many others.\nIt is idle to speak of the other securities being ample, or the personal credit of the broker in New York being ample, so long as the charge exceeds the value of the stock presumed to have been bought.\nNor am I disposed to stretch the implied authority, which may exist as suggested in the Court of Appeal, even if known and so recognized amongst brokers in Toronto, as to be binding upon each other or members of the Stock Exchange, to cover the duty arising towards a person ignorant thereof, when the broker is retained merely to purchase in New York, even when coupled with an agreement to advance part of the price.\nI think this case must be disposed of by strict attention to the nature of the contract between the parties and the consequences of some breach thereof. In doing so I desire not to be misunderstood as accept- ing without limitation either what has been held in the court below, or been contended for here and probably there, and hence my taking trouble to explain (by what I have said) in advance, what I am about to say.\nThe contract seems accurately stated in the following evidence of one of the respondents:\u2014\n249. Q.\u2014The contract was that she was to pay 15% or 20% of the par value of the stock, and you were to pay the balance to purchase it, and the stock was to be pledged to you for the amount you put up, and she was to keep her margin up according to the fluctuations of the market,\u2014was that the contract between you? A.\u2014Yes, that is the contract; there was no written contract.\nI do not think such a contract warrants the broker acting upon it either pledging or hypothecating the stock purchased pursuant thereto, for any greater sum than he has advanced together with the interest and commission due him.\nNor, to guard myself by repeating what I have said already relative to New York, do I think that if the purchase and this unwarranted pledging or hypothecating are, as they may be in a given case such as that of the dealing in Sao Paulo stock in question, part and parcel of the same transaction, that the broker has executed his contract to purchase.\nIt is not clear exactly how that was in this case. It is tolerably clear, however, that in the many changes involved here there must have been a time when the contract of purchase was executed by the terms of the pledge or hypothecation having been so expressed as to enable the shares in question to have been as of right withdrawn upon payment of the sum due from appellant to respondent.\nIt is, moreover, absolutely clear that the stocks were on demand of the appellant freed from any charge and immediately transferred to her upon her paying the amounts due.\nThe purchase the respondents were retained to make must then at all events have been fully executed, and I fail to see how thereafter she can, under the circumstances, now be heard to say the contrary, especially in the absence of any tender back of that which she got.\nNow assume for argument\u2019s sake, that the respondents exceeded in any way by unauthorized pledging or hypothecating the limits of their legal rights, and even have thereby improperly jeopardized the appellant\u2019s property and her interests in question relative thereto, how can she on the facts claim she was damnified? No damage is shewn. No case is made shewing such damages. If her pleadings might cover nominal damages that is not what has been thrashed out in the long drawn out contest.\nAnd if it ever was open to the appellant to rest upon such a case, the facts have been so held by the courts below, and the nature of the contest has been throughout so entirely distinct from such a consequence, that I do not think we can now reverse on such technical grounds, all that has passed in the courts below.\nAlthough a case may be conceivable of transactions of such magnitude as to effect by such methods as in question the value of the stocks in the market, no evidence here shews such results to have taken place.\nI may remark that though I have used purposely in order to cover briefly all points of view, the terms pledging or hypothecating as possibly conceivable relative to what was done, I by no means overlook the widely different legal meanings of the words, and in some cases, legal results, of improperly dealing with property subject thereto, or made the subject thereof.\nIn common parlance, and as used for convenience sake in argument the terms are loosely treated as interchangeable, though not so.\nIt so happens here I simply have to solve a legal problem arising in this case which must be solved in the same way, whether or not the thing known as stocks herein, or the evidence thereof, can be properly spoken of as subject matter of a pledge.\nIn the absence of fraud and having regard to the good faith of respondents, however mistaken in my view of their legal rights, I see no conceivable ground of action beyond breach of contract.\nOne question yet remains and that is the minor one of the one-half per cent. interest charged beyond the rate the brokers were paying. The contract is not clear, but the conduct of the parties makes it clear. She was told from time to time what interest was being charged. Unless the relation of principle and agent excludes the right to charge more than paid, the contract, or that and the conduct of the parties, forbids complaint.\nThe relation created by this contract is not one purely of principal and agent. It involves much more and thereby to my mind excludes in the absence of any countervailing facts and circumstances reducing it to that simple relation the application of the principles of law prohibiting an agent from making a profit unassented to by the principal.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed. I should not have thought it necessary to add anything to the reasons given by the learned judges who have dealt fully with the questions involved in the court below were it not for the difference of opinion in this court and the circumstance that the decision of the Court of Appeal (it is argued) is in some way inconsistent with the decision of this court in Conmee v. The Securities Holding Co.[11]\nThere are several grounds upon which I think the plaintiff\u2019s action must fail.\nThe evidence shews very clearly, I think, that both in New York and Toronto there is a well understood and well defined usage among brokers who buy and carry stocks for customers \u201con margin\u201d to re-pledge or hypothecate such stock en bloc for the purpose of raising the funds necessary to meet the obligations incurred by them in the transactions they have executed or undertaken to execute.\nIt was stated at the trial by Mr. E.B. Osler that this practice is advantageous to the customer because it enables the broker to borrow money at a lower rate. That it is a reasonable practice is shewn, first, by the fact of its general adoption in the two places mentioned, and secondly, by the circumstance that in the State of Massachusetts almost without exception and on the London Stock Exchange in the vast majority of cases such transactions are treated as executory agreements for the sale by the broker to the customer at the price at which the stocks are purchased plus a charge for interest and the broker so long as he carries the stocks is entitled to deal with them as owner. In Bentinck v. London Joint Stock Bank[12] the subject was dealt with by North J. who sums up the evidence given in that case at pp. 140 and 141 thus:\u2014 Now the evidence as to \u201ccontango\u201d transactions is this\u2014I am only giving a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 so far as it is now material\u2014when a client directs a broker to buy stock for which the client is not himself finding the money to pay at the time, the money is provided by the broker, and he borrows the money for the purpose. This is done sometimes, no doubt, by a pure and simple loan; but in a very large majority of cases, amounting, according to the evidence of Mr. Grant, the official assignee of the Stock Exchange, to sixteen-twentieths of the whole business on the Stock Exchange, and, according to Mr. Powell\u2019s evidence, to nineteen-twentieths of the whole business, the thing is done by the broker finding the money on \u201ccontango,\u201d and then what happens is this: he is treated, not as the mortgagee or pledgee of the shares for the money which he advances, but he becomes by contract the purchaser of the shares out and out, and they become his own property. The shares are not yet transferred to him\u2014he does not acquire any legal interest in them; but, as between the client on whose account he has bought them on the one hand, and himself on the other, when he finds the money on \u201ccontango\u201d he becomes the absolute owner of the property, subject, however, to a contract made at the same time, or part of the same contract, that he is to re-sell to the client a like amount, not the same identical shares, but a like amount of similar shares, usually on the next account day, although a later day may be fixed by arrangement, at a price larger than that for which he gave his client credit on the first occasion; because the enhanced price is to cover interest upon the money in the meantime. Therefore, in fact, these \u201ccontango\u201d transactions, although they are constantly treated as loans of money, even by persons who are thoroughly familiar with the business, although they are popularly spoken of, even on the Stock Exchange and by members of the Stock Exchange, when they come before the Court, as loans, yet, when the transaction is regarded from a legal point of view, it is not a loan on the client\u2019s security, but is a sale by which the broker becomes entitled to the security as his own, although he is subject to a contract to re-sell to the client, not the same, but an equal amount of similar shares or stocks at a future date. In all these transactions, therefore, when money is borrowed from a stockbroker on \u201ccontango\u201d or \u201ccontinuation,\u201d whether the money is obtained from the dealer or from other stockbrokers, or from bankers, the result is the same: the arrangement is one by which the broker becomes, as between himself and his client, the owner of the shares in question, although he is under a contract to provide an equal amount of similar shares at a future date. This being the nature of the business between the parties, the reason why these \u201ccontangos\u201d or \u201ccontinuations\u201d are often called loans is quite clear; but this does not alter the legal position of the parties con- cerned in them, or prevent the shares held by the brokers under such circumstances from being their own and available by them.\nAccording to the practice among brokers in Toronto and New York with reference to stocks so carried the powers of the broker over the stocks are much more restricted than those thus indicated. The evidence of Mr. Osler makes it plain that while the broker may pledge his securities en bloc he is, according to the practice in Toronto, bound to do so in such a way\u2014that is to say, he is bound so to maintain the ratio between the loan and the value of the securities lodged\u2014as to be able at any time on payment of the amount owing by a particular customer to procure delivery of any pledged shares which may be the property of that customer. His primary obligation, in a word, is to maintain such control over his hypothecated securities as to enable him at any time to carry out his contract with his customer; but subject to that he may pledge his customer\u2019s security with others en bloc for the purpose of getting the necessary funds to carry out his obligations. It appears to me to be a question of fact whether or not the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants was entered into with reference to this practice. I do not think the law assigns such legal incidents to an arrangement by a broker to carry stocks \u201con margin\u201d for a speculator as to exclude such a practice. I am quite willing to concede that in the absence of any such custom and in the absence of any express agreement to the contrary the relation between the customer and broker in such transactions would be in substance that of mortgagor and mortgagee subject to some modifications necessary to suit the peculiar necessities of the case. Here, however, we have such a cus- tom, and I think the effect of the evidence is that in Toronto at all events it would be impracticable for brokers to carry out such transactions without resorting to the methods mentioned. There are some observations of Parke B. in Foster v. Pearson[13], at pages 858, 859 and 860, not without a bearing upon the point.\nThe judgment in the case of Haynes v. Foster[14] is treated in the argument for the defendant as establishing that it is a sort of legal incident to the character of a bill-broker that he is to pledge the bills of each customer separately; but we think that such is not the fair meaning of the judgment, but that it is to be taken in connection with the evidence, and that all that was intended was this, that, in the absence of evidence as to the nature of such an employment, a bill-broker must be taken to be an agent to procure the loan of money on each customer\u2019s bills separately, and that he had therefore no right to mix bills together and pledge the mass for one entire sum. In truth, a bill-broker is not a character known to the law with certain prescribed duties; but his employment is one which depends entirely upon the course of dealing. It may differ in different parts of the country, it may have powers more or less extensive in one place than in another; what is the nature of its powers and duties in any instance is a question of fact, and is to be determined by the usage and course of dealing in the particular place. A great body of evidence was adduced in the present case to prove that it was the course of dealing in the city of London for bill-brokers to raise money for their employers, by pledging the bills of different proprietors for one entire advance; and there is nothing unreasonable in such a practice.\n* * * * *\nIt remains to consider whether there is any difference between the case of Foster v. Pearson and that of Stevens v. Foster.\nThe question was not left to the jury in the same way in the latter as in the former case. It was put on the ground that the jury might infer from the usage proved, and its general notoriety, that the customer employed the bill-brokers with reference to that usage, and therefore authorized them to deal with the bills as they in fact did; and the jury were satisfied with the evidence, and did draw the inference that Messrs. Wood & Poole had authority as between them and their employers to pledge the bills in the manner in which it appears that they did.\n* * * * * So far as the usage tends to shew an authority to pledge bills in a mass, and not separately, its reasonableness is hardly disputed; and that question has also been already disposed of. It was proved to be the prevailing practice, and it is enough for us to say the jury were warranted in drawing the inference which they did, especially as the plaintiff was himself a bill-broker.\nThese observations were in effect adopted in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[15], by Lord Macnaghten at page 225, and by Lord Field at page 228.\nIt is then, I repeat, a question of fact whether the contract was or was not entered into with reference to the usages referred to. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the proper inference is that it was. The appellant was, admittedly, familiar with transactions in the stock market. In each of the bought notes sent to her there is an intimation in these words:\u2014\nWhen carrying stocks for customers, we reserve the right of pledging the same or raising money upon them in any way most convenient to us.\nThis, she says, was not brought to her attention, but, I think, a person who, having instructed a broker to buy stocks and carry them, receives a notice of this kind and does not read it, must be taken in respect of subsequent dealings to assent to any reasonable terms it may contain to the same extent as if he had read it and taken no exception to it. Now, in my view, this intimation is a plain warning that the arrangement with the broker involves the right to use the stocks purchased as security in accordance with the reasonable practice in such transactions among reputable brokers in Toronto and New York; and I do not see how after reading it and acquiescing in it the client could be heard to object to the use of them in the same way in which stocks carried \u201con margin\u201d were being generally dealt with. I do not think ordinary people reading such a notice would take it to refer only to the broker\u2019s interest as mortgagee; that I think is too much of a lawyer\u2019s refinement. I think most people would assume that it meant something more than the mere statement of the fact that the broker would exercise his legal right to hypothecate his own interest in the securities referred to.\nBut assuming the plaintiff\u2019s rights to be regulated by the rules governing the relations between mortgagor and mortgagee, without reference to any special course of dealing, I cannot understand upon what ground she can recover in this action. The proposition upon which her case rests must be this: that a mortgagee of shares in an incorporated company making a sub-mortgage to secure a sum larger than the actual amount of his mortgage debt comes ipso facto under an obligation to pay the mortgagor the full market value of the shares at the time, and this although the mortgagor has acted in entire good faith and without profit to himself or loss to the mortgagor. I do not know upon what legal principle any such liability can be based. If the mortgagee makes a sale or as in Ex parte Dennison[16] hands over the stocks to somebody else to make a sale or does that which is equivalent to a sale he must, of course, account for what he receives or ought to have received; if he improperly uses the mortgaged property in such a way as to make a profit out of it he may be accountable for the profit. But if a mortgagee holding land under an absolute conveyance subject to a collateral agreement for redemption should submortgage or otherwise encumber the property (without disclosing the mortgagor\u2019s interest) for a larger amount than the mortgage debt, would anybody argue that the mortgagee must account for the full value of the land at the date of the sub-mortgage? If so, upon what principle could the contention be based? If one take the case of a pledge of chattels, that case is covered by distinct authority. It has long been settled that a re-pledge for more than the debt of the pledgor does not expose the pledgee to an action for conversion. Even a trustee using the property of his cestui que trust is accountable, generally speaking, only for the property or for the profits he has made or for the loss occasioned by his breach of trust. I do not think it has ever been suggested that a trustee in good faith leasing property he had no power to lease or mortgaging property he had no power to mortgage assumes ipso facto the obligation of a purchaser of the property at the option of his cestui que trust.\nA very different question arose in Conmee v. Ames[17], and I refer to it only because some language of mine has been cited as shewing that the memorandum on the bought note was not to be given effect to. In that case it appeared to me there was no evidence of any general practice which would affect the transaction under consideration. The point upon which it appeared to me, rightly or wrongly, that the decision must turn was that the plaintiffs, the brokers (who were suing the principal for a payment alleged to have been made on his account), had on the facts proved failed to establish that they had executed his mandate. I thought also that the memorandum in the bought note (on the same terms as that referred to above) not having been brought to the defendant\u2019s notice could not be held to govern the rights of the parties in respect of transactions completed before the bought note was despatched by the broker. That view has no possible bearing upon the questions arising in this case.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff sues to recover moneys paid by her to the defendants\u2014her brokers\u2014on account of the purchase price of certain shares of stock and interest thereon and for commissions; also for damages for breach of duty as her agents and for misrepresentation and deception and for the conversion of her shares.\nThe transactions were what is known as purchases on margin. The understanding, as deposed to by the defendant Wood, was that the brokers should take transfers of the stocks in such manner that, while the property of the plaintiff, they would be under the broker\u2019s control, Caswell v. Putnam[18]; and that they should carry them for the plaintiff, having the right, however, at any time to call upon her to pay the balance due upon them and to take them over. As an incident to such a contract the brokers had the right to re-pledge the plaintiff\u2019s stock, always preserving, however, her legal right upon payment of the balance owing by her to obtain delivery of her securities. Conmee v. Securities Holding Co.[19], at pages 609, 613; Rothschild v. Allen[20]. Shares were eventually delivered by the defendants to the plaintiff on her de- mand which corresponded in number and demonination with her orders to them. When she demanded and received these shares, however, she was ignorant of the brokers\u2019 dealings with her property in the interval which form the basis of her present action.\nShe prefers her claim on allegations that the defendants never bought for her the shares for which she paid them; that, if they were bought for her, at least some of such shares were re\u2011sold by the brokers\u2019 agents without authority; and, if this be so, that all of them were pledged by the defendants for their own general indebtedness, much greater in amount than what was owing to them by her, and without any provision for the release of her property on payment of the balance which she owed in respect of it; and that the amount charged her for interest was greater than the brokers themselves paid for the moneys which they borrowed and was a secret profit to which, as agents, they were not entitled.\nI am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established her charge that the brokers did not buy for her all the shares she ordered them to purchase. The purchases of Sao Paulo stock are fully proven. There is some confusion in regard to the purchase of the Louisville & Nashville Railway stock. The evidence of it is decidedly halting, and, had the finding been that this stock had not been bought for the plaintiff, I would have thought it at least equally satisfactory; but I am unable to say that there is no evidence to support the holding of the provincial courts that 100 L. & N. shares were purchased for the plaintiff in New York by the defendants\u2019 agents, the Randolphs.\nIt is no doubt the case that the identical shares of L. & N. which were so bought were not kept on hand by the defendants or their agents. But they were not bound to keep these identical shares on hand. Nourse v. Prime[21]. Subject to the question of hypothecation, with which I shall presently deal, their obligation would have been fulfilled if they kept on hand a sufficient number of L. & N. shares to answer the claims upon them of the plaintiff and of all other persons entitled to receive such stock from them. Caswell v. Putnam[22]; Conmee v. The Securities Holding Co.[23] Upon the evidence in the record, however, the finding that this obligation was fulfilled in regard to the L. & N. stock cannot, in my opinion, be sustained.\nIt is admitted that, on the day on which they received the certificates for the 100 shares of L. & N. said to have been bought by them for the plaintiff, the Randolphs delivered it through the clearing house to Gates & Co. in part fulfilment of a contract previously made for a sale to them of 400 shares of L. & N. After this delivery the Randolphs held either 450 or 550 shares of L. & N. (it is not very clear which is the correct figure)\u2014all of them under hypothecation to various lenders for large sums of money. The defendants failed to produce the Randolphs\u2019 \u201cbox-book\u201d which alone would have shewn any other unpledged shares. There is no evidence that any of the pledged shares belonged to the Randolphs themselves or could have been appropriated by them to the defendants\u2019 account without disregarding prior rights of some of their other customers. When it appeared that the L. & N. shares alleged to have been so purchased for the plaintiff were not held for her but were immediately delivered to a purchaser from the Randolphs\u2014if it were not so with- out that evidence\u2014the burden was upon the defendants to shew, as something peculiarly within their knowledge, that they or their agents had on hand or under their control other L. & N. shares which they could rightly appropriate to the plaintiff\u2019s account. Dickson v. Evans[24], at pages 59, 60; The King v. Turner[25], at pages 210-211; Elkin v. Janson[26], at page 661; Taylor on Evidence, 10th ed., p. 292. There is no such evidence in the record. The witness Abrey, Randolphs\u2019 representative, very carefully refrained from committing himself to this statement. He, no doubt, indicated the position correctly when he said, not that the defendants actually had 100 L. & N. shares in the hands of the Randolphs, but that \u201cthey were long by the records.\u201d The transfer to Gates & Co. of the shares said to have been bought for the plaintiff was, upon the evidence before us, unjustifiable. It was a distinct appropriation of them which rendered the defendants liable to account to her for their value; and to that liability it is no answer that a like number of similar shares was subsequently acquired by the defendants and was accepted from them by the plaintiff in ignorance of what had taken place. Langton v. Waite[27]. As to the 100 L. & N. shares the plaintiff\u2019s case is, in this aspect of it, if anything, stronger than was that of the defendant (appellant) in Conmee v. The Securities Holding Co.[28]\nIt is fully established\u2014in fact it is admitted\u2014that the defendants hypothecated all the plaintiff\u2019s shares for their own general indebtedness, much greater in amount than the balance due by the plaintiff in re- spect of such shares, and that at certain times they had not on hand shares available to answer her claim without resorting to those so hypothecated. They had no stipulation or agreement with their lenders under which they had a legal right to the release of the plaintiff\u2019s stock on payment of the amount she owed to them or of any smaller sum. They endeavoured to establish by evidence of brokers and others that it is the invariable custom of banks and trust and loan corporations from which such loans are procured by brokers to release the stock of a client pledged by his broker at any time upon payment of the amount of the balance due in respect of such stock by the client to the broker.\nIn the case of the pledges of the Sao Paulo shares the agreements between the lenders and the brokers were in writing. They contain no such term and in my opinion as to them this evidence of usage or custom was not admissible. It would vary written agreements or add to them a term inconsistent with the rights which they purport to give the lender.\nIn the case of the L. & N. shares, assuming that they were bought and carried for the plaintiff, the terms of the hypothecation of them are not in evidence. It does not appear whether the arrangement for it was verbal or in writing. But the pledge was for general indebtedness and there is no evidence that there was any stipulation which would give either to the defendants or to the plaintiff a legal right to the release of her shares on payment of the amount which she owed.\nI am not satisfied that the evidence in the record establishes such an invariable custom or practice as the defendants contend for on the part of the lenders from whom they borrowed. But if such a usage were established it would fall short of a reservation in favour of the plaintiff of the legal right to redeem her stock on payment of the amount due by her in respect of it; and to that legal right and nothing short of it she was entitled. The brokers could not require her to rely upon any loose understanding or mere obligation of honour between themselves and their lenders. Neither could they require her to rely upon their own personal security. She was entitled to have her shares in such a position that they would be her security and would be at all times available to her on payment of the amount which she owed in respect of them. Douglas v. Carpenter[29], at pages 333-4. See also the remarks of Lord Wynford in Rothschild v. Brookman[30], at pages 195-6.\nIt is common knowledge that the business of stock-brokers in this country is conducted in a manner more closely resembling that which prevails in the United States, and particularly in the State of New York, than that which obtains in England. Many customs and usages of English brokers are unknown in Canada; and many practices prevalent in our markets, which have come to us from the United States, would not be recognized on the London Stock Exchange. For this reason, and also because of a dearth of English authority (see R. 70 of the London Stock Exchange, Stutfield, 3rd ed., p. 45), I have drawn for authorities, perhaps more freely than is usual in our courts, upon American sources.\nThe hypothecation of the plaintiff\u2019s stocks for the brokers\u2019 general indebtedness, in the absence of auth- ority for it from her, was in my opinion unjustifiable, and, so far as such intangible property can be the subject of conversion, should be deemed a conversion of it. It was an exercise of dominion over the shares\u2014the assertion of an interest in them inconsistent with the right of the plaintiff, consistent only, in the absence of authorization from the plaintiff, with ownership of the shares by the defendants.\nEither because the securities should be regarded as negotiable; Baker v. The Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Banking Co.[31]; Colonial Bank v. Cady[32], at pages 277-8; London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[33]; or because, as against the pledgees, whose good faith is not questioned, the plaintiff was estopped from denying the authority of the brokers to pledge the securities as their own; Bentinck v. London Joint Stock Bank[34]; McNeil v. Tenth National Bank[35]; the hypothecation gave to the pledgees an enforceable lien or a special property in the stock greater than that which the brokers had authority to confer. The evidence in the record and the position taken by the defendants sufficiently establish a custom of stock-brokers and bankers to deal with securities such as those in question as transferable by delivery when indorsed in blank. The elements necessary to establish an estoppel against the plaintiff appear to be present. It has not been even suggested on behalf of the defendants that their pledgees would not have been legally entitled to hold the plaintiff\u2019s securities as against her for the full amount of the loan as collateral to which they were hypothecated, or for so much of it as they pleased, unless a right of redemption on payment of the balance due by her to the defendants was a provision of the loan implied by custom. On the contrary, they assert a right to so deal with the plaintiff\u2019s stocks, based either on a special contract with her evidenced by a memorandum at the foot of the \u201cbought note\u201d sent to her, or upon an alleged custom, which they sought to prove, and which they contend confers on brokers carrying stocks on margin this extraordinary privilege.\nI adhere to the views which I expressed in Ames & Co. v. Conmee[36], at pages 168 et seq., that the hypothecation of a client\u2019s stock by a broker for his general indebtedness without authority from the client is unjustifiable, and that the memorandum at the foot of the \u201cbought note\u201d given to the plaintiff\u2014which is the same as that considered in Conmee\u2019s case\u2014is not evidence of such authority. This note was in the following terms:\u2014\nWhen carrying stock for clients, we reserve the right of pledging the same or raising money upon them in any way most convenient to us.\nIt is clear that nothing was said about any such provision when the brokers took the plaintiff\u2019s orders. Miss Clarke denies that this memorandum ever came to her notice. But assuming that it did and that the brokers might thus add a term to the contract, upon a proper construction of the memorandum having regard to the fact that it was prepared by the brokers themselves, while it might authorize them to pledge the plaintiff\u2019s stock for an amount not greater than that due by her in any way most convenient to them- selves, there is nothing in it to confer on them a right to pledge it for a greater amount or to mingle it with other securities in a bulk pledge. Conmee v. The Securities Holding Co.[37] Neither is there anything in it to warrant the broker giving to his pledgee the right to dispose of the stock without notice either to himself or to his client. Yet we find that this was a stipulation in the pledge of the plaintiff\u2019s Sao Paulo shares to the National Trust Company; and there is a similar provision in the draft form of pledge used by the Dominion Bank with which the Sao Paulo shares were also hypothecated. It does not appear whether in the pledge of the L. & N. stock there was or was not a similar provision.\nFailing to establish an express agreement by the plaintiff authorizing such pledges of her stocks as the defendants and their agents made and the attempted inference of such an authority from the memorandum on the \u201cbought note\u201d above alluded to being also unsuccessful, the defendants sought to establish that there is a universal custom of members of the Toronto Stock Exchange to so deal with their clients\u2019 stocks held on margin without express authority from the clients and that this custom was binding upon the plaintiff either because she was actually aware of it, or because though not so aware, having employed members of the Toronto Stock Exchange, she should be deemed to have contracted subject to it. In the first place the evidence in my opinion falls short of what would be necessary to establish the custom. But, assuming that it was sufficiently proved, the attempt to bring home actual knowledge of it to the plaintiff absolutely failed. Without such knowledge it is not a custom which would bind her. Kirchner v. Venus[38], at page 399. It \u201cis so entirely in favour of (the brokers\u2019) side that it is fundamentally unjust to the other side,\u201d and, \u201cif sought to be enforced against a person ignorant of it,\u201d would be held \u201cunreasonable, contrary to law, and void\u201d; its effect, if admitted, would be to change the intrinsic nature of the plaintiff\u2019s contract. Robinson v. Mollett[39], at pages 818, 836-8; Johnson v. Kearley[40], at page 530; Lawrence v. Maxwell[41]. It follows that the hypothecation of the plaintiff\u2019s stocks by the defendants and their agents for their general indebtedness was a distinct breach of the defendants\u2019 contract with the plaintiff and also of their fiduciary duty to her. Conmee v. The Securities Holding Co.[42], at page 609-10. It was a \u201cconversion\u201d of her property; Strickland v. Magoun[43], at page 116.\nIt is well established that where a broker, who is under agreement to purchase and carry stock for a client, sells that stock without authority, leaving himself without other stock of the same kind available to satisfy his client\u2019s claim upon him, he becomes liable in equity, at the option of his client, to account to him for the proceeds of the sale, or the value of the shares as upon a conversion thereof to his own use, and he cannot escape that liability by purchasing and tendering to the client the same number of similar shares. Langton v. Waite[44], at page 173; Taussig v. Hart[45], at page 429.\nWhere a broker lends his client\u2019s stock to another broker he will in equity be held guilty of a similar conversion of it and the rights of the client are the same as if the stock had been sold, the broker being held accountable for its value at the time of the conversion. Ex parte Dennison[46].\nThe broker, who, without authority so to do, mingles his customer\u2019s securities with others and re-hypothecates them for a greater amount than the customer\u2019s indebtedness to him, neither reserving the customer\u2019s right to obtain his securities on payment of that indebtedness nor retaining in his own possession a like amount of similar securities, available for delivery to his client, is in my opinion likewise guilty of a \u201cconversion\u201d of such securities. Douglas v. Carpenter[47]; Strickland v. Magoun[48]; Rothschild v. Allen[49].\nThe broker in such a transaction appropriates the client\u2019s stocks for his own purposes and pledges them as his own. I can see no difference in principle between such an appropriation and that which takes place upon the wrongful sale or loan of stocks similarly held.\nIt is urged, however, that the recovery of the client should be confined to the actual damage which he can shew that he has sustained as the result of the wrongful hypothecation of his stock, and that, where such stock, or a like amount of other stock of the same kind is delivered to him upon his demand, he has suffered no damage and can at best have but a nominal recovery. No doubt this would be the case if the sole right of the client were to maintain a common law ac- tion of trover and conversion. Hiort v. London and North Western Ry. Co.[50]\nAt common law, and if the relationship of the client to the broker should be regarded merely as that of pledgor and pledgee, re-hypothecation by the pledgee for a larger amount than that of his claim against the pledgor, though unlawful, is deemed not so repugnant to the contract as to be equivalent to a renunciation of it and an extinguishment of the pledgee\u2019s right of detainer; and the pledgor cannot maintain an action of detinue without having paid or tendered the amount of the pledgee\u2019s claim against him. Donald v. Suckling[51], at page 616. It is to be noted, however, that, in this case, as stated by Mellor and Blackburn, JJ. the re\u2011pledging would be inoperative as against the original owner, and would confer upon the defendant no greater right than the original pledgee had: pp. 610, 611. If such an action were maintained at common law, it would be on the ground that the contract had been terminated and the pledgee would thus lose his security or its value, although not in a position to recover his advances.\nA premature sale by a mere bailee or pledgee was also held at common law not to terminate the bailment nor to destroy the interest or special property of the bailee in the goods pledged, and, therefore, although a conversion, to be insufficient without tender to the bailee of the amount of his claim to support an action of detinue; and for the conversion only actual damages could be recovered, and, if there were not such damages, only nominal damages\u2014if indeed the action would lie at all. Halliday v. Holgate[52]; Johnson v. Stear[53]. But even at common law, an action in assumpsit for money had and received would lie for the proceeds of securities wrongfully sold by the bailee or agent (not a pledgee), the owner electing to treat the wrongdoer as his agent in the transaction, and adopting the sale and claiming its proceeds as money had and received to his use. Marsh v. Keating[54], at page 600. In Bonzi v. Stewart[55], it was held that the principal of a factor, who had raised money on the security of his principal\u2019s goods without authority, might claim it as money had and received to his own use. Tindal C.J. said:\u2014\nMessieurs Bonzi were at liberty, at any time when they found their factors had wrongfully raised money on their goods, in taking the account between themselves and their factors, to abandon their goods altogether, and to treat the money so wrongfully borrowed by the factors on the pledge of the goods, as money had and received to the use of themselves.\nThe Chief Justice adds that this is but an application of the principle laid down by the House of Lords in Marsh v. Keating54.\nA stock-broker buying on margin and carrying stock for a client is something more than a mere pledgee; he is also his client\u2019s broker or fiduciary agent. His position is not dissimilar to that of a factor who, in the ordinary course of business, is entrusted with the possession of his principal\u2019s goods or the documents of title thereto.\nNow as between principal and factor, there is no question whatever that that description of case * * * has always been held to be within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, because the party partakes of the character of a trustee. Partaking of the character of a trustee, the factor\u2014as the trustee for the particu- lar matter in which he is employed as factor\u2014sells the principal\u2019s goods, and accounts to him for the money. The goods, however, remain the goods of the owner or principal until the sale takes place, and the moment the money is received the money remains the property of the principal. So it is with regard to an agent dealing with any property; he obtains no interest himself in the subject-matter beyond his remuneration; he is dealing throughout for another, and though he is not a trustee according to the strict technical meaning of the word, he is quasi a trustee for that particular transaction for which he is engaged; and therefore in these cases the courts of equity have assumed jurisdiction. Foley v. Hill[56].\nThe stock-broker holding the stocks of a client, bought by him upon margin, as collateral security for moneys advanced by him to make the purchase, is neither merely a broker, nor merely a pledgee of the stock. He holds towards his client a fiduciary relation similar to that which exists between the factor and his principal; in his capacity as a pledgee he cannot divest himself of his character as an agent; having assumed the position of a quasi-trustee, the client is in equity entitled to hold him to it and to the consequent obligation to account on that footing. Haight v. Haight & Freese Co.[57]; see also Marvin v. Brooks[58], at page 81. Indeed an accounting on this basis seems to be exigible in equity from a broker-pledgee although no fiduciary relationship existed in regard to the securities in question. Ex parte Dennison[59]. Where there is a relation of quasi-trusteeship between the parties, the equitable jurisdiction to compel an accounting undoubtedly attaches.\nIt is familiar law that if a trustee\u2019s breach of trust consists in a sale of stock, the cestui que trust may in bankruptcy proceedings at his option prove for the proceeds of the sale or for the value of the stock at the date of bankruptcy. Ex parte Gurner[60]. So, in an action against a trustee who has wrongfully sold real property, the cestui que trust has the option of compelling the trustee to purchase other lands of equal value to be settled upon the like trusts, or of taking the proceeds of the sale with interest, or the present estimated value of the lands sold after deducting any increase of price by subsequent improvements. Lewin on Trusts, 11th ed., p. 1138.\nIn the case of a wrongful sale of his stock by his broker, if the client, who had intended to hold it, upon demand receives from the broker shares of the same kind and to an equal amount at par value, though he did so in ignorance of the broker\u2019s misconduct, he cannot shew that he is any worse off than he would have been had the shares been kept for him by the broker always ready for delivery. From that point of view he has sustained no damage, and were it not for the fiduciary position of the broker he might have no redress. But in equity his right, upon learning of the wrongful sale, to hold the broker accountable for its proceeds or for the value of the securities at the time of sale, as upon a conversion thereof to his own use, appears to admit of no doubt. Like results follow where the broker lends the client\u2019s stock. Why should the consequences not be the same where he appropriates the securities by hypothecating them for his own indebtedness to an amount greater than is due him from his client? Certainly not merely because, on demand by the client, ignorant of what has transpired, he has de- livered to him shares of the same kind and of a like amount at par value. If that would suffice to discharge the broker guilty of wrongful hypothecation, it should also suffice where he has effected a wrongful loan or sale. Nor is the fact that the client has not shewn that the broker has made a profit by his misdeed a sufficient reason for his not being held so accountable.\nWhere a broker entrusted with his client\u2019s securities sells or lends them, the authorities establish that in equity he must account for their value at the date of the \u201cconversion.\u201d Where he appropriates them by unauthorized hypothecation, the client should have the same remedy. In each case alike the personal responsibility of the broker has been unlawfully substituted as the client\u2019s security in lieu of the property with which the broker has wrongfully dealt. In each case, instead of fulfilling his mandate, which required him to hold the stock or shares for his client, or, if he parted with their possession, to do so only in such manner that upon payment of the amount due by him the client could obtain them as of legal right from the holder, the broker, using them for his own purposes, has put them out of his control. In the one case the client is asked to trust to the broker buying in shares to replace those with which he has parted; in the other, to his doing that, or redeeming the shares which he has pledged. In each case the client is subjected to the risk of the broker\u2019s insolvency.\nThe broker, who hypothecates his client\u2019s stock for his own purposes for a sum larger than that due by the client, substitutes as security to the latter, at least to the extent of the excess, his personal responsibility in lieu of the stock to which the client is en- titled. If the broker, remaining solvent, by redeeming the stock and delivering it to the client on demand, could fully discharge himself, the temptation to commit the breach of duty involved in so dealing with stocks in his hands might, in many cases, be irresistible; can he but succeed in concealing his wrongdoing until the client applies for and takes over the stock or directs its sale, he escapes all liability for his misdeed. On the other hand, should he become bankrupt, and disaster to the client ensue, the broker will probably be little troubled by the claim of the latter for damages against what will in many cases be a practically worthless estate.\nIn wrongful sale\u2014in wrongful loan\u2014in wrongful hypothecation, there is involved an appropriation by the broker of his client\u2019s property for his own use.\nWhile I appreciate the distinction which is drawn between a disposition of a pledge by a bailee effected wholly without authority, which suffices to terminate the contract of bailment and to disentitle the bailee to repayment of his advances, and a disposition merely in excess of the bailee\u2019s authority to do an act of the same class\u2014such as a sale effected prematurely or without requisite notice, or a repledge for a greater amount than is due to the original pledgee\u2014which is not so repugnant to the contract of bailment that it puts an end to it; Halliday v. Holgate[61]; Donald v. Suckling[62]; and is, therefore, held not to destroy the bailee\u2019s right to repayment of his advances or, in the case of the broker-pledgee, to indemnity; Minor v. Beveridge[63]; the difference ends there. Its hypothe- cation for a larger amount by a broker, holding with a right to repledge to cover his own advances, imperils the security of his client and involves an appropriation of it by the broker for his own use quite as much as would its pledge merely for the amount of the excess if the broker had no right to pledge at all; indeed, in the former case the title of the broker\u2019s pledgee, if dependent on estoppel, will probably be more readily established. The vital distinction, however, between the repledge by a broker holding a client\u2019s securities as the defendants held those of the plaintiff and the repledge by a mere common law pawnee is that in the former case the broker confers on his pledgee a good title for the whole amount of his advances as against the broker\u2019s client, whereas in the latter, the title of the sub-pledgee is limited to the interest of the original bailee.\nIn a case of sale the broker may directly take advantage of the rise and fall in the stock market to make illicit profit; indeed, he may use his client\u2019s stocks to help to bring about fluctuations in prices for his own benefit at his client\u2019s expense. In a case of hypothecation the opportunities for direct advantage may not be the same. But, although on a loan of the client\u2019s stock the broker has not this advantage, he is held accountable for the market value of the stock at the time he wrongfully lends it. Ex parte Dennison[64]. Moreover, by pledging his client\u2019s stocks in bulk with securities of his own or of other clients, the broker may be enabled to raise a much larger sum of money than if all these stocks were pledged separately. With the additional moneys so obtained\u2014moneys part, or it may be the whole, of which rightfully belong to the client\u2014the broker may be enabled to reap advantages and to make profits which it would be difficult to estimate and almost impossible to trace directly to their source. He may be enabled on his own account to deal, to an extent not otherwise possible, in marketable securities, profiting by their fluctuations in value, and perhaps affecting the market price of his client\u2019s securities to his detriment. Upon principle as well as for reasons of policy I think that, in the case of the stock-broker, the wholesome rule which entitles the client to hold him accountable for the market value of his securities at the time of their conversion should be held equally applicable to the cases of a wrongful hypothecation, a wrongful sale and a wrongful loan of such securities. I know of no situation in which a quasi-trustee has greater opportunities, if so inclined, to derive improper advantage from the possession and control of the property of his cestui que trust, than that in which the broker carrying stocks on margin for a client finds himself. In order, as far as possible, to protect their customers against the risks to which they would be exposed, were brokers at liberty with practical impunity to deal with their securities as those of the plaintiff were dealt with in this case\u2014in order to protect brokers themselves against the temptation of making, it may be, large illicit gains by committing such a wrong with a minimized risk of personal loss, I think that the drastic but salutary rules which govern the relation of trustee and cestui que trust should be applied in all their rigour.\nThe very difficulty\u2014amounting to a practical impossibility\u2014of an accounting on the basis of the profits which the defendants may have made by the use of the money obtained by their illegal hypothecation of the plaintiff\u2019s securities affords another and a cogent reason for treating them as having become purchasers of those securities when they so dealt with them and for holding them accountable for their fair value at that time. \u201cThis seems to me to be a simple mode of effectually doing justice between the parties.\u201d Having used the plaintiff\u2019s securities as proprietors, the defendants\u2019 \u201cproceedings, I think, entitled (her) to elect, and (she) has elected, to treat them as purchasers.\u201d Marriott v. The Anchor Reversionary Co.[65], at pages 186, 188.\nHaving regard to the fact that the financial result to the plaintiff would in all likelihood have been the same as it is had her stocks not been wrongfully pledged by the defendants, it may seem a hardship to hold them so accountable. But this observation is equally applicable where the broker sells and afterwards replaces his client\u2019s stock. \u201cThis is the risk to which such transactions are subject,\u201d Ex parte Dennison[66], at page 553; and the law applicable to them is \u201ca law of jealousy,\u201d Rothschild v. Brookman[67]. I cannot but think it deplorable that it should be held to be the law of Canada that if a broker, carrying stock on margin without authority, uses his client\u2019s shares as his own\u2014pledges them for his general indebtedness\u2014substitutes for them his personal responsibility as security to his client, the latter has not the right, upon discovering the facts, to elect to adopt his agent\u2019s appropriation of his property and to hold him chargeable with its value at the time of its con- version. The effect of such a decision must be greatly to encourage breaches of duty by these quasi-trustees and to foster amongst an important body of fiduciary agents a disregard of the fundamental distinction between meum and tuum in dealing with the property of their principals.\nIn the case of a sale the proceeds usually represent the value of the securities; but, if not, the client\u2019s right is to an account of the actual market value. Taussig v. Hart[68]. In the case of an hypothecation, as in that of a loan, the value must be determined by the market price at the time. If, as in the factor\u2019s case (Bonzi v. Stewart[69]), the right of the client adopting the broker\u2019s misappropriation should be restricted to claiming credit for the moneys raised upon his securities as against the broker who has so mingled these securities with others that it is not possible to determine how much of the moneys lent to him have been obtained on the pledge of them, it may fairly be held that a portion of the advances equal in amount to the full value of the client\u2019s securities was obtained by their hypothecation. In my opinion, therefore, the defendants and their agents by pledging the plaintiff\u2019s shares for their general indebtedness without providing for their release on payment of the balance owing by her, and without holding under their own control other shares of the same description available to answer her claim, made themselves accountable to her for the market value of such shares at that time.\nThat right the plaintiff did not lose by her subsequent acceptance of the shares tendered to her by the brokers in satisfaction of her claim, or by her dealing with them as owner, in ignorance of what had transpired. Without knowledge there cannot be ratification or condonation. Johnson v. Kearley[70], at page 524. The defendants are, of course, entitled in an equitable accounting to credit for the value of the shares at the time they were so accepted. But they cannot insist on the plaintiff\u2019s returning, or tendering a return of such shares before suing for such accounting. If, in circumstances such as those of this case, a broker had this right, he might put a client, who had innocently parted with shares so taken over, in a position of serious difficulty; he might effectually deprive him of his right of action. The broker, whose misconduct has led to such a difficulty, cannot complain if his client elects to retain the securities giving him credit in the accounting for their market value when received.\nThis case may also be dealt with on the basis which commended itself to Magee J. in Hutchinson v. Jaffray & Cassels[71]. Concealing the facts which entitled the plaintiff to take the position that her indebtedness was wiped out and that she was in fact their creditor, and falsely representing to her that they held and were carrying her stocks according to her mandate, the defendants obtained from her several payments of large sums of money and eventually of the entire residue of the purchase price of the stocks, with interest on the balance from time to time unpaid. Moneys so obtained by misrepresentation\u2014paid in mistake of material facts concealed by the payee from the payer\u2014are recoverable. The law will not permit persons holding a fiduciary position to retain them. The brokers receive the full benefit to which they are entitled in respect of their claim for indemnity by having the balance of the original purchase price unpaid by the client offset in the accounting against the value of the converted property for which the client receives credit. To that they have an equitable right (Minor v. Beveridge[72]), but to nothing more.\nThe present action concerns 50 shares of Sao Paulo stock bought on the 26th of April, 1906\u2014(all the S.P. stock held by the defendants except 10 shares was hypothecated for their general indebtedness on the 30th of April); 50 shares of S.P. stock bought on the 26th September, 1906\u2014(all the defendants\u2019 S.P. stock was hypothecated for their general indebtedness on the 29th September); and 100 shares of L. & N. railway stock said to have been bought on the 25th August, 1906, and hypothecated in like manner, if it was not wrongfully sold, as I think it was, on the very day of its purchase. As to the latter stock the defendants are accountable for the full price charged to the plaintiff for it. The market prices of the S.P. stock on the 30th April and 29th September are not in evidence, but there are general statements that, when the plaintiff\u2019s Sao Paulo shares were hypothecated, the market prices did not differ materially from the prices at which they were purchased for her. The defendants having failed to prove that at the respective dates of their conversion the market prices of these shares were lower than at the respective dates of purchase, they are accountable in the case of these stocks also for the full prices charged to the plaintiff. For these sums she should be given credit\u2014in respect of the first lot of S.P. shares on the 30th April, 1906, and in respect of the second lot, on the 29th September, 1906. She is chargeable with interest on the balance of the purchase price of the first lot unpaid between the 26th and the 30th April, and in respect of the second lot on a like balance from the 26th to the 29th September, at the rates shewn in the defendant\u2019s accounts in which she appears to have acquiesced. No interest is chargeable against her in connection with the L. & N. transaction. She is chargeable with the purchase price of these several stocks and is entitled to credit for all moneys paid by her to the defendants for principal, interest and commissions, including the original marginal payments and the final payment of the 3rd of June, 1907. Upon the sale of the first lot of Sao Paulo she was credited with the proceeds. That credit must stand. She took delivery from the brokers on the 3rd of June, 1907, of 50 shares of Sao Paulo and 100 shares of L. & N. The defendants are entitled to credit for the market value of these shares at that date. The plaintiff is entitled to interest at 5% on any balance from time to time standing to her credit on such accounting and upon the final balance, which would stand to her credit after the payment of the 3rd of June, 1907, from that date until this action was brought; and to interest on her claim thus ascertained until judgment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.C.

This contract was carried out and the publishers then proposed that L. should write on the same terms, the life of Sir John A. Macdonald, for which that of William Lyon Mackenzie was afterwards substituted. L. prepared the latter work and forwarded the manuscript to the publishers, who, although they had paid him in full for it in advance, refused to publish it, as being unsuitable to be included in \u201cThe Makers of Canada.\u201d L. then tendered to M. & Co. the amount paid him and demanded a return of the manuscript, which was refused, M. & Co. claiming it as their property. In an action by L. for possession of his manuscript,\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (20 Ont. L.R. 594), Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that he was entitled to its return.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J., that the property in the manuscript (or what is termed literary property) has a special character, distinct from that of other articles of commerce; that the contract between the parties must be interpreted with regard to such special character of the subject-matter; that it implies an agreement to publish if accepted; and when rejected the author was entitled to treat the contract as rescinded and to a return of his property. Held, per Davies and Duff JJ., that there was an express contract for publication and an implied agreement that the manuscript was to be returned if publication should become impracticable for such reasons as those given by the publishers.\nHeld, per Duff J., that the publishers, until publication, could be treated as having possession of the manuscript for that purpose and, that purpose failing, there was a resulting trust in favour of the author.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe only question raised for decision on this appeal was whether or not the plaintiff, LeSueur, who had written the life of William Lyon Mackenzie for the defendants, under the circumstances and in performance of the contract mentioned in the above head-note, was entitled to the return of his mss. which the defendants refused to publish. The trial Judge held that he was so entitled and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Moss C.J.O. dissenting. The defendants have appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from the last mentioned judgment.\nHellmuth K.C. for the appellants. The plaintiff merely sold his mss. to the publishers and the property passed as in the case of any chattel. See Parker v. Cunliffe[2].\nAs to incorporating other terms in the written contract see Lovell and Christmas v. Wall[3].\nThe control by the publishers of the copyright given them by the contract vests in them the property in the mss. under the \u201cCopyright Act.\u201d Ward, Lock & Co. v. Long[4].\nLafleur K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Once it is admitted, as it is by both parties here, that the manuscript Life of Mackenzie which the respondent was commissioned to write was originally intended for publication in book form in the series then being published by the appellant and known as \u201cMakers of Canada,\u201d such an intention based on the facts revealed by the evidence implies a tacit agreement to publish the manuscript, if accepted; and, the manuscript having been rejected as unsuitable for the purpose for which it was intended, no property in it passed and the respondent was entitled to ask that the contract be rescinded and the manuscript returned upon the repayment of the money consideration which he had received.\nI cannot agree that the sale of the manuscript of a book is subject to the same rules as the sale of any other article of commerce, e.g., paper, grain or lumber. The vendor of such things loses all dominion over them when once the contract is executed and the purchaser may deal with the thing which he has purchased as he chooses. It is his to keep, to alienate or to destroy. But it will not be contended that the publisher who bought the manuscript of \u201cThe Life of Gladstone,\u201d by Morley, or of Cromwell by the same author, might publish the manuscript, having paid the author his price, with such emendations or additions as might perchance suit his political or religious views and give them to the world as those of one of the foremost publicists of our day. Nor could the author be denied by the publisher the right to make corrections, in dates or otherwise, if such corrections were found to be necessary for historical accuracy; nor could the manuscript be published in the name of another. After the author has parted with his pecuni- ary interest in the manuscript, he retains a species of personal or moral right in the product of his brain. Lyon C\u00e6n, note to Sirey, 1881.1.25.\nWhat I have said is sufficient to shew that what is called literary property has a character and attributes of it\u2019s own and that such a contract as we are now called upon to consider must be interpreted and the rights of the parties determined with regard to the special nature of the thing which is the subject of the contract. Cox v. Cox[5]. An ancient manuscript or a papyrus might have by reason of its antiquity or the circumstances surrounding its discovery some intrinsic monetary value. But what may be the value to the writer or to the publisher of the manuscript in question here, so long as it is allowed to remain in the pigeonhole of the latter? What was the consideration for the payment of $500? Not the paper on which the manuscript is written; its value is destroyed for all commercial purposes. Not the paper with the writing on it; that can have no value without publication, except for the purposes suggested by Mr. Justice Meredith. The only way in which the appellant can legitimately recoup himself for his expenditure must be by the publication of the manuscript, and in this I find an additional reason for holding that publication was an implied term of the contract.\nIn the absence of English authorities on the subject, I referred to the French books which treat at great length of such contracts as we are now considering. The majority of French writers, and among them some of the most eminent, such as Pardessus, held that the obligation to publish is always to be considered as an implied term in every contract for the purchase of the manuscript of a book; but admitting with the minority that a contract might be drawn which would transfer the whole property in the manuscript to the purchaser so that it would be in his power to retain it in his possession for his own personal use, all the French authorities admit that where, as in the present case, the parties have chosen to leave so much to intendment and implication, the court should give to the contract a construction wide enough to include the obligation to publish, that being, generally speaking, the more probable intention of the parties, as it was in this case their admitted intention at the inception of their negotiations.\nSee Pandectes Francaises, vbo. Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire, Nos. 1912 and 1913. Pouillet, Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire, 2nd ed., No. 308.\nIn conclusion, therefore, I hold that, as argued on behalf of the respondents and as found in both courts below, the conditions which together made up the consideration moving to the respondent were the payment of the stipulated price, $500, in instalments of $250 each, and the publication of the work in and as part of the series, \u201cMakers of Canada.\u201d The respondent fully performed his contract when he wrote and delivered the manuscript and if, in the exercise of his undoubted right, the appellant properly rejected it as unsuitable for the purpose for which it was intended, viz., publication in the \u201cMakers of Canada\u201d series, then both parties were free to rescind the contract altogether and the respondent upon the return of so much of the consideration as he had received was entitled to have the manuscript returned to him. It cannot be denied that by the appellant\u2019s refusal the respondent was deprived of the chief consideration which moved him to write the manuscript, that is the benefit to his literary reputation resulting from publication. Tindal C.J. in Planch\u00e9 v. Colburn[6].\nIt is unnecessary for me to go over in detail the evidence of the contract and the correspondence, all of which must be taken into consideration, as well as the standard form of contract used by the publisher with all his contributors. In the judgment of the Court of Appeal and in the notes of my brother judges all that is useful is discussed with much ability.\nFor the short reasons which I have just given and for those more fully set out by Mr. Justice Meredith in the Court of Appeal, I would confirm the judgments below and dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. From the fact that no regular contract was drawn up between the parties regulating their duties and rights, and these latter have to be determined from the rather loose correspondence between them, all the difficulties have sprung.\nIt is impossible in my judgment to put a proper construction upon this correspondence and fairly to deduce from it what the real intentions of the parties were without reference to their previous dealings.\nThe appellant company was engaged in publishing an historical series of books under the name \u201cMakers of Canada,\u201d and in the year 1901 the respondent, LeSueur, had agreed to write for that series \u201cThe Life of Frontenac,\u201d and to complete it by a fixed date. The company on its part agreed to publish the book at its own expense in that series and to pay the re- spondent certain royalties specified in the agreement as his compensation. Frontenac was written, accepted and published in the series, but by mutual agreement the method of payment was changed from the royalties previously agreed upon to two cash payments of $250 each, payable one on the publication of the book and the other on the publication of its second edition.\nSome years afterwards the company suggested to Mr. LeSueur that he should write for \u201cThe Makers of Canada\u201d the life of Sir John Macdonald \u201con the same terms as Frontenac,\u201d but afterwards feeling itself committed to another writer for Macdonald\u2019s life, suggested to the respondent that he should write the life of William Lyon Mackenzie instead, saying in one of their letters to respondent that \u201cthe Mackenzie book offers as good an opportunity for you as the Macdonald.\u201d Finally LeSueur agreed to write \u201cMackenzie.\u201d In its letter of 11th December, 1905, so often referred to in the argument, the company speaks of the agreement as a bargain with them by LeSueur \u201cto do William Lyon Mackenzie for the sum of $500, payable in instalments of $250 as outlined.\u201d\nThe respondent LeSueur wrote the book and delivered the manuscript to the appellant company, but before its delivery he had been paid the whole consideration money of $500.\nIn the result the company declined to publish the manuscript on the ground that it was not suitable for the series for which it had been prepared and although respondent on learning their refusal to publish promptly tendered them back the $500 he had received and demanded the return of his manuscript, the company declined to accept the money tendered or return the manuscript, expressing their view that \u201caccording to the terms of the agreement under which you did the work and were paid for it the manuscript is the property of the company.\u201d\nThe issue between the parties was therefore whether under the contract between them the total consideration for the writing and delivery of the manuscript life of Mackenzie was the money payment of $500 as contended by the company, or whether its publication in the series of \u201cThe Makers of Canada\u201d was an integral part of the consideration as contended by respondent LeSueur.\nThe respondent does not, of course, contend that the company had not the right to reject a manuscript unsuitable for the purpose for which it was intended, but that having rejected it and refused to publish, he, as the writer, had the right on returning the money consideration to a return of his manuscript.\nI think the argument submitted by the respondent in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is sound, namely, that in effect the contract provided that LeSueur should write a manuscript life of Mackenzie substituted for Macdonald with the hope that it would be accepted and published by the company in their series of books \u201cMakers of Canada\u201d; that until acceptance the author was at all the risks of suitability or unsuitability of the manuscript; that if accepted the property passed and the company was bound to complete the money payments if incomplete and publish the manuscript as part of the series, while if rejected no property in the manuscript passed and no right to retain the rejected manuscript remained after the tender or return of the money consideration paid by them. It seems a constrained and unreason- able construction of this contract to hold that under it the publisher should not only keep but be bound to keep and pay for an unsuitable manuscript. If the publisher was not so bound that, of course, would put an end to his claim as of right to retain the manuscript and still not publish it.\nThe whole question rests upon the construction of the contract and not upon any special rights of either authors or publishers apart from contract. In my opinion the terms of the Frontenac contract were agreed upon as those which should govern the writing of the life of Macdonald, and when Mackenzie was agreed to be substituted for Macdonald it was upon the same terms except where specifically changed. Publication in the series was undoubtedly one of the terms or consideration for the writing of Frontenac. It was incorporated in the Macdonald contract in clear language, and when Mackenzie was substituted for Macdonald and nothing said changing that specific term of the contract as part of the consideration which the author was entitled to claim, must be held to have remained part of the Mackenzie contract now in controversy.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant company of publishers were publishing a series of biographical works known as \u201cThe Makers of Canada.\u201d The respondent had, pursuant to a written contract with them, dated 26th August, 1901, written a life of Count Frontenac which seems to have been finished in the early summer of 1905. He was engaged also apparently as reader and critic of other works in the same series.\nIn December, 1905, he had in the course of this latter service, so reported upon the life of one Mackenzie, which had been contributed by another person for the same series, that its publication was suppressed.\nIn reference to this and other like works, appellant\u2019s manager wrote on the 6th of December, 1905, to respondent, and amongst other things, said:\nYou have given the period considerable study, and have furnished us with copious notes, which ought to make it comparatively easy to do the Mackenzie book. I wish you would reconsider your position regarding this and undertake the book, for which we will give you $500.\nOn the 7th of December, 1905, the respondent replied as follows:\nOttawa, 7th Dec., 1905.\nDear Mr. Morang:\u2014\nThe life of W.L. Mackenzie is a ticklish bit of work for the simple reason that you cannot write it so as to please both parties, but as Wrong has decided not to take it up, I will take it in hand on the terms you mention, and have it ready by the 1st of July next, or at latest by 1st August.\nI see there is a movement on foot for raising a monument to Mackenzie in Toronto, and doubtless if the scheme is carried out there will be a good deal of glorification of him in connection therewith. I feel as if my book would not be quite in key with it all.\nHowever, I will try my best to do justice to him and to view such faults as he had with charity.\nYours sincerely,\n(Sgd.) W.D. LESUEUR.\nOn the 11th of December, 1905, the appellant replied as follows:\n11th Dec., 1905.\nDear Dr. LeSueur:\u2014\nIn reference to your letter of the 7th, in which you accept our offer to do William Lyon Mackenzie for the sum of $500.00 payable in instalments of $250.00 as outlined. Your stipulation that you will have it done by the first of July, or the first of August, is satisfactory. We accept your offer.\nYours very truly,\nDr. W.D. LESUEUR,\n88 Maclaren Street,\nOttawa, Ont. These letters seem to form a tolerably clear contract needing no interpretation except the surrounding facts and circumstances to indicate who and what the man Mackenzie was, and the nature and probable size of the book to be written.\nThe manuscript was produced by chapters from time to time and so delivered to appellant.\nThe $500 was paid by the monthly remittances on account of this and other literary services according to the wishes which respondent had later indicated would suit his purpose and convenience better than two instalments which originally may have been contemplated.\nThese payments had so progressed that by the 26th of July, 1907, the respondent felt it right to say he had got $650 for this and other work, in all amounting to $680, and yet he had not got Mackenzie off his hands, and asked further payments to be stopped until he was in credit again.\nHe says in the same letter, \u201cWhen I hand you over Mackenzie and begin the index you can begin paying me again.\u201d The index, I gather, was not a necessary part of the contract to write the Mackenzie life.\nHe refers also in the same letter to facts relative to the progress of the Mackenzie book and his work, but nothing turns thereupon.\nThe work was finished and delivered and all paid for when appellant\u2019s readers seem to have condemned it as out of harmony with the rest of the series.\nThe respondent, feeling no doubt naturally hurt, and acting as a high-minded man might, tendered the repayment of the $500 and demanded the return of the manuscript.\nThe appellant company refused this. They say the property in the manuscript had become theirs. Respondent brought this action for recovery of the manuscript and for damages, but at the trial abandoned the latter and was awarded the former.\nThis judgment having been maintained by the Court of Appeal we are asked to reverse it.\nI confess I have found considerable difficulty in understanding upon what ground the judgment proceeds. Divers reasons are given. Amongst others an implication is found that the contract had proceeded upon the understanding that the work, when produced, would be published in the said series.\nIn the evidence it appears that in the way of advertising this series the respondent is put down as the writer who was expected to deal with the life of Mackenzie.\nHow can this inducement to subscribers form part of this contract which had preceded the advertising?\nThe entire contract is in writing. The respondent frankly admits he had made no other or further terms orally.\nIt is said that an implication which entitles the plaintiff to rescission arises from the nature of the work or from that coupled with the earlier written contract relative to the life of Frontenac.\nTwo complete answers appear to me to meet this latter suggestion. In the first place there is not a word in this contract to import the other one or its terms into this. In the next place if it could be taken as a guide to find the intention of the parties, there is in the Frontenac contract an express provision for delivery of the manuscript to the appellant. And that is followed by an express assignment of all rights and property in the work; and an agreement that the company shall have the exclusive right to take out copyright for it and get renewal thereof and to publish it during the terms thereof. Then in consideration of all that the company agree to publish at their own expense in such style as they deem advisable, and to pay the author a royalty named.\nThis provision for a royalty was abandoned by a later agreement, and a lump sum agreed upon in lieu thereof, before the contract we have to pass upon was thought of.\nI cannot see how under such a contract the non-publication could have in law the effect of divesting the company of the property in the manuscript solemnly assigned and pursuant thereto delivered to the purchasers.\nSo far from the prior contract aiding respondent it is, if those terms of it that remained unchanged at the time this was entered into are to be imported into this one pro tanto as evidencing the relations of the parties thereto, an impassable barrier in the way of respondent asserting a title to the property in the manuscript, by reason of the terms and by force of the \u201cCopyright Act.\u201d\nIf we consider this contract independently of aught else, then I can see no basis for such an implication of right to divest the owners of their property clearly vested in them by virtue of the terms of the contract and delivery of the goods so contracted for.\nCan it be possible to hold that the appellant having accepted and paid for the work as agreed, could, merely because it did not when produced suit certain views, and its publication be a doubtful venture, return the manuscript and demand the $500 and recover it?\nIt may suit respondent to have this done in this case, but how many writers could endure such a test of the like contract?\nThe right of rescission, if implied at all, must be mutual and reciprocal. I can find no warrant for holding such a thing as an implication of such a right based merely on disappointment.\nNovel theories as to the consideration being of a two fold or combined character, that is money and fame, are no more workable as implications of law in contracts respecting products of the brain put into manuscript than into other things.\nIf the workmen desires, in addition to the cash consideration, something else springing from the use of the products of his labour, then he must stipulate for it.\nThere exists in law no implied condition precedent as suggested here, that the property in any product of a man\u2019s labour with either pen or pencil, or brush or chisel, does not pass until it reaches the point or place, and be put to the use, where he can admire, and ask others to admire it; no matter how reasonable his hopes or expectations of such ambition being gratified and that gratification becoming part of the fruits of his labour.\nI agree in all that Chief Justice Moss has, in his judgment, said relative to this case, save the possible implication he sees that in this case there might have existed a right in appellant to reject the work.\nIt does not seem to me under the circumstances of this case that even that possibility of rescinding the contract existed, so long as the labour was honestly done to the best ability of the workman who was well known to the publisher and employer. It is the product of that particular man\u2019s brain he is buying and the workman is selling. Its publication may be prevented by a fire destroying the manuscript, or a wave of public opinion destroying its value. No such thing as right of rescission can in either case be held possible in law for either party finding himself in such a plight.\nEven publishers signing contracts to pay literary workmen of whose capacity they have had an opportunity to judge, must reserve such rights if they wish to enjoy same. If another view is conceivable then the right implied must surely be mutual. I can find no such implied right, and unless expressed it does not exist.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the courts below.\nDUFF J.\u2014One of the terms of the agreement between the appellants and respondent was, I think, that the appellants should publish the respondent\u2019s book as part of the consideration for the stipulations that he should write the work mentioned and that it was to become the property of the appellants.\nIt is, in my judgment, impossible to escape this conclusion except by acting upon the invitation of the appellants to shut one\u2019s eyes to everything which preceded the last two or three letters of the correspondence in which the arrangement was finally concluded. That, of course, is contrary to all principle unless it is perfectly clear\u2014what nobody suggests in this case\u2014that in these few letters the parties were professing to state completely the terms of their agreement. \u201cIt is one of the first principles,\u201d said Lord Cairns, in Hussey v. Horne-Payne[7], that where you have to find your contract or your note or memorandum of the terms of the contract in letters, you must take into consideration the whole of the correspondence which has passed.\nThe matter becomes perfectly simple when one looks at the transactions and communications between parties in the order in which they occurred. They came together in 1901. In that year the respondent was asked to write the biography of Count Frontenac for a series of biographies of men prominent in the history of Canada to be known as the \u201cMakers of Canada.\u201d The respondent consented and a formal contract was executed in these terms:\nW.D. LeSueur, of Ottawa, Ont., hereinafter called \u201cThe author,\u201d hereby enters into an agreement with George N. Morang & Company, Limited, publishers, of Toronto, to write \u201cA life of the Count de Frontenac.\u201d The said work to contain not less than 65,000 words and not more than 70,000 words. And the author hereby agrees to deliver the manuscript of the same to George N. Morang & Company, Limited, complete, on or before 1st March, 1902.\nThe author hereby grants and assigns to George N. Morang & Company, Limited, all rights and property in the above-mentioned work, and agrees that they shall have the exclusive right to take out copyright, and to hold said copyrights and renewals, and to publish said work during the terms thereof.\nIn consideration of the rights granted, George N. Morang & Company, Limited, agree to publish the work at their own expense in such style or styles as they deem most advisable, and to pay the author, or his legal representatives, a royalty of ten (10) per cent. on the retail price of all copies sold in the Dominion of Canada, and a royalty of five (5) per cent. on all copies sold in England or foreign countries at special edition prices.\nIt is understood and agreed that no royalty shall be paid on any copies given away, or destroyed, or sold at a price below cost.\nStatements of sale shall be rendered to the author by George N. Morang & Company, Limited, half-yearly, on June 30th and on December 31st of each year.\nIt is agreed that George N. Morang & Company, Limited, shall furnish to the author, free of charge, five copies of the volume as published, and should the author desire any more copies for his own use they shall be supplied at one-half the retail price. Executed this 26th day of August, nineteen hundred and one.\nWitness:\nH.B. LeSueur.\nGeorge N. Morang & Company, Limited,\nGeorge N. Morang,\nPresident.\nW.D. LeSueur.\nThe arrangement contained in this document\u2014the agent of the appellants, one of the editors of the series, so represented to the respondent when he signed it and the fact is not in dispute\u2014was identical with that entered into between the publishers and each writer contributing to the series. The respondent completed the work which was the subject of this arrangement in 1902, and it was published in 1906. In the meantime the respondent came into communication with Mr. G.N. Morang, the President of the appellant company, and very friendly and confidential relations sprang up between them. The respondent became a member of the editorial staff engaged in editing the \u201cMakers of Canada\u201d and was asked to and did edit three works of the series. Among the manuscripts he was asked to read was that of a life of W.L. Mackenzie. Largely as a result apparently of the respondent\u2019s report on this manuscript it was decided by Morang that it was not suitable for publication. Then in December, 1905, the respondent was requested himself to undertake the book on Mackenzie; and this after some demur he finally agreed to do. The correspondence leading to this result seems conclusive on the point in hand. The first letter in evidence is one dated 4th October, 1905. This letter records the fact that the appellants have purchased the respondent\u2019s \u201crights in Frontenac,\u201d and that in consideration of the abandonment by the respondent of his right to royalties under his formal contract he was to receive $250 on publication of the first and the same sum on the publication of the second edition. Morang then, referring to a proposal that the respondent should undertake the life of Sir John Macdonald, said:\nIf you undertake Macdonald, I suppose the same terms as the Frontenac will be agreeable to you.\nIt is impossible, I think, to suppose that (especially having regard to what had passed at the time of the execution of the contract of 1901) it could have occurred to anybody in the respondent\u2019s position that in proposing this arrangement the appellants were contemplating a departure from the Frontenac contract in one of its most essential terms. The suggestion here is that \u201cterms\u201d relates only to the money consideration. But what is there to justify such a limitation? The express agreement to publish was a vital part of the arrangement. Delete that and the whole consideration under the original contract and under the substituted arrangement mentioned in the letter disappeared. On this ground alone the suggested limitation of the natural meaning of the words is inadmissible. But apart altogether from the fact that under the arrangement the right to payment rested on publication\u2014the publication as an object in itself was a substantial part of the consideration the writer was to receive without which (it does not require his testimony to shew) he would not have undertaken the work. It is equally impossible to suppose that the writer could understand this proposal in a sense different from that in which it was read by the respondent.\nWe start then with this as the proposed basis of any arrangement for a biography of Macdonald: that if the respondent undertake it he shall do so upon the same understanding as to publication as that which applied to the book he had already written. The book on Macdonald was in the result not written by the respondent, but while the matter of the person who was finally to be entrusted with this book was in doubt, a suggestion was first made to the respondent respecting Mackenzie. On the 29th October Morang writes referring to the book on Macdonald, that he does not expect that book to be finished by the gentleman who was then engaged upon it, and adds:\nBut if he should write on receipt of Edgar\u2019s letter agreeing to do what we require, I am sure you will do as you offered here, take another book. I think the \u201cMackenzie\u201d book offers as good an opportunity for you as the Macdonald.\nIn December, however, Morang had become convinced that the biography of Macdonald would be satisfactorily completed by this person and definitely proposed that the respondent should assume the task of dealing with the career of Mackenzie. The passages in the correspondence relating to the subject are as follows:\nDec. 6th, 1905.\nProf. Edgar tells me that Wrong has decided that in his present position, it would not be wise for him to tackle Mackenzie. He practically decided to do it, but one of his cautious advisers warned him against it, and he has given us his decision. Hughes does not know, and never will know who advised us regarding his book. You have given the period considerable study, and have furnished us with copious notes, which ought to make it comparatively easy for you to do the Mackenzie book. I wish you would re\u2011consider your position regarding this and undertake the book, for which we will give you $500.\nDec. 7th, 1905.\nDear Mr. Morang:\u2014\nThe life of W.L. Mackenzie is a ticklish bit of work, for the simple reason that you cannot write it so as to please both parties, but as Wrong has decided not to take it up, I will take it in hand on the terms you mention, and have it ready by the 1st of July next or at the latest by 1st August.\nI see there is a movement on foot for raising a monument to Mackenzie in Toronto, and doubtless if the scheme is carried out there will be a good deal of glorification of him in connection therewith. I feel as if my book would not be quite in key with it all.\nHowever, I will try my best to do justice to him and to view such faults as he had with charity.\nYours sincerely,\n(Sgd.) W.D. LESUEUR.\n11th Dec., 1905.\nDear Mr. LeSueur:\u2014\nIn reference to your letter of the 7th, in which you accept our offer to do William Lyon Mackenzie for the sum of $500.00 payable in instalments of $250.00 as outlined. Your stipulation that you will have it done by the first of July or the first of August is satisfactory. We accept your offer.\nYours very truly.\nThis correspondence seems to leave little room for controversy. The book on Macdonald if undertaken was, as we have seen from the letter of the 4th of October, to be done on the same terms as that on Frontenac\u2014which included an undertaking to publish on the part of the publishers. In default of the book on Macdonald one on Mackenzie was to be taken up. The offer is then made in concrete form to pay $500 for this last work\u2014the exact sum the respondent was to receive for the first work; and finally\u2014the respondent having agreed to this figure\u2014Morang puts the matter beyond dispute by acknowledging the receipt of the respondent\u2019s acceptance of \u201cour offer to do W.L. Mackenzie for the sum of $500 in instalments of $250 as outlined.\u201d This last phrase can refer only to the passage already quoted from the letter of the 4th of October, stating the terms on which the respondent had agreed to the commutation of his royalties from the sale of the life of Frontenac; and demonstrates that in the appellant\u2019s view the parties were proceeding on the conditions already established by that letter.\nThat point being reached the remaining questions do not appear to present any grave difficulty. The appellants having received the respondent\u2019s manuscript refused to publish it on the grounds stated by Morang in a letter of the 6th of May, 1908. In effect these grounds were that the book as a whole presented a view of Mackenzie\u2019s character and career and of the controversies in which he was engaged entirely at variance with views expressed upon the same points in other books of the series and with current historical opinion; that Mackenzie\u2019s character and career and public views had been discussed in a spirit of hostile criticism; and that as the subjects of other biographies in the series had been treated with sympathy Mackenzie and the movements he represented would appear to have been singled out for unfair partisan attack. The publication of such a work would (the publishers thought) gravely discredit the series as a whole and seriously interfere with the sale of the books.\nIn these circumstances the respondent did not insist upon the publication of his book. He did what might have been expected having regard to the character of this criticism\u2014he tendered repayment of the money he had received on account of his work and asked for the return of his manuscript. The publishers after some delay took the position that the manuscript was their absolute property and refused his request.\nIt is not necessary to decide whether circumstances in fact existed which justified a refusal to publish. What appears to me to be perfectly clear is that on such grounds as those stated, the appellants could not rightly refuse to publish while retaining the manuscript; that the refusal to publish on such grounds constituted in effect a rejection of the manuscript.\nIt is not doubtful that the formal contract of 1901 left open many things to implication. The writer is to write a life of Frontenac containing a prescribed number of words; and the life of Frontenac so written is to become the property of the publishers and to be published by them. But it is not to be supposed that the writer merely undertook to put so many words together in the form of a book which might satisfy the description \u201cLife of Frontenac.\u201d He had been selected as a person of competent skill to write a book for a certain series the general tone and character of which was well known to him and (while I think it is impossible to imply any absolute warranty of fitness for publication in that series) it is undeniable, I think, that he must be taken to have warranted to use honestly his best care and skill in the production of a work which should meet the reasonable expectations of the publishers in that regard, so far as he could fairly do so in justice to himself. Then there is a covenant to publish. That covenant in form is absolute; but if it had entered the mind of either party that the book when produced might be of such a character that the publishers in good faith should believe the publication of it likely to destroy or gravely depreciate the commercial success of the series as a whole and the writer should be unable from conscientious reasons to alter his work to meet the publishers\u2019 views\u2014then I should think it may be presumed that all parties as reasonable people would have agreed that in such circumstances the publishers should have the right to refuse to publish. So with the provision that the book was to be the property of the publishers; the right to refuse to publish would, in the event of such refusal, involve the correlative right on the part of the author to the return of his manuscript. If it had been suggested that in a given contingency the publishers should be relieved from the obligation to publish it is, I think, inconceivable that either party would have considered it possible in the event of such a contingency occurring and the publishers acting upon it that they should at the same time be entitled to retain the manuscript and suppress the author\u2019s work.\nThe case in this aspect of it is one of that class (referred to in Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin & Co.[8], at page 59, by Lord Watson) in which the parties to a contract have not expressed their intentions in the particular event which has happened (the production of a work which in the opinion of the publishers could not be published without gravely prejudicing the sale of the whole series), but have left them to implication. In such a case his Lordship says:\nA court of law, in order to ascertain the implied meaning of the contract, must assume that the parties intended to stipulate for that which is fair and reasonable, having regard to their mutual interests and to the main objects of the contract. In some cases that assumption is the only test by which the meaning of the contract can be ascertained. There may be many possibilities within the contemplation of the contract * * * which were not actually present to the minds of the parties at the time of making it, and, when one or other of these possibilities becomes a fact, the meaning of the contract must be taken to be, not what the parties did intend (for they had neither thought nor intention regarding it), but that which the parties, as fair and reasonable men, would presumably have agreed upon if, having such possibility in view, they had made express provision as to their several rights and liabilities in the event of its occurrence.\nI should add that such having been the rights of the parties under the original contract those rights were, obviously, not affected by the fact of the money consideration having afterwards been advanced before the completion of the work.\nBut apart from any such implications the judgment must, I think, be supported. The appellants obtained this manuscript upon the faith of an agreement to publish it. In refusing to publish it they are guilty as Malins V.-C. said, in Chattock v. Muller[9], at page 181, of\na flagrant breach of duty which in this court has always been considered as a fraud.\nIn such a case, the learned V.-C. adds,\nthe court would be bound if possible to overcome all technical difficulties in order to defeat the unfair course of dealing.\nOne remedy, I am inclined to think with Meredith J. in the court below in view of this feature of the case open to the respondent was specific execution of the agreement to publish. The case appears to be analogous to those cases in which a railway company having obtained possession of land on a promise to construct buildings thereon and afterwards refusing to do so the court, notwithstanding the general rule that specific performance will not be granted of an agreement to build, decrees the execution of the promise upon the faith of which the company got the land, e.g., Wolverhampton Corporation v. Emmons[10]; Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway Co. v. London and North Western Railway Co.[11] But I do not think the re- spondent is confined to that. The suppression of this manuscript would so manifestly defeat the intention of both parties\u2014is indeed so monstrous a fraud upon the agreement under which the appellants obtained possession of it that the court will, if possible, as Malins V.-C., says, \u201covercome all technical difficulties\u201d to make that impossible. The decision of this court in Briggs v. Newswander[12], is authority for the proposition that the appellants until publication had possession of the manuscript for that purpose; and, the purpose having failed, there is a resulting trust in favour of the respondent.\nOn these grounds I humbly think the appeal fails.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014Apart from any effect which should be given to section 18 of the \u201cCopyright Act\u201d (R.S.C. ch. 70), I am of the opinion that, on the proper construction of the letters of the 6th, 7th and 11th December, 1905, the entire and unqualified right of property in the manuscript in question is vested in the appellant company and the respondent is not entitled to its return upon recouping to the company the sum which had been paid him for it. These three letters contain the contract of the parties, except as to one term, viz.: the dates at which the two instalments of $250 each should be payable, as to which, because of the reference in the words, \u201cas outlined,\u201d contained in the letter of the 11th December, parol evidence was probably admissible.\nThe contract between the parties was an employment of the plaintiff by the defendant company to \u201cdo\u201d for it the life of William Lyon Mackenzie, for which it agreed to pay him $500. Except the ordinary warranty that his work would be done with reasonable care and skill, there was no undertaking on the part of the author as to the character of his production\u2014certainly none that he would produce a work in which only views agreeable to the publishers should be put forward. For a book written with the reasonable care and skill exigible from an author, the company bound itself to pay the stipulated price. It could not, I think, have justified a refusal to pay that price merely because conclusions reached by the author upon the acts and conduct of the subject of the biography were such that, as publishers, its directors deemed it inadvisable to place the book on the market.\nOn the other hand, the publishing company certainly did not undertake to publish any book written with reasonable care and skill which the author might tender to it, however unsatisfactory his conclusions, however unsuitable his production for the purpose for which it designed to use it. Neither is it possible, in my opinion, to imply upon its part an undertaking, in the event of its failure to publish the plaintiff\u2019s work, on being recouped the price which had been paid for it, to return him his manuscript with liberty to him to publish it or to have it published through another house, thus probably rendering available to some rival publisher a book which he might sell in competition with a volume of the appellant\u2019s own series. It is only by the implication of such a term or provision in the contract that the plaintiff can succeed, and the question for our consideration is whether such an implication should be made.\nAn author may make any agreement he pleases regarding the disposition of his manuscript. He may assign it absolutely or subject to any condition or restriction upon its use. Such reservations or conditions as he makes and expresses the courts will protect and enforce. Jefferys v. Boosey[13], at pages 867-8. Certainly, too,\nthere are some things which no one would think of expressing in terms, though undoubtedly they would form part of any contract made on such a subject.\nLawrence & Bullen v. Aflalo[14], at page 20. The question with which we are now confronted is whether any, and if so, what implication should be made in regard to a matter for which the contract does not expressly provide. This is not a question of law; it is a question of intention\u2014a question of fact. While upon such questions \u201ceach case must stand on its own merits,\u201d we may discover in the authorities some analogies that may prove of assistance.\nIn regard to copyright it may be taken as settled law, since the explicit approval of Sweet v. Benning[15], by the House of Lords in Lawrence & Bullen v. Aflalo14, that, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary or of special circumstances indicating a contrary intention, the proper inference from the employment of an author to write a book for the publisher of a periodical or of a serial publication, is that the copyright and the right to obtain copyright shall belong to the publisher. This inference does not depend on section 18 of the English \u201cCopyright Act.\u201d It is drawn (to quote Lord Davey [Lawrence & Bullen v. Aflalo[16], at page 24], because\nin buying articles written by these gentlemen the inference is that both parties intended that the proprietor should have the right that was necessary for him adequately to protect the articles which he had purchased and the enterprise for the purpose of which these articles were intended to be used.\nApplying a similar test to the situation with which we are now dealing, it seems to me that it was necessary for the adequate protection of the publisher and of its enterprise that it should, on payment of the stipulated price, acquire the author\u2019s entire interest and property in the manuscript which he was employed to produce, with all rights which such proprietorship carries, including that of withholding the book from publication. Ward, Lock & Co. v. Long[17]. Otherwise the publisher might find that it had brought about the production of a work which it could not make use of, but which might be used by the author very much to its detriment.\nThere can be no doubt that the parties, contemplating no event except publication, intended that for the $500 to be paid to the author the defendant company should acquire all his rights in the book he was employed to write\u2014his common law literary property in it before publication, and his right to statutory copyright upon publication. Both parties expected that the plaintiff would succeed in producing a work of such character and merit that the defendant would publish it. Both took some risk on this point\u2014the defendant the risk of investing its $500 in an unsuitable book\u2014the plaintiff the risk of failing to secure the opportunity of enhancing his literary reputation which the publication of his work might be expected to afford. I appreciate the observation of Tindal C.J. in Planch\u00e9 v. Colburn[18], that an author is actuated by the desire for literary reputation as well as for pecuniary profit. For his literary fame he depends on publication. But it is quite consistent with the contract now under discussion, viewed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding it, that the author refrained from stipulating for publication, or, in the alternative, for the return of his manuscript and the right to have it published otherwise, because he relied upon his ability to produce a book of which the defendant\u2019s own business interests would ensure the publication, and that he was prepared to take the risk of the defendant suppressing it. This seems to me more probable than the view for which the plaintiff contends. At all events it is, I think, impossible to say that\non considering the terms of the contract in a reasonable and business manner an implication necessarily arises that the parties must have intended that the stipulation suggested (by the plaintiff) should exist. It is not enough to say that it would be a reasonable thing to make such an implication. It must be a necessary implication in the sense that I have mentioned;\nper Lord Esher M.R., in Hamlyn & Co. v. Wood & Co.[19], at page 491. There is nothing expressed in the letters of the parties which would limit or qualify the absolute title of the defendant to the work which it employed the plaintiff to produce. I find nothing special\u2014nothing unusual\u2014in the circumstances surrounding this case to warrant the introduction of any qualification or restriction upon the rights which the written contract prim\u00e2 facie confers.\nFor the plaintiff it is urged that the provision made for payment in two instalments\u2014one on the publication of the book, and the second on publication of a second edition\u2014implies an undertaking by the defendant that it would publish the book. This was the provision for payment ultimately agreed upon in the case of the \u201cFrontenac\u201d contract, and it is to it that the words in the letter of the 11th December, \u201cpayable in instalments of $250 as outlined,\u201d are said to be referable. Assuming that this term of the \u201cFrontenac\u201d contract was imported into the \u201cMackenzie\u201d contract, it merely fixes the time at or the event upon which the defendant bound itself to pay. It does not import a covenant or undertaking on its part that the event will happen, but only that it will pay when it does happen, or, if it should fail to happen through its default, that it will, unless otherwise excused, pay as if it had happened. This provision of the contract therefore does not warrant the implication of an agreement by the defendant to publish the plaintiff\u2019s work\u2014still less of an undertaking to return his manuscript and permit of its publication by the plaintiff or his nominees in default of publication by itself.\nApart entirely from the provisions of section 18 of the Canadian \u201cCopyright Act\u201d (R.S.C. ch. 70), I think it is reasonably clear that under the contract of the parties the defendant company became the proprietor of the manuscript which the plaintiff was employed to prepare and for which it paid him, and that as such proprietor it has the right to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s book shall be published or suppressed. Millar v. Taylor[20].\nBut the provisions of that section of the \u201cCopyright Act\u201d appear to conclude this case in favour of the appellant. Section 17 provides for the assignment of\nthe right * * * to obtain a copyright and (of) the copyright when obtained.\nIt is, therefore, clear that the operation of the statute is not meant to be confined to the statutory copyright which exists only after publication. Although in section 18 \u201cthe proprietorship of such copyright\u201d only is mentioned, having regard to the object of this provision, and to its collocation, that phrase should, I think, be taken to include not only the statutory copyright obtainable after publication, but also the right to obtain such copyright as an incident of the common law literary property which exists before publication. Indeed the section itself provides that the\nauthor shall not be entitled to obtain or to retain the proprietorship of such copyright, which is by the said transaction (the execution by the author of a literary work for another person) virtually transferred to the purchaser.\nIt is, therefore, reasonably clear that unless \u201ca reserve\u201d of copyright \u201cis specially made by the author * * * in a deed duly executed,\u201d his employer\u2014the other person for whom the literary work is executed\u2014has by virtue of the statute the right to obtain the copyright. Frowde v. Parrish[21]. This right is an incident of the common law literary property in the work which it is not unreasonable to assume is in such a case also vested in the person for whom the work has been executed.\nIn the absence of anything to indicate that the author in the present case in any manner specially reserved to himself any right of copyright or of control over the work which he undertook for the defendant, I am, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that he is not entitled to demand the return of his manuscript on repayment of the $500 received by him. I would allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the Ontario Court of Appeal and would dismiss this action with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Aylesworth, Wright, Moss & Thompson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Christie, Green & Hill.\n[1] 20 Ont.

In the course of such employment he was ordered to finish some rivets at an elevation of at least fifty feet from the ground. There was no \u00abscaffolding directly under the riveting and he asked the foreman in charge if he would move and re-erect the one in use or place a plank across two beams near the work to be done and was ordered to use the plank. In doing so the plank slipped and he was thrown to the ground sustaining severe injuries. The defence was that the plaintiff had voluntarily and recklessly exposed himself to unnecessary danger.\nThe plaintiff produced evidence affirming the above statement of the facts. The foreman denied that he was asked whether or not the plaintiff should move the scaffolding, but did not say that he ordered it to be moved or forbade the plaintiff using the plank. The jury found that there was common fault and assessed the total damages to plaintiff at $4,500, which was reduced to $2,200, for which the plaintiff had judgment.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the Judgment of the Court of Review maintaining the verdict was affirmed by a majority of the court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nLafleur K.C. and H.

On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the defendants contended that the verdict could not stand for two reasons:\u20141. That there was no finding that the injury to plaintiff resulted from his conformity to an order of a person in defendants\u2019 employ which he was obliged to obey:\u20142. That the trial judge, although requested by counsel for defendants to do so, refused to submit to the jury the question of whether or not the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk attendant upon working as he did when the accident happened.\nThe Supreme Court held, following the reasoning of the Court of Appeal as to the first objection, that the jury were sufficiently directed on the point as to the plaintiff being bound to obey the order of the employee whom he was assisting in repairing the car and the evidence shewed that he did follow the latter\u2019s directions.\nOn the second objection Mr. Justice Davies dissented, holding that the question as to the plaintiff being volens should have been submitted. Mr. Justice Idington took the view that the issue as to volens should have been pleaded, while Duff and Anglin JJ. were of opinion that it was covered by the finding that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence. Mr. Justice Brodeur held that as plaintiff was acting under the orders of a superior at the time the maxim volenti non fit injuria did not apply.

Lanata, at the time of the accident by which he was killed, was employed as powder-monkey and in charge of a shack in which frozen dynamite was thawed out. The shack was about 14 by 16 feet in size, with a wooden door which was not kept locked when Lanata was out and into which the foreman of the works and the workmen used to go to get warmed. There was a sheet-iron stove in the centre of it fed with wood from the top and the dynamite was placed on shelves around the walls and on a movable shelf about four feet from the front of the stove. On the day he was killed Lanata had been sent by the foreman to get some dynamite from the shack, and, according to the evidence, had either not got inside, or had got in and out again when an explosion took place, and he was found alive, his body intact and his clothing torn and burning, having apparently been thrown against the stump of a tree near the entrance to the shack.\nUnder these circumstances the trial judge gave judgment against the defendants for $2,000, which the Court of Appeal affirmed on the ground that the mode of thawing the dynamite was dangerous and contrary to the directions issued with each box, which directions were not read to nor explained to Lanata, who could not read himself, though they were known to the foreman and other officials of the company.\nAn appeal by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nG.H.

Some time before the making of this order the company had hypothecated its principal assets, including its stock of manufactured linens, to the Crown Bank of Canada to secure advances and the bank had taken possession. By order of court the business was allowed to be carried as a going concern by the liquidator and advances to be procured from the bank for wages, etc., to be repaid out of the first moneys coming into his hands. While so carrying it on he advertised for tenders for purchase of the assets, and, in April, 1906, an agreement was entered into between the defendant and one Todd by which the latter became purchaser of the property of the company \u201cfree from incumbrances\u201d and transferred the same shortly after to the plaintiffs, a new company formed to take over the business. The defendant received $5,800 on account of the purchase money and, by direction of the plaintiffs, and on their undertaking to hold him harmless, paid it over to the Crown Bank.\nIt appeared that the insolvent company used to send their goods to Scotland to be bleached, and a quantity was there when the winding-up order was made. The bleaching firm wrote to the defendant, stating the amount of their account in respect to their goods and asking for instructions. After some further correspondence the liquidator wrote them full information as to what had been done, and stated that the proceeds of sale of the assets would hardly pay the bank\u2019s claim. He ended his letter by saying: \u201cI, as liquidator, have no objection to your disposing of the goods on the highest market, applying the proceeds of such sale on your claim and advising me accordingly.\u201d Under the law of Scotland the bleachers had no right to sell the goods to satisfy their lien without complying with certain formalities, which they did not do.\nThe plaintiffs brought action against the liquidator claiming damages for conversion of the goods so sold and, at the trial, were allowed to amend by adding a claim for breach of the contract to sell the assets of the insolvent company \u201cfree from incumbrances.\u201d At the trial they recovered judgment on the latter ground, which the Court of Appeal reversed, holding that there was no conversion, as the defendant\u2019s letter quoted above did not amount to instructions to sell, and that there was no breach of contract, as the term \u201cfree from incumbrances,\u201d as used in the contract with Todd, was not intended to apply to the charges for bleaching, but to the mortgage on the buildings and liens on the stock. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which, after hearing counsel for the respective parties, reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day dismissed the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nJ.W.

The action was to recover on a covenant in a mortgage for the payment of money and interest alleged to be due to the plaintiff under the mortgage which purported to secure $2,800 with interest. As to the mortgage the question involved was whether or not the plaintiff could claim re-payment of $1,000 paid, some time after the mortgage was executed, to retire a promissory note, made by the defendant and indorsed by the plaintiff, and which was in part renewal of a similar note which had been so made and indorsed prior to the mortgage. The defence was that the note was given for the purpose of raising funds for the use of a partnership which the trial judge found existed between the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant contended that not only was the mortgage given to secure the note, but also that he was not personally liable to re-pay the $1,000 to the plaintiff. By the plaintiff it was contended that the mortgage was given, amongst other things, to secure him against liability on the note in question. The trial judge held that the note had been indorsed by the plaintiff for the accommodation of the defendant and that the mortgage had been given to secure the plaintiff in respect of the note, and he directed a reference to the master to take accounts. This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Perdue J. dissenting.\nDuring the taking of accounts the defendant discovered a statutory declaration by the plaintiff to the effect, amongst other things, that the full amount of the mortgage had been advanced by him to the defendant and that it had been taken for the purpose of securing the advance so made and not as collateral security. In these circumstances the court appealed from, in pursuance of section 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" granted special leave for the present appeal, although it had not been brought within the time prescribed by the Act[1].\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the appellant, and without calling upon counsel for the respondent for any argument, the appeal was dismissed with costs, the court not being satisfied that the judgment appealed from was so clearly wrong that it should be reversed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nHugh Phillips for the appellant.\nJ. B. Coyne for the respondent.\n[1] 20 Man. R. 331.\n"

Owing to differences which arose between the parties, the plaintiffs refused to proceed further with the execution on their part of the agreement unless the performance of the terms of the agreement by the other parties was guaranteed, and, on the 7th of September, 1905, the bond was executed. The bond was expressed to be given as security for the payment of the price of the lands and it also contained a covenant for the payment to the plaintiffs of $2,500, part of the price, to and for their own use and benefit as liquidated damages for services rendered and to be rendered by the plaintiffs. This bond was assigned to the appellant Elliott as collateral security for advances to his co-plaintiffs and, during the trial, he was added as a party plaintiff in the action. The case was tried by Mr. Justice Macdonald, who ordered judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiffs. This judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from, the Court of Appeal being of opinion that the plaintiffs had failed to shew that they had acquired any title to or interest in the lands which they had agreed to sell. It was held by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba that, as the plaintiffs could not recover under the agreement they could not recover under the bond.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of both parties, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nJ.

Duff, retained the plaintiff, a barrister, in the prosecution of some sailors for desertion. The sailors were convicted and imprisoned and plaintiff was also retained to oppose their application for discharge on habeas corpus which he did successfully. The captain being about to sail gave his note to plaintiff for the amount of his charges. About the same time he was removed from the position of managing owner and the defendant appointed in his stead. Plaintiff's note was presented to the defendant and paid.\nThe convicted sailors made a second application for a writ of habeas corpus and the order was served at the residence of Captain Walters. His daughter brought it to plaintiff, who telephoned to defendant concerning it and was told that he, defendant, had no instructions in the matter. Plaintiff attended on the second application for the writ and defendant refusing to pay his bill he brought action.\nThe trial judge and two judges of the full court held that defendant's action in paying the former account and making no objection to his acting on the second occasion estopped him from denying the plaintiff's retainer.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada unanimously reversed the judgment for the plaintiff, holding that his retainer was at an end when Captain Walters settled his account.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nW.

The deceased employee had fastened two bags of grain to the rope which worked over the pulleys without using a slip-knot and the bags, while being hoisted, became loosened and fell upon him causing injuries from which he afterwards died. Shortly before the accident he had been warned to be careful in performing the work at which he was engaged, but it did not appear that he had been instructed as to the proper method of securing the bags to the hoisting rope. The action was dismissed at the trial by Sir Frs. Langelier, A.C.J., on the ground that the injuries were caused by the negligence of deceased solely, without any fault on the part of the defendant, his employer. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Review and, in affirming that decision, the judgment now appealed from (Sir Louis A. Jett\u00ea C.J. dissenting) held that the employer by his neglect in permitting the deceased to perform his work in an unsafe manner became responsible in damages for the injury which, as the result of want of proper instructions, was the cause of his death.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of both parties the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, the appeal was dismissed with costs, His Lordship the Chief Justice dissenting.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nRoy K.C. for the appellant.\nPerron K.C. and St. Laurent for the respondent.\n[1] Q.R. 20 K.B. 378.\n"
