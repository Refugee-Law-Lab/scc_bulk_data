The appellants, creditors of the Steel Company, intervened, and objected to the granting of the winding-up order on the ground, that 45 Vic., ch 23 was not applicable to the company.\nHeld\u2014reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Fournier, J., dissenting\u2014that 45 Vic., ch. 23, was not applicable to such Company.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, rendered on the 31st March, 1884, granting an order for winding-up of the Steel Company of Canada (Limited).\nThe Steel Company of Canada (Limited), is a joint stock company, incorporated in England in 1874, under the Imperial Joint Stock Companies' Acts of 1864 and 1867.\nThe said company was never incorporated in Nova Scotia, nor in the Dominion of Canada. The chief place of business of the company in Canada is at Londonderry, in the county of Colchester, in the Province of Nova Scotia aforesaid, where the company have for some years past owned and operated extensive iron mines and iron and steel works, and the company's property at Londonderry constitutes almost entirely its assets. The company owned no real estate or premises elsewhere than in Canada, but occupied an office in Great Britain.\nThe objects of the company, according to the memorandum of association, were as follows:\u2014\n1. The carrying into effect of the agreements following, or any modifications of the same, respectively, which may be agreed upon by the several parties and the company; that is to say:\n(a.) An agreement, dated the 13th day of March, 1874, made between Charles Tennant, of the one part, and Edward Faulcknor Tremayne, of the other part, for the purchase of certain iron works, properties, lands and hereditaments, situate at or near Londonderry, in the Province of Nova Scotia and Dominion of Canada, formerly belonging to the Intercolonial Iron Company (Limited), and other works and hereditaments held in connection therewith.\n(b). An agreement dated the 13th day of March, 1874, and made between Charles William Siemens, of the one part, and Edward Faulcknor Tremayne, of the other part, for the grant of a license or right to use, free of royalty, the patent process of the said Charles William Siemens, for the production of iron and steel, and their subsequent working into merchantable forms.\n2. The purchasing, leasing, or otherwise acquiring of iron works, collieries, coal mines, iron mines, or any other mines, mining ground or minerals, and particularly the purchasing, leasing, or otherwise acquiring of the iron works and collieries, coal and ironstone mines, and other properties, lands and hereditaments mentioned or referred to in the said agreement, and other works and hereditaments held in connection therewith; and the searching for, and getting, and working, raising and making merchantable and selling and disposing of iron, coal, ironstone, and all ores, metals and minerals whatsoever.\n3. The carrying on the trades or businesses of iron masters, coal masters, miners, smelters, engineers, steel converters and manufacturers, iron founders and general contractors, in all their branches, and the making, purchasing, hiring and selling railway and other plant, fittings, machinery and rolling stock.\n4. The purchasing and selling as merchants, iron, steel, coal, metals and other materials, articles or things on commission, or as agents, or otherwise.\n5. The purchasing or taking in exchange or on lease, renting, occupying, or otherwise acquiring of any works, collieries, lands, hereditaments, premises, properties, estates and effects, or any grants, concessions, leases, or other interest therein, and purchasing or working of any patent or patent rights which may be considered desirable for the interests of the company.\n6. The purchasing the goodwill or any interest in any trade or business of a nature or character similar to any trade or business which the company may be authorized to carry on.\n7. The draining, paving, planting, building on or otherwise improving and realizing of all or any parts of the lands from time to time purchased, taken in exchange, or on lease, or otherwise acquired by the company, and the managing, farming, cultivating, maintaining, improving, under-letting, setting, leasing, exchanging, selling and otherwise dealing with and disposing of all or any parts of the lands, hereditaments, and real and personal estates and properties and effects of the company, and in such manner, and on such terms, and for such purposes as the company think proper.\n8. The construction of any waterworks, ponds, reservoirs or watercourses, and the promoting, making, providing, acquiring, leasing, working, using and disposing of railways, tramways, and other roads and ways, for the more convenient access to any parts, or otherwise for the benefit, or supposed benefit, of any property of the company, or for any other purpose.\n9. The contributing to the expense of constructing, making, providing, acquiring, working and using the same.\n10. The applying for and obtaining on behalf of the company of patents for processes to be used in any of the works or operations of the company, and the purchasing and acquiring of any patents for like processes granted to any other person or corporation, or any license for the using of the same.\n11. The making and carrying into effect of arrangements with landowners, railway companies, shipping companies, carriers and other companies and persons, for the purposes of the company.\n12. To sell the undertaking, assets and property of the company, or any portion of the same, to any other company or companies, or any person or persons, for such price in money or shares in any purchasing company or other firm, and on such terms as the company shall sanction, and to acquire the whole or any part of the undertaking, assets and property of, or otherwise to amalgamate with any other company or companies established for objects similar in general character to the objects of this company. 13. The establishing and regulating of agencies for purposes of the company, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad; and\n14. The doing all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects.\nIn May, 1875, an Act (ch. 3) of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, was passed in reference to the said Steel Company of Canada (Limited), and that Act was to be read as a part of the case on appeal.\nThe business of the company was managed by directors, whose meetings took place in Great Britain. Two at least of the directors always resided in Canada. At the commencement of these proceedings, and for some time prior thereto, the managing director resided in Canada.\nOn the 29th day of November, 1883, Gillespie, Moffat & Co., of the city of Montreal, creditors of the said company, presented before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, a petition to wind up the said company.\nThe company consented to the winding up, as prayed for in the said petition, but the Merchants Bank of Halifax, creditors of the said company, and the appellants in this appeal, appeared and opposed the granting of a winding-up order. The court made the winding-up order, from which order an appeal was taken.\nThe only question argued on this appeal was as to whether the Act (ch. 23) of the statutes of Canada, 1882, in reference to insolvent banks, insurance companies, &c., is applicable to the Steel Company of Canada (Limited).\nMr. Henry, Q.C., for appellant:\nAs appears by the case, the only question to be argued in this appeal is as to whether the statute (ch. 23) of the Canada Acts of 1882 is applicable to the Steel Company of Canada (Limited). This is not a mere bankruptcy act but a winding-up act. A company may be wound up when not insolvent at all, and the act is expressly made applicable to companies which are not insolvent. Lindley on Partnership[1].\nThe Act contains many provisions which it would be impossible to carry out against this company. The following are referred to here as examples of these inapplicable and unworkable provisions:\nSection 19 is intended to prevent the company from carrying on business except in so far as the liquidator may think beneficial for the winding up. It also restricts, after the making of the winding-up order, transfer of shares by shareholders in England, who in no view of the matter can be regarded as subject to Canadian legislation. Contributories are to be consulted in reference to the winding-up, although they live thousands of miles away, and in a different jurisdiction. Under section 38 the powers of the directors end at the beginning of the winding-up proceedings, although the board sits in another country and acts under the authority of an Imperial Legislature. Section 44 purports to work a complete dissolution of the company, although by virtue of an Imperial statute its organization and powers remain intact.\nThe rights of contributories who are in no wise subject to any jurisdiction in Canada are to be adjudicated upon and settled by a Canadian court or judge. Contributories in England may be called upon to pay money into our court. The liquidator may compromise all calls and liabilities to calls.\nCreditors in England are to be restrained from suing the company, and must ask leave of the court here before they can sue even there. Section 34 provides that the liquidator is to take into his hands all the assets of the company. By various clauses, provisions are made for proceedings against absconding directors, and for the punishment of fraudulent directors. The franchises conferred by the Parliament of Great Britain are to be limited and cancelled by certain proceedings under an act of the Colonial Dominion of Canada.\nIndependently of these provisions of the Act and of its general frame and tenor, which so strongly indicate that it was not intended to apply to an English incorporated company, some light upon the question of construction is afforded by the consideration that by the comity of nations the jurisdiction in which this company should be wound up in insolvency would be in Great Britain, where it may be said to be domiciled and where there actually exist ample provisions for so winding it up. Bulkeley v. Shultz[2].\nThe English cases which have been relied upon by the respondents to establish that under this Act the court should entertain jurisdiction to wind up foreign companies, were based upon the 199th section of the English Act, which provides that any partnership association or company, except railway campanies incorporated by Act of Parliament, consisting of more than seven members, and not registered under this Act, and hereinafter included under the term \"unregistered company,\" may be wound up under this Act. And all the provisions of this Act, with respect to winding up, shall apply to such company.\nThere is no such provision in the Canadian Act, and it is obvious, from the English cases in question, that the jurisdiction would not have been entertained in the absence of this 199th section.\nSee specially in re Commercial Bank of India[3].\nIf the act in question is to be construed as applicable to such a company as the Steel Company of Canada, it is so far ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nIf this act is to be read as extending to this company, its provisions are so far essentially inconsistent with those of the Companies Acts, 1862 and 1867, under which the company is constituted, that they must be considered repugnant, and therefore to that extent, at all events, void.\nThe Companies Acts, 1862 and 1867, were passed by the same Imperial Legislature which enacted the British North America Act, and if the Canadian Act of 1882 purports to deal with this company in a manner inconsistent with the operation of the Imperial legislation, under which the company was constituted, and to which it is clearly subject, then the Canadian Act is ultra vires to the extent of the inconsistency involved.\nThen, finally, I submit that the act of 1884, expressly stating that it is applicable to foreign companies, shows that the Dominion Parliament did not intend that the Act of 1882 should apply to English companies.\nMr. Laflamme, Q.C., and Mr. Sedgwick, Q.C., for respondents:\nThe first section of the Canadian Winding-up Act is wide enough to include and does include foreign corporations. \"This act applies to incorporated trading companies.\" Sections 13, 106, 109 and 116 show that parliament intended the act to apply to foreign as well as to home companies. Sections 107 and 108 refer to the statutes relating to life insurance, and provide for the payment of claims against life insurance companies that are being wound up. The Consolidated Insurance Act, 1877, one of these statutes, is expressly referred to, and upon reference to that act it will be seen it unquestionably includes within its purview foreign corporations.\nThe English \"Companies Act, 1862,\" provides for the winding up of corporations. It applies to \"any partnership association or company\" (sec. 199). This section is the only authority which gives the Imperial Courts jurisdiction to wind up foreign corporations under that act, and that power is unquestioned and has been repeatedly exercised.\nSee re Madrid & Valencia R. Co.[4]; re Union Bank of Calcutta[5]; Reuss v. Bos[6]; re Commercial Bank of India[7].\nThe words in the Canadian statute \"any incorporated company\" are as comprehensive as those of the Imperial, \"any partnership association or company,\" and, if so, then the authority of the English cases is wholly in favor of the respondents. See also Parsons v. The Queen Insurance Co. decided by this court[8].\nThe Canadian Act is not, strictly speaking, a winding-up act, but a bankrupt act. In contradistinction to the English statute it relates only to insolvent companies\u2014a company can be wound up only when insolvent. It cannot of its own motion be wound up. Its contributories cannot invoke the aid of the act; creditors are the only persons entitled to do so. No such provision is made for its total extinguishment as that contained in section 143 of the Companies Act, 1862; and it is submitted that should all its debts be paid under liquidation proceedings it might then proceed with its business under its original charter. The only object the act has in view is equal distribution of the company's assets among its creditors, an object peculiarly within the powers of the Parliament of Canada. That parliament had shortly before repealed the Insolvent Act, and this act was simply in effect a re-enactment of that act, so far as it related to corporations, but without any provisions for discharge. Then viewing the act in question simply as an Insolvent Act, there can be no question as to its application to a foreign insolvent company doing its principal business in Canada. In France companies having foreign legal personality are continually declared bankrupt. See Westlake's Private International Law[9].\nThe legal principles applicable to a foreigner, or person not domiciled in Canada, but doing business in Canada, cannot be different from those applicable to a foreign company doing business in Canada. By comity of nations English courts extend to foreign corporations, in matters of trading, the same protection and privileges as they shew to foreign individuals.\nThe Steel Company of Canada was formed for the purpose of operating iron mines in Canada and carrying on business there. It became insolvent there. It committed an act of bankruptcy there. Can it be said it is not to be subject to the bankrupt laws existing there?\nThe argument that Parliament could not have intended the Act in question to apply to foreign companies, inasmuch as the collection of its assets abroad is difficult, if not impossible, is not, it is submitted, tenable, for the following among other reasons: \u2014\nBecause, assuming the act is an Insolvent Act, foreign courts will recognize the rights of the statutory assignee to property abroad. Westlake on Private International Law[10].\nBecause the difficulty of realizing property or of the company's liquidator obtaining a status in foreign courts, is not conclusive as to Parliament's intention. In England, Ontario and Nova Scotia statutes have been passed providing for service of process on foreigners abroad and for obtaining judgments against them. If the defendants do not submit to the jurisdiction of the courts out of which the process issues these judgments have no validity in the defendant's domicile, and yet the constitutionality of these statutes cannot be questioned. They are binding at home, and the moment the defendant comes within the reach of the arm of the court they are effective.\nIn like manner a liquidator can settle in this country the list of contributories, and thus can obtain what is in effect a judgment against each of them\u2014such judgment is as efficient as any judgment obtained in this country against a foreigner. The difficulty of realizing the fruits of it does not affect its validity, as far as our courts are concerned.\nThe case of In re Matheson Bros. & Co. (Limited)[11] was referred to and commented on as being conclusive in favor of appellant's contention.\nMr. Henry, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.,:\u2014\nThe Steel Company of Canada (Limited) is a joint stock company incorporated in England in 1874 under the Imperial Joint Stock Companies Acts 1862 and 1867.\nThe said company was never incorporated in Nova Scotia, nor in the Dominion of Canada.\nThe only question argued on this appeal was whether the Act, ch. 23 of the statutes of Canada, 1882, in reference to insolvent banks, insurance companies, &c., is applicable to the Steel Company of Canada (Limited).\nThis is a case of winding up pure and simple. I do not think that the Dominion Parliament intended that the 45 Vic., ch. 23, should apply to winding up companies incorporated under the Imperial Joint Stock Companies Acts, 1862, and 1867. The provisions of the Dominion Act and the Imperial Acts as to winding up are in so many most important particulars inconsistent the one with the others, that if the Dominion Parliament had intended the 45 Vic. to apply to companies incorporated under the Imperial Acts, there would have been in the Dominion Act some distinct intimation indicated to that effect, or some reconciliation of the conflicting or inconsistent provisions, so that the act with respect to such companies might be effectively carried out in its integrity, which cannot now be done.\nI am confirmed in this opinion by the action of the Dominion Parliament in passing the first section of the 47 Vic., ch. 39, which repeals the 1st sect. of 45 Vic., ch. 23, and substitutes the 1st sec. of 47 Vic. in lieu thereof, the only alteration being the addition to the enumeration of the companies to which the 45 Vic. is to apply of the words: \"which are doing business in Canada no matter where incorporated,\" conveying, it appears to me, a very clear intimation that the 45 Vic. did not so apply.\nThe 47 Vic. was passed after the proceedings in this case were taken, and there is no indication that the added words should have a retrospective operation.\nTherefore I think the Act, ch. 23 of the statutes of Canada, 1882, in reference to Insolvent Banks and Insurance Companies, &c., is not applicable to the Steel Company of Canada (Limited.)\nThis renders it quite unnecessary to discuss the question as to the extent of the power of the Dominion Parliament to pass laws for winding up, or otherwise dealing with foreign insolvent trading companies doing business in the Dominion, or in reference to the disposition of their property and assets in this country or elsewhere if insolvent.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014(Oral)\nThe first point to be decided in this case is, whether the statute of the Dominion known as the Winding up Act of 1882 applies to a company incorporated in England under the companies Act of 1862, as the Steel Company of Canada was.\nThe effect of the winding up under this statute is to settle the rights and equities of the shareholders, or quasi partners, as between themselves, and to dissolve the company.\nBy the Imperial Act of 1862, under which this company was organized, winding up is provided for, and the effect of such a winding up is thus described by Lord Romilly, M. R., in re Philips[12]:\u2014\nThe object of the winding up acts was only to settle the equities between the partners in order that when the partnership was wound up they might obtain contribution from each other.\nThis then being a company having its domicile in England, and being subject to an express statutory provision for its winding up in the appropriate forum for such a purpose, viz., the forum of its domicile, a colonial statute providing for the winding up of the same company would be ultra vires and void, not merely upon the interpretation of the clauses as to the general powers of the Dominion Parliament in the British North America Act, but by the express provisions of a paramount law, the Imperial statute 28 and 29 Vic., ch. 63, which enacts:\u2014\nThat any Colonial law repugnant to any Act of Parliament extending to the Colony to which such law may relate shall be void to the extent of such repugnancy.\nI therefore consider that, as we are not to give any statute a construction which would make it repugnant to a higher law, and so void upon principles of constitutional law, neither this statute of 1882, nor the subsequent Act, which declares that foreign corporations are to be included in its provisions, applies to this company\u2014for no one can doubt but that the Imperial statute of 1882 is binding throughout the empire; therefore upon this principle, even if this statute had expressly in words included this company incorporated under the English Act of 1863, I should have equally held it to have been void,\nBut supposing the statute of 1862 to have made no specific provision for winding up, I should still hold that this act of 1882 did not apply to a joint stock company domiciled in England. All statutes are to be construed so as not to conflict with well established rules of international law.\nThen it is a universally recognized principle that a company or partnership is only to be wound up, i.e. the rights of partners inter se and the dissolution are only to be judicially brought about, in the forum of its domicile.\nWe must, therefore, construe this statute so as to be consistent with and to give effect to this rule, as to which there is a general consensus of authority, English, American and Continental. This last position does not, of course, affect the validity of the statute of 1882 but merely its construction, for the rules and canons which govern the comity of nations and make up what is called Private International Law do not in any way control the legislature, and, therefore, so far as the mere question of construction is concerned, the difficulty would have been obviated if the statute, as originally expressed, had been declared to be applicable to foreign corporations, as it is by the subsequent act of 1883, but in that case, as I have already said, I should have considered it ultra vires as in conflict with the Imperial Act of 28 and 29 Vic., ch. 63. Lastly, the very fact of the 47 Vic., ch. 89 (1883), having made the statute of 1882 applicable to foreign corporations, is conclusive to show that it was not the intention of the Legislature to include them in the first instance in the Act of 1882, upon which the winding up order in this case is alone dependent. Nothing in the foregoing statement of the reasons for this decision is intended to impugn the power of the legislature to enact bankruptcy and insolvency statutes applying to foreign corporations, or even to provide for the winding up of such corporations, provided in the case of the latter the statutory provision is express, and does not conflict with any Imperial legislation.\nFOURNIER J.:\nLa seule question soulev\u00e9e en cette cause est de savoir si \"l'acte relatif aux banques et corporations de commerce en \u00e9tat d'insolvabilit\u00e9\" peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie \"The Steel Company of Canada (Limited).\"\nCette compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e en Angleterre en 1874, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions des actes imp\u00e9riaux de 1862 et 1867, concernant l'incorporation des compagnies \u00e0 fonds social. Mais le chef-lieu de ses affaires est \u00e0 Londonderry, dans le comt\u00e9 de Colchester, Nouvelle-Ecosse, o\u00f9 elle fait une exploitation consid\u00e9rable de mines de fer, ainsi que la manufacture sur une grande \u00e9chelle d'ouvrages en fer et en acier.\nIl est admis que toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la compagnie sont situ\u00e9es en Canada et qu'elle n'a qu'un bureau d'affaires en Angleterre.\nLes op\u00e9rations de la compagnie devaient comprendre non seulement l'exploitation des mines de fer et de charbon, mais presque tous les travaux qui se rattachent \u00e0 ces industries, aussi l'exploitation de mines en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ainsi que la construction d'une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d'ouvrages, tel que le tout est \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 dans un m\u00e9moire adopt\u00e9 par la dite compagnie pour indiquer et pour d\u00e9finir les objets qu'elle avait en vue d'atteindre par son incorporation.\nLes affaires \u00e9taient conduites par des directeurs qui tenaient leurs r\u00e9unions en Angleterre, deux de ces directeurs ont toujours demeur\u00e9 en Canada. Le principal g\u00e9rant n'a cess\u00e9 d'y demeurer que depuis le commencement des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s en liquidation.\nLe 29 Novembre 1883, les intim\u00e9s, cr\u00e9anciers de la dite Compagnie, ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, une requ\u00eate demandant la liquidation de la Compagnie suivant les dispositions de l'acte ci-dessus cit\u00e9.\nLa Compagnie a donn\u00e9 son consentement \u00e0 cette proc\u00e9dure, mais l'appelante s'y est oppos\u00e9e. La cour ayant accord\u00e9 la demande des intim\u00e9s, c'est de l'ordre rendu \u00e0 cet effet qu'il y a pr\u00e9sentement appel.\nLa seule question d\u00e9battue devant la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, comme devant celle-ci, a \u00e9t\u00e9 de savoir si l'acte 45 Vict., (1882,) ch. 23, concernant les banques insolvables, etc., etc., est applicable \u00e0 la Compagnie dont il s'agit. Ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e en Angleterre, cette Compagnie se trouve ici une corporation \u00e9trang\u00e8re. L'acte ne faisant pas une mention sp\u00e9ciale des corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res, on en conclut qu'elles ne pouvaient \u00eatre soumises \u00e0 son op\u00e9ration. C'est le principal argument invoqu\u00e9 contre son application \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente Compagnie; le second est fond\u00e9 sur l'insuffisance de ses dispositions pour atteindre les d\u00e9biteurs et contributaires de la Compagnie r\u00e9sidant en pays \u00e9trangers.\nQuoique l'acte 45 Vict., ch. 23, ne fasse pas une mention particuli\u00e8re des corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res, les termes qui le d\u00e9clarent applicable aux corporations de commerce (Trading Corporations) en \u00e9tat d'insolvabilit\u00e9, ne sontils pas assez \u00e9tendus pour les comprendre? Les expressions employ\u00e9es par notre statut sont au moins aussi \u00e9tendues et compr\u00e9hensives que celles de l'acte imp\u00e9rial (Windiag Up Acts of 1862 and 1867), qui se sert des termes: \"any partnership, association or company,\" pour d\u00e9signer les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ou compagnies soumises \u00e0 son op\u00e9ration. Si sous cette d\u00e9signation, qui me para\u00eet plus vague encore que celles de notre statut, les tribunaux en Angleterre ont cru devoir faire application des dispositions de l'acte imp\u00e9rial aux corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res, je ne vois pas de raison qui puisse nous emp\u00eacher de d\u00e9clarer que ces corporations seront \u00e9galement soumises aux dispositions de notre statut.\nD'ailleurs, ind\u00e9pendamment de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des termes qui devrait suffire pour les comprendre, on voit par la sec. 13, que le statut les avait en vue en adoptant une disposition sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des compagnies qui n'ont pas le si\u00e8ge de leurs affaires en Canada.\nDans ce cas, le statut donne la facult\u00e9 aux cr\u00e9anciers d'intenter leurs proc\u00e9d\u00e9s contre telles compagnies dans la province o\u00f9 elles ont leur principal ou un de leur principaux \u00e9tablissements. La section 109 qui concerne, il est vrai, plus sp\u00e9cialement les compagnies d'assurance, fait mention de l'avis \u00e0 donner \u00e0 un cr\u00e9ancier \u00e9tranger. La section 116 prescrit le mode de donner avis au cr\u00e9ancier \u00e9tranger du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la liste des cr\u00e9anciers. Il est bien \u00e9vident par ces dispositions que l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait d'atteindre les corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res aussi bien que celles du pays.\nCeci n'est pas douteux du moins par rapport aux compagnies d'assurance qui, par la section 108, sont oblig\u00e9es d'adopter le mode d'estimation de la valeur des polices, indiqu\u00e9 dans \"l'Acte d'assurance refondu de 1877,\" dont les dispositions sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es s'appliquer aux corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res.\nDans la cause de \"The Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons,\"[13] cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e9taient soumises \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration du ch. 162 des statuts revis\u00e9s d'Ontario. \"An act to secure uniform conditions in policies of fire insurance.\"\nCependant cet acte ne faisait, pas plus que la 45me Vict., ch. 23, mention des compagnies \u00e9trang\u00e8res. Le sommaire de la d\u00e9cision de la cour sur ce point est ainsi qu'il suit:\u2014\nThat \"the Fire Insurance Policy Act\" R. S. O., ch. 162., was not ultra vires and is applicable to insurance companies (whether foreign or incorporated by the Dominion) licensed to carry on insurance business throughout Canada, and taking risks on property situate within the province of Ontario.\nDans les conclusions de son jugement Sir William Ritchie, C. J., s'exprime de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne laisser aucun doute sur cette question.\ni am, therefore, of opinion that this Act applies to all insurance companies that insure property in the province of Ontario, whether local, dominion or foreign.\nLes raisons qui ont amen\u00e9 cette cour \u00e0 comprendre les compagnies \u00e9trang\u00e8res dans les dispositions du \"Fire Insurance Policy Act\" d'Ontario, me paraissent aussi concluantes dans cette cause que dans celle de Parsons.\nUn mot d'un argument qu'on a fait valoir contre cette interpr\u00e9tation, c'est que le parlement, par un acte subs\u00e9quent en amendement, ayant fait mention sp\u00e9cialement des corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res, semble avoir reconnu qu'il y avait eu omission.\nJe ne crois pas que l'on puisse en tirer cette conclusion, car tout en tranchant la question pour l'avenir, il est sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en ces termes:\nNothing in this act contained shall affect any pending suit or action or any right of action now existing.\nLa d\u00e9cision de la question doit donc d\u00e9pendre uniquement de l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner au ch. 23, 45 Vict., et les raisons invoqu\u00e9es plus haut ne perdent aucunement de leur force par la passation de l'acte d'amendement mentionn\u00e9 plus haut.\nIl n'est pas contest\u00e9 que la compagnie dont il s'agit est une corporation commerciale. Elle devait donc en cette qualit\u00e9 \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration du ch. 23, malgr\u00e9 qu'elle soit une corporation \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Mais on oppose encore une autre raison \u00e0 son application dans le cas actuel, c'est la difficult\u00e9 d'atteindre les d\u00e9biteurs et contributaires de la compagnie r\u00e9sidant en pays \u00e9tranger, et la difficult\u00e9 de mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution plusieurs de ses dispositions contre une compagnie \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Ainsi la section 19 ordonnant de cesser, \u00e0 dater de l'ordre de mise en liquidation, toutes op\u00e9rations et transferts d'actions ne pourrait \u00eatre mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution dans le cas d'une compagnie dont le bureau de direction est \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger, non plus que la section 38 mettant fin, dans ce cas, au pouvoir des directeurs. Il serait sans doute difficile d'arriver \u00e0 une liquidation aussi compl\u00e8te et d\u00e9finitive que celle vis\u00e9e par la section 44. Mais est-ce une raison suffisante pour emp\u00eacher les cr\u00e9anciers d'exercer leurs droits sur tous les biens poss\u00e9d\u00e9s dans le pays par cette compagnie. Celle dont il s'agit, quoiqu'elle ait son bureau en Angleterre, ne semble pas poss\u00e9der d'autres biens mobiliers ou immobiliers que ceux qu'elle a dans la Nouvelle-Ecosse. Pourquoi dans ce cas les cr\u00e9anciers ne pourraient-il pas se pr\u00e9valoir des dispositions de l'acte qui sont suffisantes pour faire ordonner la vente et la distribution de tous ces biens? On pourrait ne pas arriver, il est vrai, \u00e0 une liquidation aussi compl\u00e8te que celle qu'exige l'acte imp\u00e9rial avant que la dissolution d'une corporation en liquidation puisse \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e. Mais comme notre statut a pour objet la liquidation des corporations insolvables, et non leur dissolution dont il ne parle pas, cette liquidation compl\u00e8te n'est pas aussi n\u00e9cessaire en vertu de notre acte qu'en vertu de l'acte imp\u00e9rial. Les cr\u00e9anciers n'ont aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l'annulation de la charte; ce qu'ils recherchent avant tout, c'est d'exercer leurs droits sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s les plus facilement r\u00e9alisables de la compagnie. Quoiqu'il y ait \u00e0 cela des difficult\u00e9s s\u00e9rieuses, je n'y vois cependant pas d'impossibilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale. Je partage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard l'opinion de l'honorable juge Thompson qui, apr\u00e8s avoir signal\u00e9 toutes les difficult\u00e9s, n'a pu s'emp\u00eacher d'en venir \u00e0 la conclusion suivante:\nThey would present to my mind insuperable obstacles against adopting the view that Parliament intended the Act to apply to foreign companies if it were not for this fact. The same difficulties exist in England in applying the winding up provisions of the English Companies Act of 1862, to a foreign company, and yet, by a succession of decisions the English Courts have held that these provisions do apply to foreign companies, provided such companies carry on business in England, or have their management there. The provisions which suggest these difficulties are there worked out as nearly as may be in all such cases, or left not worked out at all, according to the exigencies of the case that may be in hand.\nPuisque les difficult\u00e9s sont les m\u00eames dans l'application de l'acte imp\u00e9rial, je crois que nous devons les surmonter en adoptant le mode suivi par les tribunaux anglais. D'ailleurs, les difficult\u00e9s sont de nature \u00e0 ne pouvoir \u00eatre surmont\u00e9es par la l\u00e9gislation. On n'en a fait dispara\u00eetre aucune en d\u00e9clarant par l'amendement que le ch. 23 comprendrait les compagnies \u00e9trang\u00e8res. Notre parlement, pas plus que celui d'Angleterre, ne peut atteindre le d\u00e9biteur ou contributaire \u00e9tranger par les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives; et les jugements des tribunaux d'Angleterre ne sont pas plus faciles \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger que ceux de nos cours. Dans un cas comme dans l'autre ils ne re\u00e7oivent d'ex\u00e9cution que conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de la courtoisie internationale. Puisque l'acte d'amendement n'a pu, et qu'aucun acte l\u00e9gislatif ne peut, faire dispara\u00eetre ces difficult\u00e9s, il faut donc se contenter d'ex\u00e9cuter notre acte qu'autant que la nature de ses dispositions le permet. C'est l'opinion que l'hon. juge Rigby a exprim\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re suivante.\nIf a foreign corporation carries on business in this country through an agent or otherwise it seems to be not more unreasonable to hold that such corporation was amenable to our insolvent laws than a foreign individual trader under the same circumstances. Even if the effect of a winding up order in the case before us would be nothing more than to enable the liquidator to take possession of, realize and distribute the assets of the Company within the jurisdiction of the Canadian Courts; that alone would be sufficient in my opinion to justify us in putting the Act in operation, but I cannot see why the liquidator could not go to England and by the aid of the English Courts collect the calls which by Sec. 38 of \"The Companies' Act, 1862,\" (under which Act this Company was incorporated,[14] form an asset of the company and release the other assets of the corporation within their jurisdiction, just as could be done by the Canadian assignee of an Insolvent Englishman who had traded in Canada.\nC'est aussi celle que je crois devoir adopter. Comme les deux honorables juges dont j'ai cit\u00e9 l'opinion, je crois que notre statut 45 Vic., ch. 28, est applicable aux corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res et que pour surmonter les difficult\u00e9s de son application \u00e0 ces corporations, on doit adopter les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux anglais qui ont eu \u00e0 vaincre les m\u00eames difficult\u00e9s dans l'application des Winding Up Acts of 1862-67, aux corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res.\nDans tous les cas la compagnie en question ne peut soustraire ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration des lois de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, parce que son existence a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue par un acte de la l\u00e9gislature de cette province qui l'a autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir et poss\u00e9der des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans les limites de sa juridiction. Cette reconnaissance de son existence par la l\u00e9gislature a pour effet de soumettre ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l'effet des lois de la Nouvelle-Ecosse et nullement \u00e0 celles du lieu de son incorporation qui dans ce cas serait celles d'Angleterre. Ce principe qui ne saurait \u00eatre mis en doute est exprim\u00e9 par Thring on Joint Stock Cos.[15].\nIt (a company) may possess property in foreign countries, but it has no legal existence in such countries, unless it is recognised by the proper authorities, and when so recognised, it holds its property in subjection to the law of the country where the property lies, and not to the law of the country where the company resides. Pour ces raisons je suis d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the true construction of ch. 28 of 45 Vic. is that it was intended to apply only to local companies.\nI cannot think the legislature intended to confer any jurisdiction upon any court to do that which the court would have no power to do.\nThe company in this case is incorporated under the Imperial Joint Stock Companies Acts of 1862 and 1867, and the rights of the creditors of that company depend upon that charter, and the shareholders hold their stock under the terms of the Imperial statute, and they can only be called upon to pay for their shares by the board of directors, or, in case of liquidation, by order of a court; and, if so, how can this court, or any other in the Dominion, have authority to make further calls on these shareholders? These parties enter into a partnership under the articles of the Imperial statute, but our statute would come in and say \"you shall not be amenable to these articles, the terms of your contract shall be changed and your liabilities extended, and instead of the winding up taking place under the English Act, according to the contract, such winding up shall take place under a Dominion Act, making other provisions.\"\nI entirely agree with the observations of my brother Strong when he questions the power of the Dominion to pass a law affecting the rights of shareholders of a company incorporated under the Imperial statute, for the very moment the registration of the articles of a co-partnership takes place the law in England is applicable to every transaction of a company until it is finally wound up. But we are told this is the law of the land and that parliament is supreme over all the subject matter over which it has control, but I take the ground as part of my judgment in this case, that if the provisions of a Dominion statute (as in this case) contravene an English statute regulating an English incorporated company, such provisions would be ultra vires\u2014and that appeared to me to be the difficulty when the Dominion Parliament undertook to deal with this subjec-tmatter. To say that a company organized in England, such as the Bank of British North America, doing business in England, in Canada and elsewhere, with an immense capital, can be subject to a winding up order from a local judge or court, who shall declare who shall be contributories or not, seems to me extraordinary, and I say it is assuming a strong power which I cannot adjudge to exist. Then is it to be concluded that parliament intended to make provision for an act to be done when the requisite authority cannot be given to perform it, when such intention is not conveyed in express terms. Suppose a company has assets in England, what power has a court in the Dominion or a liquidator to order them to be realized, and if I have not the power to wind up all the estate, I have no power at all. If a call should be made upon the shareholders of a company registered in England under an order of a court in this country, could such call be enforced? Would not the shareholder very properly invoke the statutes in England as the only ones binding on him? That would at once bring the legislative power of the two countries into contact, and it is quite unnecessary to say which must prevail. It is possible that a company chartered in the United States or other foreign country doing business here might be wound up under the Dominion Act, if such could be done without interfering with the terms of the constating articles, but I see serious difficulties in the way, even in such a case; but to wind up a company chartered by registry of articles of association in England under the statute, I think to be beyond the legislative power of the Dominion to provide for. I, therefore, am of opinion that the court in this case had no power to take the procedure it did, and that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., was also of opinion to allow appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: J.

S., together with certain running powers over the trunk line of the Intercolonial, was leased to the suppliants for the period of 21 years from 1st January, 1872. The suppliants under said agreement went into possession of said Windsor Branch and operated the same thereunder up to the 1st August. 1877, on which date C. J. B., being and acting as Superintendent of Railways, as authorized by the Government, (who claimed to have authority under an Act of the Parliament of Canada, 37 Vic., ch. 16, passed with reference to the Windsor Branch, to transfer the same to the Western Counties Railway Company otherwise than subject to the rights of the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company,) ejected suppliants from and prevented them from using said Windsor Branch and from passing over the said trunk line; and four or five weeks afterwards said Government gave over the possession of said Windsor Branch to the Western Counties Railway Company, who took and retained possession thereof. In a suit brought by the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company against the Western Counties Railway Company for recovery of possession, &c., the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that 37 Vic., ch. 16, did not extinguish the right and interest which the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company had in the Windsor Branch under the agreement of 22nd September, 1872.\nOn a petition of right being filed by suppliants, claiming indemnity for the damage sustained by the breach and failure on the part of the Crown to perform the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, the Exchequer Court of Canada, (Gwynne, J., presiding,) held that the taking the possession of the road by an officer of the Crown under the assumed authority of an act of parliament was a tortious act for which a petition of right did not lie.\nHeld,\u2014On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, (Strong and Gwynne, JJ., dissenting,)\u2014The Crown by the answer of the Attorney General did not set up any tortious act for which the Crown claimed not to be liable, but alleged that it had a right to put an end to the contract and did so, and that the action of the Crown and its officers being lawful and not tortious they were justified. But, as the agreement was still a continuous, valid and binding agreement to which they had no right to put an end, this defence failed. Therefore the Crown, by its officers, having acted on a misconception of or misinformation as to the rights of the Crown, and wrongfully, because contrary to the express and implied stipulations of their agreement, but not tortiously in law, evicted the suppliants, and so, though unconscious of the wrong, by such breach become possessed of the suppliants property, the petition of right would lie for the restitution of such property and for damages.\nPrior to the filing of the petition of right, the suppliants sued the Western Counties Railway Company for the recovery of the possession of the Windsor Branch, and also by way of damages for monies received by the Western Counties Railway Company for the freight or passengers on said railway since the same came into their possession, and obtained judgment for the same, but were not paid. The judgment in question was not pleaded by the Crown, but was proved on the hearing by the record in the Supreme Court of Canada, to which Court an appeal in said cause had been taken and which affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nHeld, Per Ritchie, C.J., and Taschereau, J.\u2014That the suppliants could not recover against the Crown, as damages, for breach of contract, what they claimed and had judgment for as damages for a tort committed by the Western Counties Railway Company, and in this case there was no necessity to plead the judgment.\nPer Fournier and Henry, JJ., that the suppliants were entitled to damages for the time they were by the action of the Government deprived of the possession and use of the road to the date of the filing of their petition of right.\nAPPEAL to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, in the Exchequer Court of Canada, in favour of Her Majesty the Queen.\nThe suppliants are a company incorporated by an act of the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia, and owners of a line of railway running from Windsor to Annapolis in that province.\nOn the 22nd day September, 1871, an agreement was entered into between the Government of the Dominion of Canada and the suppliants, whereby the Windsor Branch Railroad, extending from Windsor Junction, on the Intercolonial Railway, to the suppliants' railroad at Windsor aforesaid, together with running powers over the trunk line of the said Intercolonial Railway, to and from Halifax, were leased to suppliants for the period of twenty-one years from the 1st January, 1872.\nThe suppliants, under said agreement, went into possession of said Windsor Branch and operated the same thereunder up to the 1st day of August, 1877, on which date Charles J. Brydges, being and acting as Superintendent of Government Railways, and acting for the Government of Canada, ejected suppliants from and prevented them from using said Windsor Branch and from passing over the said trunk line; and shortly afterwards said government gave over the possession of said Windsor Branch to the defendants, the Western Counties Railway Company, who took and retained possession thereof.\nUnder the proceedings taken the suppliants sought to recover from Her Majesty the Queen damages for the said breach of the agreement of September 22nd, 1871.\nAfter answers had been put in on behalf of Her Majesty and the Western Counties Railway Company, respectively, evidence was adduced and an argument was had thereon in the Exchequer Court before Mr. Justice Gwynne, and judgment given in favor of Her Majesty, with costs, as follows:\u2014\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\n\"This is a petition of right wherein the suppliants claim relief against Her Majesty in respect of the same matter as was the subject of complaint in a bill filed by the suppliants, as plaintiffs, against the Western Counties Railway Company, as defendants, in the Supreme Court of the Province of Nova Scotia, and decided in favor of the plaintiffs, and carried from thence by appeal to the Privy Council, where the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has been confirmed and is reported in L. Rep. 7 App. Cases 178. Upon the hearing of the case before me, the only points raised and discussed were: Whether proceedings by petition of right could be taken against Her Majesty to obtain satisfaction in damages for the pecuniary losses alleged to have been sustained by the suppliants by reason of the conduct which is the subject of the suppliants' complaint, and, if a petition of right does lie in such a case, what is the proper and reasonable amount which is recoverable by them from Her Majesty under the circumstances and for which judgment should be rendered in this case.\n\"The petition alleges that the suppliants are a company incorporated by an Act of the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia, passed prior to the passing of the British North America Act, for the purpose of constructing a railway from Windsor to Annapolis, in the Province of Nova Scotia, under the provisions of the said Act, and of an agreement of the 22nd November, 1866, therein recited, and incorporated into and made part of the said Act, whereby among other things it was provided that prior to the opening of the railroad a traffic arrangement should be made between the suppliants and the Provincial Government for the mutual use and enjoyment of their respective lines of railway between Halifax and Windsor and Windsor and Annapolis, including running powers, or for the joint operations thereof on equitable terms, to be settled by two arbitrators to be chosen by the said parties in the usual way in case of difference. That the suppliants, in pursuance and exercise of the powers vested in them by the Act, completed the said railway from Windsor to Annapolis, with a junction at Windsor communicating with a railway called the Windsor Branch Line and thereby with another railway called the Trunk Line into Halifax, both of these last mentioned lines being sections of the provincial railways, afterwards known as the Nova Scotia Railway, which at the time of passing the said Act was the property of the Government of Nova Scotia and so continued, subject to the rights claimed by the suppliants therein, until the 1st July, 1867, when by operation of the provisions of the British North America Act the said railway lines so far as they were the property of the Province of Nova Scotia, and subject to the rights of the suppliants therein, became the property of Canada. That an agreement between the Government of the Dominion of Canada, acting therein by the Minister of Public Works, under the authority and sanction of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, and the suppliants was, upon the 22nd day of September, 1871, entered into making provision for the use by the suppliants of the Windsor and Branch Trunk Line upon certain terms therein provided, by which agreement it was provided that the same should take effect on the first day of January, 1872, and continue for 21 years, and be then renewed upon like conditions as in the said agreement mentioned or upon such other conditions as might be mutually agreed upon. That in pursuance of such agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, and upon the 1st of January, 1872, the Government of Canada delivered to the suppliants, and they thereupon entered into the exclusive use and possession of the said branch line, with the stations, etc., in use thereon, subject, however, to the right of the Dominion Government to have access thereto for the purpose of maintaining the railway and works as provided in the said agreement, and the government likewise gave to the suppliants, and they thereupon took and exercised such use of the said trunk line and the accommodation specified in connection therewith in Article 3 of the said agreement of the 22nd of September, 1871, as they were under such agreement entitled to have and exercise; and that from the time when such use and possession of the said premises respectively were so given to them as aforesaid the suppliants continued to hold and enjoy the same and to work and operate their own railway line from Windsor to Annapolis, and the said branch and trunk lines from Windsor to Halifax until the first day of August, 1877, The petition then alleges, and herein is involved the gist and gravamen of the suppliants' complaint, that on day, namely, the 1st day of August, 1877, one Charles John Brydges, then being, and acting as, the superintendent of Government Railways, and acting on behalf of the Government of Canada, forcibly ejected the suppliants and their servants and railway stock from, and afterwards forcibly prevented them from coming upon or using or passing over the said trunk and branch lines, and he continued in possession thereof, and to prevent your suppliants from coming upon or using or passing over either of such lines, until shortly afterwards the said Government gave over the possession of the said Branch Line to another railway company, known as the Western Counties Railway Company, incorporated under an Act of the Legislature of Nova Scotia for the purpose of making a railway from Annapolis to Yarmouth in Nova Scotia, and that such company thereupon took and has ever since held possession of, and excluded the suppliants from, and from any use of the said Branch Railway, and that the said government have continued to the present time in possession of the said Trunk Line and to exclude the suppliants therefrom and from any use thereof. That by being so expelled and excluded as aforesaid the suppliants have been prevented from further performing their obligations or exercising the powers and privileges undertaken by and required of them under the said agreement of the 22nd of September, 1871, of operating and using the said Trunk and Branch Lines from Halifax to Windsor in connection with their own line from Windsor to Annapolis, and that save in so far as they have been so prevented by the said government from so doing the suppliants have duly operated the said railways and done and performed all other acts and conditions required to be done and performed on their part under and in respect of the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871. The petition then states the passing of an Act of the Parliament of Canada, 37 Vic., ch. 16, for the purpose of raising the contention that it did not profess to give any authority to the Government of Canada to transfer the said branch railway to the Western Counties Railway Company otherwise than subject to the suppliants said rights, and that if the said act did purport so to do it was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada and inoperative. The petition further alleged that by the acts so committed by the Government of Canada as aforesaid in forcibly expelling and excluding the suppliants, and by their breach of and failure to perform the said agreement of the 22nd of September, 1871, they had caused to the suppliants great injury, loss and damage, and the suppliants submitted that they had no effectual remedy in the premises against Her Majesty's government but by petition of right, but that they had been advised that they are entitled to recover possession of the said Branch Line from the Western Counties Railway Company, and that they had accordingly commenced a suit against them for the purpose in the Supreme Court of Equity in Nova Scotia; and the suppliants, among other things, prayed that the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, or such sum as might be reasonable, might be paid to them in compensation and by way of damages for the breach and losses occasioned to them by the breach and failure of the Government of Canada to perform the said agreement of the 22nd of September, 1871.\n\"The judgment of the Privy Council, on the appeal of the Western Counties Railway Company from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in the suit in Equity brought against that company by the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company, has established that the latter company had a good title to the possession of the Windsor Branch Railway under the agreement entered into with them by the Government of Canada, dated the 22nd day of September, 1871, and the result of the success of the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company in that suit has been to restore to them the possession of that branch railway from which they had been wrongfully evicted. The judgment has further decided that the agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, was an implement of the obligation to make a traffic arrangement which was contained in the agreement of November, 1866, and which was incorporated into and made part of the act incorporating the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company. The Government of Canada therefore, which by the British North America Act became owners of the Windsor Branch Railway, subject to the rights and interest of the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company therein, under the agreement of November, 1866, and their act of incorporation, specifically performed the agreement entered into with the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company by the government of the old Province of Nova Scotia prior to Confederation and perfected the title of that company to the use, possession and enjoyment of the Windsor Branch Railway, under the agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, for the term of 21 years from the 1st day of January, 1872, unless that term should sooner become forfeited or extinguished by due process of law or determined by contract between the parties. The judgment of the Privy Council also determined that the Dominion Act 37 Vic., ch. 16, did not extinguish the right and interest which the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company had in the Windsor Branch Railway under the agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, even if the Dominion had under the circumstances power so to do, a point which is not determined.\n\"The consequence is that at the time of the committal of the acts of trespass complained of by the suppliants, and which are made the foundation of the claim for indemnity in damages relied upon in this petition of right, the suppliants had full statutory right and title to maintain their possession of the Windsor Branch Railway, and had therefore ample power in the law, and the same power as all other owners of property have, to protect themselves against the wrongful acts of all persons whomsoever, whether such persons assumed to act in an official capacity as servants or agents to the Dominion Government or otherwise; the act therefore alleged to have been committed by Mr. Brydges, although he was invested with the character of superintendent of Government Railways, was, as indeed it is upon this petition charged to have been, a plain act of trespass for which he was liable to an action, so likewise the Western Counties Railway Company upon their entering and taking possession were equally wrongdoers, and as such responsible to the suppliants, and liable to indemnify them in damages for the injury which the latter thereby sustained, and they have been adjudged so to be by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, which judgment has been affirmed by the Privy Council. Now what is sought to be obtained by this petition of right in addition to restitution of the property is merely compensation in damages to be paid by Her Majesty for the trespass and eviction so committed by persons acting under the authority of the Government of Canada, or professing so to do, in taking possession of the Windsor Branch Company, evicting the suppliants from the possession thereof and putting the Western Counties Railway Company into possession thereof, and for the mesne profits received by the Western Counties Railway Company during their possession. For the damages sustained by the suppliants by this trespass and eviction, the judgment recovered by the suppliants as plaintiffs against the Western Counties Railway Company renders that Company responsible, but the suppliants nevertheless claim the right to recover the same damages by a judgment to be rendered against Her Majesty upon the petition of right.\n\"To this petition the Western Counties Railway Company have been made parties under the provisions of the 6th section of the Dominion statute, 39 Vic., ch. 27, which is similar in its terms to the 5th section of the Imperial statute 23rd and 24th Vic., ch. 84, and the company have filed a statement in defence under the provisions of the statute, whereby they assert title to the property in dispute upon the same grounds as were unsuccessfully urged by them in the suit brought against them in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that is to say, under the provisions of an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 37 Vic., ch. 16. Her Majesty's Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada has also under the provisions of the statute 39 Vic., ch. 27, filed an answer to the suppliants' petition, wherein, while admitting the agreement of the 22nd November, 1866, referred to in the petition, and the execution of the instrument of the 22nd September, 1871, disputing however its validity and effect, and setting up a resolution of the House of Commons and certain resolutions passed by His Excellency the Governor-General in Council upon certain reports of the Minister of Public Works relating to the property in question, and setting up also the Dominion Act 37 Vic., ch. 16, proceeds to say in the 12th paragraph of such answer\u2014that on or about the 25th July, 1877, the Government of Canada having completed arrangements with the Western Counties Railway Company for giving to them possession of the said branch, a minute of His Excellency the Governor General in Council was passed ordering and directing that the arrangements then existing with the suppliants with respect to the said branch should be terminated on the 1st day of August, 1877, and the Minister of Public Works on behalf of Her Majesty was directed to resume possession of the said branch on that day and to put the Western Counties Railway Company in possession thereof, pursuant to the said Act 37 Vic., ch. 16.\n\"That in pursuance of the said minute of council and of the said act the officers of Her Majesty did on or about the said first day of August, upon the refusal of the suppliants to give up the possession of the said branch, take possession thereof and afterwards gave possession of the same to the Western Counties Railway Company, which is the ejection and giving over of possession complained of in the fifth paragraph of the said petition.\n\"And he submitted (14th) that in taking possession of the said branch, in giving over such possession to the Western Counties Railway Company, no wrong was committed against the suppliants which entitles them to any relief against Her Majesty by petition of right; and he denied (15th) that the suppliants were excluded by the government from the trunk line between Halifax and Windsor or from any use thereof, but he submitted that no relief could be decreed against Her Majesty upon the said petition with respect to the said trunk line, inasmuch as the instrument of the 22nd September, 1871, upon which the suppliants base their claim to relief, if ever binding, was based upon a single and indivisible consideration, viz: One-third of the gross earnings from all traffic carried over the Windsor Branch and the Trunk Line; and that if the said instrument cannot, and he submitted that it cannot, under the circumstances referred to in his answer, be enforced with respect to the said branch, neither can it be enforced with respect to the Trunk Line; and submitted (16) that the relief prayed for in the first and second paragraphs of the prayer of said petition cannot be decreed against Her Majesty, nor can any injunction for the purposes prayed for be ordered by the court; and he submitted, lastly, that it should be declared that the suppliants are not entitled to any portion of the relief sought by their petition and that they should be ordered to pay the costs incurred by Her Majesty in the matter.\n\"Now the case of Tobin v. The Queen[1], decides that the Imperial statute 23rd and 24th Vic., ch. 34, alters only the form of procedure to be adopted by suppliants resorting to petition of right, and does not alter the laws relating to the subject for which the petition can be maintained.\n\"The Attorney General in that case, the present Lord Selborne, argued that the proceeding authorized by the statute, requiring a party in possession under title derived from the Crown of property claimed by a petition of right to be made a party thereto, was in the nature of bill of interpleader, wherein the party claiming the right to the possession and the party in actual possession can assert their respective rights.\n\"The case which has been already decided in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and in the Privy Council at the suit of the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company against the Western Counties Railway Company, has decided that the right of former company to the possession of the property in question could as against the latter company be effectually adjudicated upon and determined in a suit instituted and conducted according to the ordinary practice of the courts of justice between subject and subject; and that redress can be thus obtained against the Western Counties Railway Company for the wrongs complained of by the suppliants, and the damages occasioned to them thereby. It was not suggested upon the hearing before me of this petition of right, that the judgment rendered in that case was not sufficient for the purpose of establishing as against the Crown the rights of the suppliants to the restitution and possession of the property under the agreement of the 22nd of September, 1871. It seemed rather to have been assumed to be sufficient for that purpose; for the only question, as I have already said, which was opened and discussed before me was as to the right of the suppliants to have a judgment in this case for the recovery from Her Majesty of the damages occasioned to the suppliants by the wrongs complained of.\n\"The case of Tobin v. The Queen establishes that a petition of right cannot be maintained to recover unliquidated damages for a tort.\n\"It does lie to obtain restitution of property wrongfully taken on behalf of the crown, or wrongfully withheld, but the judgment in favor of the suppliant upon such a petition only enabled him to recover possession of the specific property, or the value of it if it had been converted to the Sovereign's use. As against the Sovereign, the only redress to be obtained is restitution. If damages are sought they are to be obtained from the individual who did the wrong. In the present case the suppliants have already obtained a judgment against the Western Counties Railway Company entitling them to an account of the receipt from traffic, which but for their wrongful possession of the suppliants' property the latter would have received, and this was the nature of the damages claimed before me, but there is no pretence that any sum of money from such source ever came to the possession of Her Majesty.\n\"The case made by the petition is that what was done, although professed to be done under the authority of an Act of Parliament, was not authorized by the Act, and was in fact a trespass unlawfully and forcibly committed: now when public servants of whatever rank commit an act of trespass in the erroneous belief that the act is authorized by an Act of Parliament, Tobin v. The Queen is an express authority that the Sovereign cannot be made responsible on a petition of right for such an act for two reasons: 1st. because in such case the act is not done by command of the Sovereign but under the assumed authority of an Act of Parliament; and 2nd, if it were done by command of the Sovereign, the command to commit a trespass being unlawful, it is no command in law, so that, as is decided in that case, the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply to the Sovereign. I have no doubt therefore that under the circumstances which are relied upon by the suppliants a petition of right could not be maintained in England to recover damages from Her Majesty, and that therefore by the express provisions of the Act. 32 Vic., ch. 27, sec. 19, no damages can be recovered against Her Majesty upon this petition In so far therefore as this petition claims compensation in damages from Her Majesty, the petition must be dismissed with costs, leaving the suppliants to pursue their remedy for such compensation against the Western Counties Railway Company under their judgment already recovered against that company.\n\"If the suppliants think it necessary that they should have a declaration of their rights, upon the petition, upon the basis upon which they have been established by the judgment in the suit in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirmed by the Privy Council, the case may be set down to be spoken to before me upon the minutes. As the question of damages was all that was opened or discussed before me, I have confined my judgment to that question.\"\nThis appeal was from the refusal of Mr. Justice Gwynne to grant a rule for a new trial.\nThe case in appeal was first argued before five judges, Mr. Justice Taschereau being absent, but was subsequently re-argued before the full bench.\nMr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., and Mr. H. McD. Henry Q.C., for appellants:\nThe acts complained of are distinctly admitted to have been done by Her Majesty, and therefore the argument need not be complicated by any questions as to the responsibility of the Sovereign for acts of her servants.\nThese acts must be regarded as constituting a breach of contract and not as a \"mere tort,\" or indeed as a tort in any sense; not a \"mere tort,\" because a breach of contract was also effected; and not a tort at all, seeing that since the \"Queen can do no wrong\" what was done must be regarded as a breach of contract only.\nThere is no decided case nor any authority for the position (involved in the judgment appealed from) that the act or acts complained of are to be regarded as wrongs properly so-called. In other words, there is no authority for the position that where a clear and direct breach of contract happens also to involve an element which in some respects might be regarded as tortious, the Crown shall be protected in its breach of agreement by the maxim that \"the Queen can do no wrong;\" and it is further submitted that there is no good reason why such a result should follow.\nThe theory of the judgment appealed from in this behalf involves the anomalous result that, while petition might lie if the Queen had simply refused to let the suppliants into possession under their agreement, yet they are remediless where, after being in possession for a time, they are, in breach of the agreement, prevented from continuing that possession.\nBut even if the expulsion from the Windsor Branch could, upon true principles, be regarded as a \"mere tort,\" the refusal of Her Majesty to execute her part of the contract as to the running powers over the Trunk Line can be nothing but a breach of contract. In that there was no trespass, no invasion of property right. There was in law nothing but a refusal to perform Her Majesty's part of the agreement in that behalf.\nIt is a mere coincidence that Her Majesty, in breaking the agreement, did what might have been characterized as a tort if it had not been a breach of agreement.\nSo far as the present subject of discussion is concerned, the judgment appealed from is based on the case of Tobin v. The Queen[2].\nNow, the case of Tobin v. The Queen is distinguishable from the present in the following important particulars, and it cannot, therefore, govern the rights of the suppliants in this petition.\nIn Tobin v. The Queen there was no contract nor even a pretence of the existence of a contract, much less any breach of contract. The act complained of constituted nothing but a tort. It was not only unauthorized by the Crown, or any department of Government, but was expressly repudiated in the answer as being so unauthorized. The benefit to the Crown of the seizure was remotely contingent upon the vessel in question being condemned in the Admiralty Court, and that never occurred, so that nothing of the suppliants, or arising from his property, ever came to the Crown. In the present case, on the other hand, there was a breach by the Crown of a contract made with the Crown.\nHer Majesty has admitted in Her answer that the act which constitutes the breach of contract was done for Her.\nThe property in question was actually used by Her Majesty for nearly two months, the proceeds received by Her, and the rights and privileges of the suppliants were then let to third parties, who held them under and for the Crown, until they were restored to the suppliants.\nWith regard to the portion of the judgment appealed from, which suggests that redress for the suppliants is available against the Western Counties Company we submit it is erroneous for the following reasons:\n1st. Because in no view can the Western Counties Railway Company be held answerable for the loss to the suppliants represented by the period during which the Crown actually received the profits of the property in question, that is, from 1st August to 24th September, 1879.\n2nd. Because this case cannot be regarded merely as practically giving rise to an interpleader between the suppliants and the Western Counties Railway Company joined as claiming under the Crown, inasmuch as the claim is for compensation for a specific breach of a contract of the Crown, for part of which compensation, at least, the Western Counties Railway Company can in no view be held liable.\n3rd. No such defence has been pleaded, nor was any such defence urged at the trial of the petition.\n4th. No compensation has ever been decreed or recovered from the Western Counties Railway Company. This portion of the judgment appealed from would indeed appear to involve a mere speculation as to the effect of the equity suit brought in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the judgment in which still remains entirely without form, as will appear by reference thereto.\nOn the re-argument the following cases were cited: Rigby v. The Great Western Railway[3]; Manly v. St. Helens Canal and Railway Co.[4]; Wall v. The City of London Ry. Pro. Co.[5]; Wigsell v. The Corporation of the School for the Indigent Blind[6]; McMahon v. Field[7]; Taylor v. Dunbar[8]; Lock v. Furze[9]; Earl of Warwick v. Duke of Clarence[10]; Banker's Case[11]; The British Columbia and Vancouver's Island Spar, Lumber and Saw Mill Co. (Limited) v. Nettleship[12].\nMr. Lash, Q.C., for the respondent, Her Majesty's Attorney General:\nThe Petition of Right Act does not give to a suppliant any additional remedy against the Crown which would not have existed in England prior to the Imperial Act 23 and 24 Vic., ch. 34, but merely relates to the form of procedure, and in England the relief prayed for against the Crown in this matter could not have been granted upon a petition of right.\nThe petition in this matter in effect seeks to recover from the Crown damages for trespasses unlawfully and forcibly committed by servants of the Crown, contrary to the well established doctrines laid down in the case of Tobin v. The Queen[13]; McFarlane v. The Queen[14]; MacLeod v. The Queen[15]; and cases therein referred to.\nThe suppliant's rights to the possession of the property in question and to the damages for the wrongs complained of could have been established and adjudicated upon in a suit or suits instituted and conducted according to the ordinary practice of the courts of justice between subject and subject. And so far as relates to the connection of the Western Counties Railway Co'y with the matter, their rights were so established and adjudicated upon in the suit brought against that company. The only ground upon which judgment was or could have been given in the suppliants' favor in the last mentioned suit is that the acts complained of were torts, which rendered all persons concerned in them liable to the suppliants in unliquidated damages; such being the case, it follows, under the authorities above mentioned, that such acts cannot be relied on in support of a claim against the Crown by petition of right.\nThe petition of right, in addition to seeking damages, prays for specific performance of the agreement of 22nd September, 1871, and for an injunction to restrain Her Majesty's officers and servants from doing certain acts. No such relief can be given against the Crown.\n[The learned counsel relied principally upon the judgment of the Exchequer Court, and the reasons therefor given by Mr. Justice Gwynne, and on the re-argument cited Bird v. Randall[16]; Gosman, in re[17], and Woodfall on Landlord and Tenant[18].]\nMr. Gormully was present on behalf of the Western Counties Railway Company, but was not heard.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nIn discussing this question I am free to admit to the fullest extent the doctrine that a petition of right, founded on a tort in the legal sense of that term, cannot be entertained against the Crown, and also that the Crown cannot be prejudiced by the misconduct, laches, or negligence, of any of its officers, either with respect to the rights of persons or of property. But I think it clear that matters of contract and grant made on behalf of the Crown are within a class of subjects legally distinct from wrongs, such as those from which the Crown is exempt by reason of the maxim that the Crown can do no wrong, and, therefore, with all respect, it does not seem to me that Tobin v. The Queen[19], relied on by the learned judge in the Exchequer Court, is any authority for applying the maxim invoked to this case, the great distinction being that that was not a case of a claim against the Crown, for acting by its servant in the assertion of a supposed legal right, but it was a claim for compensation for a wrongful act done by a servant of the Crown in the supposed performance of his duty.\nOn the contrary, Erle, Chief Justice, at page 355, very clearly propounds a doctrine so consonant with common sense that I should long hesitate before repudiating it, viz.:\nThat claims founded on contracts and grants made on behalf of the Crown are within a class legally distinct from wrongs.\nSo in Seddon v. Senate[20]:\nLord Ellenborough, C. J., observed that the argument of the defendant's counsel, [which he repudiated,] went further; that the defendant having conveyed all interest in the subject-matter out of himself, the plaintiff had no remedy on the covenant, but only the same remedy as against any wrong-doer. That if one sold and covenanted to another an estate with the common covenants, and afterwards went on it to sport, the purchaser could not maintain covenant.\nLeBlanc, J., says:\nAnd that brings it to the question, whether, when it appears that the defendant had agreed to part with his whole interest in the medicines, and he does convey in terms large enough to cover his whole interest, the law will not imply a covenant that he shall not himself vend that for his own profit which he had agreed to sell and had sold to another; and it appears to me that the breach assigned against him in that respect is not like a mere tort committed by a stranger; but is a breach of that right which he had conveyed to another. He has done that which is the exercise of an assumed right over a subject-matter which he had before covenanted to convey and had conveyed to the plaintiff; and I also think that the manner in which that breach is assigned is not merely as in the case of a tort by a stranger, but as of a right conveyed to the plaintiff by the deed of the defendant.\nBayley, J., says:\nA covenant is nothing more than an agreement, in construing which we have only to look to the fair meaning of the parties to it; and if the agreement were in substance and effect that the defendant would sell and assign to the plaintiff the sole right of making and vending the medicine for his profit, and that the defendant would not interfere with him in making and vending it, that raises an implied covenant on the part of the defendant that he would not make and vend it; and if he do afterwards make and vend it, it is a breach of that implied covenant.\n* * * * * *\nIt appears, therefore, by the language of the third deed alone, that the defendant contacted with the plaintiff that he should have the sole exercise of the right of making and selling these medicines for his own benefit; and then the question is, whether the conduct of the defendant, in interfering with that right which he had before conveyed to the plaintiff, be not a breach of his covenant. As in Pomfret v. Ricroft[21] Twysden, J., (who differed from the rest of the court upon the case in judgment) agreed that the grant of a water course implies a covenant by the grantor not to disturb, by any act of his own, the grantee in the enjoyment of it; and, therefore, that a subsequent act of disturbance by the grantor in stopping the water course would give the grantee an action of covenant against him. And if one make a lease of a house and estovers, and afterwards cut down all the wood out of which the estovers were to be taken, the lessee shall have his remedy by action of covenant against him; it being a misfeasance in him to annul or avoid his grant. So in Russel v. Gulwel[22] it was agreed that if one make a lease of lands, reserving a right of way, or common, or other profit a prender, if the lessee disturb him in the enjoyment of the way, &c., covenant will lie for such disturbance. To apply the same principle to the present case: the defendant assigns by deed all his right, title, and interest in the making and vending of a certain medicine to the plaintiff, and afterwards he disturbs him in the enjoyment of it by making and selling it on his own account; that, therefore, is in breach of his covenant.\nLord Ellenborough, C.J., afterwards observed that no argument could be drawn from the opinion delivered by the court to authorize the extension of the doctrine to the wrongful act of a stranger.\nSo in Jones v. Hill[23], an action on the case in the nature of waste, which is an action founded on tort:\nThe declaration stated that the defendant held certain messuages, as tenant to the plaintiff, for the remainder of a term of years, upon a general condition to repair and leave the premises in as good plight and condition as the same were in when finished under the direction of a surveyor.\nBreach for not repairing during the term and yielding up the premises in much worse order than when the same were finished under the direction of the surveyor.\nLord Chief Justice Gibbs says:\nWhere there is an express stipulation or contract between two parties, this species of action is not maintainable, for such contract is a total waiver of tort, and it therefore ceases to bear the character of waste.\nThat a petition of right is the suitable and proper remedy for the subject, when by misinformation (as in this case) or inadvertence the Crown has been induced to invade the private rights of any of its subjects, or where the Crown has in its hands property to which the subject has a legal title, ancient and modern authorities, in my opinion, unquestionably establish.\nAs to the ancient authorities.\nPetition says Staundeforde, Prerog., is all the remedy the subject hath when the King seizeth his land or taketh away his goods from him, having no title by order of his laws so to do, in which case the subject for his remedy is driven to sue unto his sovereign lord by way of petition only; for, other remedy hath he not; and, therefore, is his petition called a petition of right, because of the right the subject hath against the King by the order of his laws to the thing he sueth for.\n* * * * * *\nThat petitions did lie for a chattel as well as for a freehold, does appear 37 Ass. pl. 11, Bro. Abr. Petition, 17. If tenant by statute, merchant be ousted, he may have a petition, and shall be restored; vide 9 H. 4, Bro. Petition, 9. If the subject be ousted of his term, he shall have his petition $ 9 H. 6, fo. 21, Bro. Petition, 2. Of a chattel real, a man shall have his petition of right, as of his freehold; 7 H. 7, fo. 11. A man shall have a petition of right for goods and chattels; and the king indorses it in the usual form: 34 H. 6, fo. 51. Bro. Petition, 3. He adds: It is said, indeed, [Illegible Text] H. 7, fo. 3, Bro. Petition, 19, that a petition will not lie of a chattel.\nThe whole tenor of Lord Somers' argument in the Banker's case shows that he was clearly of opinion that a petition of right would lie for a chattel, and even for unliquidated damages.\nIn 4 Ins. 241 Lord Coke says:\nIt is holden in our books that in restitutions the king himself has no favor nor his prerogative any exemption, but the party restored is favored.\nIn Manning's Exchequer practice[24], it is said:\nBy the law of England, no personal wrong can, for obvious reasons, be imputed to the sovereign. But, when the property of the subject is invaded or withheld, the prerogative does not prevent the injured party from obtaining restitution or payment. Where, however, a right is sought to be established against the crown itself, it would be absurd, as well as indecent, to adopt the mandatory forms of common process. The course, therefore, prescribed by the common law, is, to address a petition to the King in one of his courts of record, praying that the conflicting claims of the crown and the petitioner may be duly examined. * * * * * * *It is called a petition of right, and is in the nature of an action against the King, or of a writ of right for the party, though chattels real or personal, debts or unliquidated damages may be recovered under it.\nIn Blackstone's Commentaries, p. 254, it is said:\nThat the King can do no wrong, is a necessary and fundamental principle of the English constitution, meaning that, in the first place, whatever may be amiss in the conduct of public affairs is not chargeable personally on the Sovereign, nor is he, but his ministers, accountable for it to the people; and, secondly, that the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury; for, being created for the benefit of the people, it cannot be exerted to their prejudice. When ever, therefore, it happens, that, by misinformation or inadvertence, the crown hath been induced to invade the private rights of any of its subjects, though no action will lie against the sovereign (Jenkins, 78) (for, who shall command the King?) yet the law hath furnished the subject with a decent and respectful mode of removing that invasion, by informing the Crown of the true state of the matter in dispute; and, as it presumes, that to know of any injury and to redress it are inseparable in the royal breast, it then issues as of course, in the King's own name, his orders to his judges to do justice to the party aggrieved. * * * *\nThe common law methods of obtaining possession or restitution from the Crown of either real or personal property are:\u20141. By petition de droit, or petition of right, which is said to owe its origin to King Edward the First[25]; 2. By monstrans de droit, manifestation or plea of right; both of which may be preferred or prosecuted either in the Chancery or Exchequer. The former is of use where the Sovereign is in full possession of any hereditaments or chattels, and the petitioner suggests such a right as controverts the title of the Crown, grounded on facts disclosed in the petition itself; in which case he must be careful to state truly the whole title of the Crown, or otherwise the petition shall abate; and then, upon this answer being indorsed or underwritten by the king soit droit fait al partie (let right be done to the party), a commission shall issue to enquire of the the truth of this suggestion; after the return of which the king's attorney is at liberty to plead in bar, and the merits shall be determined upon issue or demurrer, as in suits between subject and subject.\nAs to the more modern authorities.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in Baron de Bodes case[26], Lord Denman says:\nThere is nothing to secure the Crown against committing the same species of wrong, unconscious and involuntary wrong, in respect of money, which founds the subject's right to sue out his petition when committed in respect to lands or specific chattels; and there is an unconquerable repugnance to the suggestion that the door ought to be closed against all redress or remedy for such wrong.\nErle, C.J., in Tobin v. The Queen, says:\nWe come now to the authorities showing where the petition of right will and where it will not He. We pass the class of claims founded on contracts and grants made on behalf of the Crown with brief notice, because they are within a class legally distinct from wrongs.\n* * * * *\nAgain:\nWe pass from the class of claims on contract, in all systems of law distinguished from claims founded on wrong, and proceed to the more numerous class of claims where petitions of right have been brought in respect of property either wrongfully taken on behalf of the Crown, or wrongfully withheld.\nAs a general principle, property does not pass from the subject to the Crown without matter of record. In the time of feudal tenures, rights in property accrued to the Crown on very many occasions, and officers had the duty of enforcing the rights of the Crown. The right accrued on some of these occasions by matters of record, and on other occasions powers existed for the making the right matter of record by office found. The officers seized, or justified seizures, under these records; and their right to seize was a subject of frequent contest, tried either by petitions of right, monstrans de droit, or traverse of office found.\nBut, whatever was the form of procedure, the substance seems always to have been the trial of the right of the subject as against the right of the Crown to property or an interest in property which had been seized for the Crown; and, if the subject succeeded, the judgment only enabled him to recover possession of that specified property, or the value thereof, if it had been converted to the King's use. The form for trying this question has gone through several changes. Traverse of office found, monstrans de droit, and petition of right were the forms in most frequent use. Amendments of the procedure were made by the statutes 34 E. 3, c. 14, 36 E. 3, c. 13, and 2 E. 4, allowing many questions to be raised by traverse, in cases where theretofore a petition of right was necessary; and much learned discussion is to be found in the books relating to these different forms. Lord Coke has much learning thereon, both in his commentary on the statutes of substituting traverse for petition[27], and in his judgment in the case of The Saddlers' Company[28]. In Conyngsby and Mallom's Case[29] all the judges gave separate judgments of much research, to the effect that a monstrans de droit was wrong in that case, and that the plaintiffs ought to have had a petition.\nIn Feather v. The Queen[30] Cockburn, C. J., says:\nHow can you distinguish between the seizure of goods by a servant of the Crown where it is admitted a petition of right lies and the improperly interfering with his liberty.\nAnd at page 293, Cockburn, C. J., delivering judgment of the court says:\nWe think it right to state that we can see no reason for dissenting from the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Common Pleas (in Tobin v. The Queen). We concur with that court in thinking that the only cases in which the petition of right is open to the subject are where the land, or goods, or money of a subject have ound their way into the possession of the Crown, and the purpose of the petition is to obtain restitution, or if restitution cannot be given compensation in money, or where a claim arises out of a contract as for goods supplied to the Crown or to the public service. * * * *\nIn considering this case let us start with the now unquestionable proposition that for breach of contract unliquidated damages can be recovered against the Grown by petition of right. This was clearly established in Thomas v. The Queen[31] in which Blackburn, J., thus states the principle:\nContracts can be made on behalf of Her Majesty with subjects, and the Attorney General suing on her behalf can enforce those contracts against the subjects, and if the subject has no means of enforcing the contract on his part there is certainly a want of reciprocity in such cases.\nThe controversy in this case has never, that I can discover, as between the Crown and the suppliants, been, whether its officer, who evicted the suppliants, was or was not guilty of a tort, and therefore the Crown on that ground not liable for his act; no such defence is set up by the answer of the Attorney General, nor any evidence offered on the part of the Crown in support of such a defence. It would appear to have been stated at the hearing in this case and adopted by this court, but in my opinion it is entirely opposed to the whole action of the Government and the line of defence on record, where the real substantial true matter in controversy between the suppliants and the Crown is clearly put forward by the Attorney General; the suppliants claiming that the contract of 22nd September, 1871, is valid and binding, in full force and effect, and under which they were by the agreement of the Crown entitled to the continuous enjoyment and possession of the Windsor Branch and running privileges over the trunk line from Windsor junction to Halifax for a period of 21 years from the 1st day of January, 1872, and that the Crown in breach of this agreement evicted the suppliants, took possession of the Windsor Branch and prevented them from exercising running powers over the trunk line. The Crown, on the contrary, contending that it had the legal right to put an end to the agreement, avers that it did so, and therefore the agreement, being thus terminated, the eviction and taking possession was lawful, and so no breach thereof.\nThe Crown, by the answer of the Attorney General, does not attempt to get rid of their liability by setting up that the act of taking possession and evicting the suppliants was a wrongful act of trespass by the manager of the railway, for which the Crown is not responsible; on the contrary, the Crown admits the doing of the act and justifies it on the ground that the legal right existed in the Crown to put an end to the contract and resume possession, and that a minute of the Governor in Council was passed ordering that the agreement with the suppliants should terminate on the 1st August, 1877, and directing the Minister of Public Works, on behalf of Her Majesty, to resume possession; in pursuance of which minute the officers of Her Majesty did, upon refusal of the suppliants to give up possession, take possession thereof and afterwards gave possession to the Western Counties Railway, which taking possession the Crown submits was no wrong committed against the suppliants. The words of the Attorney General's answer are as follows:\n11. I submit that the said instrument of 22nd June, 1875, was not and is not binding upon Her Majesty in so far as the same purported to confer upon the suppliants any rights with respect to the said branch other than such as were determinable by further order of the Governor in Council, and in so far as the same purported to confer upon the suppliants any right with respect to the said branch beyond the time when arrangements might be completed for giving possesssion thereof to the Western Counties Railway Company, as referred to in the second section of the said Act of May, 1874. I say that the insertion of any clause in said instrument of 22nd June 1875, purporting to confer upon the suppliants rights other than such as were determinable by further order of the Governor in Council was an error on the part of the person who prepared said instrument, and the same was signed by the said Minister of Public Works in error and without knowledge on his part that such clause was contained therein.\n12. I say that on or about the 25th of July, 1877, the Government of Canada, having completed arrangements with the Western Counties Railway Company for giving to them possession of the said branch, a minute of His Excellency the Governor General in Council was passed ordering and directing that \"the arrangements then existing \"with the suppliants with respect to the said branch should be terminated \"on the first day of August, 1877,\" and the Minister of Public Works on behalf of Her Majesty was directed to resume possession of the said branch on that day and to put the Western Counties Railway Company in possession thereof pursuant to said Act of May, 1874, all of which the suppliants had notice.\n13. In pursuance of the said minute of council and of the said act of 1874 the officers of Her Majesty did, on or about the said first of August, upon the refusal of the suppliants to give up possession of the said branch, take possession thereof and afterwards gave possession of the same to the Western Counties Railway Company, which is the ejection and giving over of possession complained of in the fifth paragraph of the said petition.\n14. I submit that in taking possession of the said branch, and in giving over such possession to the Western Counties Railway Company, no wrong was committed against the suppliants which entitles them to any relief against Her Majesty by petition of right.\nHere the Attorney General does not say the possession was taken by force, or in any way tortiously, no tortious act is set up for which the Crown claim not to be liable, but the exact opposite, The Attorney General puts forward that upon the construction of the agreement and the statutes bearing thereon, the Crown claims it had a right to put an end to the contract, and they did so, and claim that the action of the Crown and its officers being lawful and not tortious, they were justified, and, therefore, the suppliants are not entitled to claim damages. The Crown does not and never has repudiated the act of its officer, but the very reverse. The Courts, however, having decided that the ground taken by the Crown was not tenable in law, that the Crown was misinformed as to its supposed rights, that the agreement was still a continuous, valid and binding agreement to which they had no right to put an end, this defence entirely fails. And therefore the Crown by its officers having thus acted on a misconception of, or mis-information as to, the rights of the Crown, wrongfully, because contrary to the express and implied stipulations of their agreement, but not tortiously in law, evicted the suppliants, and so, though unconscious of the wrong, by such breach became possessed of the suppliants property, and for restitution of which and damages indemnity is now sought, and this is the only real substantial matter that I can discover in controversy in this petition.\nTo go outside of this agreement, of this litigation, and of this answer and defence of the Crown, and the legal decision on the rights of the parties, and declare this bon\u00e2 fide action of the Government, based on what the Government believed to be the true construction of the agreement and the just rights of the Crown to be nothing more nor less than a personal wrong, a simple act of trespass committed by Mr. Brydges, for which he and he only is legally responsible, conflicts, in my opinion, with every principle of law and justice. It must be admitted that the maxim that the Queen can do no wrong does not apply to breaches of contract entered into by the Crown. To turn, then, the deliberate and advised action of the Crown on its construction of this agreement into a simple tort by an officer of the Crown would be to make the maxim applicable to breaches of contract as well as torts, and in my humble opinion to enable a salutory prerogative to be used for the perpetration of the greatest injustice. In a proper case no one will be more ready or willing to uphold and maintain this maxim than I, as I have on several occasions shown in this Court, but to apply the maxim to a case such as this would, in my opinion, be wholly unjustifiable, and supported by no authority that I am aware of, the suppliants seeking compensation and indemnity for a simple breach of a contract which the Crown wholly independent of tort deemed it had a right to put an end to.\nWhat is then the true construction of this agreement, entered into between the Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company, limited, and the Government of Canada (approved and ratified by His Excellency the Governor General of Canada, in Council, on the 22nd day of September, A.D. 1871), and which provides inter alia, as follows:\u2014\n2. The Company (meaning the plaintiffs) shall expect, for the purpose of the authorities, (meaning the Government of Canada) in maintaining the railway and works have the exclusive use of the Windsor Branch, with all station accommodation, engine sheds and other conveniences (but not including rolling stock and tools for repairs) now in use thereon.\n3. The Company shall also use, to the extent required for its traffic, the trunk line with the station accommodation thereon, including engine shed accommodation for fire engines, water supply, fuel stages, turntables, signals, telegraphs, wharves, sidings and other conveniences, but not including machine shops and other shops, buildings and appliances for repairs of rolling stock.\n21. This agreement shall take effect on the 1st day of January, 1872, and continue for 21 years, and be then renewed on the same conditions or such other conditions as may be mutually agreed on.\nIt must be construed so as to make it operate according to the intention of the parties.\nI think the true construction of this agreement or grant is, and the clear intention of the parties as indicated thereby was, that the suppliants should have the full, beneficial and continuous enjoyment of the privileges thereby granted for a continuous period of 21 years, and that they should not be disturbed by the Crown in such enjoyment, and as a consequence, to enable the agreement to operate according to the intention of the parties, there is an implied undertaking on the part of the Crown not to do anything to derogate from its grant so to enjoy, the Crown, in my opinion, being no more entitled to act in derogation of its grant or to defeat its own act and not be liable for a breach of its agreement, expressed or implied, than a subject.\nIf parties agree that it shall be lawful for one to hold the other's property for a certain time, this is, on the one hand, an agreement that the owner shall not, during that time, interfere with such holding, and on the other, that the holder shall not detain it for a longer time, and in either case, if the one during the time interferes, or the other detains beyond the time specified, it is a breach of the covenant or agreement.\nIt cannot be denied that the Crown by this agreement contracted with the suppliants for, and granted to them, the continuous right. This, then, is a contract in which quiet enjoyment during the continuance of the agreement is necessarily implied as against the act of the Crown; in other words, that the Crown will do nothing in derogation of its grant, nor disturb the suppliants in the enjoyment of that which the Crown agreed they should have, and, therefore, any interference with the possession of suppliants by the Crown is a breach of the contract, express and implied, and in no way resembles a mere tort committed by a stranger.\nThe suppliants complaining, therefore, of no act of tort committed by the Crown or its servants, but simply in effect alleging that the Crown, on the assumption that the contract was at an end, evicted the suppliants and resumed possession of the road, and so broke the agreement with the suppliants by preventing them from having what they were entitled to under the agreement, and the Crown having thus come into possession of property belonging to the suppliants, they, by this their petition of right, seek to be restored to such possession and indemnified for the damages sustained by such breach on the part of the Crown, or, in the words of the petition: \"the Government of Canada by \"the breach and failure to perform the said agreement \"of 22nd September, 1871, and 22nd June, 1875, have \"caused to your suppliants great injury, loss and \"damage,\" for which they seek indemnity.\nI think the action of the Crown under the minute of the Governor in Council, amounts to no more than an eviction by a landlord, whose tenant has a covenant express or implied for quiet enjoyment, in other words, simply equivalent to an eviction where the lessee is ousted by the lessor, in which case it is clear an action of covenant lies against the lessor on the implied covenant in law upon the word \"demise.\" In this case we are not to look to the manner of the eviction, that is not the point in controversy, the right to evict is what we have to deal with, and therefore this case should be treated as if a copy of the minute of the Governor in Council, had been served on the suppliants and possession demanded thereon by the Crown, and the suppliants, knowing that they could not successfully or forcibly resist the action of the Crown, had, under protest, without requiring physical force to be used, permitted the Grown to resume possession, relying on their protest and contract; and as if now by legal means they sought restitution of the possession and redress and indemnity, for an alleged breach of their agreement, under which they were entitled as against the Crown to have the continuous possession and quiet enjoyment of the premises, for the period therein stipulated; and must not, as has been done, be treated as solely a question of tort committed by an officer of the Crown. This then appears to me to be peculiarly a case to which the petition of right is applicable. The Crown, acting in the assertion of its supposed rights, has broken its contract, by reason whereof property and the increase and proceeds of property belonging to the suppliants have found their way into the hands of the Crown to the detriment of the suppliants.\nIn the view taken adverse to suppliants' right to recover, in so dealing with the case there seems to me to be an entire ignoring of the privity of contract both express and implied between the suppliants and the Crown, and of the nature of claims on contract as distinguished from the class of claims founded on wrong, and also of the fact that the act done was under the authority of an order of the Governor in Council under a claim of right and in assertion of that right.\nThis act of the Government in endeavouring to put and end to the contract, or, in other words, to cease to continue it, was no act done with a tortious intent, it was an act which the Government deemed they had legal authority to perform, on the assumption that the contract was, by the legal act of the crown, at an end, and that the Government could, therefore, legally resume possession of the road. Neither the Government nor its officers entered, or professed to enter on or take possession of the road as trespassers, but under a claim of legal right; therefore neither the Crown nor its servants committed a tort in the legal sense of that term, or an act which can be set up as against the suppliants as a tort to defeat the claim of the suppliants on their contract; the crown, as Lord Denman expresses it, committed an unconscious and involuntary wrong, which, though not legal by reason of the contract being a continuous subsisting contract, was simply a breach of that contract. This taking possession under a claim of right, as opposed to a tortious taking by the officer has, as has been shown, never been repudiated by the crown, but, on the contrary, the Crown affirmed it in this suit and ask this court to affirm that, so far from the act of taking possession being tortious, it was lawful and right because the agreement was at an end. The crown treats it, and properly treats it, as a claim founded on contract and grant made on behalf of the Crown, which, Erle, C. J., says, are a class legally distinct from, wrongs. The possession taken on the part of the Crown was therefore nothing more than a claim of title.\nIf this is mere matter of tort for which a petition of right could not be brought, but an action would lie only against Mr. Brydges, who, it is alleged, committed the tort, if Mr. Brydges died this action would die with him, actio personails moritur cum person\u00e2; and it that the Crown, having no right to put an end to the agreement, and it being valid and binding on the Crown, could direct its servant to take possession, accept the possession obtained by the act of its servant, and so most effectually, not only break but put an end to the agreement, and, contrary to its terms, keep in its own possession the property of the suppliants (for it need not have handed the possession over to the Western Counties,) and receive the profits and emoluments of the road, which belonged not to the Crown but to the suppliants, and the suppliants be remediless in the premises, as would be the practical result of the decision in the Court of Exchequer, is, I think, a doctrine principles of law and justice will not tolerate. If this is to be treated simply as a matter of tort as between the suppliants and the Crown the same principle, I presume, must have effect as between party and party. Suppose then, A owned this road and entered into a similar agreement with B, and A, assuming, as did the Crown in this case, that the contract was at an end, when in fact and in law it was in full force and effect, entered and evicted as of right the grantee or lessee, and continued in possession and received the rents and profits and died, in an action against A's executors for breach of contract by the deceased in his lifetime would it be competent for them to reply, \"no \"action for indemnity or damages for breach of \"contract by deceased can be brought against us, for \"though true A did make this agreement and \"though true, on the assumption that the agreement \"was at an end, when in truth it was subsisting, \"he did, contrary to the agreement, enter \"and evict, and died, and though he has taken from you \"all the privileges, profits and advantages, which by \"his contract he agreed you should have, his doing \"so is no breach of the agreement; his entry \"eviction and resumption of possession was simply a \"tort, not a breach of his contract, and therefore the \"maxim actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2 applies, \"and so no action for such tortious act or its consequences \"can be maintained against us; therefore, \"as we have done nothing whatever since his death in \"connection with the property, you are remediless.\" This, in my humble opinion, is an exact illustration of the present case.\nI am pleased to think that in my view of the law I am not constrained to a conclusion, in my opinion, so unreasonable and unjust. These suppliants honestly contracted with the Government; there has been no breach of this agreement on their part that has not been satisfactorily arranged; it is not pretended that the suppliants have been guilty of any wrong whereby they have forfeited their rights under the agreement, or whereby they have debarred themselves from claiming the benefit of the contract. When the Crown therefore, disregarding the agreement, became possessed of that which, by virtue of the act of the Crown, had become the property of the suppliants, on no principle that I am aware of can relief be denied. Law, justice, common honesty, not to say the honor of the Crown alike demanded that there should be restitution of the property of the suppliants, and indemnity for the proceeds thereof which have come to the hands of the Crown, and of which the suppliants have been deprived by the wrongful, though unconsciously wrongful, act of the Crown.\nThis to my mind is peculiarly and emphatically a case in which one may, as Lord Denman did in Baron de Bodes' case declare an unconquerable repugnance to the suggestions that the door ought to be closed against all redress and remedy.\nHad there been no contract in this case, and the seizure of this property had been wrongfully made by the Crown officers and came to the possession of the Crown, then it may be questionable how far the suppliants could, beyond a judgment of restitution, obtain redress for unliquidated damages for the wrongful seizure.\nIn such a case it well may be that having obtained restitution from the Crown of the property wrongfully seized, if damages are sought they should be obtained, if at all, from the officer who did the wrong.\nMr. Justice Gwynne says:\nNow what is sought to be obtained by this Petition of Right, in addition to restitution of the property, is merely compensation in damages to be paid by Her Majesty for the trespass and eviction so committed by persons acting under the authority of the Government of Canada or professing so to do in taking possession of the Windsor Branch Railway, evicting the suppliants from the possession thereof and putting the Western Counties Railway Co. into possession thereof, and for the mesne profits received by the Western Counties Railway during their possession, For the damages sustained by the suppliants by this tresspass and eviction, the judgment recovered by the suppliants as plaintiffs against the Western Counties Railway Company renders that Company responsible, but the suppliants nevertheless claim the right to recover the same damages by a judgment to be rendered against Her Majesty upon the Petition of Right.\nBut this, I submit, is not so. How could the Western Railway be made responsible for the act of the Government in evicting and dispossessing the suppliants and for the resumption of possession by the crown, acts to which they were in no way parties? On the contrary, it appears from the case that the possession was taken on behalf of the Crown on the 1st August, and the road operated by the Crown from that period until the 24th September, and not till then was possession transferred to the Western Counties Railway. Who, but the Crown, can be liable for taking possession and keeping the suppliants out of possession, from the 1st August until 24th September? On what principle can the Crown be absolved from its liability, and the burthen of indemnifying suppliants cast on the Western Counties Railway Company, and so the suppliants bound to look to them instead of the crown for redress? Surely until the Western Counties Railway Company got the possession, in the absence of the slightest evidence to show that they had till then in any way interfered with the road, or the suppliants in connection with the possession thereof, they can in no way be made responsible.\nThen, again, with reference to the trunk line. The result of the decision of the Privy Council is that when the Government resumed possession of the Windsor Branch, and consequently excluded the suppliants from the use of the trunk line of railway from Halifax to its junction with the Windsor Branch line, suppliants had the unquestionable right and title to the possession of the Windsor Branch Railway, and the use of the trunk line. Now, as to the trunk line from Halifax to Windsor, there can be no doubt that the suppliants were excluded from enjoying the uses of this road, and yet there is no pretence that there was any tortious act by the Crown or any of its servants\u2014the suppliants, without any acts of force, were simply in defiance of their agreement excluded, and the reason assigned is thus put by Her Majesty's Attorney General in answer to suppliants' claim:\n15. I deny that the suppliants were excluded by the Government from the trunk line between Halifax and Windsor or from any use thereof, but I submit that no relief can be decreed against Her Majesty upon the said petition with respect to the said trunk line inasmuch as the instrument of 22nd September, 1871, upon which the suppliants base their claim to relief if ever binding was based upon a single and indivisible consideration, viz.: one-third of the gross earnings from all traffic carried over the Windsor branch and the trunk line, and if the said instrument cannot, as I submit it cannot, under the circumstances above referred to, be enforced with respect to the said branch, neither can it be enforced with respect to the trunk line.\nInasmuch as it has been decided that the instrument of 22nd September, 1871, is valid and binding, this defence necessarily fails. What answer is there to suppliant's claim as to this? Nothing whatever, that I can discover; and how can it be denied that the Crown was guilty of a breach of this portion of the agreement for which suppliants are entitled to an indemnity; and what had the Western Counties Railway to do in reference to this?\nBut while I have little difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that this was a proper case for a Petition of Right. I have had much difficulty as to the amount of damages to which the appellants are entitled.\nThe concluding prayer of suppliants in the suit of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway Co. v. The Western Counties Railway Co., is as follows: \u2014\n\"The plaintiffs also pray that the defendant company may be ordered and decreed to deliver up possession of the said Windsor Branch Railway to the plaintiffs, and that they may be restrained by order or injunction from this honorable court from further keeping possession of the said railway and running trains thereon, and that an account may be taken of the full amount of the moneys received by the defendant company for freight or passengers on said road since the same came into their possession. And that until a final decree shall be made in this suit a receiver shall be appointed by this honorable court to take and receive all moneys earned or to be earned by the defendant company or any other company or persons whomsoever. And that such further or other relief in the premises may be granted to the plaintiffs as shall be in accordance with justice and equity, and as to this honorable court shall seem expedient.\"\nOn which the judgment of the Judge in Equity was in their favor upon the whole case. A judgment subsequently sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and afterwards by the Privy Council on the appeal by the Western Counties Railway, and in this court on the appeal of the Attorney-General of Canada.\nThe suppliants having thus elected to sue the Western Counties Railway Company, not only for the recovery of the possession of the Windsor branch, but also by way of damages for the moneys received by the Western Counties Railway for the freight or passengers on said road since the same came into their possession, and having recovered judgment for the same, I, as at present advised, do not think they can now recover another judgment for the same moneys against the Crown and thus have two judgments\u2014one in contract against the Crown, and the other in tort against the Western Counties Railway, in two different courts for the same damages.\nIt is clear this action against the Western Counties Railway could only be against them as tort feasors, for it cannot be contended there was any contract or privity of contract between them and the suppliants for breach of which the suppliants could have an action. The suppliants then having elected to treat the dealings of the Western Counties Railway with the Windsor branch as a tort, and having recovered a judgment for such tort, suppose the officers of the Crown were (for the Crown could not be) joint tort feasors, the case of Rex v. Hoar[32] conclusively shows that after such judgment no action could be brought against such joint tort feasors.\nIf this is so it would seem necessarily to follow that the suppliants, having recovered judgment for all the damages sustained by reason of the tortious acts of the Western Counties Railway Company in reference to the property after it passed into their possession, the suppliants can only recover for the consequences of the breach of contract on the part of the Crown for the net freight and passage money which actually came to the hands of the Crown while the property was in the possession of and worked by the Crown, and that they cannot claim as damages for breach of contract what they claimed and had judgment for as damages for a tort committed by the Western Counties Railway, and which was proved on a hearing by the record in this court, which affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and which, affecting only the amount of damages in this case, did not require to be pleaded.\nBut wholly independent of and in addition to which it may be observed that had no action been brought against the Western Counties Railway Co., after the Crown passed the property over to the Western Counties Co., it is difficult to see how, for their occupation, a petition of right could be maintained. In such a case the cause of complaint against the Crown is removed or ceases, and the company, not the Crown, being in possession, they are in of wrong, and an action lies against them, and therefore no petition against the Crown, and this is very clearly put in Staumford's Exposition of the King's Prerogative, before referred to, at fol. 740, where it is said:\u2014\nAlso, whereas the king doth enter upon me, having no title by matter of record or otherwise, and put me out, and detains the possession from me, that I cannot have it again by entry without suit, I have then no remedy but only by petition. But if I be suffered to enter, my entry is lawful, and no intrusion. Or if the king grant over the lands to a stranger, then is my petition determined, and I may now enter or have my assise by order of the common law against the said stranger, being the king's patentee. When his Highness seizeth by his absolute power contrary to the order of his laws, although I have no remedy against him for it, but by petition, for the dignity's sake of his person, yet when the cause is removed and a common person hath the possession, then is my assise revived, for now the patentee entereth by his own wrong and intrusion, and not by any title that the king giveth him, for the king had never title nor possession to give in that case.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that we ought to dismiss this appeal for reasons which are substantially the same as those given by the learned judge before whom the Petition of Right was heard in the Exchequer Court.\nModern decisions have conclusively settled the law to be that the Crown cannot be made liable for wrongful acts committed by its officers to the prejudice of a subject.\nThis question was discussed with great learning and very fully considered by the Courts in the cases of Lord Canterbury v. The Attorney General[33], Tobin v. The Queen[34], and Feather v. The Queen[35], with the result mentioned, it being held that the doctrine of respondeat superior which in the case of a subject is applied to make a principal or master liable for the wrongful or negligent act of his agent or servant, done within the scope of his authority, is not applicable to the Crown; and this principle has already been acted on in this Court in the cases of McFarlane v. The Queen[36] and McLeod v. The Queen[37]. It follows, therefore, that if the acts complained of in this Petition of Right were mere torts the suppliant is not entitled to recover damages, and the conclusion of the Court below was perfectly correct and ought to be adhered to. The fact that the acts complained of were done under the special authority of the order in council of the 25th July, 1877, by which it was ordered in supposed conformity to the act 37 Vic., cap. 16, (though, as it has since been determined by the Privy Council, upon an erroneous construction of that Statute,) that possession of the Windsor Branch Railway should be given to the Western Counties Railway Company on the 1st of August, 1877, can make no difference; and that this is so even upon the assumption that the order in council is to be construed as a direct command by the Crown to its officers to take possession, as they did, of the Windsor Branch Railway, and to exclude the suppliant from the use of the Trunk line, is apparent from the authorities already quoted In Tobin v. The Queen, Lord Chief Justice Erle says: That which the Sovereign does by command to his servants cannot be a wrong in the Sovereign because, if the command is unlawful, it is in law no command and the servant is responsible for the unlawful act the same as if there had been no command.\nAnd the Chief Justice adds a quotation from Halt's Pleas of the Crown to the same effect. In Feather v. The Queen the Court of Queen's Bench say:\u2014\nFor the maxim that the King can do no wrong applies to personal as well as political wrongs and not only to wrongs done personally by the Sovereign, if such a thing can be supposed to be possible, but to injuries done by a subject by authority of the Sovereign. For from the maxim that the King can do no wrong it follows as a necessary consequence that the King cannot authorize wrong. For to authorize a wrong to be done is to do a wrong, inasmuch as the wrongful act when done becomes in law the act of him who authorized or directed it to be done.\nAnd both the cases just quoted from show that the only remedy for a wrong done in obedience to express orders emanating from the Crown is by an action against the officer who performs the act, and that to such an action the orders of the Sovereign constitute no defence. In Feather v. The Queen the case of Buron v. Denman[38] was relied on by the suppliant as an authority against this proposition; but that case, as explained by the court, was shown to have no application as the injury there complained of, and which by the ratification and adoption of the Lords of the Admiralty became an act of state, was done without the dominions of the Crown and to the prejudice of a foreigner, and being by reason of the adoption of the Admiralty to be considered as an act of state, was only remediable according to the rules and usages of international law, upon the reclamation of the government of which the party complaining was a subject to the government of the United Kingdom.\nAnother and distinct reason for holding that the Crown is not liable under the circumstances of the present case is that the Governor General and the Ministers of the Crown who advised him, in the making of the order in council of the 25th of July, 1877, did not assume to act under the authority of the Crown, but in pursuance of the Act of Parliament. This appears upon the face of the order in council itself, which adopts the report of the Minister of Public Works, who in his report: \"Recommends that possession of the said Windsor Branch Railway be given to the Western Counties Railway Company on the 1st of August, 1877, under the terms of the Act of May, 1874, entitled An Act to authorize the transfer of the Windsor branch of the Nova Scotia railway to the Western Counties Railway Company.\" Tobin v. The Queen is a direct authority for the Crown upon this point also. It was there held that the officer, for whose act in destroying a vessel which he had seized, assuming to act under powers conferred by certain statutes for the suppression of the slave trade, although he erroneously supposed the statutes in question gave him authority so to deal with the property seized, when in truth they did not do so, was nevertheless for that reason not to be deemed an agent of the Crown. In the present case the possession of the railway was taken from the suppliants and transferred to the Western Counties Railway Company by the officers of the Crown, upon the supposition that they were acting in obedience to the paramount authority of parliament, an assumption for which it may be said, though it can make no difference in principle, they had much better grounds than had the officer for whose acts it was unsuccessfully sought to make the Crown liable in Tobin v. The Queen. If the interpretation of the statute acted on by the Governor General in council had been the correct construction, instead of an erroneous one, as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has held that it was, there could have been no doubt that the act of taking possession of the Windsor Branch Railway would have been attributable to the statute, and defensible as a proper mode of carrying its provisions into execution. The order in council then was not intended to be made in the exercise of the general executive powers of the Crown, but for the sole purpose of carrying into execution the supposed requirements of the Act, and for this reason the order in council is not to be considered as an act of the Crown, but rather as an act of the officers and ministers of the Crown, not intended to be done as being within the scope of the prerogative powers of the Crown, delegated generally to the Governor General, but with the object and intention of acting as the mandataries of parliament, in carrying out the provisions of the statute with which, according to the construction they assumed to be the correct one, they had been charged by parliament. The first point decided in Tobin v. The Queen is, therefore, a direct authority against the suppliants, and the order in council cannot be considered as a command of the Crown nor can anything done under it be imputed to the Crown. The suppliants are consequently not entitled to recover damages, if the injuries complained of are to be treated as mere wrongful acts on the part of the officers and servants of the Crown.\nThe suppliants, however, now say that the wrongs in respect of which they seek indemity were not merely tortious acts, but breaches of contract for relief in respect of which they insist they have a remedy by petition of right. And if they can show that there were contracts with the Crown of which the acts complained of constituted breaches they no doubt bring themselves within the authority of the Banker's case[39] and of that of Thomas v. The Queen[40]. In the Banker's case, although there was great difference of opinion whether the form of proceeding adopted in that case\u2014a petition directly to the barons of the Exchequer\u2014was the regular one, there seem to be a general consensus of opinion that whenever a sum of money was due by the Crown to a subject ex contractu a petition of right will lie. This was recognized to be the law in Tobin v. The Queen, and in Feather v. The Queen, Cockburn, C. J., says:\nWe concur with that court (the Common Pleas) in thinking that the only cases in which a petition of right is open to the subject are: where the land or goods or money of a subject have found their way into the possession of the Crown and the purpose of the petition is to obtain restitution, or if restitution cannot be given, compensation in money, or when the claim arises out of contract for goods supplied to the Crown or the public service.\nIn Thomas v. Queen, it was expressly held that a petition of right could be maintained for the recovery of damages for the breach of an executory contract entered into by a responsible minister of the Crown with the suppliant for the payment of money in an event which the petition alleged had happened. In the case of McLean v. The Queen.[41], in this court, the same principle was adopted and the suppliant recovered damages for the breach by the Crown of a contract to employ them as printers at certain contract prices. In Churchward v. The Queen[42] also, although the case did not call for a decision on this point there are numerous dicta to the same effect, and, indeed, the Attorney General who argued that case on behalf of the Crown did not dispute the general principle that a petition of right will lie to recover damages for non-performance of a contract to pay money.\nThe petition itself seems rather to put the case of the suppliants as one entitling them to damages for tortious acts than as grounded on contract; its allegations, however, are not very clear in this respect. The material paragraphs are the 5th and 11th. The fifth paragraph is as follows:\n5. In pursuance of the aforesaid agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, and on the 1st January, 1872, the date named therein, the Government of Canada delivered to your suppliants, and they thereupon entered into the exclusive use and possession of the said ranch line with the stations, sheds and other conveniences in use thereon (subject, however, to the right of the said authorities to have access thereto for the purpose of maintaining the railway and works), and the Government likewise gave to your suppliants, and they thereupon took and exercised such use of the trunk line and the accommodation specified in connection therewith in article 3 of the said agreement of the 22nd Sept'r, 1871, as they were under such agreement entitled to have and exercise. And from the time when such use and possession of the said premises respectively were so given to them as aforesaid, your suppliants continued to hold and enjoy the same, and to work and operate their own railway line from Windsor to Annapolis, and the said branch and trunk Unes from Windsor to Halifax until the 1st day of August, 1877. On that day one Charles John Brydges, then being and acting as the superintendent of government railways and acting on behalf of your Majesty's government of Canada, forcibly ejected your suppliants and their servants and railway stock from and afterwards forcibly prevented them from coming upon or using or passing over the said trunk and branch hues, and he continued in possession thereof, and to prevent your suppliants from coming upon or using or passing over either of such lines, until shortly afterwards the said government gave over the possession of the said branch line to another railway company known as the Western Counties Railway Company, incorporated under an Act of the Legislature of Nova Scotia for the purpose of making a railway from Annapolis to Yarmouth in Nova Scotia. Such company thereupon took and has ever since held possession of, and excluded your suppliants from, and from any use of, the said branch railway. The said government have continued to the present time in possession of the said trunk line and to exclude your suppliants therefrom and from any use thereof.\nThis seems clearly to rest the right to recover on the ground that the acts of the government superintendent of railways were tortious acts. But in the 11th paragraph the suppliants charge that they have suffered damages by reasons of breaches by the Crown of what is called the agreement of the 22nd September, 1871. The prayer is for a specific performance of the agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, and inter alia:\nThat the sum of \u00a3150,000 sterling or such sum as may be reasonable may be paid to the suppliants in compensation, and by way of damages for the injuries and losses which have been occasioned to them by the breach and failure of your Majesty's government of Canada to perform the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871.\nThe first question which arises on this branch of the case is, was there in the legal sense of the term a contract by the Crown to give the Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company the exclusive use of the Windsor branch, and the running powers over the branch line, or was not the agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, rather in the nature of a performance of an obligation which had been previously created by statute. By the agreement of November, 1866, by which Messrs. Punchard, Barry & Clark contracted with the government of Nova Scotia for the construction of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway it was provided that before the new line, which was to be the property of the contractors, was opened a traffic arrangement was to be made between them and the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia for the mutual use and enjoyment of the respective lines of railway between Halifax and Windsor, and Windsor and Annapolis, including running powers, or for the joint operation thereof, on equitable terms to be settled by two arbitrators to be chosen by the parties in case of difference.\nBy the Nova Scotia Act, 30 Vic. ch. 36, passed on the 7th May, 1867, Punchard, Barry and Clark were constituted a corporation under the name of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company and the stipulation contained in the contract of 1866 already stated was (among the provisions of the contract) declared \"to be incorporated into and made parcel of the act.\" On the 1st of July, 1867, the Government Railways in Nova Scotia, including the Windsor Branch and Trunk line, became, by the operation of the 108th section of British North America Act, 1867, the property of the Dominion Government, and it has been determined by the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of the Western Counties Railway Company v. The Western and Annapolis Railway Company[43], that this transfer\u2014\nHad not the effect of vesting in Canada any other or larger interest in these railways than that which belonged to the Province at the time of the statutory transfer, and that accordingly the Dominion took the property of the Windsor Branch Railway subject to the same obligation by which the right of the Provincial Government was affected, viz.: to enter into a traffic arrangement with the respondent company in terms of the agreement confirmed by the Provincial statute of the 7th May, 1867, and that it was in pursuance of that obligation that the Dominion Government entered into the agreement of the 22nd September, 1871.\nIt seems, therefore, that there is a good foundation for the argument that we ought to regard the agreement of 1871, not as an executory contract by the Crown, but rather as an ascertainment of the terms on which the suppliants were to enjoy the rights for which their promoters had stipulated by the original agreement of November, 1866, and which had been afterwards assured to them by the provincial statute. Again, can that be said to be a contract by the Crown which it had no option to refuse to enter into but with the alternative of being compelled to submit to such terms as the arbitrators might think fit to impose. A contract implies a voluntary act on the part of those who enter into it, and here the Crown was not free but was bound by the statute. It having been already determined by the highest authority that this agreement of September, 1871, was \"in implement of the obligation to make a traffic arrangement,\" is it not rather to be regarded and treated as a performance of a statutory obligation by which the Crown was bound, and which it could not afterwards, by declining to carry it out, be said to break, as it might be said to break a contract for the payment of money which had been freely entered into independently of any statutory requirement? To put it in another form, were not the rights of the suppliants to the exclusive use of the branch and to the running powers on the trunk line dependent upon the statute and not upon any contract with the Crown? On the other hand the agreement certainly took the form of a contract, and it may be said that it was none the less such because it was entered into by the Government under the compulsory powers of the statute.\nIn the entire absence of any authority showing how far the Crown can be made liable by this form of remedy in respect of obligations ex contractu, and considering the rather fine distinction upon which, as I suggest, the suppliants rights are to be imputed to the statute rather than to a contract, I should not like to rest my judgment on this ground.\nIf however the memorandum of September, 1871, is to be considered a contract by the Crown, it certainly is not one analogous to those for the non-performance of which a Petition of Right was held to lie in the Banker's case[44] and in Thomas v. The Queen, nor one of the class pointed out by Cockburn, C.J., in Feather v. The Queen, as entitling the party contracting with the Crown to a remedy by petition of right. Even if it be conceded that this arrangement of 1871 did constitute a contract binding on the Crown, it was not an executory contract of which it could be said that either the order in council or acts done under its authority by the superintendent of railways were breaches.\nSo soon as the suppliants were let into possession of the branch line and permitted to enjoy the running powers on the trunk line they were in under the statute, and the agreement was executed and performed just as much as a covenant to pay money is satisfied by the payment of the money. There remained no longer any contract to be performed, the statute and agreement together gave them a complete title to the rights which the agreement had fixed and ascertained, and their continuous enjoyment of their rights was guaranteed, not by any contractor agreement, but by the statute. Had a statute empowered the Crown to make an absolute grant of the branch line and its franchises to the suppliants, and had a grant been accordingly made under the great seal, no one would pretend that if the Crown officers afterwards took possession of the railway their acts, although authorized by the Crown, would be in law anything other than mere tortious acts of the officers of the Crown; it could not in such a supposed case be pretended that there was any breach of an obligation springing from contract; any intermediate contract by the Crown between the statute and the grant would have been executed and performed by the grant. Then it appears to me that the statute imposing upon the government the obligation of conceding the rights which the agreement conferred upon the suppliants, vested those rights in them just as effectually as a formal grant would have done if a mere enabling power to make a grant had been given to the Crown. In the case of Feather v. The Queen, which was a petition of right to recover damages from infringement by the officers of the Crown of a patent for an invention, although the case was ultimately determined upon the ground that such a patent did not bind the Crown, it is still worthy of remark that the court pronounced an opinion upon what would have been the rights of the suppliant upon the assumption that the Crown was bound by the patent, in which case it was considered that the infringement would have been a tort for which the Crown could not have been made liable. It was not even attempted in argument to put the case of the suppliant upon the ground of contract, though it would seem that if the Crown in the present case can be said to have broken a contract it might have equally been said to have done the same in the case presented by Feather v. The Queen. It results, therefore, from this case of Feather v. The Queen that a violation of a right in itself amounting to a tort is not to be considered a breach of contract for which the Crown is to be held liable, merely because the title to the right of property violated is to be ascribed to a contract with the Crown executed by grant.\nFor these reasons I am unable to consider the acts complained of here as breaches of an obligation springing from contract, as in the case of nonpayment of money and other analogous cases; they are rather violations of a jus in re, of a statutory right of property, and therefore this is to be classed with such cases as Tobin v. The Queen and not with those in which, like Thomas v. The Queen, it has been held that an obligation to pay money arising from contract may be enforced by petition of right.\nFurther, the ground already adverted to in considering the liability of the crown for torts seems also to afford an answer to the suppliants, even granting that they are entitled to maintain that there was a contract binding on the Crown. As already stated, it was one of the grounds of the decision in Tobin v. The Queen, that when the officers of the Crown assume to act in pursuance of a statute they arc not to be regarded as acting within the scope of their authority as agents of the Crown. And this principle applies as well to cases in which the authority which the officer assumes to exercise is not upon a proper construction of the statute conferred at all, as to those in which the acts are strictly within the terras of the statute and susceptible of being justified by it. Whatever may be said of mere nonperformance or non-feasance there can be no reason for making any distinction in this respect, so far as positive acts are concerned, between acts which are in breach of contracts and those which are bare torts, acts violating rights of property. The acts relied on as being in breach of the contract which the Crown is said to have been bound by were the order in council and the taking possession of the branch line under its authority, and the exclusion of the suppliants from the use of the trunk line. Now, all these things were done, as already stated, expressly with the intention of acting in pursuance of the statute of 1874, and for the purpose of carrying out of the provisions of that statute, a duty which Parliament had imposed on the executive government. It is true that just as in Tobin v. The Queen it was erroneously supposed that the statute conferred powers which by a proper construction of its terms it did not give, but that is not material, the point is that the Governor General in Council was not acting as the officer or agent of the crown but as the mandatary of Parliament, and for this reason neither the order in council itself, nor the act of any officer in enforcing it, can be imputed to the Crown, and therefore, if we are to regard the Crown as being bound by a contract to continue the suppliants in the undisturbed enjoyment of their rights, there never has been any breach of that contract. It cannot be maintained in answer to this objection that the acts complained of are not to be attributed to the Crown, that the act of the Governor in Council was in itself an original and direct exercise of the power of the Crown, and in this respect equivalent to an order of the Queen in Council. The cases of Cameron v. Kyte[45], and Musgrave v. Pulido[46], have determined that the Governor of a colony is not, as incidental merely to his office, invested with the powers of exercising the Royal prerogative, that he is not, as it is expressed in those cases, to be considered a Viceroy, but that he only possesses such powers as have been delegated to him by his commission from the Crown. The British North America Act, 1867, makes no difference in this respect, for the 9th section is as follows:\nThe Executive Government and authority in Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the. Queen.\nActs of state performed by the Governor General in Council are therefore ordinarily to be referred to the powers expressly or impliedly delegated to him by Her Majesty's commission, and consequently, if the Governor General assumes to act, not in exercise of the powers so delegated, but exclusively for the purpose of executing the provisions of an Act of Parliament, he can in that case no more be said to act as an agent or officer of the Queen than the naval officer in Tobin v. The Queen could have been said to have been acting within the scope of his authority as an officer of the Crown, and the high dignity of the office of Governor General of the Dominion and the magnitude and importance of the functions with which he is entrusted can make no difference in applying the principle of law that the Crown is not liable for the acts of any of its functionaries which are performed, not with the intention of exercising authority conferred by the Crown, but only for the purpose of complying with the mandates of Parliament.\nThis conclusion would not leave the suppliants without remedy, for they have not only a right of action against the officers of the Crown, if they acted upon an order unwarranted by law, but they have the further right of petitioning Parliament for an indemnity which it is to be presumed will not be withheld from them.\nThe suppliants have already been restored to their rights as regards the possession of the railway, under the decision in the action against the Western Counties Railway Company and they therefore require no relief in that respect.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nLe 22 septembre 1871, le gouvernement du Canada, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le Ministre des Travaux Publics, agissant avec la sanction de Son Excellence le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, en vertu d'un ordre en conseil, fit avec la compagnie appelante un arrangement par \u00e9crit pour l'usage du chemin de fer connu sous le nom de Windsor Branch Railroad,\u2014s'\u00e9tendant depuis la jonction de Windsor sur le chemin de fer Intercolonial jusqu'au chemin de fer de la dite appelante qui conduit de Windsor \u00e0 Annapolis. Les principales conditions de cet arrangement sont ainsi qu'il suit:\n2. The Company shall, except for the purposes of the Authorities in maintaining the Railway and Works, have the exclusive use of the Windsor Branch, with all station accommodation, engine sheds and other conveniences (but not including rolling stock and tools) now in use thereon.\n3. The Company shall also use, to the extent required for its traffic, the Trunk Line, with the station accommodation thereon, including engine shed accommodation for five engines, water supply, fuel stages, turn tables, signals, telegraphs, wharves, sidings and other conveniences, but not including machine shops and other shops, buildings and appliances for repairs of rolling stock.\"\n* * * * * * * * *\n10. The Company shall pay to the Authorities monthly, one-third of the gross earnings from all traffic carried by them over the Windsor Branch and Trunk Line.\n* * * * * * * * *\n19. In the event of the Company failing to operate the Railways between Halifax and Annapolis, then this Agreement shall terminate, and the Authorities may immediately proceed to operate the Railway between Halifax and Windsor as they may deem proper and expedient.\n20. The termination of this Agreement, under the preceding clause, is not to prejudice any rights which the Company may now have.\n21. This Agreement shall take effect on the 1st day of January, 1872, and continue for twenty-one years, and be then renewed on the same conditions, or such other conditions as may be mutually agreed on.\nL'appelante prit en vertu de cet arrangement possession de l'embranchment de Windsor et l'exploita jusqu'au 1er ao\u00fbt 1877, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle l'appelante fut d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par C. J. Brydges, surintendant des chemins de fer du gouvernement, agissant par ordre de ce dernier qui, peu de temps apr\u00e8s, mit la compagnie intim\u00e9e en possession du m\u00eame chemin (Windsor Branch).\nL'appelante se trouvant l\u00e9s\u00e9e par cette d\u00e9possession et le refus du gouvernement d'ex\u00e9cuter l'arrangement ci-dessus cit\u00e9, demanda par p\u00e9tition de droit \u00e0 sa Majest\u00e9, une compensation pour les dommages lui r\u00e9sultant de la violation de l'arrangement en question. En vertu des dispositions de la 6me section, 39 Vict., ch. 27, la compagnie Western Counties Railway \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en cause et a produit une d\u00e9fense. Apr\u00e8s contestation li\u00e9e et audition des preuves, cette cause fut plaid\u00e9e devant l'honorable juge Gwynne, qui, par son jugement, rejeta la p\u00e9tition de l'appelante pour deux raisons: 1o. Parce que Sa Majest\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas responsable des cons\u00e9quences des voies de faits (trespasses) commises par ses employ\u00e9s. 2o. Parce que l'appelante ayant poursuivi la compagnie Western pour avoir accept\u00e9 du gouvernement la possession du Windsor Branch, et la faire condamner \u00e0 rendre compte des recettes du dit chemin de fer, la condamnation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e avait eu l'effet d'\u00e9teindre le droit de demander les m\u00eames dommages contre Sa Majest\u00e9. C'est de ce jugement qu'il y a maintenant appel \u00e0 cette cour.\nLa principale raison invoqu\u00e9e de la part de Sa Majest\u00e9 contre le pr\u00e9sent appel est exprim\u00e9e dans le factum de son savant conseil, comme suit:\nBecause the Petition of Right Act does not give to a suppliant any additional remedy against the Crown which would not have existed in England prior to the Imperial Act 23 and 24 Vic., c. 34, but merely relates to the form of procedure, and in England the relief prayed for against the Crown in this matter could not have been granted upon a Petition of Right.\nThe petition in this matter in effect seeks to recover from the Crown damages for trespasses unlawfully and forcibly committed by servants of the Crown, contrary to the well established doctrines laid down in the cases of Tobin v. The Queen,[47]; McFarlane v. The Queen, Supreme Court of Canada; MacLeod v. The Queen, Supreme Court of Canada, and cases therein referred to.\nLes autres moyens de d\u00e9fense de Sa Majest\u00e9, fond\u00e9s sur les r\u00e9solutions de la Chambre des Communes du Canada; sur le d\u00e9faut d'ex\u00e9cution de la part de l'appelante des conditions p\u00e9cuniaires de l'arrangement du 22 septembre 1871; sur la 37me Vict., ch. 16, ayant form\u00e9 le sujet d'un proc\u00e8s d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en dernier ressort par l'honorable Conseil Priv\u00e9 qui a donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 l'appelante, doivent \u00eatre laiss\u00e9s hors de consid\u00e9ration comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement jug\u00e9s D'apr\u00e8s ces d\u00e9cisions l'arrangement du 22 septembre, 1871, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l\u00e9gal et obligatoire.\nOn ne peut nier que cet arrangement forme entre les parties contractantes un contrat r\u00e9gulier obligeant chacune d'elles \u00e0 en ex\u00e9cuter les conditions. La seule question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est donc de savoir s'il y a lieu de r\u00e9clamer par p\u00e9tition de droit des dommages (unliquidated damages) pour la violation d'un contrat (breach of contract). Cette question ne saurait souffrir de difficult\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans la cause de McLeod vs. La Reine. Ayant en plusieurs fois d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'occasion d'exprimer mon opinion sur cette question, je ne crois pas qu'il soit utile de le faire ici de nouveau. Je me contenterai de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans la cause d'Isbester v. La Reine, d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en cour d'\u00e9chiquier, et \u00e0 celles que j'ai cit\u00e9es dans la cause de McLeod v. La Reine[48], en ajoutant que s'il pouvait y avoir encore un doute \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, les nombreuses autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es et les arguments si habilement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s dans les savantes dissertations de l'honorable juge en chef sur cette question auraient l'effet non-seulement de faire dispara\u00eetre ce doute, mais aussi de d\u00e9montrer que cette question est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie.\nL'hon. Juge Gwynne ayant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la d\u00e9possession op\u00e9r\u00e9e par M. Brydges comme une voie de fait commise par un employ\u00e9, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, en se basant sur la cause de Tobin v. La Reine, qu'il n'y avait pas lieu \u00e0 la p\u00e9tition de droit.\nL'appelante se plaint, il est vrai, dans sa p\u00e9tition d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9e par force (forcibly) du chemin de fer \u00e0 l'usage duquel elle avait droit et d'avoir aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9e par force de s'en servir. Mais elle se plaint de plus qu'apr\u00e8s s'en \u00eatre empar\u00e9, le gouvernement en est demeur\u00e9 en possession et qu'il en a ensuite remis la possession \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e. Quoique le fait de d\u00e9possession par force soit mentionn\u00e9, il n'est toutefois reclam\u00e9 aucun dommage pour cette consid\u00e9ration, les dommages demand\u00e9s ne sont que pour la privation de l'usage du chemin. D'ailleurs l'all\u00e9gation que le gouvernement apr\u00e8s la voie de fait de Brydges a continu\u00e9 en possession du chemin et l'a ensuite remis \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e, forme une all\u00e9gation suffisante par elle-m\u00eame du refus du gouvernement d'ex\u00e9cuter son contrat. En outre ce refus de la couronne a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la voie de fait commise par C. J. Brydges, car c'est en vertu d'un ordre en conseil en date du 25 juillet, 1877, que le gouvernement a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 mettre fin \u00e0 ses arrangements avec l'appelante, tandis que ce n'est que le 1er ao\u00fbt suivant que l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9e.\nL'all\u00e9gation de la d\u00e9fense \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre cit\u00e9e.\n12. I say that on or about the 25th July, 1877, the Government of Canada having completed arrangements with the Western Counties Railway Company for giving to them possession of the said branch, a minute of His Excellency the Governor General in Council was passed ordering and directing that the arrangements then existing with the Suppliants with respect to the said branch should be terminated on the first day of August, 1877, and the Minister of Public Works on behalf of Her Majesty was directed to resume possession of the said branch on that day and to put the Western Counties Railway Company in possession thereof pursuant to said Act of May, 1874, all of which the Suppliants had notice.\n13. In pursuance of the said minute of Council and of the said Act of 1874, the officers of Her Majesty did on or about the said first of August, upon the refusal of the Suppliants to give up possession of the said branch, take possession thereof and afterwards gave possession of the same to the Western Counties Railway Company, which is the ejection and giving over of possession complained of in the fifth paragraph of the said petition.\nOn voit par cette citation que c'est le gouvernement lui-m\u00eame qui, par une r\u00e9solution solennelle, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin au contrat en question. La voie de fait de Mr. Brydges est donc tout \u00e0 fait sans importance, et d'ailleurs l'appelante ne s'en plaint pas et n'a rien demand\u00e9 pour ce motif.\nIl est \u00e9vident que les faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause sont tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rents de ceux de celle de Tobin. Le principe sur lequel est fond\u00e9 le jugement dans cette derni\u00e8re cause, quoique parfaitement correct, n'est pas applicable \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause. Ce n'est pas poulies cons\u00e9quences d'une voie de fait, mais pour l'ex\u00e9cution d'un contrat (breach of contract) que l'appelante r\u00e9clame une compensation. La p\u00e9tition de droit dans la cause de Tobin n'avait pas d'autre b\u00e2se que la voie de fait.\nL'existence du droit de p\u00e9tition dans le cas actuel \u00e9tant admise, il ne devrait rester maintenant pour disposer de la cause telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaidoiries des parties, qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le montant de la compensation \u00e0 accorder; mais l'Honorable Juge Gwynne, dans son jugement ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 une importante question de droit que les plaidoiries des parties n'avaient point soulev\u00e9, une r\u00e9-audition de la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e pour les entendre sur la question de savoir: jusqu'\u00e0 quel point la poursuite intent\u00e9e par l'appelante r\u00e9clamant de la compagnie intim\u00e9e un compte des recettes per\u00e7ues par elle pendant son exploitation du Windsor Branch peut affecter son recours contre le Gouvernement.\nNi de la part de la Couronne, ni de celle de la compagnie intim\u00e9e, le fait de l'existence de cette poursuite n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 comme moyen de d\u00e9fense dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Ce n'est que lorsque le conseil de l'intim\u00e9e a produit une copie du dossier d'appel (Appeal Book), au Conseil priv\u00e9 dans cette premi\u00e8re cause, qu'il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce dossier faisait voir que l'appelante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu jugement contre l'intim\u00e9e pour une partie des dommages qu'elle r\u00e9clamait en cette cause de la Couronne. L'appelante s'est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette production pour deux raisons: 1o. parce que le fait d'un premier jugement sur les m\u00eames causes d'action n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9; 2o. que s'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9 la preuve aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre faite l\u00e9galement, par la production d'une copie authentique du dossier, qu'il aurait fallu compl\u00e9ter par la preuve de l'identit\u00e9 des parties ainsi que de l'identit\u00e9 des causes d'action.\nCes objections sont bien fond\u00e9es et suffisantes pour faire \u00e9carter la question soulev\u00e9e par l'honorable juge Gwynne comme n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 ni plaid\u00e9e ni prouv\u00e9e, De plus, il est clair que le principe de responsabilit\u00e9 n'est pas le m\u00eame dans les deux causes,\u2014dans celle-ci la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne d\u00e9coule d'un contrat, mais dans l'autre, contre la Compagnie intim\u00e9e, la responsabilit\u00e9 est bas\u00e9e sur une voie de fait pure et simple (a common trespass), qui, de plus, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise que plus d'un mois apr\u00e8s la violation du contrat par le gouvernement. Les deux actions sont donc fond\u00e9es sur des causes diff\u00e9rentes, puisque la Couronne ne peut \u00eatre tenue responsable d'une voie de faits. Cependant, si le premier jugement ordonnant \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e de rendre compte des recettes qu'elle avait per\u00e7ues, e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi d'un compte et d'une condamnation au paiement d'une somme d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et que cette somme e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement pay\u00e9e, je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 admettre que ce paiement aurait eu l'effet de diminuer d'autant le recours de l'appelante contre la Couronne. Cette doctrine para\u00eet bien \u00e9tablie, mais l'ordre de rendre compte n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi d'aucune ex\u00e9cution,\u2014aucun paiement n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, peut-on consid\u00e9rer que cet ordre a eu l'effet d'op\u00e9rer pour autant l'extinction du droit d'action de l'appelante contre Sa Majest\u00e9e? Ce principe ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 admis par deux des hon. juges qui composent la majorit\u00e9 de la cour, un autre \u00e9tant d'avis de renvoyer la petition in toto, la cons\u00e9quence en a \u00e9t\u00e9 que Sa Majest\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 exon\u00e9r\u00e9e de tous les dommages soufferts par l'appelante pendant le temps que la compagnie intim\u00e9e a exploit\u00e9 le Windsor Branch.\nPeut-on appliquer aux faits de cette cause le principe invoqu\u00e9 par l'hon juge Gwynne et soutenu par deux autres hons. juges de cette cour, viz: qu'un former recovery, avait \u00e9teint le droit d'action contre la Couronne? La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dates principales des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de cette cause et \u00e0 ceux de la cause de l'appelante contre le Western Co. fera voir le contraire.\nL'action de l'appelante pour obtenir un compte de la compagnie Western Co. a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e devant le juge d'Equit\u00e9 de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, Halifax le 10 ao\u00fbt 1877, Son d\u00e9cret ordonnant une reddition est en date du 1er mars 1880, confirm\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00earme de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, 5 avril 1881, et par l'hon. Conseil Priv\u00e9, le 22 f\u00e9vrier 1882.\nLe 18 ao\u00fbt 1878, un an seulement apr\u00e8s l'institution de l'action devant le juge d'Equit\u00e9, l'appelante pr\u00e9voyant sans doute les longueurs de cette contestation qui a dur\u00e9 environ cinq ans, obtint un fiat lui permettant de produire sa p\u00e9tition de droit contre Sa Majest\u00e9. Il n'y avait alors aucun jugement ou ordre dans sa poursuite contre la compagnie Western Co., et ce n'est qu'environ 15 mois apr\u00e8s le 1er mars 1880, que fut rendu le d\u00e9cret ordonnant un compte, confirm\u00e9 deux ans plus tard par l'Honorable Conseil Priv\u00e9. Lorsque la p\u00e9tition de droit fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, le droit d'action de l'appelante existait dans toute son int\u00e9grit\u00e9; il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de pr\u00e9tendre qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9teint ou transform\u00e9 par ce jugement qui n'existait pas alors. Tout au plus la compagnie intim\u00e9e aurait-elle pu plaider une exception de litispendance en supposant que ce plaidoyer f\u00fbt fond\u00e9 dans les circonstances de la cause; mais comme elle n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de le faire, rien ne pouvait donc arr\u00eater le cours de la proc\u00e9dure. Si le fait d'un jugement subs\u00e9quent \u00e0 l'institution de la p\u00e9tition de droit pouvait affecter le droit d'action de l'appelante, n'aurait-il pas d\u00fb former le sujet d'un plaidoyer connu dans le droit anglais sous le nom de puis darien continuance? Mais ni dans l'un ni dans l'autre de ces deux cas, on n'aurait pu emp\u00eacher l'appelante d'obtenir son jugement en cette cause, car l'existence de plusieurs jugements contre diff\u00e9rentes personnes responsables des cons\u00e9quences de voies de fait n'est pas ill\u00e9gale, comme le font voir les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s. En outre est-il bien \u00e9tabli d'apr\u00e8s la loi anglaise que la condamnation non suivie de paiement de l'une de deux parties \u00e9galement responsables des cons\u00e9quences d'une voie de fait a l'effet d'\u00e9teindre la dette et d'op\u00e9rer la d\u00e9charge de la partie qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e? Cette question est controvers\u00e9e et la jurisprudence ne semble pas encore \u00eatre d\u00e9finitivent fix\u00e9e. Il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendu avant la cause de Brown v. Wootton, que la simple existence d'un jugement f\u00fbt une de fin non recevoir (a bar) contre l'action qui pourrait ensuite \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e contre une autre partie responsable au m\u00eame degr\u00e9.\nDans la cause de Locke v. Jemner,[49] bien qu'il semble \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un jugement contre l'un des deux trespassers op\u00e9rait la d\u00e9charge de l'autre, et devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9quivalant au paiement (satisfaction), le rapport de la cause nous laisse cependant sous l'impression que la cour \u00e9tait d'opinion que plusieurs jugements pouvaient \u00eatre obtenus, mais que le paiement seul pouvait emp\u00eacher de proc\u00e9der contre tous ceux qui \u00e9taient responsables. La cause de Corbett v. Barnes, tout en d\u00e9cidant qu'un seul paiement (satisfaction) peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9, fait clairement voir par induction que plusieurs jugements peuvent \u00eatre rendus contre ceux qui sont conjointement responsables d'une voie de fait. Ces causes font voir qu'avant comme apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de Brown v. Wootton, plusieurs des plus \u00e9minents juges d'Angleterre ont pens\u00e9 que la loi \u00e9tait contraire au principe qui fait la base de cette d\u00e9cision. La cause de Buckland v. Johnson, en 1854, est la premi\u00e8re dans laquelle cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une autorit\u00e9. Deux raisons sont invoqu\u00e9es au soutien de cette doctrine; la premi\u00e8re, que la r\u00e9clamation pour dommages, d'incertaine qu'elle est avant le jugement, devient, par l'effet du principe transit in rem judicatam, (is merged), absorb\u00e9e et confondue dans le jugement qui constitue une obligation d'un ordre sup\u00e9rieur. Si cette proposition est vraie quant \u00e0 celui contre lequel un jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9, elle ne l'est certainement pas contre celui qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi; le droit existant contre lui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement transform\u00e9, et les int\u00e9r\u00eats du demandeur n'en sont pas plus avanc\u00e9s par ce jugement, et le recours devrait par cons\u00e9quent exister encore contre lui. C'est la r\u00e8gle suivie dans le cas de personnes oblig\u00e9es conjointement et solidairement en mati\u00e8re de contrat\u2014et comme en mati\u00e8re de voies de fait commises par plusieurs personnes, il y a \u00e9galement responsabilit\u00e9 solidaire, il est difficile de comprendre pourquoi dans ces cas-l\u00e0 l'on ne ferait pas aussi application du m\u00eame principe. La remarque de Lord Ellenborough, dans la cause de Drake v. Mitchell, appuie fortement cette mani\u00e8re de voir:\nA judgment recovered in any form of action, is still but a security for the original cause of action, until it be made productive in satisfaction to the party; and, therefore till then, it cannot operate to change any other collateral concurrent remedy which the party may have.\nQuoique les autorit\u00e9s du droit fran\u00e7ais aient peu de force dans un cas comme celui-ci, je ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de faire observer qu'elles sont conformes sur ce point \u00e0 la doctrine \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par Lord Ellenborough.\nLarombiere[50]:\nLe jugement pass\u00e9 en force de chose jug\u00e9e op\u00e8re novation dans le droit ou l'obligation dont il d\u00e9clare l'existence; novatur judicati actione prior contractus[51]. Un droit et un engagement nouveaux se substituent \u00e0 ceux qui sont ainsi reconnus, plut\u00f4t ces derniers empruntent un nonveau caract\u00e8re \u00e0 leur reconnaissance en justice. Il en r\u00e9sulte une obligation qui a pour cause a chose jug\u00e9e, qu\u00e6 ex causa judicati descendit; ou, mieux encore, une obligation qui n'est autre que le lien de droit produit par la chose jug\u00e9e. Car, ainsi que le dit Ulpien,[52]; on contracte en jugement de m\u00eame qu'en convention, nam sicut stipulatione contrahitur ita judicio contrahit. Mais cette novation ne ressemble point \u00e0 celles des articles 1271 et suivants. Elle ne produit point l'extinction de l'obligation, loin de l\u00e0, elle la confirme. Car, dit Paul,[53], en exer\u00e7ant une action en justice, nous ne faisons pas notre condition pire, mais nous la faisons meilleure; neque enim deteriorem causant nostram faciemus actionem exercentes, sed meliorem. Cette novation a donc seulement pour r\u00e9sultat de faire que le jugement constitue d\u00e9sormais la cause de l'obligation, et que la chose jug\u00e9e tient elle-m\u00eame lieu de cause.\nL'argument fond\u00e9 sur le principe que ce qui \u00e9tait incertain auparavant est devenu certain par le jugement, et pass\u00e9 en force de chose jug\u00e9e, est sans doute vrai, mais a-t-il d'autre effet que d'ajouter, comme le dit Lord Ellenborough, une s\u00fbret\u00e9 de plus \u00e0 la cause originaire d'action? (Is still but a security for the original cause of action, until it be made productive in satisfaction to the party). Serait-il logique d'en conclure qu'il a aussi l'effet d'\u00e9teindre le droit d'action quant \u00e0 ceux qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivis? Est-ce la vaine recherche de la certitude de son droit que la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e est venue demander \u00e0 la justice, ou une indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle par un paiement effectif des dommages qu'elle a soufferts?\nSi la jurisprudence \u00e9tait bien \u00e9tablie, lors m\u00eame que je la consid\u00e9rerais comme peu fond\u00e9e en principe, je n'h\u00e9siterais pas \u00e0 m'y conformer; mais comme elle ne me para\u00eet ni fix\u00e9e, ni fond\u00e9e sur des raisons satisfaisantes, je crois devoir en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que l'ordre obligeant la Compagnie intim\u00e9e \u00e0 rendre compte \u00e0 l'appelante, n'a nullement affect\u00e9 le recours de cette derni\u00e8re contre Sa Majest\u00e9. Je dois ajouter de plus, que je concours dans les arguments et les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par l'honorable juge Henry sur cette question. Comme lui, je suis d'avis que Sa Majest\u00e9 est responsable de tous les dommages soufferts par la Compagnie appelante comme cons\u00e9quence de l'inex\u00e9cution de l'arrangement du 22 septembre 1871. HENRY, J.\nThe main subject of controversy in this case has, within the past five or six years, been adjudicated upon twice, by the Judge in Equity and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia; and it was to some extent finally decided by Her Majesty's Privy Council in the suit of the appellant company against the Western Counties Railway Company. The right of the appellant company to the possession and use of what is known as the Windsor Branch Railway, under an agreement with the Dominion Government, was by all the judgments maintained. The company having been ejected from it by the Government of the Dominion in violation of its agreement and contract on the 1st of August, 1877, and kept so ejected for nearly three years, the question now before this Court is as to the right of the appellant company to damages for the losses sustained by it during the time it was so expelled and kept out of possession.\nThe appellants in this petition pray:\n1. That the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, as confirmed by the said agreement of the 22nd June, 1875, may be specifically performed by Your Majesty, or by the Government of Canada on Your Majesty's behalf, and in particular, that in performance thereof, the Government may give and afford to your suppliants such a right to use the said trunk line from Halifax to Windsor Junction, with all station, engine, and other accommodation and conveniences thereto belonging, as provided by article 3 of the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, and also that in case Your Majesty's Government shall of any arrangement with the Western Counties Railway Company, or otherwise resume the possession and control of the said Windsor Branch Line, possession thereof with all station accommodation, engine sheds, and conveniences, may be given to your suppliants in conformity with the provisions of article 2 of the said agreement.\n2. That an injunction may be awarded to restrain any of your Majesty's officers and servants from doing any act at any time hereafter during the continuance of the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871, to interfere with or obstruct or disturb, or which may interfere with or obstruct or disturb your suppliants in taking and holding possession of, and in the exclusive use of the said branch railway and appurtenances, as provided by article 3 of the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871.\n3. That the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling (\u00a3150,000) or such sum as may be reasonable, may be paid to your suppliants in compensation and by way of damages, for the injuries and losses which have been occasioned to them by the breach and failure of your Majesty's Government of Canada to perform the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871.\n4. Such other relief in order to secure to your suppliants the full and undisturbed enjoyment by them of their rights under the said several agreements of the 22nd November, 1866, the 22nd September, 1871, and the 22nd June, 1875, and their said Act of Parliament, as the circumstances of the case may require and to your Most Excellent Majesty shall seem meet.\nThe petition, amongst other things, claims damages for the losses sustained; and it is for us now to consider if the claim is well founded, and to what extent?\nThe charge of ejection by the Government, as stated in the petition, is admitted by the answer, and was attempted to be justified under an Act of the Parliament of Canada, as is shown by the twelfth and thirteenth paragraphs of the answer of the Attorney General, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, as follows:\u2014\n12. I say that on or about the 25th July, 1877, the Government of Canada having completed arrangements with the Western Counties Railway Company for giving to them possession of the said branch, a minute of His Excellency the Governor General in Council was passed, ordering and directing that the arrangements then existing with the suppliants with respect to the said branch should be terminated on the first day of August, 1877, and the Minister of Public Works on behalf of Her Majesty was directed to resume possession of the said branch on that day and to put the Western Counties Railway Company in possession thereof pursuant to the said Act of May, 1874, all of which the suppliants had notice.\n13. In pursuance of the said minute of Council and of the said Act of 1874, the officers of Her Majesty did on or about the said first of August, upon the refusal of the suppliants to give up possession of the said branch, take possession thereof and afterwards gave possession of the same to the Western Counties Railway Company, which is the ejection and giving over of possession complained of in the fifth paragraph of the said petition. The wrong was fully admitted, and, as I before stated, attempted to be justified. The legal result should, and must, therefore, follow. We are told, however, that what is complained of was but a trespass of the subordinate officers of the railway department, who ejected the appellant company, and that the Queen is not answerable for the trespass of such officers, and the case of Tobin v. The Queen has been cited to sustain the position. The two cases are in no respect alike. The one before us is not in the nature of an action for trespass as was the other. The act of the officers was no doubt a trespass; and they could have been held personally answerable in damages; and so we are also told was the case with respect to the Western Counties Railway Company. If no other redress can be obtained for a wrong, the consequences of which are comparatively enormous if not ruinous, than to seek it from the mere servants of a government or from a bankrupt company, to whom the property of the appellants was handed over by the Government, it might be at once said there is none. It would be monstrous if no redress could be had in such a case. The Government enter into a solemn agreement for certain substantial considerations to lease and permit a party to have the use of a Government railway for a term of years. The lessee fulfils his part of the contract, but the Government, without the slightest reason, sends parties to eject the lessee and take possesion of the railway. The contract is violated by the Government and damages were sustained by means of the ejection by the Government through its railway officers under its orders. Damages for the breach of the contract are sought, and it is claimed that no liability attaches to the Government, because the breach of the contract included an act of trespass. Does it render it any less a breach of contract because the officers who executed the orders of their Government under the minute of Council were guilty of a trespass? As well might one say who had had given a covenant for quiet enjoyment of real estate, to the party to whom he conveyed, and the covenant having been broken and an action brought for such breach: \"I decided to eject you and employed \"my servant to do it, but as he was guilty of a trespass \"in ejecting you although by my orders I am not \"answerable for trespass committed by him, and therefore \"I am relieved from my covenant, and you must \"seek the only redress open to you which will be \"in the shape of damages from him.\"\nI am not unmindful of the distinction that exists as regards liability for torts between the Sovereign and a subject, and of the immunity of the Sovereign; but as the fact of a trespass having been committed could not be received as a defence to a charge of a breach of covenant the fact of the alleged trespass in this case cannot be received as a defence for the breach of an agreement. It would appear to me to be paralleled by a case of trover for a horse taken by defendant's orders by his servant from the owner who was pulled off the horse and beaten by the servant. The defendant denied liability on the ground that he only ordered his servant to take the horse; but as he had gone beyond orders and assaulted and beaten the plaintiff, for which latter act he the defendant was not liable, the fact of the servant having so exceeded his orders released him from the consequences of what was done within his orders. Such is in substance the defence to the claim of the appellants in the case. The government having ordered the officers to take possession of the railway, can they be permitted to say, that because their officers committed a trespass in doing so, the government is released from liability for the breach of contract involved. That position is fully sustained by the evidence; but why need we look to that when the answer fully admits it; and the respondent is estopped from now denying it. That issue being the only one I thus briefly dispose of, and adopt, to that extent, the views of the learned Chief Justice, whose exhaustive judgment I have had the priviledge of reading and whose arguments and authorities quoted fully sustain the position I have taken.\nThe remaining matter to be considered is in respect of the amount of damages.\nIs the appellant company entitled to have awarded damages for the losses sustained for the whole period during which, by the act of the government, the company was deprived of the use of the railway; or only for the time it was held and operated by the government before handing it over to the Western Counties Railway Company?\nIt is urged, that as the appellant company commenced an action in the Equity Court in Nova Scotia against the other company in consequence of their alleged illegal acts in taking over the railway from the Government, and holding possession of it, and obtained a favourable decision from the learned judge in Equity before whom the case was tried\u2014which decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and also by Her Majesty's Privy Council\u2014the respondent is not liable for damages for losses sustained after the road was handed over to that other company; and that to the latter the appellant must look for damages.\nTo appreciate properly the merits of that contention it becomes necessary to refer to dates.\nThe appellant company was ejected on the 1st day of August, 1877, and the other company put in possession of it on the 24th of September following.\nThe action against the other company was brought on the 10th of October following. The defendants demurred to the plaintiff's bill, which was argued; and on the 8th March, 1878, judgment was pronounced by the judge in Equity overruling the the demurrer with costs. An appeal was had from that judgment to the Supreme Court in Nova Scotia; and, in May, 1878, a judgment of that court was given, dismissing the appeal, and confirming the judgment of the judge in Equity.\nAn answer was on the 13th of May, 1878, put in by the defendants, and evidence taken; subsequently the case was heard by the judge in Equity and on the 1st of March, 1880, he delivered judgment; and concluded it by saying:\u2014\nAfter having given the fullest consideration to the whole case, I am of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to the judgment of the court in their favor, with costs.\nAn appeal was taken from that judgment to, and heard by, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and in April, 1881, judgment was given simply dismissing the appeal, with costs.\nFrom the latter judgment an appeal was taken to her Majesty's Privy Council, and, after argument, an order of the Queen in council dated the 27th of February, 1882, was passed, on the report of the Judicial Committee of the Council of the 22nd February, 1882, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and dismissing the appeal with costs No further step or proceeding was taken in that cause; and no decree was made in it, either by the judge in Equity, or either of the appellate courts before whom it was heard.\nThe present action was commenced by the filing of the petition of right on the 19th of September, 1878. The answer was put in on the 18th of October, 1878, and the case was tried in the Exchequer Court of Canada during the summer or autumn of 1882, several months subsequent to the judgment of the Privy Council in the other case. What effect, if any, can the proceedings or judgment in that case have upon the amount of damages to be awarded in this? I have already quoted the several prayers in the petition of right herein, and by them the court is asked to decree the specific performance of articles 2 and 3 of the agreement of 1871, for an injunction to restrain any of the government officers or servants, from doing any act, to the prejudice of the company, in the use of the railway as provided by article 2 of the agreement; or in using the trunk line of railway from Halifax to its junction with the branch railway, as provided by article 3, and also for damages, for the injuries done to and losses occasioned by the company through the breach of, and failure of the government to perform, the agreement. The prayers of the appellant company in their bill against the other company is as follows:\u2014\n\"The plaintiffs therefore pray that it may be decreed \"and declared by this honorable court, that the said \"agreement of the 22nd day of September, A.D. 1871, is \"a valid and binding agreement, in no way cancelled or \"vacated by an order in council or other act of the government \"of Canada, but that the same is still in full \"force and effect. And that it may be further declared \"that the said Act of the Dominion parliament, passed \"on the 26th day of May, A.D. 1874, in no way affected \"the rights of the plaintiffs in, to, and over the said \"Windsor Branch Railway, but only affected the rights of \"the Government of Canada in such road, subject to the \"plaintiffs' rights, under the said agreement and under \"the act of incorporation, passed by the legislature of \"Nova Scotia; and that if the said act of the 26th of May, \"A.D. 1874, purports to do more than to convey the rights \"of the Government of Canada, subject to the plaintiff's \"rights, and to affect the plaintiffs under the said agreement \"and act of incorporation, then that the said Act \"of the 26th day of May, A D. 1874, may be declared to \"be ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Also, \"that under any view of the said Act of the Parliament \"of Canada, and under the facts disclosed in \"this bill, the running powers of the plaintiff over the \"said Windsor Branch Railway are still in force and effect \"The plaintiffs also pray that the defendant company \"may be ordered and decreed to deliver up possession of \"the said Windsor Branch Railway to the plaintiffs, and \"that they may be restrained by order or injunction from \"this honourable Court from further keeping possession \"of the said railway and running trains thereon, and that \"an account may be taken of the full amount of the \"monies received by the defendant company for freight \"or passengers on said road since the same came into \"their possession. And that until a final decree shall be \"made in this suit a receiver shall be appointed by this \"Honourable Court to take and receive all monies earned \"or to be earned by the defendant company or any other \"company or persons whomsoever. And that such \"further or other relief in the premises may be granted \"to the plaintiffs as shall be in accordance with justice \"and equity, and as to this honourable Court shall seem \"expedient.\"\nThe first prayer merely asks for a declaration of the law as to the rights and interests of the appellant company.\nThe second, is for an order or decree for the possession of the railway, and an injunction against the further keeping of the possession of it, by the defendant company\u2014for an account of the monies received by the latter for freight or passengers, since the road came into their possession; and for the appointment of a receiver, until a final decree should be made. It will then be seen, that the objects sought to be attained in the two actions are not identical\u2014and a judgment for the appellant company, in the action against the other company, could not afford the extent of relief prayed for in this suit. No claim for damages was made in the former\u2014a decree for an account is asked for, but, if given, would not necessarily be a gauge by which to measure the damages of the appellant company. Who can, under the evidence we have, say the road was operated as successfully pecuniarly by the one company as it would have been by the other?\nThe branch line adjoining the line of the appellant company and being seventy or eighty miles from that of the other company, would, no doubt, be capable of yielding a much larger profit to the former. Besides the management and upholdence may have been larger in the one case than in the other. It is in evidence that in consequence of the change of possession and working of the branch railway, through traffic arrangements for passengers and freight were broken up and the revenue was thereby largely decreased. The profit of the other company was therefore much less than it otherwise would have been. Again, no decree was made in the action against the other company; and who can assume what, if made, it would have been. It is quite possible that if the account had been decreed and taken there would have been little or nothing to be awarded to the appellant company.\nThe parties in this suit have submitted it under issues raised by the pleadings; and by them we are to be governed and decide. In the answer, we find nothing pleaded as a defence on the ground of any recovery against the other company. There is no pleading necessary as to damages merely, but if there was a recovery of judgment for a part of the time damages are sought in this action, a plea thereof would not be one as to damages merely. We are asked to decide as to the breach of the agreement in question; and, in case of liability found for the injury done to the company, to say what damages the company are entitled to for the time which, by the act of the government, they were kept out of the use and possession of the railway.\nThe minutes of the trial of this suit show that a certain book, called the appeal book, on the appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to this Court, in the suit of the appellant company against the other company, was tendered by the counsel of the respondent herein; and his lordship, before whom the trial was had, reports that the counsel who so tendered it said:\nIt showed the present rights of the plaintiff company as against the Western Counties Railway Company; and that they were claiming against the latter company for the same damages as in the present action. The appeal book was offered as a substitute for the record of the proceedings, being instead of evidence by exemplification, and was, of course, subject to all just exception. (The appeal book received subject to all just exceptions and marked exhibit \"A.\")\nThe object of the counsel in tendering the book was, as reported, to show that the appellant company against the other company \"the same damages as in the present action. The book, however, does not do so, as I have already shown. With all due deference, I cannot conceive how such could have been received under the issues being tried; and even had a plea of former recovery for the same cause of action been pleaded, evidence from the record was alone receivable; and even that would have required evidence of identity as to the parties and causes of action. Rules of evidence, long and well established, as necessary for the due and proper administration of justice, are not to be set lightly aside, or frittered away; and we are bound to observe them.\nIf legitimate evidence of a former recovery has been tendered, it would not have been receivable unless by an amendment of the pleading, which was not either asked for or ordered. We have then no issue before us to which such evidence is applicable; and if we had, the evidence tendered cannot be received in respect of it. I consider it my duty therefore to decide as to the damages in this suit in the same manner as if that appeal book had not been tendered or received, as it was subject to all just exceptions.\nThe mere pending of another suit against other parties cannot be pleaded either in abatement or bar; but the recovery in a suit against another person for the same cause of action may, in some cases, be pleaded. By what I consider the ruling authorities, however, the mere recovery of judgment, without satisfaction, has been considered insufficient.\nThis suit was not tried until many months after the judgment of the Privy Council was given in the suit against the other company; and the respondent had ample time, and would have been no doubt permitted, to add to his answer, a defence as to the damages whilst the other company had possession of the railway; but such was not done; and the trial of the issues, raised by the petition and answer, took place. Had, however, such an addition to the answer been made, I cannot see any effect it could have had. There was no decree against the other company for anything; none for the payment of any money; and how can it be claimed there was any former recovery? We are told that the appellant can still proceed and get a decree; but, as I before said, they have not, and cannot, get any decree, to cover the damages claimed in this suit. They might obtain an account, and had that been done, and a decree founded on it, there might be a question if the amount, so decreed, should not be deducted from the amount of damages to be awarded in this case; although without satisfaction being shown it is very doubtful. The mere opinion of the judge, when deciding a case before him, is no part of the record, from which alone evidence can be derived, and we have, in this court, held that we would not hear an appeal from the opinions of judges but have always required the formal judgment of the court, evidenced by a certified copy of the rule or order or in some other necessary manner. In one case we declined to hear an appeal, although it was shown that there was no rule for judgment filed; and postponed the argument until a rule was filed and certified. How then can we with any consistency receive the opinion of a judge in evidence to affect the rights of parties when no formal judgment has ever been entered, or decree made. It may be said that a decree might have been obtained and that the appellant company should have moved for, and obtained one; but we are not trying that matter. The defence as to the damages rests on the fact of a former recovery; and how can we find that, in the case in question, there was any recovery at all, by which the damages in this suit would be affected?\nIn the case of the Vestry of Bermondsey v. Ramsey in the Common Pleas[54] in 1871, I find it held that:\u2014\nAn unsatisfied judgment recovered by a vestry, for the expenses of paving a street, under the Metropolis Local Management Act, against a former owner of tenements, is no bar to an action for these expenses against a tenant under a succeeding owner of the tenements.\nMontague Smith, J., with whom were Miller and Brett, JJ., in delivering the judgment of the court, said:\nIn the present case the judgment recovered against the owner has created a change of remedy quoad him; but we think it does not operate to affect the collateral concurrent remedy against the occupier. The priciple is illustrated by the familiar instance of actions against the several parties to a bill of exchange; and by the cases, which have a close analogy to the present, of principals and sureties, in which the recovery of judgment against one party is no bar to actions against the others. He also says:\u2014\nNo doubt in a case of joint liability, giving a joint cause of action against several, the recovery of judgment against one of the obligees is a bar to an action against the others, but this is not so where the liability is joint and several, or where several parties are independently and collaterally bound to the same obligation. The principle is well expressed by Lord Ellenborough, C.J., in Drake v. Mitchell[55]. Lord Ellenborough said: \"I have always understood the principle of transit in rem judicatum to relate only to the particular cause of action in which the judgment is recovered operating as a change of remedy from its being of a higher nature than before. But a judgment recovered in any form of action is still but a security for the original cause of action until it be made productive in satisfaction to the party; and, therefore, till then it cannot operate to change any other collateral concurrent remedy which the party have.\"\nIt is said in Woodfall[56]:\nThat if a lessee enter into a covenant which runs with the land, for himself and his assigns, and then assigns the term, and the assignee be guilty of a breach, an action on covenant lies, either against the lessee or against the assignee, but execution shall be taken against one of them only.\nAnd again at page 209:\nThat the lessor may, at the same time sue the lessee upon his express covenant, and the assignee upon the privity of estate, but he can have execution against one only.\nIt is well settled that for a breach of contract or covenant an action can be maintained and damages recovered against the Sovereign by petition of right. It was so decided in Thomas v. The Queen. The appellant company is, in my opinion, entitled to damages in this suit for the time they were by the action of the government deprived of the possession, use and profits of the railway in question, from the 1st day of August, 1877, being the date of their expulsion, to the date of the filing of their petition of right on the 19th of September, 1878, and to our judgment for such damages to the amount of fifty-six thousand five hundred dollars with costs. TASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nIt was not and could not be denied by the appellant that no petition of right lies against the Crown to recover damages for a tort, and it was not and could not be denied by the Attorney-General that a petition of right does lie against the Crown to recover damages for a breach of contract. Is it for a tort, or for a breach of contract, that the appellants claim damages in this instance, is then the question to be first decided? That there is not a little difficulty in the solution of it is amply shown by the diversity of opinions amongst my brother judges. As the Court stood divided, after a first hearing, in which I had not sat, no judgment could be given and a re-hearing had to be ordered. I need hardly say that as the result of the case now depends upon the view I take, I have given to it more than ordinary consideration. I have come to the conclusion, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice in his elaborate judgment, that the damages claimed here are for a breach of contract, and not for a tort, and that consequently the appeal should be allowed, and the petition of right of the appellants maintained. The Privy Council has finally decided that under the contract of the 22nd September, 1871, the appellants became legally possessed of and were entitled to retain the possession of the railway in question. Now, it is admitted by the Attorney-General's statement of defence (No. 12) that it was by an order of, under, and in obedience to His Excellency the Governor General in Council that Mr. Brydges took possession of the said railway. The Attorney General further admits that the Minister of Public Works and his officers were ordered by the said order in council to take possession of the said railway in her Majesty's name, and it was in her Majesty's name, they evicted the suppliants. Now His Excellency the Governor General in Council's orders are surely the orders of the Crown, the orders of the Sovereign. The executive authority is vested in the Sovereign. The Sovereign acts upon the advice of and through her responsible ministers, who, in turn, have her Majesty's orders put into execution by the officers of the state. To say that the appellants only recourse was against Brydges, as for a tort, is to say that a petition of right would never lie against the Crown for a breach of contract, as it is always by its officers that any order of the Crown authorizing and commanding a breach of contract must be executed.\nIn this case the Crown, under the advice of its constitutional advisers, was led to believe that it had the right to evict the suppliants.\nThe judgment of the Privy Council has determined that this was an error, and that the suppliants had a right to this railway. It does seem to me that the Crown must be held responsible to the suppliants for the consequences of this eviction.\nThis railway was actually used and the proceeds thereof received by the Crown for nearly two months.\nI am of opinion that the Crown is responsible for the damages suffered by the suppliants during this period.\nThat there was an Act of Parliament on the matter, under which the Crown acted, or thought it could so act, does not alter the case. Parliament makes the laws, but does not execute them. This belongs to the executive power.\nParliament cannot convey its orders or directions to the meanest executive officer in relation to the performance of his duty[57].\nThen the Privy Council have settled that this eviction was not authorized by any Act of Parliament.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nBy the Dominion statute, 39 Vic., ch. 27, sec. 19, it is enacted that nothing in the act contained shall give to the subject any remedy against the Crown in any case in which he would not have been entitled to such remedy in England under similar circumstances by the law in force there, prior to the passing of the Imperial Statute 23rd and 24th Vic., ch. 34.\nThe sole question raised and argued before me was as to the right of the suppliants to recover from Her Majesty damages by way of compensation for the wrongs in the petition of right complained of. And by force of the above clause of the Dominion Act that question is whether by the law of England, as it stood prior to the above Imperial Act, such damages were recoverable in England under like circumstances.\nSo long as the law of England is as it has been held to be in Tobin v. The Queen[58] and in McFarlane v. The Queen[59], decided in this Court, I am unable, notwithstanding the two arguments which this case has undergone upon this appeal, to see upon what principle the claim for damages asserted against Her Majesty upon this petition of right can be sustained.\nThe third ground enunciated in Tobin v. The Queen, upon which the judgment in that case proceeded, is that a petition of right cannot be maintained to recover unliquidated damages for a trespass. The main foundation upon which this principle rests is said to be the maxim that the Sovereign cannot be guilty of a wrong, and so cannot be made liable to pay damages for a wrong of which he cannot be guilty. Erle, C. J., in delivering the judgment of the Court there, says,[60]:\nThe maxim that the King can do no wrong is true in the sense that he is not liable to be sued civilly or criminally for a supposed wrong. That which the Sovereign does personally the law presumes will not be wrong: that which the Sovereign does by command to his servants cannot be a wrong in the Sovereign, because, if the command is unlawful it is in law no command and the servant is responsible for the unlawful act the same as if there had been no command.\nAnd citing Lord Hale in his pleas of the Crown[61] he continues:\nLord Hale says the law presumes the king will do no wrong, neither, indeed, can do any wrong, and therefore if the king command an unlawful act to be done the offence of the instrument is not thereby indemnified. But although the king is not under the coercive power of the law, yet in many cases his commands are under the directive power of the law, which consequently makes the act itself invalid, if unlawful, and so renders the instrument of the execution thereof obnoxious to the punishment of the law.\nHe cites also Lord Coke, who says:\nThe king being a body politique cannot command but by matter of record for Rex pr\u00e6cipit and Lex pr\u00e6cipit are all one, for the king must command by matter of record according to the law, and Bracton says: Nihil aliud potest, Rex; quam quod de jure potest.\nTo the same effect he adds is Blackstone[62]:\nThe king can do no wrong, which ancient and fundamental maxim is not to be understood as if every thing transacted by the government was, of course, just and lawful, but means only two things\u2014first, whatever is exceptionable in the conduct of public affairs, is not to be imputed to the king, nor is he answerable for it personally to his people, for this doctrine would destroy the constitutional independence of the Crown; and, secondly, that the prerogative of the Crown extends not to do any injury.\nHaving made these quotations, the learned Chief Justice concludes thus:\nThis maxim has been constantly recognized, and the notion of making the king responsible in damages for a supposed wrong tends to consequences that are clearly inconsistent with the duty of the Sovereign.\nFrom this judgment and the reasoning in support of it, it is apparent that the principle upon which rests the doctrine that a petition of right cannot be maintained to recover unliquidated damages for a trespass is that the act complained of being unlawful cannot in law be imputed to the Sovereign. In the eye of the law it is not the act of the Sovereign at all.\nWhen the unlawful act is committed by an officer or servant of the Crown, it is, of course, not the personal act of the Sovereign, and the principle of respondeat superior cannot be applied to the Sovereign in such a case, for the Sovereign cannot command an unlawful act to be done. If the command is unlawful, it is in law no command, and moreover the Sovereign can, in the eye of the law, command only by matter of record.\nNow the act upon which the suppliants in this case rest their claim for damages against Her Majesty is a plain act of trespass. The suppliants case is, that while in legal possession of the Windsor Branch Railway under the provisions of an Act of Parliament, and a valid contract, dated the 22nd of September, 1871, made in pursuance thereof with the Government of Canada, acting by and through the Minister of Railways, whereby it was agreed that the suppliants, performing the terms of the said contract in all things to be performed by them, should continue in such possession for the period of twenty-one years from the first day of January, 1872, one Charles John Brydges then being, and acting as, the superintendent of government railways, and acting on behalf of the Government of Canada, forcibly ejected the suppliants and their servants and railway stock from, and afterwards forcibly prevented them from coming upon, or using or passing over, the said trunk and branch lines, and he continued in possession thereof; and to prevent the suppliants from coming upon, or using, or passing over, either of such lines until shortly afterwards the said government gave over the possession of the said branch line to another railway company, known as the Western Counties Railway Company, incorporated under an Act of the Legislature of Nova Scotia for the purpose of making a railway from Annapolis to Yarmouth, in Nova Scotia, and that such company thereupon took and has ever since held possession of and excluded the suppliants from, and from any use of, the said branch railway; and the said Government of Canada have continued in possession of the said trunk line and to exclude the suppliants therefrom, and from any use thereof. And the petition further alleges, that notwithstanding that the suppliants had duly performed all acts and stipulations on their part to be performed under and by virtue of said agreement, nevertheless that the officers of Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada have, in violation and in breach of the provisions and agreements therein upon the part of Her Majesty contained, refused, and they continue to refuse to perform and abide by the terms and provisions of the said agreement on their part, and on behalf of Her Majesty with respect to the said trunk and branch lines, and to exclude the suppliants from possession thereof and from the use thereof; and further, that\u2014\nBy the acts so committed by the Government of Canada in forcibly expelling and excluding the suppliants, and by their breach of and failure to perform the said agreements they have caused to the suppliants great injury, loss and damage, and the suppliants submit that they have no effectual remedy against her Majesty's government, except by petition of right; but that they have been advised that they are entitled to recover possession of the said branch line from the said Western Counties Railway Company, and they have accordingly commenced a suit against them for the purpose, in the Supreme Court of Equity in Nova Scotia, which suit is now pending.\nAt the time that the present petition of right was brought to a hearing the above suit against the Western Counties Railway Company had been conclusively determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in favor of the suppliants, and it was admitted that the suppliants had been restored to their possession of the Windsor Branch line, and that all that the suppliants now sought was to recover from her Majesty compensation in damages for the injury sustained by the suppliants by the wrongful conduct set forth in the petition of right, which damages were therein prayed for as follows:\nThat the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, or such sum as may be reasonable, may be paid to the suppliants in compensation by way of damages for the injuries and losses which have been occasioned to them by the breach and failure of Her Majesty's Government of Canada to perform the said agreement of the 22nd September, 1871.\nIt is apparent that what is relied upon in the petition of right as a breach by the Government of Canada of the agreement contained in the instrument of the 22nd September, 1871, and as establishing a failure upon the part of that government to abide by the terms of that instrument, wholly consisted in the illegal act of trespass and eviction committed by Mr. Brydges, acting as chief superintendent of government railways, and in the alleged wrongful continuance of that act of trespass done to the line when the possession was restored to the suppliants. Now the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of The Windsor & Annapolis Railway Co. v. The Western Counties Railway Co. establishes that the instrument of the 22nd September, 1871, operated in implement of, and as specific performance of the agreement entered into with the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Co. by the Government of Nova Scotia, under and in the terms of an act of the legislature of that province prior to Confederation, subject to the provisions of which act the Windsor Branch Railway became by the British North America Act, vested in the Government of the Dominion of Canada Upon the execution therefore of the instrument of the 22nd September, 1871, the Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company became and were possessed of the Windsor Branch Railway by a good, sure, perfect and indefeasible statutory title, subject only to the conditions stated in that instrument, nothing further was required to be done to complete their title, which then became and thenceforth was sufficient in law to have enabled the suppliants to have maintained their possession against all trespassers and disseisers whomsoever and to obtain satisfaction in damages from all persons whomsoever and all corporations guilty of and parties to any trespasses committed upon such their possession. They had full power to have resisted the trespass alleged in the petition to have been committed by Mr. Brydges, and to have prevented the wrongful eviction which is therein complained of, and to have obtained complete satisfaction in damages from him and all persons by whose direction and authority he acted, for such his illegal entry upon the property whereof the suppliants were so legally possessed.\nIt is now contended, that although it is admitted that no petition of right can be maintained for the purpose of recovering damages against Her Majesty by way of compensation for the trespass and eviction, which was in fact a disseisin committed by Mr. Brydges, and the continuance thereof by the Western Counties Railway Company after they were, as stated in the petition, put into wrongful possession of the Windsor Branch Railway, still that the damages consequential upon those trespasses may be recovered from Her Majesty, by treating the wrongful and illegal acts of Mr. Brydges and other officers of the Dominion Government as constituting a breach of contract by Her Majesty. This contention, I confess, appears to me to be utterly fallacious and unsound, lor, if a petition of right cannot be maintained for the purpose of recovering from Her Majesty, damages by way of compensation for the trespasses, because the acts complained of were trespasses and illegal, and for that reason cannot be imputed to, (or in law be regarded as the acts of,) her Majesty, to whom the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply, I am quite unable to see how those same illegal acts of trespass can be imputed to, and be regarded as the acts of, her Majesty for the purpose of making her responsible in damages as for a breach of contract. In The Queen v. McFarlane[63] I have expressed my opinion of the fallacy involved in this species of argument, which cannot, in my opinion, be supported upon any principle or by any authority.\nMr. McCarthy in his able argument for the suppliants admitted that if there is not in the instrument of the 22nd September, 1871, an implied contract that the suppliants shall have quiet enjoyment of the Windsor Branch Railway free from any interruption by or on behalf of her Majesty, that is to say, that if the instrument does not operate as a demise by her Majesty of the Windsor Branch Railway for the term of 21 years, the suppliants have no locus standi in curi\u00e2. But that instrument neither is nor professes to be a lease by her Majesty of the Windsor Branch Railway. Neither in its frame nor its manner of execution is it a lease, and the assumption that the present case is analogous to an action of covenant against a lessor for breach of an implied covenant for quiet enjoyment against the acts of the lessor and of those claiming under him, even it well founded, would not place the right of the suppliants to recover in any clearer light; for there can not be an implied covenant for quiet enjoyment contained in the instrument of the 22nd September, 1871, any more than there is a like covenant by Her Majesty in letters patent of land granted in fee simple. Yet it has never been heard that a petition of right lies to recover damages from the sovereign, as for a breach by the sovereign of a covenant for quiet enjoyment founded upon a wrongful entry and disseisin committed by a grantee claiming under a subsequent grant of the same land, or by an officer of the government in putting such second grantee in possession of the land previously granted to another. In the present case all idea of her Majesty having given any directions personally to Mr. Brydges to commit the acts complained of, is out of the question. In committing those acts he was not acting or professing to act in any sense by the command or authority of Her Majesty, nor otherwise than under the command and authority of the members of the Dominion Privy Council, or of some of them, who neither acted nor professed to act under the command or authority of Her Majesty but under an order in council professed to be passed under the provisions of and upon the authority of an Act of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. It appears now by the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company v. The Western Counties Railway Company that the construction put upon that act of Parliament by the Privy Council of Canada was erroneous, but such erroneous construction of the act while it may make the members of the Privy Council themselves individually responsible for any act, by them done or commanded to be done upon the assumed authority of the act of Parliament, and of the order in council professed to be passed also upon its authority, cannot make their acts, or the acts of Mr. Brydges under their direction, to have been acts committed under the authority of and by the command of Her Majesty, nor can Her Majesty be made responsible in damages for such acts as being in breach of a covenant entered into by her. To a Petition of Right, seeking to recover damages from Her Majesty for the act complained of as constituting a breach of a covenant entered into by Her, the answer is precisely the same as it would be to a petition seeking to recover damages from Her Majesty by way of compensation for the trespass and disseisin, treating it as a trespass: namely, that the acts constituting the alleged breach of covenant being illegal cannot be regarded as being the acts of the Sovereign at all for any purpose, whether it be for the purpose of establishing a trespass or a breach of covenant committed by the Sovereign; as the acts were the unlawful acts of the person or persons actually engaged in committing them or who commanded them to be so committed, but cannot in law be regarded as the acts of Her Majesty.\nIf this, which appears to me to be the undoubted law of England, appears to be too technical a construction of the law and does not coincide with public opinion in the present day as to what should be the law in cases of trespasses committed by officers of the Dominion Government upon the property of individuals or corporations, application must be made to the Dominion Parliament to provide other means for redressing such wrong than the law of England by which we must be governed in this matter, at present affords.

J. Ritchie, C. J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau. JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT OF CAMERON, C.J., SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE WEST NORTHUMBERLAND CONTROVERTED ELECTION CASE.\nWager by agent with voter\u2014Bribery\u2014Corrupt practice\u2014Treating on polling day\u2014Agency.\nOne Pringle, an acknowledged agent of the respondent, and the President of the Conservative Association whose candidate the respondent was, made a bet of $5 with one Parker, a Liberal, that he would vote against the Conservative party, and deposited with a stakeholder the $5, which, after the election, was paid over to Parker. At the trial, Pringle denied that he was actuated by any intention to influence the conduct of the voter, and alleged that the bet was made as a sporting bet, on the spur of the moment, and with the expectation that, as he said, Parker would warm up and vote; but he also admitted in evidence that it passed through his mind that some one on the voter's side would make the money good if he voted. Parker said be had formed the resolution not to vote before he made his bet, but the evidence showed that he did not think lightly of the sum which he was to receive for his not voting, his answer to one question put to him being: \"Oh! I don't know that $5 would be an insult to any one not to vote.\"\nHeld (reversing the judgment of the Court below), That the bet in question was colorable bribery within the enactments of sub-sec. 1 of sec. 92 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, and a corrupt practice which avoided the election.\nThe acts complained of in the Heenan-Beauvais charge were also relied on as sufficient to have the election set aside. The facts of this charge were that H., a Conservative, prior to the election, canvassed, in company with the respondent, one B. On election day H. was selected by the assistant secretary of the association (an acknowledged agent of the respondent) to represent the respondent at the Burnley poll, and obtained from him a certificate under s. 42 of the Dominion Elections Act, entitling him to vote at the Burnley poll. H. there met B. and treated him by giving him a glass of whiskey, and after B. had voted he gave him $2 and subsequently sent him $50. The treating, according to B's. evidence, was nothing more than an act of good fellowship; and according to H's. account, that B. was not feeling well, and the whiskey was given in consequence. B. negatived that the $2 were paid him for his vote, and H. said that he supposed it was a dollar bill and told B. to go and treat the boys with it, and that it was not given on account of any previous promise or for his having voted.\nThe Court a quo held that none of these acts constituted corrupt acts so as to avoid the election.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, per Ritchie, C.J. and Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\u2014There was sufficient evidence of H s. agency, but it was not necessary to decide this point.\nPer Strong, J.\u2014There was no proof of H's. agency. Agency is not to be presumed from the fact that the respondent permitted H. to canvass B. in his presence, and there is an entire absence of proof of any sufficient authority to H. to bind the respondent by his acts at the polling place in the matters of the treating and the payment of the $2.\nPer Fournier, J.\u2014That the treating of B. on polling day, both before and after he had voted, by H., an agent, and the giving of the sum of $2 immediately after he had voted, were corrupt acts sufficient to avoid the election. APPEAL from the decision of the Hon. Chief Justice Cameron[1], dismissing with costs the petition against the election of respondent.\nThe petition contained the usual allegations, but at the close of the case petitioner's counsel relied upon two charges, which are contained in items 1, 2, 8 and 9 of the Bill of Particulars, viz.:\u2014\n\"1. Raphael Beauvais was, on the 20th day of June, 1882, at the township of Haldimand, by Thomas Heenan, an agent of the respondent, treated, contrary to section 94 of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874, and promised the sum of $50, or other valuable consideration, to induce the said Raphael Beauvais to vote for the said respondent at the said election.\n\"2. The said Raphael Beauvais, at the time and place aforesaid, was, by the said Thomas Heenan, treated, contrary to section 94 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, and paid the sum of $2, on account of the said Raphael Beauvais having voted for the respondent at the said election.\n\"8. John Barker was, on or about the 17th day of June, 1882, paid the sum of $5, and treated, contrary to section 94 of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874, by Robert Roderick Pringle, an agent of the respondent, to induce the said John Parker to refrain from voting at the said election.\n\"9. John Parker was, on or about the 30th day of June, 1882, paid the sum of $5, or some other valuable consideration, by Robert Roderick Pringle, an agent of the respondent, on account of the said John Parker having refrained from voting at the said election.\"\nThe evidence relied on in support of the charges contained in paragraphs 8 and 9, known as the Pringle-Parker case, is reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given. As to the charges contained in paragraphs 1 and 2, known as the Heenan Beauvais case, it was proved that on polling day, before voting, one Beauvais was treated twice by one Heenan, and immediately after voting he was taken behind the school house, where the poll was held, and treated again and given $2, and a few weeks later Heenan gave him $50, but under the following circumstances:\u2014Heenan was a strong conservative, and the respondent and Heenan together, had seen and canvassed Beauvais a few days previous to the polling, at Donohoe's hotel, on the morning after a meeting held there by respondent. On this occasion, one Polkinghorne, who acted as assistant-secretary of the association to which respondent entrusted the management of his election, obtained from the returning officer a certificate under section 42 of the Act, entitling Heenan, as an agent of respondent, to vote at the Burnley poll. Heenan went to Burnley the evening before the polling, and passed the night at Donohoe's hotel. He left early in the morning, and, when passing Beauvais' house, stopped to speak to him, and gave Beauvais a drink of whiskey from a flask or bottle. Beauvais in his evidence stated that Heenan asked him if he was going to the poll; he answered, he was. Heenan replied: \"All right, I will see you there.\" They met at the poll, and Heenan \"coaxed, and coaxed\" him to vote on his side. Beauvais said it was not his side. Heenan then went into the polling booth and coming out again told Beauvais once in a while: \"Vote with us, you won't be sorry for it; you won't be sorry for it.\" During this time he treated Beauvais again from his bottle. Beauvais at last said he would vote for respondent on two conditions: first, that he should get money for his vote, and second, that Heenan should keep the fact of how he voted a secret. Heenan agreed to the latter condition, and, as to the first, he said, as Beauvais relates: \"he could not do it, and he darsen't do it; because, he said, if he gave me something before I would go into the poll when the people was looking at me with him, he says, when you come to vote they might swear you, and it would not work.\" Beauvais then went in and voted. As he was coming out Heenan asked him how he had voted; he said, for respondent. Heenan replied that he was glad, and asked him to go around behind the school house, where he gave Beauvais another drink, and gave him a $2 bill, saying, \"that will buy you whiskey coming home.\" Beauvais said the money was not given for his vote, and asked when he would see Heenan again. The latter answered that he would meet him in Cobourg in four or five weeks. He went to Cobourg, but was told there that Heenan had gone to his place. On going home he found that his wife had received a message from Heenan to meet him at Warkworth the next morning. He went there and met Heenan, who suggested his going to see his friends below Montreal, in order to get him out of the way. He said he could not afford it, and Heenan said, \"we will lend you the money if you go away.\" They were at McGraw's tavern, and as Beauvais was leaving the table after dinner, the waitress, Mary Ann Donohoe, handed him an envelope with his name on the outside, and $50 inside. This, she stated, was handed to her by Heenan while Beauvais was at his dinner.\nBeauvais was examined on the 7th of January, and, on account of Heenan's absence the trial was adjourned to the 2nd of May, when Heenan was examined. He stated that Beauvais, in the morning, complained that he \"had a bad stomach,\" and that he gave him the first drink on that account, and told Beauvais that any farmer who would vote for the National Policy would not be sorry for it, and swore that he did not put forward any such excuse for the second drink he gave Beauvais, just before he got him to vote; but says, that as Beauvais was coming out of the poll after voting, he asked him if he felt better now, and Beauvais said his stomach was bad yet. He added that he neither directly or indirectly had any intention of influencing Beauvais.\nThe learned judge at the trial found that Heenan was an agent, but that the treating was not done with the object of corruptly influencing Beauvais, and that the money was not corruptly given, and also held that the bet in the Pringle-Parker case was not made with a corrupt intent.\nMr. J. J. MacLaren, Q.C., for appellants:\nIn addition to the authorities and cases reviewed in the judgments, the learned counsel referred to the following:\u2014\nCooper v.

J.:\nThis is an appeal from the decision of the Hon. Chief Justice Cameron, dismissing with costs the petition against the election of respondent.\nThe petition contained the usual allegations, but at the close of the case petitioner's counsel relied upon two charges, which are contained in items, 1, 2, 8 and 9 of the bill of particulars. Items 1 and 2 in effect charge that Thomas Heenan, an agent of respondent, on polling day, treated Raphael Beauvais, a voter, in order to induce him to vote, and on account of his being about to vote, and treated him, and gave him $2 on account of his having voted and promised him $50 or other valuable consideration.\nThe second charge under items 8 and 9 of the bill of particulars, relates to the bet of $5 made with John Parker, an elector, by R. R. Pringle, the President of the Conservative Association whose candidate respondent was. There is no question about Pringle's agency, and, as he himself says, for a month he did nothing else but look after the election, driving night and day throughout the riding, organizing committees, visiting them, getting reports, directing respondent where to hold meetings, where and whom to canvass, &c.\nAs to the charge against Heenan, in the view I take of the case, I do not think it necessary to refer to it, but were it important for the determination of the appeal, and it became necessary to decide the question of agency, I should hesitate before I differed from the learned judge, who, at the conclusion of his judgment, says:\u2014\nIf it were necessary in this case to decide whether Heenan was agent or not of the respondent, I should be inclined to hold that he was. I am quite sure from what appeared at the trial, the respondent would have been anxious to secure the influence and assistance of Heenan, and, I think, he was disposed to regard his presence with him in the neighborhood of Burnley as beneficial to his cause, and no direct request on his part to Heenan to canvass for him would have indicated to me that he accepted his services more distinctly than what did take place.\nI think, however, that the second charge under items 8 and 9 of the bill of particulars, known as the Pringle-Parker case, must be fatal to this election. I think that whenever a wager is made in such a way as to influence a voter in determining for whom he will or will not vote, or in influencing him in refraining from voting, it is a corrupt practice, the necessary effect of the bet being to restrain the voter and influence him in determining whether he would vote or refrain from voting. The law requires the voter to be free till the last moment of giving or withholding his vote, which he cannot be, if he has laid such a wager as the present. The bet deprives the voter of free action, he becomes, as Martin, B., said in the Bradford case[61], a man incompetent to give a vote because he has not that freedom of will and of mind which the law contemplates a man ought to have for the purpose of voting.\nIn this very case the person who wagered with the voter puts forward as evidence that he made the bet under the idea that he would win it, because, though the voter had expressed an intention not to vote, knowing him to be a partizan of the opposite party, and who, if he did vote, would vote against the party for whom Pringle was acting as agent, though then at variance with his party, he would warm up and vote; but this shows, it seems to me, very strongly the impropriety of the bet, because the moment he warmed up and wished to vote he would find himself confronted with the loss of ten dollars before he could do so, and the voter very candidly admits that that amount might have an influence on his voting or refraining from voting, and I am by no means prepared to say it had not a direct influence on the voter in this case, and it is clear the wagerer, Pringle, thought it would influence him, for, though he says he thought he would vote and lose the wager, he thought he could be induced to do so by his party making up the money to him, so that there would be bribery on one side or the other.\nThe evidence of Parker is as follows:\nQ. Now, did you make that bet with him so as to get this money for not voting; had that anything to do with it? A. I did not intend to vote anyway.\nQ. Had this bet anything at all to do with your not voting? A. I do not think it.\nQ. And as far as you know, do you think Mr. Pringle had any notion that making this bet would prevent your voting? A. I don't know anything about that; you must judge that yourself.\nQ. Did you think about it at the time? A. I did not think any thing about it at the time.\nQ. You have just told us all that took place about it? A. I think so.\nQ. You have kept your resolution and did not vote? A. Yes.\nQ. And that is the story? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Would you have taken $5 to vote? A. No.\nQ. Would you have taken $5 if you intended to vote to keep from voting? A. No.\nQ. Would you have taken twice that? A. Oh? I don't know.\nQ. What is your price? A. I have not got any price.\nQ. At all events $5 is not your price? A. No.\nQ. You would not have allowed a man to insult you by offering $5 not to vote? A. Oh; I don't know as $5 would be any insult to any person not to vote.\nQ. You are not high strung? A. No; I am not.\nI think in view of this evidence it is quite clear that this voter was not so high strung that a wager of money would not influence him, and it is also clear that Mr. Pringle, who made this bet, thought it would influence the voter, for though he says he thought the voter would vote and lose his money, he goes on to say this:\nQ. You still thought he would vote notwithstanding what Beatty had said? A. Yes, and I thought it very likely he would not lose the $5.\nQ. Why? A. I thought somebody else would make it good to him on his party side.\nQ. You thought somebody on his side would very likely make good the $5? A. Yes.\nQ. That passed through your mind? A. I don't know at that time it did; it was afterwards.\nQ. When did it pass through your mind? A. I could not tell.\nQ. But you remember that did pass through your mind some time, that somebody on his side would probably make it good if he voted? A. Yes. So that we find this man was placed in the position to either to lose his money, or the only terms upon which he could vote would be by his own side remunerating him for the loss he would be put to, and I think in view of the evident desire of the Legislature to secure the free and independent exercise of the elective franchise, to allow the candidates or their agents to engage in transactions such as these with voters with impunity would be to allow them to frustrate the spirit and letter of the law.\nEven the decision of the learned judge who tried this case can hardly be said to be entirely opposed to the conclusion at which I have arrived for, he says:\nWhile I do not think I can properly hold the bet was made with the intention of inducing Parker to refrain from voting, it comes dangerously near leading to that conclusion. On the whole case, it seems to me that a decision for or against the validity of the election could not be said to be absolutely wrong.\nI am of opinion to allow this appeal with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\nTwo cases of alleged bribery by agents have been relied on by the appellant as affording grounds for avoiding the election. The facts disclosed by the evidence in relation to one of them, the Pringle-Parker case, already stated by the Chief Justice, are, in my opinion, such as to require us to allow the appeal and to set aside the election.\nThe learned judge who tried the petition came to the conclusion that any prim\u00e2 facie presumption of a corrupt intent by Pringle in making the bet with Parker that he would vote at the election was sufficiently rebutted by the denial of the former that he was actuated by any intention to influence the conduct of the voter, and by the statement of Parker that he formed the resolution not to vote, and that he adhered to and carried out this resolution unaffected by the wager proposed by Pringle, and the learned judge thought that this direct evidence of the parties concerned was confirmed by the surrounding circumstances. With every disposition to acquiesce in the finding of a judge for whose ability and experience I have so high a respect as the present Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, I am unable to agree in this conclusion.\nWhen an acknowledged agent, as Pringle was, makes a bet of this kind against the interest of his own party in the election, one or the other of two inferences must be made; it must be assumed, either that he was so indifferent to the success of his own side that he was willing to make money by wagering against it, or that the bet was not made for the purpose of winning but with the view of losing it, and so in order to confirm the voter in his declared resolve not to vote, and thus under the guise of a wager to bribe him. It appears to me impossible to say in the face of the evidence that the first was the object which Mr. Pringle had in view. He was the respondent's chief agent, and, as he himself states, most indefatigable in the prosecution of the canvass, spending a considerable sum of money in legitimate expenses to carry the election, and devoting much time and labour to it, and I cannot suppose in the face of his own testimony that he really wished that Parker should vote, as he must have done, if he in truth made the bet to win.\nIf the bet was not made with the hope and desire of winning it, it must have been made with the intent that its decision, depending as it did upon the mere volition of Parker, should have the effect of making him adhere to his first determination not to vote. Such, I say, would be the prim\u00e2 facie presumption from the mere fact that such a bet was made. Then is it sufficient to do away with such a presumption, that the parties to the wager, when examined as witnesses, state that they were mentally unconscious of any intention to treat the bet as an inducement not to vote, and by Parker stating that it had not such an effect? I am of opinion that such a denial of criminal intent cannot for a moment be permitted to outweigh the natural and obvious conclusion to be drawn from the act itself; all the principles which courts proceed on in acting on circumstantial evidence forbid it. The policy of the law in cases of bribery at elections is against such a mode of escaping from the effect of evidence like that before us; were we once to countenance the notion that an agent could safely make a bet of this kind with a voter, relying on his own statement on oath being afterward sufficient to enable him and his candidate to escape from the consequences of it, as an act of bribery, we should, in my opinion, be suggesting a form of corruption which would be almost universally resorted to.\nI must also differ with the learned Chief Justice, when he says that the surrounding circumstances go to show that the bet was not made in order to induce Parker to refrain from voting.\nIt appears to me not to be sufficient to warrant this conclusion that Parker swears that he had resolved not to vote and that he was not conscious of any influence being exerted on him by the circumstances of the bet inducing him to adhere to his original determination. As Buller, J., says in Allen v. Ream[62]:\nThe law leaves it to the voter to exercise his franchise or not, but it also requires him to be free till the last moment of giving or withholding his vote, which he cannot be if he has laid such a wager as the present. As to the argument that the amount of the bet\u2014$5\u2014was so small that it cannot be supposed that it exercised any influence on the conduct of the voter, there is one answer at least, amongst several which may be suggested, which must be conclusive. It is found in the evidence of Parker himself, for being asked by counsel for the respondent: \"You would not have allowed a man to insult you by offering $5 not to vote?\" he answers: \"Oh I don't know as $5 would be any insult to any person not to vote\"\u2014thus showing that he did not think so lightly of the sum which he was to receive in the event of his not voting, and of that which he was to lose in the event of his exercising his franchise as to consider it a mere nominal sum.\nThere is an absence of authority so far as decisions go on the effect of wagers of this kind. The case of Allen v. Hearn and several cases before election committees were cases in which the bets were not by a candidate or an agent but by a voter or non-voter with a voter, and were wagers on the event of the election and not on the voting or non-voting of a particular voter, and the question invariably arose on a scrutiny and did not affect the election but was confined to the single vote. Some of the text writers on election law do however allude to this question, and all who have treated of it unhesitatingly pronounce such a wager to be nothing else than colorable bribery. Thus Cunningham[63] says:\u2014\nHitherto we have only adverted to the effect of betting on individual votes. There may be cases where the whole election may be rendered void in consequence of a bet or bets, as when a candidate or agent bets with voters that he will not be returned. He by this evidently makes it their interest that he should be returned, and such a bet would doubtless be held by a judge to avoid the election, for it would be a mere cloak to render the real nature of the transaction less repulsive or probably to hide it from detection. Bushby, in his manual[64], is even more to the point; he says, in discussing the question of indirect bribery:\nAgain, the offence may be committed under various colorable pretexts, as for instance, when a man offers to bet against his own side with a voter. The intention of the person making the offer would in such a case be presumed to be corrupt, and the bet, if taken, would, as regards him, be a bribe. Moreover, if the vote were given in accordance with the corrupter's intention, the voter also would be guilty of bribery, provided that he was aware of that intention.\nAgain, Rogers[65], in his treatise, is to the same effect, for he says;\nCases might arise where a briber might effect his corrupt purpose by means of a wager with a voter by betting against his own party.\nThese quotations, though not of course of the same weight or value as judicial decisions, are yet amply sufficient to confirm me in the opinion which without their concurrence I should have arrived at and which I have already stated, that this election ought to be avoided in consequence of the bet in question and the subsequent payment of the amount of the stakes, as being colorable bribery within the enactments of sub-sec. 1 of sec. 92 of the Dominion Elections Act of 1871.\nAs regards the Heenan-Beauvais case, I am of opinion that there is no proof of Heenan's agency. The authorities referred to by Mr. McCarthy show conclusively that agency is not to be presumed from the fact that the respondent permitted Heenan to canvass Beauvais in his presence, and there is an entire absence of proof of any sufficient authority to Heenan to bind the respondent by his acts at the polling place in the matters of the treating and the payment of the $2.00.\nThe appellant should, I think, have the general costs of the election and of this appeal, and also all costs incidental to the Pringle-Parker case in which he succeeds, but I consider the respondent entitled to the costs as well of the Heenan-Beauvais case, as of the other cases which were dismissed by the judge at the trial.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am also in favor of allowing this appeal, not only on the ground that I consider the wager made and paid by Pringle to a voter to be an indirect bribe, but also on the ground that I consider the treating of Beauvais on polling day, both before and after he had voted, by Heenan, an agent, and the giving of the sum of $2 immediately after he voted, to be corrupt acts sufficient to avoid the election.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI consider the bet made by Pringle, under the circumstances in this case, no matter what his own views were, sufficient to avoid the election. It is a direct inducement not to vote\u2014it is true in the shape of a bet\u2014but it amounted to the same thing as if he handed him five dollars; in fact it was more, for if he voted he would lose $5. When a party does that, he, in my opinion, takes away from the voter that freedom which the law requires he should have up to the last moment. The policy of our election law being that every man should go to the poll free and uncontrolled by any influence whatever, and that the vote should be secret, anything that may interfere with his franchise in the shape of a gift, office, or emolument is an interference with the freedom of the party; and if that is done by the candidate or his acknowledged agent, I think it is under the law sufficient for avoiding the return.\nIn respect to the other case I express no opinion. I cannot say the evidence is insufficient to prove Heenan's agency. However, I have not given attention to that point, because I did not consider it necessary in the view I take of the other questions I have already spoken of. I think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the election avoided.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred with RITCHIE, C.J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: J. W.

Bain\nRespondent\n1884: Oct. 28, 29 & 30; 1885: Jan'y. 12.\nPresent.\u2014Sir W. J. Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM JOHNSON, J., SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE SOU LANGES CONTROVERTED ELECTION CASE.\nDominion Elections Act, 1874, Sec. 95\u2014Intimidation\u2014Undue influence\u2014Conspiracy between Deputy Returning Officer and respondent's agent to interfere with franchise by marking ballots\u2014Effect of\u2014Election void.\nIn an election petition it was charged that the respondent personally, as well as acting by C. A. C., D. P. and others, his agents, did undertake and conspire to impede, prevent, and otherwise interfere with the free exercise of the franchise of certain voters, and that, in furtherance of a premeditated scheme which the respondent and his agents well knew to be illegal, they did, in fact, so impede, prevent, and interfere with the exercise of the franchise of certain voters, by getting their ballots marked, rendered identifiable, and consequently void, whereby the franchise of these voters was unjustifiably interfered with.\nAt a previous election the respondent had been defeated by a majority of three votes, and the election having been contested was set aside, and certain voters were reported by the judge as having been guilty of corrupt practices, but had not been found guilty of such corrupt practices under section 104 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874.\nAt a public meeting before the election C. A. C., the respondent's agent, to intimidate these persons and prevent them from voting, in a speech made by him, threatened them with punishment if they voted; and subsequently printed notices to the same effect were sent to these voters.\nOn the polling day D. P., who had been appointed deputy returning officer, on the distinct understanding with, and promise made to, the returning officer that he would not mark the ballots of these voters, consulted with C. A. C., and on his advice and in collusion with him marked the ballots of certain of these voters.\nHeld,\u2014That the election was void by reason of the attempted intimidation practiced by C. A. C., the respondent's agent; and by reason also of the conspiracy, between the said agent and the deputy returning officer, to interfere with the free exercise of the franchise of voters, violations of sec. 95 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, and corrupt practices under section 98 of the said Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Johnson, J., rendered on the 2nd of July, 1884, maintaining the respondent as the duly elected member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of Soulanges, and dismissing the petition of the appellant, with costs.\nThe respondent, James W. Bain, was returned for the electoral district of Soulanges, at an election for the Dominion House of Commons, held on the 20th and 27th December, 1883.\nHis election was contested by the appellant on the 8th February last by a petition in the usual form, as to corrupt practices, without claiming the seat. The respondent met the petition, 1st, by a denial of the petitioner's right to petition; 2nd, by a denial that any corrupt practices had been committed by himself, his agents and partizans.\nOn the 20th March, 1884, respondent's plea of want of quality on the part of the petitioner was rejected, and on the 2nd July, 1884, Johnson, J., after the hearing of witnesses, rendered judgment, maintaining the election and dismissing the petition with costs.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the question decided by the court was whether the facts upon which charge No. 96 of the petition was rested, constituted violations of section 95 of the Dominion Election Act 1874.\nThe charge is as follows:\n\"On or about the 26th December, 1883, before polling \"day and during said election, defendant personally and \"by his agents, specially by Charles A. Cornellier, advocate, \"of Montreal, and Damien Prieur, clerk, of St. \"Zotique, did contrive, frame and conclude a design to \"intimidate, stop and hinder in the free exercise of their \"electoral franchise the following persons, to wit: \"Jean Baptiste Elie, Th\u00e9odore Duval, Gabriel Leroux, \"Charles Ch\u00e2les, Isaie Fournier, Damase Fournier, Joseph \"A. Le gris, Elie Baptiste Prieur, Joseph Pilon, M\u00e9n\u00e9zippe \"Cusson, S\u00e9raphin Bissonette, Th\u00e9ophile Sureau, \"dit Blondin, and, by executing said design through the \"agency of defendant's agent at the poll of St. Zotique, \"held by said Damien Prieur, did intimidate, stop and \"hinder in the free exercise of their electoral franchise \"the said above mentioned persons voting at said poll, \"to wit: J. B. Elie, Gabriel Leroux, Th\u00e9odore Duval, \"Charles Ch\u00e2les, Isaie Fournier, and Damase Fournier, \"all of them electors of St. Zotique, against the instructions \"and notifications of the returning officer, A. M. \"Pharand.\"\nThe documentary and oral evidence relied on as proving the said charge, are reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Geoffrion, Q. C., and Mr. DeB. Monk, for appellant.\nThe following authorities were cited and relied on as applicable to the facts of the case. The Kamouraska case[1]; the Laval case[2]; the Jacques Cartier case[3]; Rouville Election case[4]; Cunningham on Elections[5]; Rogers on Elections[6]; Gloucester case[7]; Bothwell Election case[8]; Journals House of Commons[9].\nMr. Alderic Ouimet, Q. C., and Mr. Cornellier, for respondent, relied on the following authorities:\nNorth Durham[10]; Windsor case[11]; Bradford case[12]; Stafford case[13]; Bolton case[14]; Hackney case[15]; Drogheda case[16].\nThe remarks of Justice Blackburn in the North Norfolk case[17]: \"But, in order to bring a case within this \"section, it must be shown that the loss or damage \"inflicted or threatened is of a substantial nature. What \"may be called a mere precarious loss would not necessarily \"be sufficient.\" The Verch\u00e8res Election case decided by Judge Jett\u00e9[18].\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nIt was charged by particular 96 that the respondent personally as well as acting by Mr. Cornellier, by Damein Prieur and other persons unknown to the petitioner, did undertake and conspire to impede, prevent and otherwise interfere with the free exercise of the franchise of the following voters, to wit: Joseph A. Legris, Joseph Pilon, and Elie B. Prieur, of Coteau Landing, Charles Ch\u00e2les, John Elie, Gabriel Leroux, Th\u00e9odore Duval, Damase Fournier, Baptiste Fournier, Zotique Lalonde, and others of St. Zotique, M\u00e9n\u00e9sippe Cusson of St. Clet, and that, in furtherance of a premeditated scheme which they, respondent and his agents, well knew to be illegal, they did, in fact, so impede, prevent and interfere with the exercise of the franchise of certain electors, Charles Ch\u00e2les, John Elie, Gabriel Leroux, Th\u00e9odore Duval, Damase Fournier, Baptiste Fournier, Zotique Lalonde, all electors of the Parish of St. Zotique, by getting their ballots marked, rendered identifiable and consequently void, whereby the franchise of these voters was unjustifiably interfered with.\nThis is the only charge I think it necessary to discuss.\nThere is no controversy as to the facts upon which this charge was rested; the question submitted to this court is therefore not one of the interpretation to be given the evidence, as to which there is no conflict. It is a question of law, as to whether the facts constitute a violation of section 95 of our Dominion Elections Act.\nThere can be no doubt that Cornellier was not only the agent of the respondent, but the organizer of respondent's whole election. He gives this account of himself:\nQ. D\u00e8s l'\u00e9manation du bref dont il est question on cette cause, vous vous \u00eates mis en rapport avec le d\u00e9fendeur, n'est-ce pas? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Ici ou \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al? R. Ici, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, partout o\u00f9 je l'ai rencontr\u00e9, je me suis charg\u00e9 de l'organisation et je l'ai faite.\nQ. C'est vous qui vous \u00eates charg\u00e9 de l'organisation, et c'est vous qui l'avez faite? R. Oui.\nQ. Par cons\u00e9quent, il s'est repos\u00e9 sur vous par rapport \u00e0 cette organisation-l\u00e0? R. Je crois que oui.\nQ. Vous avez agi en cons\u00e9quence? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Etes-vous all\u00e9 chez lui pendant l'\u00e9lection? R. Tr\u00e8s-souvent.\nQ. Qu'entendez-vous par tr\u00e8s-souvent? R. Plusieurs fois par semaine.\nQ. Avez-vous s\u00e9journ\u00e9 chez lui? R. J'ai s\u00e9journ\u00e9 chez lui, j'ai couch\u00e9 chez lui, j'ai mang\u00e9, je me suis retir\u00e9 chez lui en diff\u00e9rents temps, lorsque j'\u00e9tais dans la paroisse de St. Polycarpe, je me suis retir\u00e9 chez monsieur Bain. Q. Et il \u00e9tait entendu que vous deviez conduire l'\u00e9lection? R. Il \u00e9tait entendu que je devais prendre une part active \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection.\nIt is equally clear that up to the time of his appointment as deputy returning officer, Damien Prieur had taken an active part in the election.\nIn his evidence he answers as follows:\nQ. Avez-vous pris une part active \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re \u00e9lection? R. Oui, monsieur, j'ai pris une part active \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection, jusqu'\u00e0 ma nomination comme sous-officier rapporteur.\nQ. En faveur du d\u00e9fendeur? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous avez toujours travaill\u00e9 pour monsieur Bain, n'est-ce pas? R. Dans ses deux \u00e9lections.\nQ. Monsieur Bain le savait? R. Oui, il devait le savoir.\nAnd he knew that at the previous election between the same parties in which he had worked for Mr. Bain which had been set aside, that the majority was only three votes:\nQ. Etes-vous all\u00e9 chez lui pendant l'\u00e9lection? R. Non, monsieur.\nQ. Est-il venu chez vous? R. Il est venu chez moi, c'est-\u00e0-dire, pas chez moi, mais chez mon p\u00e8re.\nQ. Vous saviez que sa minorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 de trois voix? R. Oui, monsieur, il a eu d'abord deux voix et ensuite, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9compte, il a eu trois voix.\nHis appointment, he being so unquestionably a partizan, was most imprudent on the part of the returning officer, if he was aware of it, (which I am happy to say does not appear to have been the case, but on the contrary he seems to have acted with great discretion and propriety,) and Prieur's acceptance most reprehensible, for judged by his previous partizanship, and communications with Cornellier in reference to these votes, and his subsequent conduct, it could only have been to enable him to use his office in conjunction with Mr. Cornellier in violating the law in the interest of the respondent.\nHere is what he says:\nQ. Avez-vous vu monsieur Cornellier pendant la derni\u00e8re \u00e9lection? R. Oui, monsieur, tr\u00e8s souvent. Q. Tr\u00e8s souvent? R. Bien, c'est-\u00e0-dire tr\u00e8s souvent, plusieurs fois.\nQ. Chez vous? R. Une couple de fois chez nous, deux ou trois fois, je n'ai pas remarqu\u00e9 toutes les fois que je l'ai vu; chaque fois que je l'ai vu; chaque fois qu'il est venu \u00e0 St. Zotique, il est venu chez nous.\nQ. Vous l'avez vu ailleurs, aussi? R. Je l'ai vu chez mon beau-p\u00e8re.\nQ. Qui cela? R. Monsieur Filiatrault.\nQ. Monsieur Stanislas? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous a-t-il parl\u00e9 avant l'\u00e9lection de certains voteurs de St. Zotique qui ne devaient pas voter? R. Personnellement, il ne m'en a pas parl\u00e9, mais il a dit chez monsieur Filiatrault, et partout o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9, que certains voteurs n'avaient pas droit de vote, il a dit cela devant moi.\nQ. Seul vous en a-t-il parl\u00e9 \u00e0 vous? R. A moi personnellement, tout seul, non.\nQ. Vous en a-t-il parl\u00e9 \u00e0 vous, soit seul ou avec d'autres? R. Avec d'autres il m'a dit que ces gens-l\u00e0 n'avaient pas droit de vote, qu'ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s.\nQ. Vous a-t-il parl\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re dont vous deviez prendre les objections aux votes de ces gens-l\u00e0? R. Il m'a dit qu'une objection serait fil\u00e9e.\nQ. Bien, voulez-vous dire si monsieur Cornellier vous a parl\u00e9 de certaines objections qu'il devait faire aux votes des \u00e9lecteurs qu'il pr\u00e9tendait \u00eatre d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s? R. Je crois qu'il m'a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de cela; il m'a dit qu'il avait certaines objections \u00e0 faire sur certains votes qui \u00e9taient connus comme d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s dans le comt\u00e9.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il vous a dit? R. Il m'a dit que ces gens-l\u00e0 n'avaient pas droit de vote, qu'il pr\u00e9tendait que ces gens-la n'avaient pas droit de vote, qu'ils \u00e9taient disqualifi\u00e9s par la loi.\nQ. Est-ce tout? R. Je crois que c'est tout......Bien, le matin, il est venu chez nous......\nQ. Quel matin? R. Le matin de la votation.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il vous a dit? Qu'est-ce qu'il est all\u00e9 faire chez vous? R. Il m'a dit que j'avais parfaitement le droit de marquer les bulletins des gens qui \u00e9taient disqualifi\u00e9s par la loi.\nQ. Etiez-vous sous-officier-rapporteur? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Au poll num\u00e9ro huit? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Et monsieur Cornellier est venu chez vous le matin m\u00eame de la votation? R. Monsieur Cornellier est venu chez nous le matin de la votation et il m'a dit que j'avais parfaitement le droit de marquer le bulletin des gens qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s par la loi, qu'il pr\u00e9tendait qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s par la loi. Q. Monsieur Prieur, que lui avez-vous dit alors? R. Je lui ai dit: \"C'est correct, si j'ai droit de le faire, je le ferai.\"\nQ. Vous a-t-il montr\u00e9 ses objections? R. Je les ai vues avant.\nQ. Vous les avez vues avant la votation? R. J'ai lu la nature des objections.\nQ, Il vous les a montr\u00e9es? R. Oui.\nWe find the returning officer distinctly and formally instructing his deputy as to his duty in respect to not marking the ballots, and intimating to him his unwillingness to appoint him if he was not satisfied to act as instructed. Here is what the returning officer says:\nQ. Y avait-il de ces \u00e9lecteurs qui se trouvaient dans cette situation particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 St. Zotique? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Pouvez-vous dire qui ils \u00e9taient? R. Charles Ch\u00e2ls, Gabriel Leroux, John Elie, je crois, et peut-\u00eatre quelques autres; je me rappelle que de ces trois-l\u00e0.\nQ. Isaie et Damase Fournier? R. Je ne pourrais pas jurer.\nQ. Qui a agi comme votre d\u00e9put\u00e9-officier-rapporteur au poll de St. Zotique? R. Olivier Damien Prieur.\nQ. Il \u00e9tait nomm\u00e9 par vous, n'est-ce pas? R. Oui, monsieur, sa commission est du vingt-deux d\u00e9cembre dernier.\nQ. Vous reconnaissez ici la commission en vertu de laquelle Damien Prieur agissait \u00e0 ce poll-l\u00e0? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Cette commission est sign\u00e9e par vous? R. Oui.\nQ. Lui avez-vous donn\u00e9 des instructions requises par la loi? R. Je lui ai donn\u00e9 des instructions imprim\u00e9es et des instructions verbales.\nQ. Il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 agi comme sous-officier-rapporteur? R. Deux fois.\nQ. A-t-il eu la loi entre ses mains? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Il est revenu vous trouver pendant l'\u00e9lection, M. Pharand? R. Il est venu chercher sa bo\u00eete le vingt-quatre d\u00e9cembre.\nQ. Qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent? R. Monsieur Juaire.\nQ. C'est ce M. Juaire qui a agi comme votre sous-officier-rapporteur \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re Beaudette, n'est-ce pas? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Voulez-vous dire ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 dans cette circonstance-l\u00e0, quand il est venu chercher la bo\u00eete? R. Quand il est venu chercher sa bo\u00eete, il est arriv\u00e9 avec son livre ouvert, me disant qu'il avait des objections.\nQ. Quel livre ouvert? R. L'acte de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de mil huit cent soixante-quatorze, me disant qu'il y avait des objections fil\u00e9es contre les voteurs d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s, et qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'agir en vertu de l'article cinquante-six. L\u00e0, je lui ai fait comprendre que ceci ne se rapportait que lors du des bulletins du scrutin \u00e0 la fin de la votation et je lui ai d\u00e9fendu formellement d'employer ce moyen-l\u00e0, lui disant que les objections qui seraient faites, de les entrer au cahier de votation avec un num\u00e9ro correspondant \u00e0 celui de l'objection, et que par ce moyen, on verrait si ces \u00e9lecteurs-l\u00e0 avaient vot\u00e9 ou non, et que ce serait aux tribunaux \u00e0 d\u00e9cider plus tard sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de leurs votes.\nQ. Lui avez-vous dit qu'il fallait assermenter les voteurs et entrer les objections au cahier de votation? R. Je lui ai dit que le cahier de votation contenait la profession, la r\u00e9sidence, la qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire ou locataire enfin la qualification, et que s'il y avait des objection?, d'entrer le mot \"object\u00e9\" avec le num\u00e9ro correspondant \u00e0 celui des objections, et que si on demandait d'assermenter les voteurs, de les assermenter, et que s'ils refusaient de voter ou de jurer, qu'il devait entrer la question et la r\u00e9ponse, et que s'ils voulaient, qu'il devait tout consigner au cahier de votation.\nQ. Lui avez-vous dit qu'il ne devait pas assermenter les bulletins de cette nature-l\u00e0? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Le lui avez-vous dit formellement? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. N'est-il pas vrai M. Pharand, que vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9, l\u00e0, que si Damien Prieur ne suivait pas vos instructions, que vous ne le nommeriez pas votre d\u00e9put\u00e9? R. J'ai fait remarquer \u00e0 M. Prieur que s'il ne voulait pas se conformer aux instructions que j'avais re\u00e7ues, et que s'il ne voulait pas me dire qu'il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement convaincu que les instructions que je lui donnais \u00e9taient l\u00e9gales, que je pr\u00e8fererais ne pas lui donner la bo\u00eete, ne pas lui donner sa commission, et il est parti en disant qu'il \u00e9tait parfaitement convaincu que j'\u00e0vais droit.\nQ. Que vous aviez raison? R. Oui, monsieur.\nThen we have the obtaining the appointment on the assurance to the returning officer that he was perfectly satisfied that the returning officer was right.\nNotwithstanding all of which we find him immediately after, consulting with Mr. Cornellier, acting on his advice or instructions, and in direct opposition to and defiance of those of the returning officer, and marking and destroying the ballots, and complaint is made to the returning officer who writes a letter, (though strange to say under the circumstances he was prevented from giving the contents,) which evidently was forbidding his continuing the practice. Prieur, in his examination, says what the letter contained; viz.:\nElle disait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s ceci: qu'il m'avait d\u00e9fendu de marquer les bulletins, de faire ces choses-l\u00e0, et que si je les faisais, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 mes risques et p\u00e9rils, si je les faisais, ou si je l'avais fait.\nThe deputy returning officer exhibits his partizan character and his complicity with Cornellier in this, which I can only designate as a conspiracy to destroy ballots, by showing this letter to the agents of the respondent, but refusing to allow the agent of the opposite candidate to see it. His evidence on this point leaves no doubt in my mind as to the improper motives which prompted him throughout:\nQ. A quatre heures et demie vous avez re\u00e7u une lettre de l'officier rapporteur, monsieur Pharand? R. Oui, monsieur,\nQ. L'avez-vous cette lettre-l\u00e0? R. Je ne l'ai pas sur moi, mais je dois l'avoir chez nous; l'autre jour en regardant des papiers, il me semble l'avoir vue.\nQ. Que disait cette lettre? R. Elle disait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s ceci: qu'il m'avait d\u00e9fendu de marquer les bulletins, de faire ces choses-l\u00e0 et que, si je les faisais, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 mes risques et p\u00e9rils, si je le faisais ou si je l'avais fait.\nQ. Qui vous a remis cette lettre? Q. C'est monsieur Bissonnette, je crois.\nQ. Monsieur Fran\u00e7ois Bissonnette? R. Oui.\nQ. Le secr\u00e9taire d'\u00e9lection de monsieur Pharand, l'officier-rapporteur? R. Je ne le sais pas.\nQ. Vous a-t-il dit de mettre cette lettre-l\u00e0 dans les archives de votre bureau de votation? R. Apr\u00e8s qu'il m'eut remis la lettre, il est rest\u00e9 dans le poll une escousse, et quand il est parti, il m'a dit de mettre la lettre dans les archives du poll.\nQ. Il vous a dit de mettre la lettre dans les archives du poll? R. Oui, monsieur Bissonnette m'a dit de la mettre dans les archives, mais la lettre ne le dit pas.\nQ. Avez-vous mis la lettre dans les archives du poll? R. Non, parce que je consid\u00e9rais que c'\u00e9tait une lettre priv\u00e9e.\nQ. Avez-vous montr\u00e9 cette lettre au repr\u00e9sentant de monsieur Bain, dans ce poll-l\u00e0? R. Oui, monsieur, parce qu'il me l'a demand\u00e9.\nQ. Le repr\u00e9sentant de monsieur Bain vous a demand\u00e9 la lettre?\nR. Il m'a demand\u00e9 si je voulais lui montrer la lettre et je la lui ai montr\u00e9e. Q. Avez-vous recu la m\u00eame demande de la part du repr\u00e9sentant de M. deBeaujeu? R. Peut-\u00eatre......c'est possible......je crois que oui.\nQ. Lui avez-vous montr\u00e9 la lettre? R. Non, je ne la lui ai pas montr\u00e9e, monsieur Cornellier l'avait dans les mains quand il me l'a demand\u00e9e et il me l'a donn\u00e9e ensuite.\nQ. Vous ne la lui avez pas montr\u00e9e? R. Non.\nQ. Pourquoi n'avez-vous pas communiqu\u00e9 cette lettre-l\u00e0 aux deux repr\u00e9sentants des deux candidats? R. Parce que c'\u00e9tait une lettre priv\u00e9e et je suis bien le ma\u00eetre de montrer mes lettres \u00e0 qui je voudrai.\nQ. Vous ne l'avez pas mise dans les archives du poll, parce que vous consid\u00e9riez que c'\u00e9tait une lettre priv\u00e9e? R. Oui.\nI cannot conceive that an agent of a candidate, or a deputy returning officer, could act in a more flagrant manner in violation of the law, to defeat the right of voters and prevent a fair and honest election according to law than was done in this case by the respondent's agent and this unworthy deputy returning officer. Here is what another party says:\nQ, Monsieur Par\u00e8yre, avez-vous durant la derni\u00e8re \u00e9lection rencontr\u00e9 monsieur Charles Auguste Cornellier, \u00e9cuyer, avocat, quelque part? R. Oui, monsieur, je l'ai rencontr\u00e9 chez Stanislas Filiatrault, la veille de la nomination.\nQ. Etiez-vous all\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement pour le voir? R. J'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire, monsieur Filiatrault avait envoy\u00e9 son petit gar\u00e7on pour me chercher disant que M. Cornellier d\u00e9sirait me donner des instructions.\nQ. A quel titre devait-il vous donner ces instructions? R. Il me donnait ces instructions comme devant \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 sous-officier-rapporteur.\nQ. Aviez-vous raison de vous attendre \u00e0 \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 sous-officier-rapporteur. R. Je n'en savais rien, je n'avais pas eu de commission, seulement on m'avait dit que je devais l'\u00eatre; mais l'officier-rappor-teur ne m'en avait jamais parl\u00e9.\nQ. Veuillez donc raconter \u00e0 la cour ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 entre M. Cornellier et vous? R. Je suis arriv\u00e9 le jour de la nomination, au soir, et M. Cornellier m'a dit qu'il d\u00e9sirait me parler. M. Filiatrault m'a introduit \u00e0 M. Cornellier. M. Cornellier a dit: \"Asseyez-vous; je vous ai fait demander pour vous donner des instructions concernant l'\u00e9lection; on m'a dit que vous deviez \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 officier-rapporteur, et j'ai des instructions \u00e0 vous donner\": Et M. Cornellier a commenc\u00e9 ses instructions, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me dire qu'il y aurait des votes d'object\u00e9s, et que ces objections seraient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l'agent de M. Bain;\nQ. Vous a-t-il mentionn\u00e9 le fait que ces objections devaient \u00eatre imprim\u00e9es ou quelque chose? R. Ces objections \u00e9taient imprim\u00e9es dans le temps. Ensuite il m'a dit: \"Lors que quel qu'un se pr\u00e9sentera pour voter, vous mettrez la premi\u00e8re objection qui vous sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, objection No. 1, ainsi de suite pour les autres.\nQ. Vous a-t-il mentionn\u00e9 quelques noms de personnes, \u00e0 propos de ces objections dans le temps? R. Il m'a mentionn\u00e9 S\u00e9raphin Deschamps, p\u00e8re. Il m'a dit: \"Si Seraphim Deschamps, p\u00e8re, se pr\u00e9sentait,\" et ainsi de suite.\nQ. Si je comprends bien votre r\u00e9ponse, M. Cornellier vous aurait dit de marquer cela sur le dos des bulletins? R. Sur le dos des bulletins, et ensuite au d\u00e9pouillement, mettre les bulletins marqu\u00e9s avec les objections, les mettre sous enveloppe; en ayant soin de mettre sous enveloppe les bulletins \u00e9cart\u00e9s. Et ensuite j'ai demand\u00e9 pour quelle raison. \"La raison, c'est celle-ci, a-t-il dit, c'est que les bulletins iront devant le juge, et le juge d\u00e9cidera si ces bulletins devront servir \u00e0 M. de Beaujeu ou non,\" et alors il m'a lu quelque chose; il m'a lu quelque chose comme quoi il avait raison de faire cela.\nThe conduct of both these parties deserves, in my opinion, the severest condemnation. The agent of the respondent, in the first place, trying privately to induce a person whom he supposed would be appointed deputy returning officer, in case he was so appointed, to violate the law in the interest of the party for whom he was acting; and afterwards privately interfering with a public officer and inducing him to violate the law and his duty under it, and so to act in opposition to what I cannot doubt from his connection in this transaction with the deputy returning officer he must have known, (in fact Prieur swears he told him,) were the instructions of his superior, the returning officer; and the deputy returning officer, in holding private conversations behind the back of his superior officer and advising with an agent of one of the candidates, and acting on such advice by marking ballots of voters with a view to their identification, and so to destroy them and prevent their being counted in the interest of such candidate, (and this, too, on an unfounded pretence that such voters had been judicially disqualified, when, in fact, there had been no such disqualification,) not only in defiance of the law, but in defiance of the officer appointing him, responsible for the appointment of proper persons under him, and in breach of the instructions of his superior and of his promise and undertaking to that officer, that he would act in conformity with the law and his instructions, and without the giving of which promise it is obvious he would never have been appointed.\nI can hardly conceive a more fraudulent device or contrivance in the language of the 95th section of the Dominion Elections Act, \"to impede, prevent, or interfere \"with the free exercise of the franchise of the \"voters.\" This being so, there clearly has been a violation of that section by the terms of which the party guilty of such violation is to be deemed to have committed the offence of undue influence, and which by sec. 98 is declared to be a corrupt practice, and by sec. 101 any corrupt practice committed by a candidate at an election, or by agent, whether with or without the actual knowledge and consent of such candidate, the election of such candidate, if he has been elected, shall be void. I cannot conceive a case which calls more imperatively for the marked condemnation of this court than this, for if tampering with returning officers by candidates or their agents is tolerated, or such combinations and conspiracies to act in direct opposition to the law can be entered into with impunity between candidates or their agents and returning officers, both the letter and spirit of the law is set at nought and an honest, free election becomes an impossibility, if unscrupulous parties choose so to combine, and returning officers can be found to lend themselves to such like schemes and be permitted in their official capacity to carry them out with impunity.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am likewise of opinion that this election must be set aside, and that upon two distinct grounds: First, on the ground of threats to voters and attempts at intimidation; and, secondly, upon the ground that the arrangement come to between Mr. Cornellier and the deputy returning officer to mark the ballots of certain voters, and what was done in pursuance that of arrangement, were acts of improper interference with the exercise of their franchises by those voters within the meaning of sec. 95 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874.\nThe original attempt at intimidation was made at a meeting held at St. Zotique previous to the election, and is referred to in a passage of the judgment of the learned judge who tried the petition\u2014Mr. Justice Johnson\u2014who thus states his conclusion from the evidence:\u2014\nIf there were any doubt as to the meaning of Mr. Cornellier's speech at St. Zotique (and making due allowance for party feeling, I really think that the witnesses on both sides agree pretty much as to what was said), there could be none as to what was really meant; for, unless we assume they meant one thing on one day and another on another day, we have in writing in the notice just what was the position taken by the respondent and his agents in this matter; and it is not pretended that the tenor of the speeches was different from that of the notices.\nThis is a rather more favorable construction than I should have been inclined, had I been dealing with this case in a court of first instance, to have placed on the evidence, but I am willing and, probably, I am bound, according to the principles of dealing with evidence in an appellate court, to accept this finding as conclusive.\nIn addition to this however it was proved that Mr. Cornellier told these electors that if they voted in violation of the law they should be prosecuted. Then, assuming that Mr Cornellier, in his speech at St. Zotique, stated neither more nor less, but just what was contained in the notices subsequently served on the voters in question at the poll, let us see what that statement was in point of fact, and then enquire what we must consider to be its legal effect.\nThe notice served is as follows:\u2014\nJe soussign\u00e9, agent d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 de James William Bain, \u00e9cuyer, l'un des candidats \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9lection, objecte au vote de Charles Ch\u00e2les, fils, de St. Zotique, \u00e9lecteur apparaissant \u00e0 la liste \u00e9lectorale de l'arrondissement No. 8, et qui s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour voter sous le num\u00e9ro huit du cahier de votation du Poll No. 8.\nEt pour raisons au soutien de cette objection, je d\u00e9clare en ma qualit\u00e9 susdite, que je m'objecte \u00e0 ce que le pr\u00e9sent \u00e9lecteur ne donne son vote, attendu que par jugement prononc\u00e9 le six octobre dernier (1883), \u00e0 Coteau Landing, dans la cause de contestation d'\u00e9lection, dans laquelle Stanislas Filiatreault, commer\u00e7ant du Coteau Landing, \u00e9tait p\u00e9titionnaire, et G.

CORNELLIER,\nSt. Zotique, 27 d\u00e9cembre 1883. Agent autoris\u00e9 de J. W. Bain.\nTherefore, adopting the conclusion of the learned judge, that the statement of Mr. Cornellier at the St. Zotique meeting was the equivalent of what was contained in these notices subsequently served, we must take it to be proved that Mr. Cornellier then publicly stated to and of those electors whose names were mentioned in the report made to the Speaker by Mr. Justice Loranger, who tried a former controverted election for the county, that they had been found guilty of corrupt practices under sec. 104 of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874. That section is as follows:\u2014\nAny person, other than a candidate, found guilty of any corrupt practice, in which, after notice of the charge, he has had an opportunity of being heard, shall, during the eight years next after the time at which he is so found guilty, be incapable of being elected to and of sitting in the House of Commons, and of voting at any election of a member of the House of Commons, or of holding any office in the nomination of the Governor General of Canada.\nThen it is the law that any voter who, having been legally disqualified by the judge trying an election petition, afterwards, in contravention of such sentence of disqualification, votes at a subsequent election, is in addition to a liability to an indictment at common law, subject to such penalties as might be imposed by an election judge pursuant to the provisions of sec. 117 of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874.\nSo that it is proved by the clearest evidence, and according to the finding of the judge, that Mr. Cornellier, in his speech at St. Zotique, openly and publicly declared to the voters named in Mr. Judge Loranger's report that they were disqualified from voting, and that if they voted they would be liable to such penalties and punishments as might be imposed by law, which, he further declared, should be enforced by all processes of law which could be taken advantage of against them for those purposes. The assertion of disqualification and threat of punishment in the case of voting thus made, I hold to have been, under the real facts of the case, a practising of intimidation upon the voters named, with a view to induce them to refrain from voting, under the express words of the 95th sec. of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874. It matters not that this attempted intimidation did not succeed, but that all these voters afterwards, and after being advised by others, had the courage, in the face of the intimidation which had been practised and the threats which had been made, to present themselves at the poll and insist upon their votes being received. Nothing is better established in point of law than the proposition that the threat, if made by an agent of the candidate, though unsuccessful in deterring the voter, is sufficient to avoid the election. In the Northallerton case [19] Mr. Justice Willes says:\nA mere attempt on the part of an agent to intimidate a voter, though it was unsuccessful, would avoid an election.\nThen, when the voters came to the poll there was a repetition of the attempt at intimidation which had been practised at the St. Zotique meeting, in a more formal and deliberate way, by serving upon the deputy returning officer, openly and in the presence of the voters, the notice already referred to, calling upon the officer to reject the votes because the voters had been found guilty of corrupt practices and fraudulent devices by the judge who had tried the former petition. Now, it is no answer as a justification of these charges of intimidation to say that the statement of Mr. Cornellier at the meeting, and the assertion to the same effect in the notice, that these persons had been found guilty, as alleged, is literally true, and, that Mr. Justice Loranger had, as the fact was, stated in his report to the Speaker, that they were guilty of corrupt practices. The charge advanced by Mr. Cornellier was, that they had been found guilty of corrupt practices in such a way as to disqualify them from voting, and to make them liable to punishment and penalties if they did vote. The report to the Speaker does not establish anything of the kind. In order to disqualify an elector and make him liable to penalties if he should vote after disqualification, it is made by the 104th section, which I have already stated, an indispensable condition that \"after notice of the charge he shall have had an opportunity of being heard.\" Now, in the present case, it is manifest that this most just, fair and reasonable provision of the law had not been observed. It is true that the electors in question had been served with a notice to appear before Mr. Justice Loranger, and to show cause why they should not be reported as guilty, and that they attempted to set aside this notice, but they never were confronted with the witnesses whose testimony was relied on to prove them guilty, and they never had an opportunity of making their defence, for they never had an opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses against them, which, as will be universally acknowledged, is the most valuable incident of the right of defence which an accused person possesses. The witnesses relied on to prove corrupt practices against these persons may, it is true, have been cross-examined in the principal trial on the main issue\u2014the validity of the election; but it was one thing to cross-examine them on behalf and in the interest of the respondent to the petition, and another and a totally different thing to cross-examine them on behalf of these electors accused of corrupt practices. It is beyond all question that no opportunity was ever afforded for a cross examination of this latter kind, and in the absence of it, it is impossible to say that these persons were ever heard in their defence, or afforded an opportunity of being so heard, sufficient to bring them within the provision of the 104th section. They were, therefore, never legally disqualified, and had an unimpeachable right to vote. I am not prepared to say that Mr. Cornellier did not believe the law was as he stated it to be, or that he knew that the facts did not warrant his statement of the law. So far from imputing to Mr. Cornellier that he knowingly and wilfully misstated either facts or law, I now repeat what I said at the argument, that I believe he acted in perfect good faith, and considered himself justified in making the assertions he did to these persons. But what I hold is, that an agent of a candidate, whether advocate or layman, who undertakes to tell an elector he has no right to exercise his franchise, and will be subject to punishment or penalties if he does so, or who makes representations and assertions to an elector respecting his right to vote calculated to intimidate him and to induce him to refrain from voting, does so at his peril; and that it is incumbent on an agent so acting to be sure that his facts are correct and his law is sound, for in the event of his being in error in either respect his candidate must suffer the consequences. In the present case the right of these electors to vote was impugned on grounds which, on investigation, turn out to be without foundation in point of law and also in point of fact, and consequently the statement that they would be liable to prosecution, and would be prosecuted, if they exercised their franchises, must be regarded as the fulmination of an illegal threat, constituting a practising of intimidation within the meaning of the 95th section, which, by the same section, amounts to undue influence, and, being practised by an admitted agent, must make the election void.\nI also agree with the Chief Justice that the election must be set aside upon the distinct ground mentioned by him, and for reasons in the main identical with those which his lordship has stated.\nThe returning officer only appointed Mr. Prieur to be a deputy returning officer after taking proper and prudent precautions to assure himself that Mr. Prieur, though an open partizan of the respondent's, would act properly at the election. In the interview which the returning officer had with Mr. Prieur, preceding the appointment of the latter, reference was made to these voters mentioned in the report of the judge at the previous trial, and the returning officer exacted from Mr. Prieur a promise that he would not put any marks on the ballots, or do anything in any way to interfere with the votes of these men. Mr. Prieur accepted the office on that promise and understanding, and otherwise it would not have been conferred upon him. Then what does Mr. Prieur do? If nothin further had taken place than his reception of the notices when they were handed to him at the poll, his conduct would have been unobjectionable. Even if he had marked the ballots, there being no preconcerted arrangement that he should do so, his so marking them might, perhaps, have indulgently been attributed to ignorance or to misconception of the somewhat complicated law which regulates elections. But we are precluded by the evidence from making these suppositions, for it is proved beyond doubt or question that in face of the caution he had received from the returning officer, and the promise he gave to act upon it, Mr. Prieur had, before the polling, a private interview and conference with Mr. Cornellier, the agent of the respondent, in which, notwithstanding his promise to his superior officer who had appointed him, not to mark the ballots, he agreed and conspired with Mr. Cornellier to do so. This conduct of the deputy returning officers, pursued in privity with the agent of the respondent, and induced by the irregular and clandestine solicitation of that agent, constitutes a ground for setting aside this election, distinct altogether from that of intimidation and threatening, before disposed of, as being \"a fraudulent device or contrivance impeding, \"preventing, or otherwise interfering with, the exercise \"of the franchise\" of the voters in question within the meaning of the provision of sec. 95, expressed in the words just quoted. In my opinion, a stronger exemplification of the evil which sec. 95 was intended to prevent than that of an agent of a candidate agreeing and conspiring with a returning officer to put a mark on the ballot of a particular voter, by which that ballot might be afterwards identified, could not be suggested. My conclusion therefore is, that on both the grounds indicated the appeal must be allowed, and with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that the election should be set aside for the two reasons given by the learned Chief Justice, for the intimidation which is proved, and also for a fraudulent contrivance to interfere with the freedom of the election.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nAt an election held for this county in 1882, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the previous member, two candidates, deBeaujeu and Bain the present respondent, had contested the seat. The result was a majority of three for deBeaujeu. This election, however, was subsequently voided for corrupt practices by de Beaujeu's agents. A writ was then issued for a new election, which took place on December 27th, 1883, between the same candidates, Bain and de Beaujeu. Bain, the respondent, having been returned by a majority of three, the appellant contested his election by a petition in the usual form, without claiming the seat for deBeaujeu. After a long trial, the presiding judge dismissed the petition, and maintained the election. The petitioner now appeals to this court from the said judgment, limiting his appeal to certain cases only.\nParticular No. 96 is one of these cases. It is in the following terms. [The learned judge read the charge][20].\nIt appears, by the evidence on this charge, that shortly before polling day, Mr. Cornellier, who is admitted to have been the respondent's conducting agent, had a document printed in the following form:\nI, the undersigned, duly authorized agent of James William Bain, Esq., one of the candidates at the present election, object to the vote of of elector appearing on the electoral list of district No. and who has come to vote under No. of the voters' list of the electoral district No. and for reasons in support of this objection, I declare, in my above quality, that I object to the present elector giving his vote, because, by judgment pronounced at Coteau Landing on the 6th October last, in the contested election case in which Stanislas Filiatrault, merchant, of Coteau Landing was petitioner, and G. R. L. G. H. S. de Beaujeu was defendant, and inscribed under No. 3 of the records of the Superior Court sitting under the federal contested Elections Act of 1874 and Acts amending the same, said judgment pronounced by his honor justice Loranger, the said after notice duly served upon him and found sufficient by the said judgment after issue joined was found guilty of corrupt practices according to said act, and reported in consequence to the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, and consequently he has become a disqualified elector (scheduled briber) in the sense of the said federal contested Elections Act of 1874 and amendments, and for eight years, from the 6th October last, that he cannot vote at the present election. I demand also the administering of the oath to the said elector, and also that the present objection should be endorsed on the ballot, which will be given (if any should be given) by the deputy returning officer placing on the back of the ballot (should he deliver one to said voter) a number corresponding to that of the objection, in order that the court may be enabled to revise his decision on a scrutiny.\nIt must be remarked here that this document contains a false statement, and that it was not true that the electors, against whom it was prepared, had been disqualified or deprived of their franchise.\nThis document was made known throughout the county, and a copy of it left by Cornellier with each of the respondent's agents at the different polls. Those of the electors of St. Zotique, mentioned in the charge, who have been examined, had all heard of it, or been told that they had no right to vote, and their ballots would be marked, as demanded by Cornellier.\nBefore the nomination, Cornellier sent for a man named Prieur, who, it was supposed, would be the deputy returning officer at the Coteau Landing poll. Prieurs evidence as to what then passed between him and Cornellier, is as follows:\nQ. Veuillez donc raconter \u00e0 la cour ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 entre M. Cornellier et vous? R. Je suis arriv\u00e9 le jour de la nomination, au soir, et M. Cornellier m'a dit qu'il d\u00e9sirait me parler. M. Filiatrault m'a introduit \u00e0 M. Cornellier. M. Cornellier a dit: \"Asseyez-vous; je vous ai fait demander pour vous donner des instructions concernant l'\u00e9lection; on m'a dit que vous deviez \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 officier-rapporteur, et j'ai des instructions \u00e0 vous donner\": Et M. Cornellier a commenc\u00e9 ses instructions, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me dire qu'il y aurait des votes d'object\u00e9s, et que ces objections seraient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l'agent de M. Bain.\nQ. Vous a-t-il mentionn\u00e9 le fait que ces objections devaient \u00eatre imprim\u00e9es ou quelque chose? R. Ces objections \u00e9taient imprim\u00e9es dans le temps. Ensuite il m'a dit: \"Lorsque quelqu'un se pr\u00e9sentera pour voter, vous mettrez la premi\u00e8re objection qui vous sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, objection No. 1, ainsi de suite pour les autres.\"\nQ. Vous a-t-il mentionn\u00e9 quelques noms de personnes, \u00e0 propos de ces objections dans le temps? R. Il m'a mentionn\u00e9 S\u00e9raphim Deschamps, p\u00e8re. Il m'a dit: \"Si S\u00e9raphim Deschamps, p\u00e8re, se pr\u00e9sentait,\" et ainsi de suite.\nQ. Si je comprends bien votre r\u00e9ponse, M. Cornellier vous aurait dit de marquer cela sur le dos des bulletins? R. Sur le dos des bulletins, et ensuite au d\u00e9pouillement, mettre les bulletins marqu\u00e9s avec les objections, les mettre sous enveloppe; en ayant soin de mettre sous enveloppe les bulletins \u00e9cart\u00e9s. Et ensuite j'ai demand\u00e9 pour quelle raison. \"La raison, c'est celle-ci, a t-il dit, c'est que les bulletins iront devant le juge, et le juge d\u00e9cidera si ces bulletins devront servir \u00e0 M. deBeaujeu ou non,\" et alors il m'a lu quelque chose; il m'a lu quelque chose comme quoi il avait raison de faire cela.\nQ. Apr\u00e8s que M. Cornellier vous eut donn\u00e9 ces instructions, avez-vous, vous-m\u00eame, regard\u00e9 l'Acte Electoral, pour voir si les instructions \u00e9taient correctes? R. Je l'ai regard\u00e9.\nQ. Vous saviez que M. Cornellier \u00e9tait avocat? Q. Je le savais.\nQ. Et avez-vous r\u00e9ellement cru que M. Cornellier vous donnait des instructions v\u00e9ritables et l\u00e9gales dans le temps? R. Je n'avais pas de doute que M. Cornellier me donnait des instructions v\u00e9ritables.\nQ. Est-ce que le num\u00e9ro que vous deviez mettre sur le bulletin devait correspondre avec quelque autre num\u00e9ro? R. Devait correspondre avec l'objection.\nQ. De sorte que, suivant vous, vous pouviez parfaitement identifier celui qui votait? R. Parfaitement.\nAnd this evidence is uncontradicted. Can one imagine conduct more reprehensible than this of a member of the bar, the respondent's chief election agent, so approaching a man whom he expects to be a deputy returning officer, in order to give him his instructions as to this officer's duties, and to tell him how he will have to perform his functions.\nHowever, as to this Coteau Landing No. 1 poll, Cornellier's gratuitous instructions to Prieur were of no effect, as another man Mr. Gladu one who knew his duty, was appointed deputy returning officer.\nIn the St. Zotique poll, however, Cornellier was more successful. Here, Damien Prieur, an active partizan of the respondent, was named deputy returning officer. The returning officer, a man of integrity and against whose conduct nothing can be said, had made it a condition of this nomination that he, Prieur, would not mark any of the ballots as Cornellier desired them to be marked, telling him that such marking would be contrary to law. It was only on the promise by Prieur to follow those instructions of the returning officer, that he was appointed deputy returning officer. On the very morning of the polling day, however, he promised Cornellier that, as he, Cornellier, insisted that the ballots of those who were disqualified could be legally marked, he Prieur would mark them. And he did mark them. He did not hesitate to ignore the instructions of his superior officer, and the promise he had made to get his appointment in order to put himself into the hands of the respondent's agent and obey his desires and dictations. His oath of office had evidently not deprived the respondent of a partizan.\nWhat actually took place at the poll is as follows:\u2014 Prieur, before delivering ballots, to any of the objected voters marked on the back of the ballot the words, \"objected to by objection No. \" placing upon the ballot a number which corresponded with the number of the objection. In this way, the eight ballots of the above named voters were marked with identifying numbers, and Prieur says he put them in his pocket.\nThis was done in spite of a written protest from the opposing candidate's agents.\nHearing of this proceeding, the returning officer, in the afternoon, wrote a letter to Prieur, severely reprimanding him and telling him he would have to answer for his conduct.\nOn receipt of this letter, which was coupled with an order by the election clerk, who delivered it, to place it of record among the documents of the poll, Prieur handed it to Mr. Cornellier, who perused it; the other representative asked permission to see it, but this Prieur refused, and put the letter in his pocket where it remained.\nAfter the close of the poll Prieur getting nervous, probably, and afraid of the consequences of his illegal acts, took out the eight objections produced before him and endorsed them \"objection dismissed.\" He then counted as good the marked ballots which he had in his pocket and put them in this box. Mr. Champagne says they all identified the votes.\n\"Put the ballots in his pocket.\" That is what this deputy returning officer has to confess he did under the guidance of the respondent's conducting agent. And this in face of an enactment in which no one has ever dreamt of an ambiguity, that the deputy returning officer \"shall then immediately, and in the presence of the elector, place the ballot paper in the ballot box\"[21].\nAs to the marking of these ballots, I need not say anything to prove its utter illegality. It had to be admitted before the court by the respondent's counsel.\nNow, it seems to me, that it can hardly be possible to bring clearer evidence of fraudulent contrivances to prevent voters from exercising their franchise. That this agent's object was to prevent these voters from voting at all, if possible, is made abundantly clear by a number of witnesses examined in the case, who all testify that he did not cease repeating publicly and privately during the election the false statement that these men had no right to vote; that if they voted, legal measures would be taken against them; and that if they came to the polls, their votes would be objected to, and if received at all by the deputy returning officer, would be distinctly marked so as to be identified. These witnesses, however, on this only proved what the printed notice says in unequivocal terms.\nThis marking of the ballots at the instigation of the principal agent of the respondents, taken in connection with the notice issued by the said agent with the intention to prevent these voters from voting at all, or, if voting, from voting as their fellow citizens did, under the protection of secrecy guaranteed to them by the Ballot Act, was a fraudulent device or contrivance to impede, prevent and interfere with the free exercise of the franchise of these voters, and a corrupt practice under section 95 of the Act. Whether or not this contrivance was successful, is immaterial.\nA mere attempt on the part of an agent to intimidate a voter, even though it were unsuccessful, would avoid an election[22].\nIf there was a fraudulent device of any sort to prevent a voter voting a certain way, even though unsuccessful, it would amount to a fraudulent device to interfere with the free exercise of the franchise[23].\nAnd whether these acts of the respondent's agent affected the result of the election or not, is also immaterial. A single act of corrupt practice by an agent avoids the election.\nThe contention that this election-agent acted in good faith and under the impression that these voters had really no right to vote, that he could legally ask from the deputy-returning officer the marking of their ballots, and the putting of these ballots in the deputy returning officer's pockets, and that consequently his acts should not avoid the election, cannot be admitted. When any one accepts for a candidate the responsibility of the complete organization and carrying out of an election, as this agent did in this county, he must be presumed to undertake that, as far as he himself and all those over whom he has any control are concerned, everything shall be conducted according to law. He undertakes to perform the duties, and all the duties, of an election agent, according to law, and he cannot later on be excused for any infraction of these duties, by saying that he ignored them; he is estopped from doing so. If he did ignore them, it is culpable negligence in him, of which he cannot take advantage; and to him with more force than to any one else in that election applies the maxim, ignorantia juris non excusat.[24]. The election laws might as well be repealed, if such a defence could prevail.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs, and this election avoided with costs of the petition and trial thereof in the election court against the respondent.\nHad this charge of fraudulent contrivance under sec. 95 not been established, the election would still have had to be set aside on the charge of intimidation, as shown by Mr. Justice Strong's judgment, in which I entirely concur.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Monk & Ryan.\nSolicitors for respondent: Ouimet, Cornellier & Lajoie.\n[1] 3 Q.

At the time of its insolvency the bank was indebted to Her Majesty in the sum of $93,494.20, being part of the public moneys of Canada which had been deposited by several departments of the government to the credit of the Receiver General. The first claim filed by the Minister of Finance at the request of the respondents (liquidators of the bank), did not specially notify the liquidators that Her Majesty would insist upon the privilege of being paid in full. Two dividends of 15 per cent, each were afterwards paid, and on the 28th February, 1884, there was a balance due of $65,426.95. On that day the respondents were notified that Her Majesty intended to insist upon her prerogative right to be paid in full. At this time the liquidators had in their hands a sum sufficient to pay in full Her Majesty's claim. The following objection to the claim was allowed by the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, viz: \" That Her Majesty, the Queen, represented by the Minister of Finance and the Receiver General, has no prerogative or other right to receive from the liquidators of the Bank of Prince Edward Island the whole amount due to Her Majesty, as claimed by the proof thereof, and has only a right to receive dividends as an ordinary creditor of the above banking company.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld,\u2014(Reversing the judgment of the court below):\u2014\n1. That the crown claiming as a simple contract creditor has a right to priority over other creditors of equal degree. This prerogative privilege belongs to the crown as representing the Dominion of Canada, when claiming as a creditor of a provincial corporation in a provincial court, and is not taken away in proceedings in insolvency by 45 Vic, ch. 23.\n2. That the crown had not waived its right to be preferred in this case by the form in which the claim was made, and by the acceptance of two dividends.\nAPPEAL from an order or decision of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, made and given on the third day of November, A.D. 1884. The following is the special case:\u2014\n''The President, Directors and Company of the Bank of Prince Edward Island \" were a banking corporation, incorporated by the Legislature of Prince Edward Island by an Act, passed in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, intituled: \"An Act to incorporate sundry persons by the name of 'The President, Directors and Company of the Bank of Prince Edward Island.' \"\nThe said company, from the time of its incorporation, until its insolvency, hereinafter mentioned, transacted a banking business in Prince Edward Island.\nOn the first day of July, A.D. 1873, Prince Edward Island became part of the Dominion of Canada.\nThe Bank of Prince Edward Island never came under the provisions of any of the Banking Acts of the Parliament of Canada, but the Parliament acknowledged its existence by the passage of an Act, in the forty-fifth year of the present reign, ch. 56, intituled: \"An Act for the Relief of the Bank of Prince Edward Island.\"\nThe said Bank of Prince Edward Island became insolvent, and, on the nineteenth day of June, A.D. 1882, an order was made by the Hon. James Horsfield Peters, one of the judges of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, for the winding up of the said bank, under the provisions of the Act, 45 Vic., ch. 23, intituled: \"An Act respecting Insolvent Banks, Insurance Companies, Loan Companies, Building Societies and Trading Corporations.\"\nThe Bank of Prince Edward Island, at the time of its insolvency, was indebted to Her Majesty in the sum of $93,494.20, being part of the public moneys of Canada, which had been deposited by several departments of the Government, to the credit of the Receiver-General.\nThe respondents do not deny that the bank, at the time of its insolvency, owed her Majesty $93,496.20 of the public moneys of Canada, deposited to the credit of the Receiver-General, and the only question arising for decision now is: Is Her Majesty entitled to be paid in full? In other words, is Her Majesty a privileged creditor, or must she rank as an ordinary creditor and take a pro rata amount?\nIt is agreed between Her Majesty and the respondents that the question to be raised and decided on the present appeal shall be:\u2014\nIs Her Majesty, in her Government of Canada, entitled to be paid the full amount of the said indebtedness of the insolvent company to her, in priority to the simple contract creditors of the said insolvent company?\nIf the Supreme Court of Canada decide that Her Majesty is so entitled, then the appeal is to be allowed, and the respondents ordered to pay the said indebtedness in full.\nThe Bank of Prince Edward Island became insolvent, and the winding-up order was made on the 19th June, 1882.\nThe first claim filed by the Minister of Finance, at the request of the respondents, did not specially notify the liquidators that Her Majesty would insist upon her privilege of being paid in full.\nTwo dividends of 15 per cent, each were afterwards paid, and on the 28th of February, 1884, there was a balance due of $65,426.95, over and above the $30,000. On that day (28th February, 1884) Mr. Hodgson acting for the Crown, notified the respondents that Her Majesty intended to insist upon her prerogative right to be paid in full.\nAt the time of serving this notice the liquidators had in their hands a sum sufficient to pay Her Majesty's claim in full.\nA more formal demand for preference was made on the 17th March, 1884.\nThe objections to Her Majesty's claim (filed by leave of Mr. Justice Peters) were heard before him. The first objection is:\u2014\n\"That Her Majesty the Queen, represented as aforesaid\" (by the Minister of Finance and the Receiver-General) \"has no prerogative or other right to receive from the liquidators of the above-named banking company the whole amount due to Her Majesty, as claimed by the proof thereof, dated the 8th day of March, A.D. 1884, and has only a right to receive dividends as an Ordinary creditor of the above-named banking company.\"\nThis objection was allowed.\nFrom the order allowing this objection, an appeal was taken (under sec. 78 of 45 Vic., ch. 23) to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island.\nThat court, by order dated 4th November, 1884, affirmed Mr. Justice Peters' order, and dismissed the appeal.\nPermission to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from this order was granted by Mr. Justice Strong on the 26th day of November, 1884.\nG. W. Burbidge, Q.C., and E. J. Hodgson, Q.C., for appellant:\nIt has been established beyond dispute, that when the rights of the Crown and of the subject concur, that of the Crown is to be preferred. Chitty on Prerogatives ([1]).\nThe Queen, as the head of the Government of Canada is invested with all her prerogatives, and will not be held to be deprived of any of them by parliament, unless the intention to do so is expressed in explicit terms, or the inference is inevitable ([2]); Lenoir v. Ritchie ([3]); Cushing v. Dupuy ([4]); Johnston v. Ministers and Trustees of St. Andrew's Church ([5]); Theberge v. Landry ([6]); Harlington, Marquis of V. Bowerman ([7]).\nThe court below conceived itself bound by the winding-up Act, 45 Vic., ch. 23, to order the distribution of the assets equally, even as against the Queen.\nNow we admit that the Crown is bound by a statute \"made for the public good, the advancement of religion and justice, and to prevent injury and wrong,\" without being expressly named. Bac. Abr. Prerogative ([8]); The King v. Wright ([9]). But the statute under which this insolvent bank is being wound up (45 Vic. ch. 23) is not a statute within these exceptions.\nIn re Henley ([10]) is decisive upon the question at issue in this case ([11]).\nOn the question of estoppel we contend:\n(a) that estoppels do not bind the Crown. Chitty on Prerogatives ([12]); Regina v. Renton ([13]); The Queen v. Fay ([14]).\nSee the remarks of Mr. Justice Strong in The Queen V. McFarlane ([15])\n(b) That in this case there has been no election.\nThe receiving of the indebtedness by instalments was a mutual convenience.\nThe court below decided that the prerogative right to be paid in full is in the Government of Prince Edward Island, to the exclusion of the Queen in her Government of Canada, and that had this been an indebtedness to the former Government, and proper proceedings taken to make it a record debt, it would have been entitled to preference over all other creditors.\nThe learned judge, in the court below, has misapprehended the preamble to the British North America Act, when he says: \"It is true that the provinces have given executive power to the Dominion over subjects before belonging to them, but by the convention recited in this preamble they are to have a constitution similar to that of England regarding her colonies, with respect to the subjects retained, and, if so, the Lieutenant-Governors must have the Queen's prerogative still vested in them.\" It is not the Provinces, but the Dominion of Canada, which the preamble declares is to have a constitution ''similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom:'' City of Fredericlon v. The Queen ([16]).\nThe whole judgment of the court below is based on this fallacy.\nThe fact of the insolvent bank being a local institution does not affect the question to be decided. If moneys due to the Crown were in the possession of a commercial firm or private individuals, residing and doing business in Prince Edward Island, and they became insolvent, the Queen would not be deprived of her prerogative right to be paid in preference to other creditors on the ground that the commercial firm or the private individual had never been brought under the control or influence of the Dominion Government.\nR. Filzgerald, Q.C., and A. Peters for respondent:\nThe Crown's claim to a preference arises under what are termed the minor prerogatives of the Crown, which do not extend to this province. See Attorney General v. Judah ([17]).\nThe right of the Crown in relation to all such minor prerogatives can only be exercised in Prince Edward Island by the Queen in her government thereof, and for the benefit of the province. This would clearly have been the case before confederation, and there is nothing in the British North America Act conferring on the Government of Canada the right to exercise these prerogatives.\nThe autonomy of the provinces is preserved by the British North America Act, and their several Lieutenant-Governors represent the Queen in the performance of many executive prerogative and administrative acts. It is contended that the prerogative here claimed (if it exists) is vested in the Lieutenant-Governor, and cannot be exercised both by the Provincial and the Dominion Governments. If such a right existed in both Governments their several interests might clash, and in case of deficiency of assets must clash. Supposing such a contest, can it be contended that the provincial prerogative, which existed previous to confederation, has been taken away without express enactment. Attorney General v. Mercer ([18]); Holmes v. Regina ([19]).\nAt confederation only such of the prerogatives as were necessary for carrying on the general government of Canada, became vested in the Governor General, and the prerogative right to a preference here claimed is not necessary for such purpose.\nThe Crown's claim in this case clearly arises out of a simple trading contract, the Crown dealing with the bank as an ordinary customer, and in such case we contend the Crown has no privilege over any other creditor. Attorney General v. Black ([20]); Monk v. Ouimet ([21]).\nAnother ground for affirming the judgment is that the Crown, in this case, elected to prove their claim under the Winding-up Act, and to stand in the same position as other creditors, and having done so, cannot now revoke their election and claim a preference. See Bigelow on Estoppel ([22]); also, argument in re Bonham ([23]).\nIt is further submitted, that even if the Crown has a legal preference, the proper course has not been taken to enforce it, and that before such preference can be enforced the debt must be made a debt of record and writ of extent must issue. Manning's Exch. Practice ([24]); Chitty on Prerogatives ([25]); West on Extents ([26]); Doe dem. Hayne v. Redfern ([27]). In relation to the $30,000 draft, under no circumstances can the Government of Canada now claim any prerogative right. So far as liquidation proceedings are concerned, the Bank of Montreal is the only creditor therefor, and with the consent of the government were duly settled on the list of the creditors of said bank by order of the Judge in liquidation.\nE. J. Hodgson, Q.C., in reply:\u2014\nWhen the bank became insolvent, there was no dispute as to its indebtedness to the Crown, nor is there any now. The matter of the $30,000 is not a disputed indebtedness; the Bank of Prince Edward Island admits owing the money; the contest is, who is to rank as a creditor, the Bank of Montreal or the Queen?\nRITCHIE, C J.:\u2014\nThe debts due by the insolvent bank to \"the various persons and corporations\" are due by simple contract only.\nThe ground upon which Mr. Justice Peters has rested his judgment is stated by him as follows:\u2014\nI have now gone through the various points raised by the issues, and I wish to observe, that although some of my observations may apply to provincial banks and corporations generally, the ground on which I rest my decision is, that the insolvent bank is a purely local institution, never brought under the control or influence of the Dominion Government in any way, and whose claim is, therefore, a civil right of a merely local and private nature in this province. Whether a provincial bank, holding its charter from the Dominion Government or brought under the Dominion Bank Act, would occupy the same position, is a question not before me, and on which I, therefore, express no opinion.\nThe claim of the Crown must be dismissed with costs, and I order that the costs, when taxed, be deducted from the dividend now ready to be paid to the Receiver-General of the Dominion.\nThis, it appears to me, is conclusively answered in the factum of the appellant, where it is said:\u2014\n\"The appellant contends that the fact of the insolvent bank being a local institution does not affect the question to be decided. If moneys due to the Crown were in the possession of a commercial firm or private individuals residing and doing business in Prince Edward Island, and they became insolvent, the Queen would not be deprived of her prerogative right to be paid in preference to other creditors, on the ground that the commercial firm or the private individuals had never been brought under the control or influence of the Dominion Government.\"\nI do not think there can be a doubt that the Crown is entitled at common law to a preference in a case such as this, for when the rights of the Crown come in conflict with the right of a subject in respect to the payment of debts of equal degree, the right of the Crown must prevail, and the Queen's prerogative in this respect, in this Dominion of Canada, is as exclusive as it is in England, the Queen's rights and prerogatives extending to the colonies in like manner as they do to the mother country.\nI am at a loss to conceive how the acceptance of two dividends on account of the indebtedness of the bank to the Crown, can deprive the Crown of payment of its claim in full, there being sufficient funds, independent of the two dividends, to satisfy the Crown's demand in full. It is unquestionable that no laches can be imputed to the Crown; the interests of the Crown are certain and permanent, and, as it is said, \"it must not suffer by the negligence of its servants or by the compacts or combinations with the opposite party.\" There is no pretence for saying that there ever was any waiver of the prerogative rights of the Crown by the Deputy-Receiver General, nor that he had any power or authority to waive them; and if the officers of the Crown, in receiving the dividends, should have insisted on payment in full, and did not do so, this could not enure to the detriment of the crown. As the Crown cannot be prejudiced by the misconduct or negligence of any of its officers, so neither can an officer give consent that shall prejudice the rights of the Crown. He could not give an express consent that could prejudice the rights of the Crown, still less, impliedly waive the Crown's rights.\nThe Deputy Receiver General might have refused the dividends and insisted on payment in full. That claim is not to be barred or extinguished; for, as has been said, no laches can be attributed to the Crown, and the Crown cannot be deprived of its prerogative right by any neglect of its subordinate officers; but here there was neither laches nor neglect. The receipt of a portion of the Crown's claim by instalment may have been, and, as suggested, probably was for the mutual convenience and benefit of all parties, and was no abandonment of the Crown's rights, or election on the part of the Crown to be paid ratably with the other creditors.\nI think this case too clear on principle to require authority ([28]), and if modern authorities are required the cases in Giles v. Grover; in re Henley and in re Oriental Bank are directly in point\nIn Giles v. Grover ([29]), Alderson, J., says:\nThe next prerogative of the Crown about which I apprehend there is no dispute is, that, where the right of the Crown and the subject concur, that of the Crown is to be preferred; a prerogative depending, first, on the principle that no laches is to be imputed to the king, who is supposed by our law to be so engrossed by public business as not to be able to take care of any private affair relating to his revenue; and, secondly, on the ground that by the King is, in reality, to be understood the nation at large, to whose interests that of any private individual ought to give way. In the quaint language of Lord Coke, Thesaurus Regis est firmamentum pacis et fundamentum belli. And until restrained by various enactments of the statute law, this prerogative extended to prevent the other creditors of the King's debtor from suing him, and the King's debtor from making any will of his personal effects without special leave first obtained from the Crown. But without farther adverting to the ancient state of the prerogative, it is clear that at this day the rule is, that if the two rights come in conflict that of the Crown is to be preferred.\nIf, however, the right of the subject be complete and perfect before that of the King commences, it is manifest that the rule does not apply, for there is no point of time at which the two rights are in conflict; nor can there be a question which of the two ought to prevail in a case where one, that of the subject, has prevailed already. But if, whilst the right of the subject is still in progress towards completion, the right of the Crown arises, it seems to me that two rights do come into conflict together at one and the same time, and that the consequence in that case is, that the right of the Crown ought to prevail. Lord Mansfield expresses this proposition in shorter language when he says: No inception of an execution can bar the Crown. Cooper v. Chitty ([30]).\nIn re Henley & Co. ([31]), James, L.J.:\nIt appears to me clear on every principle that the Crown is not bound by the Companies Act, 1862, not being specially mentioned in it. * * * Whenever the right of the Crown and the right of a subject with respect to payment of a debt of equal degree come into competition, the Crown's right prevails. Whether, therefore, the debt is treated as a debt of record, or of specialty, or of simple contract, there being a right of priority in the Crown, it is right that the debt should be paid.\nBrett, L.J.:\nI am of the same opinion. There are two prerogatives of the Crown bearing upon this question. The first is that the Crown is not bound by a statute in which it is not specially mentioned. Therefore the Crown is not bound by the Companies Act. It follows that, this being clearly a debt for which the Crown can distrain, its powers of distress are not taken away by the Act, and it can proceed to distrain in this case. It is, therefore, right that the debt should be paid in priority to other creditors. But suppose we regard it merely as a simple contract debt; then in the administration of the assets of the company the Crown comes into competition with the other simple contract creditors, and then the other prerogative to which I have alluded comes in, namely, that in competition with subjects the right of the Crown must prevail. Therefore, in which ever way we look at the question, I think the Crown ought to be paid this debt in priority.\nIn re Oriental Bank Corporation ex parle The Crown ([32]).\nMcNaughton, Q.C., and W. Latham, for the liquidator:\nWe are willing to concede that the prerogative of the Crown in the colonies is as high as in this country.\nChitty, J.:\nIt is settled law that on the construction of the Companies Act, 1862, the Crown is not bound, the Crown not being named, and there being no necessary implication arising from the Act itself by which the Crown's prerogative is affected or taken away. That is the short statement of the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of in re Henley ([33]). In that case there were two prerogatives brought into question\u2014the one was the prerogative of the Crown, when assets had to be administered, to priority over the subject. It was held that that prerogative was not taken away. The other was the prerogative which the Crown, not being bound by the statute, had notwithstanding the statute, to issue process. That was also held not to be taken away.\nThe 98th section of the Act of 1862 contains an enactment that the court shall cause the assets of the company to be collected and applied in discharge of its liabilities. Now, the fund to be administered would consist, by virtue of the decision in In re Henley & Co., of the whole of the assets of the company, if the Crown came in under the liquidation, and sought to prove and the Crown would then retain its rights of priority as against the other creditors. But if the Crown stood out and insisted on its prerogative, then the assets to be administered would be the assets of the company, less that portion of the assets which the Crown had taken away.\nNo distinction was drawn in argument, and very property, between the rights and prerogatives of the crown suing in respect of Imperial rights, and the rights of the Crown with regard to the colonies.\nIn re Baleman's trust, Sir James Bacon, V.C., said:\nI cannot hesitate to say and to decide, that the Queen's prerogative is as extensive in Now South Wales as it is here, in this county of Middlesex. It has been contended that the title of the Crown by forfeiture was confined to this soil\u2014the soil of England. But the Queen is as much the Queen of New South Wales as she is the Queen of England, and I must hold that every right which the Queen possessed by forfeiture extended as much to the colonies as to this country.\nThe learned judge in the court below referred to what I said in Atty.-Gen. v. Mercer ([34]) as to the Lieut.-Governors of provinces representing, in a limited manner, the Crown. To all that I said in the case referred to by the learned judge I still adhere, but what I then said has no bearing on the present case, but must be read with reference to the cases I was then considering. In regard to the case before us, I may say I can discover nothing in the B.N.A. Act which takes away from Her Majesty the prerogative right in regard to debts due Her Majesty in the Dominion of Canada of an Imperial character, or in relation to the Government of Canada.\nNo question arises in this case as to the rights of the Local Government, should it be a creditor, or of the relative rights of the Dominion and Provincial Governments, should both be creditors, with assets only sufficient to pay one, as has been suggested. It will be quite time enough to deal with these questions when they arise.\nSTRONG, J.:\nFour questions are raised by this appeal. First, the right of the Crown, claiming as a simple contract creditor, to priority over other creditors of equal degree, as a general rule, of English law, is disputed. Secondly, assuming the Crown to have this right according to the general rule it is denied that such a prerogative privilege appertains to the Crown, as representing the dominion of Canada, when claiming as a creditor of a provincial corporation in a provincial court. Thirdly, it is insisted that the priority of the Crown, even if it exists and applies in favor of the Crown in its government of Canada, as regards ordinary proceedings for the recovery of debts at common law, is taken away by the Act of Parliament (45 Vic. ch. 23) under which the present proceedings in insolvency are being taken. And lastly, it is urged, that, failing all of the preceding contentions, the Crown has, in the present instance, by the form in which its claim was made and by the acceptance of the two dividends already declared, waived its right to be preferred to other simple contract creditors.\nIn my opinion, the Crown is entitled to succeed on every one of these points, and that upon authority so clear and decisive as to leave little room even for argument on the part of the liquidators.\nThe rule of law formulated in the maxim Quando jus domini regis et subdili concurrunt, jus regis prceferri debet we find propounded by Lord Coke in 9 Rep. 129, and also in Co. Litt. 30b, and recognized in many later authorities ([35]): and its existence at the present day, as a well established principle of the constitutional law of the Empire relating to the royal prerogative, was distinctly recognized and acted on by the English Court of Appeal in the late case of Re Henley ([36]), decided as recently as 1879. This case of Re Henley has been said, not to be a decision upon the point in question, but a mere dictum. This is not so, for the report of the case itself, as well as later judicial recognition and comments, shows that the right of the Crown, as a simple contract creditor, to priority over other simple contract creditors, was one of the rationes decidendi upon which all of the three eminent judges who decided it proceeded. That case arose under a \"winding-up\" proceeding under the Companies Act, 1862. The claim of the Crown was for arrears of income tax, in respect of which it had a right of distress. Vice-Chancellor Malins, in a long judgment, which need not be particularly referred to, held that the Crown was only entitled to payment out of the assets of the company rateably with other creditors of like degree. The Crown appealed, and, although the arguments of counsel are not given in extenso in the report, it is apparent, from the authorities cited, that the right of the Crown was rested, not merely on the statutory right of distress, but also on the general preference which is now in question; and that the judgment of the court proceeded as much on one of these grounds as on the other, is apparent from the language of the learned judges.\nJames, L.J. says:\nBut if the matter is treated as a matter solely of administration of assets under the direction of the court, I think it is also right. When ever the right of the Crown and the right of a subject with respect to the payment of a debt of equal degree come into competition, the Crown's right prevails. Whether, therefore, the debt is treated as a debt of record or of specialty, or of simple contract, there being a right of priority in the Crown, it is right that the debt should be paid.\nBrett, L. J. says:\nBut suppose we regard it merely as a simple contract debt: then, in the administration of the assets of the company, the Crown comes into competition with the other simple contract creditors, and then the other prerogative to which I have alluded comes in, namely, that in competition with subjects the right of the Crown must prevail. Therefore, in whatever way we look at the question, I think the Crown ought to be paid this debt in priority.\nCotton, L.J. concludes his judgment as follows:\nBut if the case is looked at as one in which the Crown submits to come in under the administration of assets in the winding-up, there is still the right which the Crown has, when in competition with other creditors, of being paid in priority. These extracts show conclusively, that the principle now disputed was one on which the judgement in Re Henley was based by all the judges who took part in the ultimate decision of that case. Further, if anything additional is wanting to show that what the judges who decided Re Henley say in the quotations before given were no mere dicta, the case of The Oriental Bank Corporation ex parte The Crown ([37]) may be cited. Chitty, J., who decided the last-mentioned case, referring to Re Henley, says:\u2014\nIn that case there were two prerogatives brought into question: the one was the prerogative of the Crown, when assets had to be administered, to priority over the subject. It was held that such priority was not taken away.\nAnd again:\nNow the fund to be administered would consist, by virtue of the decision in Re Henley, of the whole of the assets of the company, if the Crown came in under the liquidation and sought to prove, and the Crown would then retain its right of priority as against the other creditors.\nThese observations of Mr. Justice Chitty show that he recognized the authority of Re Henley as determining the point which now calls for decision; but, further than this, it appears that, without question by the counsel for the liquidator, Mr. Justice Chitty acted on this view of the effect of Re Henley, and in this same case of the Oriental Bank Corporation gave the Crown priority in respect of simple contract debts over other simple contract creditors.\nIt being thus demonstrated by satisfactory authorities that the Crown has the right of precedence now claimed, according to the fundamental doctrines of English constitutional law, is any distinction to be made in applying such a rule in England and in the province of Prince Edward Island? That the law of England is the rule of decision in the province has not been and cannot be disputed, nor has it been pretended (save as regards the very statute now in question, a matter to be separately considered here after) that by any express and direct legislation, provincial, federal or imperial, the rights of the Crown, as applicable in Prince Edward Island, have been in any way interfered with. Authorities which it would be useless to quote, so familiar are they, establish, that, in a British colony governed by English law, the Crown possesses the same prerogative rights as it has in England, in so far as they are not abridged or impaired by local legislation, and that, even in colonies not governed by English law, and which, having been acquired to the Crown of Great Britain by cession or conquest, have been allowed to remain under the government of their original foreign laws, all prerogative rights of the Crown are in force, except such minor prerogatives as may conflict with the local law. The two decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec Monk V. Ouimet ([38]) and Attorney-General v. Judah ([39]) may, perhaps, be referred to this distinction. Then, if the Crown's right of priority has been taken away in Prince Edward Island, it can, apart from the provisions of the Insolvent Act, only be by some of, the provisions of the British North America Act. The most careful scrutiny of that statute will not, however, lead to the discovery of a single word expressly interfering with those rights, and it is a well settled axiom of statutory interpretation, that the rights of the Crown cannot be altered to its prejudice by implication, a point which will have to be considered a little more fully here-after, but which, it may be said at present, affords a conclusive answer to any argument founded on the British North America Act. Putting aside this rule altogether, I deny, however, that there is anything in the Imperial legislation of 1867 warranting the least inference or argument that any rights which the Crown possessed at the date of confederation, in any province becoming a member of the dominion, were intended to be in the slightest degree affected by the statute; it is true, that the prerogative rights of the Crown were by the statute apportioned between the provinces and the dominion, but this apportionment in no sense implies the extinguishment of any of them, and they therefore continue to subsist in their integrity, however their locality might be altered by the division of powers contained in the new constitutional law. It follows, therefore, that the Crown, speaking generally, still retains this right to payment in priority to other creditors of equal degree in Prince Edward Island.\nIt is. said, however, that, whilst the last proposition may be true as regards the rights of the Crown as representing the provincial government of the Island, it does not apply to the Crown as representing, as in the present case it does, the government of the dominion. This objection is concluded by authority still more decisive than the former. That the Crown is at the head of the government of the dominion, by which I mean that Her Majesty the Queen is, in her own royal person, the head of that government, and not her Viceroy, the Governor General, there can be no doubt or question, for it is in so many words declared by the ninth section of the British North America Act, which enacts\u2014 \"The Executive Government and authority in and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.\"\nThat, for the purpose of entitling itself to the benefit of its prerogative rights, the Crown is to be considered as one and indivisible throughout the Empire, and is not to be considered as a quasi-corporate head of several distinct bodies politic (thus distinguishing the rights and privileges of the Crown as the head of the government of the United Kingdom from those of the Crown as head of the government of the dominion, and, again, distinguishing it in its relations to the Dominion and to the several provinces of the dominion) is a point so settled by authority as to be beyond controversy. In the case already referred to of the Oriental Bank Corporation ([40]) this very point occurred, and the counsel who opposed the contention of the Crown, with the approval of the learned judge, declined to argue it. The claim of the Crown there was to priority, over simple contract creditors, in respect of a simple contract debt (amongst others) due to it in right of its government of the colony of Victoria\u2014a colony possessing a constitutional government; and the counsel for the liquidator, so far from drawing any distinction between the claims of the Crown in respect of its Imperial rights, or as representing colonies, and as representing Victoria, say: \"We are quite willing to concede that the prero\u00adgative of the Crown in the colonies is as high as in this country;\" and the learned judge (Mr. Justice Chitty) says, at the end of his judgment:\u2014\nNo distinction was drawn in argument, and very properly, between the rights and prerogatives of the Crown suing in respect of Imperial rights and the rights of the Crown with regard to the colonies.\nIn re Bateman ([41]), the Crown claimed in England the goods and personal property of a felon, as for a forfeiture on a conviction for felony in the colony of New South Wales, and it was there seriously argued, that the rights accruing to the Crown under such forfeiture were not enforceable in England. The court (Bacon. V.C.), however, entirely rejected this contention, and determined that the rights of the Crown were not to be considered divisible according to the several governments and jurisdictions into which the Empire is apportioned, but that prerogative rights, accruing to it in one jurisdiction, may be enforced against persons and property anywhere throughout the Queen's dominions. To these authorities may also be added the well known cases which have determined that the benefit of the prerogative applies when the Crown sues nominally, though entirely in the interests of private parties, upon recognizances given by, or as security for, receivers and committees of lunatics, in which cases it has long been the universal practice to treat such debts as debts of record due to the Crown, entitling the parties interested to the benefit of the Crown's title to priority in respect of that class of obligations. It is therefore safe to conclude, as a general proposition of law, that whenever a demand may properly be sued for in the name of the Queen, the prerogative rights of the Crown attach in all portions of the British Empire subject to the prevalence of English law, irrespective of the locality in which the debt arose and of the government in right of which it accrued.\nIt is, however, said, that this right of the Crown to priority over other creditors, in a case like the present, where the assets of an insolvent banking company are being administered under the statute 45 Vic., ch. 23, is taken away by the necessary effect of the statute making equality the rule of distribution. The general rule for the construction of statutes, when the prerogatives of the Crown are in question, is thus stated in a work of authority ([42]):\u2014\nWhere a statute is general and thereby any prerogative, right, title, or interest, is divested or taken away from the King, in such case the King shall not be bound, unless the statute is made by express words to extend to him ([43]). In the case of re Bonham, ex parte The Postmaster General ([44]), it was held that the Crown, though named in some of the provisions of the English Bankruptcy Act, 1869, was not bound by provisions in which it was not expressly named. And in the cases re Oriental Bank and re Henley, before cited, it was held, that the Crown was not bound by the winding-up clauses of the Companies Act, 1862.\nBy the 150th section of the English Bankruptcy Act, 1883, the priority of the Crown is expressly taken away.\nThese authorities, which could be multiplied to any extent, are sufficient citations in point to exemplify a rule so familiar as that just stated.\nThen, applying it here, there is no pretence for saying that the Crown is bound by the Act under which these proceedings are taken. In no one clause of the Act is the Crown named, and it can be no more said that, by necessary implication, it includes the Crown than the same could have been said of the English Bankruptcy and Companies Acts, which, as just shown, do not affect the Crown.\nThe last and most untenable of all the points which have been made against this appeal is, that the Crown has waived and abandoned its priority by the way in which it proved, and by accepting the two dividends of 15 per cent. each. I have examined the claim, but find nothing in it indicating any intention of waiver, even if the rights of the Crown could be waived in this way, which I doubt. As regards the acceptance of the dividends, that, under the admitted fact stated in the case, that at the time of serving the notice claiming payment in full, on the 28th February, 1884, a date long subsequent to the receipt of the last dividend, the liquidators had in their hands a sum sufficient to pay the Crown in full, can amount to no more than a creditor receiving part payment, which surely does not amount to waiver.\nMy conclusion is, that the order of the court below must be reversed, and an order allowing the claim of the Crown to be paid in full substituted for it, with costs both in this court and the court below.\nFournier, J.:\nFor the reasons given by the Chief Justice, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nHenry, J.:\nI never had any difficulty in this case. There is no authority, that I can find, in opposition to the principle that where the claim of the Crown under a simple contract and the claim of a subject under a simple contract conflict, the Crown has precedence. So, whatever may be the degree of the claim, when the Crown is otherwise on an equal footing with the subject, the decisions have always been that the Crown is entitled to precedence. The Crown represented in the dominion and the Crown represented in Prince Edward Island\u2014in fact, in each of the provinces\u2014might possibly have claims against the same debt. What proportion should be allotted to each in such a case would be a matter for subsequent regulation and settlement; but the fact that the Crown has a claim for the dominion, and a claim for each of the provinces, certainly cannot affect the decision in this case.\nI think the grounds taken by the learned judge below were untenable. I do not think there is any waiver in this case. The evidence does not point to any such waiver. Certainly, the parties who received dividends did not expressly stipulate that there should be a waiver of any of the rights of the Crown; and even if they had done so, I do not think they had the power to bind the Crown. I think the appeal should be allowed.\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The question does not, it seems to me, admit of any doubt. The contention that the local government of Prince Edward Island could alone exercise this prerogative right in the province is untenable. The Lieutenant-Governors, no doubt, in the performance of certain of their duties as such under the B.N.A. Act, may be said to represent Her Majesty, in the same sense and as fully, perhaps, as Her Majesty is represented, for instance, by justices of the peace, constables and bailiffs, in the execution of their duties. But it is the first time that I hear it contended, as has been done in this case, that the Lieutenant-Governor in a province, on matters not exclusively left to the provinces under the B.N.A. Act, could ever use Her Majesty's name and prerogatives to defeat Her Majesty's rights and prerogatives. Not less extraordinary, to my mind, is the dictum of the court below, that if Her Majesty had proceeded in the Exchequer Court at Ottawa to recover judgment for this indebtedness, the court of Prince Edward Island, if applied to, would grant a prohibition to prevent the process of the Exchequer Court from being enforced.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Edward J.

Stats., Ont., ch. 118, secs. 1 and 2.\nOn the 28th March, 1882, a writ was issued by C. et al. (respondents) against one M. for the recovery of the sum of $32,155.33, and said writ was duly endorsed, in accordance with the provisions of the Judicature Act, with particulars of the claim of the re-respondents for the said sum of $32,155.33 on an account previously stated and settled between C. et al. and M., such amount being arrived at by allowing to M. a discount of 5 per cent. for the unexpired balance of the term of credit to which M. was entitled on the purchase of the goods. No appearance was entered by M. to the writ, and on the 8th April judgment was recovered for the amount, and on the same day writs of execution were issued. M. et al. (appellants), creditors of M., instituted an action against him on the 8th April, 1882, and obtained judgment on the 14th April, and on the same day writs of execution were issued.\nThe stock-in-trade was sold by the sheriff at public auction, under all the executions in his hands, to the respondents, who were the highest bidders.\nOn a trial in an interpleader issue, to try whether appellants\u2019 execution against M. was entitled to priority over that of respondents, and whether the judgment of the latter was void for fraud, and as being a preference; and whether respondents\u2019 executions were void as against appellants\u2019 execution, on account of their having issued them before the expiration of eight days from the last day for appearance, Mr. Justice Armour directed a verdict or judgment to be entered in favor of the appellants. That judgment was reversed by the Queer\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of Ontario, whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario; On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada;\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal),\u2014That what the debtor did in this case did not constitute a fraudulent preference prohibited by R.S.O., ch. 118, and that the premature issue of the execution of the respondents was only an irregularity, and not a nullity.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, rendered on the 28th of March, 1884, confirming that of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the 10th of March, 1883, which set aside a judgment of the Hon. Mr. Justice Armour in favor of the present appellants.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear in the head note and in the report of the case in the Ontario Appeal Reports[1].\nJ.J. McLaren for appellants contended: 1st. That the respondents\u2019 execution was a nullity because it was issued on the same day judgment was signed and before the expiration of eight days from the last day of appearance. He cited Rule 72, O.J.A. Code L. 5, De Leg., t. 14; Montreal Bank v. Burnham[2]; Kerr v. Douglass[3]; Brooks v. Hodgkinson[4].\n2nd. That the judgment upon which it was issued, under the circumstances was a fraudulent preference and void against the appellants, citing and commenting on Rev. Stat. Ont., ch. 118, ss. 1 and 2; Sharpe v. Thomas[5]; Doe Mitchinson v. Carter[6]; Billiter v. Young[7]; Hurst v. Jennings[8]; White v. Lord[9]; Maxwell on Statutes,[10]; Hardcastle on Statutes,[11]; and authorities cited by the Hon. Mr. Justice Armour in the court below.\nThomson for respondent contended that the judg- ment recovered by the respondents against the said Gideon Morrison was clearly unimpeachable under R.S.O., cap. 118, sec. 1. It was not founded on a confession of judgment, warrant of attorney, or cognovit actionem. Holbird v. Anderson[12]; Young v. Christie[13]; Mackenzie v. Harris[14]; McKenna v. Smith[15]; Labatt v. Bixel[16]; King v. Duncan[17]; Heamen v. Seale[18]; Davis v. Wickison[19]; Turner v. Lucas[20]; and that the judgment and executions of the respondents against Morrison, the sale of the goods by the Sheriff, and the purchase thereof by the respondents, are not, nor any of them, impeachable under the second section of the said act. They did not constitute an assignment or transfer by the debtor within the meaning of section 2 of the act.\nAs to the premature issue of the execution of the respondents, the learned counsel contended it was only an irregularity, which could be waived by the judgment debtor, and could be objected to by him alone. It was never open to the appellants to complain of such irregularity. Avison v. Holmes[21]; Farr v. Arderly[22]; Perrin v. Bowes[23]; Holmes v. Russell[24]; Bank of Upper Canada v. Vanvochis[25]; Weedon v. Garcia[26]; Blanchenay v. Burt[27]; Archibold\u2019s Practice, [28]; O.J.A., rule 473.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nI think the language of chapter 118 R.S.O. too clear and explicit to admit of any doubt as to its legitimate construction. The legislature has in unmistakable terms declared that if any insolvent, &c., \u201cvoluntarily or by collusion with a creditor or creditors gives a confession of judgment, cognovit actionem, or warrant of attorney to confess judgment with intent, &c., to defeat or delay his creditors, &c., or to give a creditor a preference * * * every such confession, &c., shall be deemed void as against creditors[29].\u201d\nAnd by sec, 2. Any insolvent making any gift, conveyance, assignment, or transfer of any of his goods, &c., with intent to defect or delay creditors, or to give a creditor a preference, every such gift shall be void as against creditors. Not to invalidate assignments for satisfying rateably, &c., creditors, or to invalidate a bona fide sale in ordinary course of trade to innocent purchasers.\nThe insolvent in this case gave no such confession, cognovit or warrant of attorney,\u2014instruments well known to and understood in the law,\u2014nor any instrument, document or writing whatever, which by the most strained construction of any language can, in my opinion, be tortured into a confession, cognovit or warrant of attorney, nor can I understand how anything the debtor did in this case can be held to operate as a gift, conveyance or transfer of goods or effects, when, in fact, no gift, conveyance or transfer was made, nor anything done which, either at law or in equity, can be held to amount to a gift, conveyance or transfer. In buying the goods at the sheriff\u2019s sale the defendants were in the position of ordinary bidders, the goods became theirs, not by gift, conveyance or transfer from the debtor, but simply because they bid higher than any one else; how could this have any bearing on the transaction to make it good or bad, any more than if any outsider had purchased and the proceeds in cash had been paid over to defendant by the sheriff? But, in fact, the goods were sold under other executions as well as that of the defendants and prior to defendants\u2019 execution. Considering the case in the strongest manner that Mr. Justice Armour presents it, and that the parties intended just what he suggests, the question still is, (however desirable it may be that such a transaction should be prohibited) has the legislature, by the 118 ch. of the Revised Statutes, made the transaction illegal? It nowhere prohibits a party from admitting an immediate indebtedness and foregoing a credit on getting, in accordance with the terms of the original indebtedness, 5 per cent. discount in lieu thereof, as in this case, and the debt becoming thereby immediately payable; and where is there any law prohibiting the creditor from suing to recover his debt, or to prohibit the debtor from suffering judgment by default when he could have no defence to the action, or to prohibit the creditor, having obtained a regular judgment, from issuing execution and levying on the debtor\u2019s goods with the obvious intent to secure his debt? For, so far as the creditor is concerned it could be done with no other intent than to get payment in preference and priority to the other creditor. The transaction was no more, then, than saying to the debtor: \u201cYou cannot secure by a cognovit, &c., or by gift, conveyance or transfer, but if I can get a judgment against you in regular course and an execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands before other creditors, that not being prohibited, the law will give me a priority.\u201d\nIt is, in my humble opinion, quite wrong to say this is putting a narrow construction on the words of the statute, it is putting the only construction on the language that the words will bear. To adopt any other construction is to go outside of the words and extend the effect of the statute beyond the terms, and so to ignore instead of interpret the language of the statute, and so to legislate rather than to adjudicate\nThe issuing of the execution was a mere irregularity and not open to objection by plaintiff.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI entirely agree with the Court of Appeal and the majority of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. Were we to hold that judgments come within the enactment against preferences contained in the 2nd sec. of R.S.O. ch. 118, we should either be legislating or otherwise determining that \u201cjudgment\u201d is included in the words \u201cgift, conveyance, assignment or transfer,\u201d neither of which I am prepared to do, though I entirely agree with the observations of Mr. Justice Armour showing how very ineffectual the law is to prevent the frauds at which it is aimed, when construed as, I think, we are bound to construe it.\nAs regards the 1st sec. I am not prepared to overrule Young v. Christie[30], which could only have been decided as it was, unless judgments by default were held to be included in the words \u201ccognovit actionem or warrant of attorney,\u201d which could not be done without violating the rules of construction laid down in modern cases, decided by courts of high authority and by which we are bound.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014I concur.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the statute does not provide for the case of a party shortening the credit for payment by a deduction of five per cent. None of the prohibitory provisions of the statute are shown to have been contravened.

When an agent of a candidate receives and spends for election purposes large sums of money and does not render an account of such expenditure, it will create a 'presumption that corrupt practices have been resorted to 2. The payment by an agent of a sum of $147 to a voter claiming the same to be due for expenses at a previous election, and who refuses to vote until the amount is paid, is a corrupt practice\u00bb\n3. The hiring and paying of carters by an agent to convey voters who are known to be supporters of the agent\u2019s candidate is a corrupt practice.\u2014Young v. Smith ([1]) followed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Mr. Justice L. B. Caron, sitting under the provisions of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874, unseating the appellant for corrupt practices committed by his agents ([2]).\nThe petition of the respondents contained the usual charges of bribery, corrupt practices, &c, by the appellant personally and by his agents.\nThe facts of the charges upon which this appeal was decided sufficiently appear in the head note and in the report of the case in the court below.\nJ. Belleau, the appellant, in person.\nGeo, Irvine, Q.C., for respondents.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThis case has come before us on appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Caron. I feel bound to say that as long as I have had the honor of presiding in this court no case has come before us where there was such a clear undisguised infraction of the law as there has been in this case. In the first place without going into the two particulars brought before us, we have what to me is a startling admission made. Dr. Lacerte, an agent of the appellant, says that he has spent $150. This agent offers $50 to one man, (who will not take it from him,) to organize the carters in the interest of the appellant in this case. He then gives it to another, to a devoted friend of his party, and when he is asked who this devoted friend was, he says he does not recollect his name, and no account is rendered by the election agent of this money, nor does the present appellant, the sitting member, profess to know anything about it. Then we have another lead-ing manager at this election, who expends, he admits, $1,100 in the interest of the present appellant, and yet he renders no account of it to the agent, and cannot tell to whom, cannot apparently name one person to whom he gave this money, or any portion of it, but says it was distributed over the county in the interest of the appellant. Then we come to the charges of giving drink on voting day, and here it appears to have been done wholesale, that is, to this extent, that in the very committee room of this person, for the purpose, the witnesses say, of amusing the supporters, they put three gallons of spirits, and the people were invited in, and go, and are treated; any one who would take it, got it. Then, again, there is the payment of carters without apparently any disguise\u2014the engagement of carters to take voters to the poll, and payment of them. All these are known to be corrupt acts, and, if done by au agent, will avoid the election.\nThere is another question, as to the agency, but, as far as I am concerned, I do not think it necessary to do more than to read the judgment of Mr. Justice Caron. I read, as my judgment, the words he has used in his judgment ([3]):\nAinsi que je Pai fait voir plus haut, les petitionnaires ont prouv\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame, que L.E. Couture, Dr. Lacerte et le Dr. G. Guoy ont agi durant i'\u00e9lection du d\u00e9fendeur et comme ses agents.\nAnd concludes by saying: C Chccun de ces actes constitue des manauvres frauduleuses.\" I think the evidence fully sustains the conclusions at which the learned judge has arrived, and I think it was impossible for him, or any other man, lay or legal, to come to any other conclusion than that there was a gross violation of the Election Act by agents admitted tobe agents of the candidate; and therefore this appeal must be dismissed with costs here and in the court below.\nSTRONG, J.:\nI am of the same opinion.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nThe judge of the court below has shown a great deal of lenity and patience, and I think, perhaps, he ought to have resented a little more than he did the insults, the reiterated insults, offered to him during the trial of the election. He was exposed to very harsh attacks by the newspapers, impeaching his impartiality, and everything has been disposed of rather in too mild a manner. As to the merits of the election, never has an election tried or decided in this court shown such strong, complete evidence of every offence alleged. The most direct agencies were proved. It is impossible to entertain a single doubt on any one of the offences alleged.\nHENRY, J.:\nI have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that this election ought to be avoided for the reasons given in the judgment of 3udge Caron. Every case he mentions there was, I think, sufficiently proved. Furnishing the liquor in the committee-room on election day is sufficient of itself to avoid the election and I think it is proved they were very liberal about it. It was there for everybody, friend and foe. Still, that being the case, where it might go to show the motive was not a corrupt one it is forbidden by the statute, and avoids the election if done by the candidate or his agents. I think the seat should be vacated and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nI am of the same opinion. In fact, I am sure that the appellant never expected any other judgment. I am sorry the Legislature does not give us power to punish the appellants in such cases, and give treble costs. This was never intended to be a serious appeal. I was of opinion, after hearing the appellant, to dismiss the appeal without calling upon the respondent.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : J. G, Boss\u00e9.\nSolicitor for respondents : F. Langelier.\n[1] 4 Can. S.C. R. 494\n[2] 10 Q. L.R. 247\n[3] 10 Q. L. R. 253.\n",

The bill prayed that the award might be amended and the defendant decreed to pay the amount due the plaintiffs on the award being rectified, and that, in other respects, the award should stand and be binding on the parties; there was also a prayer for general relief.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that to grant the decree prayed for would be to make a new award which the court had no jurisdiction to do, but:\nHeld, also, reversing the decision of the court below, that under the prayer for general relief the plaintiff was entitled to have the award set aside.\nThe plaintiffs' factum, containing reflections on the judge in equity and the full court of New Brunswick, was ordered to be taken off the files as scandalous and impertinent.\nAppeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. affirming the judgment of the judge in equity dismissing the plaintiffs' bill[1].\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear in the judgment of the court.\nJ. Travis for appellants contended, first, that under the prayer of general relief in his Bill he was entitled to have the award rectified, and if not under that prayer, then under an amended prayer, which this court, under 43 Vic., ch. 34, has power to grant, and if the court was of opinion that the appellant was not entitled to have the award rectified, then he was entitled to have the award set aside, on the ground that the arbitrators made an award on matters not included in the submission and over which they had no jurisdiction, and relied on and cited inter alia Con.

Phillips v. Evans[6]; Daniels[7]; Stevens v. Guppy[8]; Verplank v. The Mercantile Insurance Co.[9].\nJ. Travis in reply.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThree several actions had been commenced in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick against the above defendant, the one at the suit of the above named plaintiff, Gideon Vernon, another at the suit of him and his wife, and the third an ejectment on the demise of Gideon and Mary E. Vernon; before any thing was done in these actions further than service of the writs by which they were commenced, it was agreed by and between the parties to this present suit, that the several matters in dispute between them, and for which the said actions were commenced, should be referred to arbitration, and for carrying out such agreement mutual bonds of submission were executed; that executed by the defendant has been produced, and it contains the following statement of the matters intended to be referred:\u2014\nWhereas differences have arisen between the above named and bounden Warren Oliver on the one part, and the above named Gideon Vernon and Mary E. Vernon his wife, on the other part, and there are now depending in the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick three suits at law, one brought by the said Gideon Vernon against the said Warren Oliver and one David Oliver to recover from them certain sums of money claimed to have been lent by the before mentioned Mary E. Vernon to the said Warren Oliver and David Oliver; one by the said Gideon Vernon and Mary E. Vernon, his wife, against the said Warren Oliver to recover from him damages for an alleged trespass to the person of the said Mary E. Vernon by the said Warren Oliver; and an action of ejectment brought by the said Gideon Vernon and Mary E. Vernon against the said Warren Oliver to eject him from certain lands situate, &c., &c., claimed by the said Mary E. Vernon to belong to her, which said differences and suits and all demands concerning the same, including mesne profits in the said last mentioned suit, the said Warren Oliver on his part, and the said Gideon Vernon and Mary E. Vernon his wife, on their part, have and do hereby agree to refer to the award and determination of, &c., &c., &c.\nThe submission contained further an agreement that the said arbitrators, or any two of them, should be at liberty to order and determine what they should think fit to be done by either of the said parties respecting the matters referred, and this further agreement:\u2014\nAnd it is agreed between the said parties that in the suit first above named, namely, Gideon Vernon v. David Oliver and Warren Oliver, that the award of the abitrators, or any two of them, shall, if it be against the said Warren Oliver and David Oliver, show the amount owing by the said Warren Oliver and David Oliver to the said Mary E. Vernon.\nUpon the arbitration the defendant's attorney presented a claim of the defendant against Grideon Vernon alone, as a set off against his demand in his action for recovery of the monies lent by his wife to the defendant and David Oliver; the plaintiff's attorney objected to the arbitrators entertaining this claim of set off, and to their receiving any evidence in respect of it, upon the ground that, as he contended, it was not within the submission, and moreover, that it was barred by the Statute of limitations; the arbitrators however, entertained the claim, notwithstanding the plaintiff's objection, and disregarding wholly the last clause contained in the submission as above set out, they did not by their award find, as they were expressly required to do, what was the amount owing in the said first mentioned suit to the said Mary E. Vernon by the said Warren Oliver and David Oliver, but made their award as follows:\u2014\nThat the said Warren Oliver should, on or before the 4th August next ensuing the date thereof, pay or cause to be paid to the said Gideon Vernon the sum of six hundred and eighty-three dollars, in full payment and discharge of and for all monies, debts, damages, dues, claims and demands of the said Gideon Vernon and Mary E., his wife, or either of them, upon any account or transaction or other matter whatsoever at any time before their entering into the said bonds of arbitration as aforesaid, and that the said Warren Oliver or his heirs shall and do, on or before the said fourth day of August next ensuing the date hereof, make and execute a good and sufficient deed of conveyance of all his share and right in the lands of the estate of his late brother, Alfred Oliver, situate, &c., &c.\nThe award then directed that the defendant should pay to the arbitrators the sum of $84 (eighty-four dollars) for their costs of the arbitration and award, and lastly, the arbitration did thereby further award and decree that the said award should be final and conclusive of all matters, actions, cause and causes of action, suits, controversies, trespasses, debts, damages, accounts and demands whatsoever, for or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, arising out of the matters referred to them by the said bonds previous to the date thereof; the submission contained no clause, providing that it might be made a rule of any court. The plaintiffs filed their bill in equity in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, wherein they alleged that the arbitrators, in disregard of the plaintiff's objection, had entertained the said matter of set-off which the plaintiffs insisted was not within the submission, and had allowed the same to the defendant to the amount of seven hundred and thirty-seven dollars and fifty-six cents, as against the monies lent by the said Mary E. Vernon to the said defendant and his brother David, and that they wholly neglected to find, although they were expressly required by the submission to find, what was the amount which was due by the defendant and his brother David to the said Mary E. Vernon, but that, on the contrary, they had in fact (after deducting from such amount whatever it may have been, which the arbitrators deemed to have been so due the said seven hundred and thirty-seven dollars and fifty-six cents,) divided the balance, without showing what that balance was, into two equal parts, and included in the sum of said six hundred and eighty-three dollars only one of such parts, and then awarded in effect that the plaintiffs should accept the one-half of such balance in full satisfaction and discharge of the whole amount, whatever it might be, which was really due to the said Mary E. Vernon from the said defendant and his brother; the bill then alleged that the plaintiffs, in order to take up the said award, had been obliged to pay to the said arbitrators the said sum of eighty-four dollars, the costs of the said arbitration and award, which the arbitrators had adjudged should be paid by the defendant, and it prayed that the said award might be amended by the court in the above matters, that is to, say by expunging the credit given to the defendant for the amount of set off claimed by him, and by reinstating the half of the balance which the arbitrators had deducted from the amount due to Mary E. Vernon; and that the defendant might be decreed forthwith to pay to the plaintiff, Gideon Vernon, the whole amount coming to him on the said award, being rectified as aforesaid in the several particulars, in which it is wrongful and improper as aforesaid; and that in all other respects the said award should stand and be forthwith acted upon and be binding on the parties thereto; and that the said Warren Oliver should also pay to the said Gideon Vernon, the said sum of eighty-four dollars with interest thereon, and interest on the proper sum due and payable to him under the said award, and that the plaintiffs and each of them might have all other relief in the premises to which they are entitled, and that the defendant might pay the costs of this suit and that all proper directions should be given and accounts taken.\nThe plaintiffs' bill is framed upon the erroneous assumption that the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity over awards extends to the making of a wholly new award in the place of that made by the judges of the parties own selection. What is the precise limit of the jurisdiction of the court over awards it is not necessary to define, for it never has been supposed that it extended so far as to justify the court in undoing what the arbitrators, in the exercise of their discretion, have by their award deliberately done, and substituting therefor a finding which, in the opinion of the court, the arbitrators should have found; or in adding to the amount by an award adjudged to either party, a sum which the arbitrators have by their award deliberately disallowed, however erroneous their disallowance of that sum may have been. If, as is contended by the plaintiffs, the item of set-off which the arbitrators are by the bill charged with having allowed to the defendant was not within the submission, the allowance of that item by the arbitrators would afford ground for setting aside their award, but could not justify the court in putting themselves in the place of the arbitrators, and in making a new award quite different from that which the arbitrators deliberately, albeit erroneously, have made. It is unnecessary to enquire whether this item of set-off was or not within the submission, for, if it was, and this was contrary to the intention of the parties, the plaintiffs' remedy was to have the submission rectified; and if it was not within the submission, their sole remedy was to have the award set aside if the arbitrators entertained the matter which was not within the submission. So likewise as to the amount alleged to have been deducted by the arbitrators by the process alleged of their dividing into two equal parts, the balance of the claim of Mary E. Vernon, after deducting from the whole of such claim the above item of set-off, and including one only of such two equal parts in the amount of $683; the court can have no jurisdiction to add to the amount awarded that part which the arbitrators have deliberately, albeit erroneously, disallowed; by so doing the court would be constituting themselves judge of the differences between the parties in the place of the judges of the parties own selection. In so far therefore as the bill claims to have the award amended by the court in the particulars, and in the manner, specified, the jurisdiction of the court has been wholly misconceived The frame of the bill also, is most objectionable for the scandalous prolixity of its contents. The plaintiffs have introduced therein a great mass of irrelevant matter, consisting of a lengthy correspondence between the solicitors of the parties, and other matters which are wholly irrelevant, the object of the framer of the bill being to establish by such correspondence and other matters, that the intention of all parties to the submission was that it should be confined to the claims of Mary E. Vernon, and that therefore the item of set off was not within the submission; but whether it did or not, in fact, come within the terms of the submission, must needs be determined by the submission itself. The setting out therefore of this prolix correspondence in the bill was quite irrelevant. The prolixity thus introduced into the bill is followed, to an equally irrelevant extent, in the answer of the defendant, and is carried into the evidence adduced at the trial, where the whole of the evidence taken before the arbitrators, and the accounts entered into by them, was allowed to be introduced into this case, (notwithstanding the remonstrance and objection of the defendant's counsel,) just as if the bill was by way of appeal from the decision of the arbitrators upon the merits of the case. The result has been that the printed case in appeal laid before us has become expanded into a large book of about ninety printed pages, when the whole substance of the case might have been stated almost in as many lines. It is not, however, the printed case in appeal alone which is objectionable, for the factum of the plaintiffs is framed in such a scandalous manner, in fact, in such a virulent and malignant spirit of invective of the judgments of the learned judges whose decision is appealed from, as to disgrace not only the counsel by whom it was prepared, but this court also, if it should be permitted to remain upon its files or among its records; and for this reason, and to mark the sense of the court at the indignity offered to it by such a document being laid before it, it should be ordered to be struck off the files of the court, and not to be kept among the records of the case.\nAlthough, in praying the interference of the court to amend the award in the particulars in which it was contended by the plaintiffs to be erroneous, the jurisdiction of the court has been misconceived, I am of opinion that under the prayer for general relief the plaintiffs were entitled to a decree setting the award aside, assuming sufficient cause for setting it aside to be established. Stevens v. Guppy, which was relied upon in the court below as establishing a contrary doctrine, was a case very dissimilar in its character. The substance of the present bill is, that the award is bad in the particulars mentioned, and that being so, it should be amended in the manner asked by the plaintiff in his prayer for special relief, or set aside under the prayer for general relief. It is the ordinary case of a prayer for alternative relief. Now, that the case made by the bill and established in evidence, requires that the award should be set aside, there can, I think, be no doubt, for the arbitrators have studiously, as would seem, refrained from finding, although they were expressly required by the submission to find, what amount was due to Mary E. Vernon for the monies loaned by her to defendant and his brother; the omission to find this amount constitutes a most important defect, for it now appears by the evidence of one of the arbitrators that in the amount of $683 awarded in bulk, not showing how much, if anything, was awarded for the debt to Mary E. Vernon, or how much for the assault, or how much for mesne profits, is included a sum which constitutes but the half of a sum which, assuming the allowance to the defendant of the set off to have been unobjectionable, was so due to Mary E. Vernon, and the award nevertheless adjudges that the sum of $683 so constituted shall be taken by the plaintiffs in full satisfaction of all actions, and causes of action, up to the time of the execution of the submission, and so in satisfaction of a larger sum of undefined amount undoubtedly due to Mary E. Vernon, although not found by the award as it was by the submission required to be. In this respect the award cannot be sustained, but in view of the gross prolixity of the irrelevant matter set out in the bill, and of the fact that the plaintiffs wholly fail in what was made the chief object of the bill as framed, the plaintiff should have no costs in the court below nor upon this appeal.\nThe order of this court, in my opinion, should be that a decree for setting aside the award be issued out of the Court of Equity of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, but without costs, and that the plaintiffs' factum filed in this case be struck from off the files and records of this court as scandalous and impertinent, and that no costs of this appeal be allowed to either party.\nAppeal allowed without costs.

The Queen, 9 App. Cas., 117, followed).\nAs this Act does not interfere with the existing rights and powers of incorporated cities, a by-law passed by the corporation of the city of Three Rivers, on the 3rd April, 1877, in virtue of its charter (20 Vic., ch. 129, and 38 Vie., oh. 76), imposing a license fee of $200 on the sale of intoxicating liquors, is within the powers of the said corporation.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), whereby the judgment of the Superior Court at Three Rivers rendered by Mr. Justice McCord in favor of the appellant was reversed.\nThe appellant, wishing to obtain a license under the Quebec License Act of 1878, (41 Vic., ch. 3), to keep a saloon, on the 31st March, 1880, presented a certificate signed by twenty-five electors, to the council of the corporation of Three Rivers for confirmation as reacquired by sec. ii of said act, and on the 5th May, 1880, requested the officers of the corporation to deliver over to him the certificate of confirmation, which they re- fused to do, unless the appellant should pay $200 as required by the by-laws of the corporation.\nOn this the appellant petitioned for a writ of mandamus dated the 5th May, 1880, alleging that the respondents refused to deliver to him the certificate required by the License Act of 1878, ch 3; that the by-laws relied on were illegal, null and void; that the respondents had not the right, according to the act of incorporation or any other law, to enact such by-law; that the local legislature could not authorize the council of the corporation of the city of Three Rivers to enact a by-law with the object of imposing a tax of two hundred dollars, to be paid by those who desired to obtain the certificate of confirmation, required by the 11th sec. of the said License Act of 1878; and that finally such by-laws have the effect of regulating commerce to wit: the sale of spirituous liquors, which is the prerogative of the federal parliament and that the local legislature acted ultra vires of its powers.\nBy his petition the appellant asked for the issue of a peremptory mandamus to declare the said by-laws null and to order the officials of the council to sign and deliver the said certificate to the appellant.\nThe respondents met this petition and the wit:\nFirst, by a demurrer alleging that the respondents had never refused to perform any act which they were bound to do by law, but, on the contrary, that even in the said petition it is alleged that they did not sign nor deliver the certificate asked for because of the existence of a by-law to the contrary, which prevented them doing so, before the reception from the appellant of the sum of two hundred dollars; and that the principal object of the petition is to obtain the voiding of said by-laws which cannot be done by a writ of mandamus.\nSecondly the respondents pleaded that the Parliament of Canada, in 1857, by 20 Vic, ch. 129, authorized the council to enact the by-laws in question, which are at present in force and obligatory for all; that the sum of two hundred dollars is a duty or fee which must be paid by those who wish to sell spirituous liquors.\nAnd that the British North America Act does not abrogate the said authority, but on the contrary confirms it. Finally, the respondents pleaded une defense au fonds en fait.\nThe statutes and by-laws bearing on the case are reviewed in the arguments and judgments hereinafter given.\nJ. Doutre, Q.C., for appellant:\nThe by-law which is relied on was passed prior to 1875, when all existing statutes concerning the city of Three Rivers were repealed, and in lieu thereof 38 Vic., ch. 76 was substituted as a new charter. This charter contains an important departure from the provisions of the Act of 1857 especially on the subject of retailers of spirituous liquors; and for any by-law subsequent to the passing of this statute, the city council had no other powers or authority v than those contained in sec 101, and by that section they can levy a tax by means of a license and no discriminating scale of taxes on the trades or professions is authorized\nAt that time, 38 Vic., ch. 5, amending the Quebec License Act, was in force, and the legislature, when granting that charter, was fully aware of the burdens it had already imposed upon retailers of spirituous liquors It had no doubt the right to authorize the city of Three Rivers to increase these burdens to any extent. On the other hand, the provincial government deriving from the liquor trade an important part of its revenue is interested in delegating its taxing powers with prudence and deliberation.\nOtherwise some municipalities, by imposing excessive taxes, might, in effect, prohibit the trade and thereby deprive the government of an important source of revenue. Therefore the delegated powers ought to be strictly construed\nThen, can the city fare better with the provisions of the License Act of 1878, under which the appellant applied and obtained the certificate of confirmation, the refusal of which caused the original action and the subsequent appeals?\nI submit that the License Act of 1878 does in no way maintain or revive by-laws previously existing, whether conflicting or conforming with the new License Act\nSec. 36 says: \"On each confirmation of a certificate for the purpose of obtaining a license for the cities of Quebec and Montreal, the sum of $8 is paid to the corporation of each of those cities; and to other corporations, for the same object within the limits of their jurisdiction, a sum not exceeding twenty dollars may be demanded and received.\"\nSec. 37: \"The preceding provision does not deprive cities and incorporated towns of the rights which they may have by their charters or by-laws.\" This last provision did not exist in 34 Vic. ch. 2. It has been shown that the charter of 1875 did not contain any provision authorizing the council to single out the tavern keepers and impose upon them an exceptionall tax, either directly or by means of a license. If it was not within its jurisdiction to impose such a tax, it is very doubtful if it could make a by-law to collect $20 for a confirmation of certificate under the 36th sec of the License Act of 1878. However, such by-law is not in existence, and it is useless to enquire into the extent of a power which has not been exercised..\nNow, as to the constitutional question:\u2014\nThe case raises a broader question than those discussed so far. Supposing the charter of 1857 ample enough to cover the by-law of 1871, could any legislation be had from the provincial legislature after the constitutional Act of 1867 to authorize a by-law to prohibit or regulate the liquor trade, beyond police regulations, such as ordering the closing of bar-rooms at certain hours, on Sundays, or on election days?\nThe maintenance of the charter of 1857 was protected by the 129th sec of the British North America Act of 1867. As long as the city of Three Rivers was satisfied with that charter the new constitution of Canada could not affect it. But as soon as they demanded and obtained the repeal of that charter, they fell under the \"provisions of the constitutional act, which placed within the power of the federal authority only the regulation of the liquor traffic, as an incident of the regulation of trade generally.\nBy the Consolidation Act of 1875, 38 Vic, ch. 76, sec, 1 (P. Q.) all the statutes concerning the city of Three Rivers were unqualifiedly repealed. From that moment, the legislature of Quebec could not delegate powers which it did not itself possess, such as prohibiting or impeding the sale of intoxicating liquors, otherwise than making regulations for the government of saloons licensed taverns, &c., and the sale of liquors in public places, which would tend to the preservation of good order and prevention of disorderly conduct, rioting, or breaches of the peace. Going further was to assume to exercise a legislative power which pertains exclusively to the Parliament of Canada ([2]). So held, by the Supreme Court of Canada, in Mayor of Fredericton v. the Queen ([3]). So held, by the Privy Council, in Russell v. Queen ([4]).\nThese considerations, as well as those previously insisted upon, seem to have been overlooked by the Queen's Bench.\nIncorporating and regulating municipal bodies, must be understood to be done in conformity with the general provisions of the constitutional act. The provincial legislatures cannot authorize municipalities to do things which the legislatures themselves could not do. For instance, the local legislatures could not authorize a municipality to organize or drill militia, a thing which they could not do themselves.\nAs regards the raising of a revenue for municipal purposes, no doubt they could do it always within the same limit, and it was plainly done, and exhausted by 38 Vic, ch. 76, sec. 101, sub-sec. 7, which empowered the city of Three Rivers to lew a business tax on the tavern keepers, either directly or by means of a license. Beyond the powers contained in that section, the legislature of Quebec authorized the respondent if they had jurisdiction from their charter, to levy a license fee, to the extent of $20 but no more.\nIn passing that License Act of 1878, the legislature of Quebec was conscious of its power as is manifested by the authority granted to Quebec and Montreal to lew a moderate license fee of $8 and to other municipalities, having jurisdiction from their charter, to impose a license fee up to $20 The legislature evidently thought that going further would encroach upon federal authority, and amount to partial prohibition or to regulation of traffic.\nN. L. Denoncourt, Q.C., (J M. McDougall with him) for respondents: The Act which created the respondents a municipal corporation gave them the power to enact the by-laws of the 30th January, 1871, and of the 3rd April 1877, and this last act has not been in any way repealed by the License Act of 1878 of the Quebec legislature, and is not ultra vires([5]).\nAs to the constitutional question the British North America Act by the sub-sec. 8 of sec. 92, gives to local legislatures the right to pass a prohibitory liquor law for the purposes of municipal institutions.\nThe City of Fredericton v. The Queen ([6]) and Russell v. The Queen ([7]) decided that the Parliament of Canada had the power to legislate on traffic of intoxicating liquors * but it is not said that municipalities had no more the right to impose taxes on persons wishing to sell liquors as they had before. So these decisions do not affect in any way the respondents in this present appeal. [The learned counsel also relied on the reasons given by Mr. Justice Ramsay in the court below ([8]).]\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nNo matter of fact comes up before this court. The whole case consists in enquiring whether the corporation and its officers had the right to exact $200 before delivering their certificate of confirmation of the elector's certificate\nI think the appeal should be dismissed, I cannot discover that any of the rights conferred on the corporation of the city of Three Rivers are superseded or taken away by the Quebec License Act of 1878, or any other Act. On the contrary, by see. 255 of the Quebec License Law of 1878 it is enacted, \"But the dispositions of this act shall in no way affect the rights and powers belonging to cities and incorporated towns by virtue of their charters and by-laws and shall not have the effect of abrogating \u00f3r repealing the same;\" showing how careful the Legislature was to make it apparent beyond all doubt, that the existing rights and privileges of incorporated cities were not to be interfered with\nThe case of Hodge v. Queen ([9]), just decided by the Privy Council covers the constitutional question raised.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI agree entirely with the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Ramsay in the Court of Queen's Bench, determining that the Quebec License Law of 1878 does not repeal or in any way affect the powers conferred on the city of Three Rivers by its Act of incorporation; and that the by-law now in question requiring the payment of a license fee of $200 by tavern keepers was authorized by that Act. If the Act of incorporation had been passed since Confederation it would have been intra vires, as an exercise of the police power which by the British North America Act is vested in the Local Legislatures\nAs Mr. Justice Ramsay has so fully and ably considered the case, I do not feel called upon to say anything further on this head. Hodge v. The Queen decided by the Privy Council, since the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was delivered, having put an end to the question any further discussion of it is uncalled for. I desire to add, however, that the powers with which the corporation is invested by the Act 37 Vic, ch. 129, sec. 37, clause 14 would if now for the first time conferred upon the municipality by the Local Legislature be valid under the British North America Act, sec. 92, sub-sec. 9, as an exercise of the power to raise money, by means of tavern licenses, for municipal purposes. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The constitutional question has now to my mind, been definitely settled by the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Hodge v. The Queen ([10]). As to the legality of the by-laws, I am of opinion that they are continued in force by the statute and that the corporation, by virtue of its Act of incorporation, had power to pass the by-laws in question.\nHENRY J.:\nThe city of Three Rivers was incorporated by an Act of the late Province of Canada (20 Vic. ch. 129), by which it received power to raise funds for the expenses of the city, and for improvements, by the imposition of taxes, including those on proprietors of houses for public entertainment, taverns, coffee houses and eating houses and on retailers of spirituous liquors, &c. The council of the city was empowered to make by-laws for restraining and prohibiting \"the sale of any spirituous, vinous, alcoholic and intoxcating liquors, or for authorizing such sale, subject to such restrictions as they may deem expedient for determining under what restrictions and conditions, and in what manner, the revenue inspector * * * shall grant licenses to merchants, traders, shop-keepers, tavern keepers and other persons to sell such liquors; for fixing the sum payable for every such license\u2014provided that, in any case it shall not be less than the sum which is now payable therefore by virtue of the laws at present in force; for regulating and governing all shop-keepers, tavern-keepers and other persons selling such liquors by retail; and in what places such liquors shall be sold, and in such manner as they may deem expedient to prevent drunkenness &c.\"\nThat Act was substantially confirmed by section 129 of the British North America Act leaving it to be continued, repealed, altered or amended, as therein provided.\nBy a by-law passed by the council of the city in 1871, a license fee of one hundred dollars was imposed on all licensees to keep an inn, hotel, tavern or public house, for the selling or retailing of any spirituous, vinous, alcoholic or intoxicating liquors; and such license was not to be issued until such sum and all fees should be paid.\nIn 1875 the Legislature of the Province of Quebec passed an Act amending and consolidating the Act of incorporation of the city of Three Rivers, and several Acts in amendment thereof and re-enacted the provisions of that Act in relation to licenses, tavern-keepers, &c.; leaving the same powers with the council of the city as those conferred by the Act of incorporation in relation to by-laws,\nUnder the provisions, and by virtue of the power given by the latter Act, the council, by a by-law passed in 1877, raised the license duty from $100 to $200.\nIt is objected by the appellant that the legislation of the Province of Quebec in 1875 was ultra vires, on the ground that by the British North America Act the legislative power to deal with the subject in question was vested in the Parliament of Canada, and not in the Legislature of the Province of Quebec. If that objection is well founded, he would be entitled to our judgment. He refused to pay the sum provided by the later by law of the council, and if the council had not the power to impose the increased duty under the Act of 1875, before mentioned, they got it in no other way. I am and, I may say, always have been, of the opinion that the British North America Act if read, in the light which a knowledge of the subject before the passage of that Act would produce, plainly gives the power of legislation to the Local Legislatures in respect or such licenses. I so gave my opinion in the case of Frederic-ton v. The Queen ([11]), argued and decided in this court and I think it better to refer to my judgment in that case for some of my reasons than to repeat them at length here. it is true that my views expressed in my judgment in that case, as to \" The Canada Temperance Act, 1878,\" were not shared by my learned brethern, nor by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council but the judgement of this court in that case, and that of the Privy Council in Russell v.. The Queen ([12]), contain nothing, or but little, in conflict with the proposition that the Legislature of the Province of Quebec had the exclusive power to deal with the subject-matter in question; and that view is fully sustained by the judgment of the Privy Council in a later case, Hodge v. The Queen, ([13]).\nBy sec 92 of the British North America Act the Local Legislatures were given the exclusive power to legislate in regard to \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneers and other licenses, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes,\" and also as to \" municipal institutions.\" The power over those subjects is therein stated to be exclusive, and when we find that expression used we would hardly think it necessary to examine other parts of the Act with any expectation of finding a counter provision\u2014the power is not only given expressly but exclusively. Did parliament mean what it said, or did it so provide, and intend that the provision should be overridden and controlled, and rendered totally inoperative? I cannot come to such a conclusion. The uncontrolled power is thus given to the Local Legislatures to raise a revenue for either of the purposes named; it is given as an exclusive right, and unless modified by some one of the enumerated powers in sec. 91, I maintain that the Parliament of Canada has no power to interfere with that right for any object or purpose, or for any reason or consideration whatever. I am not forgetful of the sub-stance and importance of the last clause of sec. 91, which provides that \" any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of the subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures, of the provinces.\" Can we, however, conclude that the framers of the Act and Parliament meant by a clause of such a general character, intended principally to cover unforeseen difficulties, to completely override and control such a plain enactment as the following:\nIn each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses, in order to the raising of revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes.\nThe object, as stated, was to enable each province to raise a revenue. Under the provisions as to \" municipal institutions\" the Local Legislatures derive the power to make laws to regulate shops, saloons and taverns. These provisions are explicit as well as comprehensive and exclude every other legislation in the Dominion as to those subjects; unless, indeed, under the concluding clause of sec. 91, just quoted, they are subordinated to the power of legislation given to the Dominion Parliament as being within one or more of the classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 91. The Act most pointedly and effectually excludes and prohibits the interference of the Dominion Parliament with the exclusive powers of the local legislatures as to the matters in question, except (and only in that case) the subject-matter comes within one of the classes of subjects mentioned and enumerated in sec. 91. The first part of sec. 91 gives power to the Parliament of Canada.\nTo make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces\nThe right to make laws for the peace &c. of Canada, is as fully restricted to such subjects as do not come within the classes of subjects assigned to the legislatures of the provinces, as language can make it. The subject of licenses for shops, taverns, &c, are exclusively so given, and therefore the right to make laws for the good government of Canada does not include power to interfere with local legislation. Here, then, the power is limited; and any substantial interference with the functions assigned to the legislatures of the provinces, is excepted from the power conferred by the general terms of the preceding part of the clause. It was, to my mind the clear intention of the clause, and of those who framed it that the exclusive powers given to the legislatures of the provinces should not be affected; but that outside of and apart from them, the power of the Parliament of Canada was to be unlimited.\nLegislation by that Parliament, under the power conveyed by that clause, conflicting with Acts of the local legislatures under the powers exclusively given by sec. 92 I consider ultra vires.\nIn the judgment of the Privy Council in Russell v. The Queen ([14]), I find this sentence:\nIt was not, of cour 9 App. Cas. 117,se, 7 App. Cas. 829. contended for the appellant that the Legislature of New Brunswick could ha e passed the Act in question, which embraces in its enactments all the provinces: nor was it denied with respect to this last contention that the Parliament of Ca 7 App. Cas. 829. 7 App. Cas. 829.nada might have passed an Act of the nature of that under discussion, to take effect at the same time throughout the whole Dominion.\nIf not denied when such a proposition was stated, it is the same as if it were alleged to have been admitted. if so admitted by the counsel at the argument there was but little left requiring the judgment of the august tribunal considering the case. The result was there-fore, only what would be reasonably expected.\nI am always ready to give such a construction to that concluding clause of section 91 as will give it all the effect it was intended to have and it is legitimately entitled to but I cannot do so to the extent of nullifying other provisions so unambiguous and explicit as those of sec. 92, to which I have referred. My learned brethren differed from me in the case of Fredericton v. The Queen ([15]), on the ground that the right to legislate as to \"trade and commerce\" being vested in the Parliament of Canada, the local legislatures could not enact the same provisions as are found in the \"Canada Temperance Act, 1878,\" and consequently the power must be in the Canadian Parliament to pass that Act. That was however a result and conclusion I felt unable to arrive at or appreciate, for the reasons given in my judgment in that case. The same questions involved in Fredericton v. The Queen came subsequently, in the case of Russell v. The Queen before the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council. The grounds taken by my learned brethren were neither adopted nor repudiated in the judgment in the latter case, but the same result on other grounds was reached, and the -constitutionality of the \"Canada Temperance Act, 1878,\" established, on grounds which, in my opinion, do not touch the issue before us in this case. It has been argued that because a prohibitory Act of the Legislature of any of the provinces would be an interference with \"trade and commerce,\" the power to deal with the regulation of which was given to the Parliament of Canada such an Act would be ultra vires; and therefore the power to pass such an Act must necessarily be in that parliament. I cannot adopt that proposition, because I think, that independently of other reasons, such legislation would, and must, necessarily override and destroy the provision intended to enable the local legislatures to raise the revenue, as in sub-sec. 9 of sec. 92. No doubt, it was fully understood and agreed upon, by those who considered the subject of the confederation of the four provinces, that certain means for raising a revenue for the purposes named in that sub-section should be given to the local legislatures. Some of the provinces were then raising thousands of dollars by revenues from licenses; and it must be assumed that such means of revenue were intended to be continued. If therefore the Parliament of Canada passed a prohibitory Act, it would tend to sweep. away the revenues intended to be raised and expended in each of the provinces. No one could or would object to the passage of such an Act, if rights incontestably vested in the local legislatures, as to revenue for the purposes named, were not interfered with. The learned judges of the Privy Council hesitated to ascribe the power to pass such an Act to the right to legislate for the \u201cregulation of trade and commerce, possibly considering that prohibitory legislation might not be \"regulation.\" Suppose, under what is termed the local option provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, 1878, the prohibitory principle should be adopted by a large number of the districts in a province, there would necessarily be a comparative loss of local revenue. That loss would be caused by means of Dominion legislation, and without any provision for making up the loss to the province. Taking the whole of the British North America Act into consideration, with the knowledge of the state of matters existing in the four confederated provinces at the time of confederation, can it be fairly and reasonably contended that such a result was intended by the framers of the constiution? As one of those so engaged,as well as in the \"preparation of the British North America Act,Ican arrive at no such conclusion. My decision in this case, and the views I have expressed, are, however the result of my construction of the words and phraseology of the Act itself.\nIt was claimed that the License Act of 1878 limited the power of the corporations by the provisions of sec. 36. Sec. 37, however, enacts that preceding provision does not deprive cities and incorporated towns of the rights which they have by their charters or by-laws.''\nFor the reasons given, I think the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment below confirmed, with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nBy the Act 20 Vic., ch. 129, passed by the parliament of the late Province of Canada the city of Three Rivers was incorporated, and by section 36 sub-sec 7 of that Act it was enacted, that in order to raise the necessary funds to meet the expenses of the said city, and to provide for the several necessary public improvements in the said city it should be lawful for the council of the city among other taxes, to impose certain duties or annual taxes on the proprietors or occupiers of houses of public entertainment, taverns, coffee houses and eating, houses, and on all retailers of spirituous liquors, &c.; and by the 37th section of the Act the said council was empowered to make by-laws:\nFor (among other things) restraining and prohibiting the sale of any spirituous, vinous, alcoholic and intoxicating liquor, or for authorizing such sale, sub 3 Can. S. C. R. 565.ject to such restrictions as they may deem expedient for determining under what restrictions and conditions, and in what manner, the Revenue Inspector of the district of Three Rivers shall grant licenses to merchants, traders, shop-keepers, tavern-keepers, and other persons to sell such liquors, for fixing the sum payable for every such license, provided that in any case it shall not be less than the sum which is now payable therefore by virtue of the laws at present in force. For regulating and governing all s 3 Can. S. C. R. 565.hop-keepers, tavern-keepers, and other persons selling such liquors by retail, and in what places such liquors shall be sold in such manner as they may deem expedient to prevent drunkenness, and for preventing the sale of any intoxicating beverage to any child, apprentice or servant.\nThis act was in force when the British North America Act was passed, which, by its 92nd section, items 8 and 9, enacts, that in each province thereby constituted the legislature may exclusively make laws relating to municipal institutions in the province, and to shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes; and by its 129hh section that except as otherwise provided by the Act all laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, at the Union, should continue in force in Ontario Quebec Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively, as if the union had not been made, subject, nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Imperial Parliament) to be repealed abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the legislature of the respective provinces, according as the matter of each such Act should be subjected by the British North America Act to the authority of parliament, or to that of the provincial legislatures. The effect, then, of the 129th section, was to continue in force all the provisions of the Act 20th Vic., ch. 129, incorporateing the city of Three Rivers, except in so far as provision to the contrary was made, if provision to the contrary was made by the British North America Act. While this Act was so continued in force the council of the city passed a by-law in 1871, whereby it was enacted that no hotel keeper or other person could obtain a license to . keep an inn hotel, or tavern, or any public house for the selling and retailing any spirituous, vinous, alcoholic or intoxicating liquor, in the city of Three Rivers, before conforming to all the provisions of the law which regulates the obtaining such license, nor until he shall have obtained a certificate, as required by law, which certificate shall not be granted by the said council until such hotel keeper or other person shall have paid to the secretary treasurer of the said council the sum of one hundred dollars over and above all duties and fees on such license. Now, this by-law having for its authority only the above quoted sections of 20th Vic, ch. 129, could only be a valid by-law in the event of such sections being continued by the 129th section of the British North America Act which section only continued the above sections of 20 Vie ch. 129 if there was no provision to the contrary in the British North America Act, and in that case the right to repeal, abolish, and alter the provisions contained in the above sections of the 20th Vic. ch. 129, equally with all other sections of that Act as had been continued by the 129th section of the British North America Act would seem naturally to fall within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature under the clause of the 92nd section, which places under the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislatures of each province, the power to make laws in relation to municipal instituitons in the province. Acting on this assumption, the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, in 1875, passed the Act 38 Vic, ch, 76, for amending and consolidating the act of incorporation of the city of Three Rivees and the different Acts amending that Act, and by the 74th and 75th sections of this Act re-enacted in substance and almost verbatim the provisions contained in the above 37th section, and by the 101sf section, sub-sec. 7, the precise provision contained in the above 36th section of 20 Vic, ch. 129.\nNow is there anything in the British North America Act which makes it to have been ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec to re-enact as they have done by 38 Vie ch. 76 the substance of the above sections of 20th Vie, ch. 129, regulating the conditions upon which licenses to sell spirituous liquors may be granted in a municipality by the Revenue Inspector and for regulating the conduct of the licensed dealers therein? This question, as it appears to me, must be answered in the negative I cannot doubt that by item No. 8 of sec. 92 which vests in the provincial legislatures the exclusive power of making laws in relation to municipal institutions, the authors of the scheme of confederation had in view municipal institutions as they had then already been organized in some of the provinces, and that the term as used in the British North America Act unless there be some provision to the contrary in sec. 91 of the Act, comprehends the powers with which municipal institutions as constituted by Acts then in force in the respective provinces, were already invested for regulating the traffic in intoxicating liquors in shops, saloons hotels and taverns and the issue of licenses therefore, as being powers deemed necessary and proper for the beneficial working of a perfect system of local municipal self-government Unless, then, there be some provision in the British North America Act to the contrary, the Legislature of the Province of Quebec had full power, in any Act passed by it creating a municipality, or in any Act amending and consolidating the Acts already in force incorporating the city of Three Rivers, to insert the provisions in question here which are contained in the 74th 75th and 101st sections of 38 Vic, ch. 76.\nIt seems to be supposed that the judgment of this court in the City of Fredericton v. The Queen is an authority to the effect that since the passing of the British North America Act it is not competent for a provincial legislature to restrain or prohibit, in any manner the sale of any spirituous liquors, and that therefore the Legislature of the Province of Quebec could not invest the corporation of the city of Three River with the powers purported to be vetted in them by the 74th and 75th sections of the Act 38 Vic. ch. 76 and that the Dominion Parliament alone could enact the provisions contained in the 75th section The effect of this contention if sound would be that instead of the Provincial Legislatures having exclusive power to make laws in relation to municipal institutions in the province, which the B. N. A. Act they are declared to have and which by the authors of the scheme of Confederation intended they should have the joint action of the Dominion Parliament and of the legislature of any province would be necessary to invest municipal corporations in that province with powers which have always been considered to be necessary and proper for the effectual working of that system of local municipal self-government which prevailed at the time of Confederation being agreed upon. But the City of Fredericton v. The Queen ([16]), raised no such question, nor is any such point professed to be decided by our judgment in that case. There was no question there as to the right of a provincial legislature to insert, in an Act passed by it in relation to municipal institutions, such a provision as that in question here. What was decided in. the City of Frederiton v. The Queen was, that the Provincial Legislatures had not jurisdiction to pass such an Act as \"The Canada Temperance Act of 1878,\" and that the Dominion Parliament alone was competent to pass it; and of this opinion, also, was the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Russell v. The Queen ([17]); but there was nothing whatever in the decision calculated to call in question the right of the provincial legislatures to insert, in all acts in relation to municipal institutions, such provisions as those in question here, which relate to the raising of revenue from the issue of tavern licenses and to the establishment of regulations of a purely local and municipal character for governing the conduct of the parties licensed, which have always been deemed to be usual, and indeed proper and necessary regulations, to be established and enforced in all reordered municipalities, and essential to the efficient working of a system of local municipal self-government; and which, being of a purely local, municipal, private and domestic character, do not come within the true meaning of the term \"regulation of trade and commerce\" as used in section 91 which term as there used, is to be construed as applying to subjects of a general, public and quasi national character in which the inhabitants of the Dominion at 1arge may be said to have a common interest, as distinct from those matters of a purely provincial, local, municipal, private and domestic character in which the inhabitants of the several provinces may, as such, be said to have a peculiar and local interest. The by-law, therefore, of the city of Three Rivers, passed in 1877, increasing the license fee as established by the by-law of 1871 from $100 to $200 was authorized by the Act 38 Vic. ch. 76 and there is nothing in the License Act 41 Vic. ch. 3 depriving the corporation of the powers vested in it by 38 Vic. ch. 76. On the contrary, all those powers are, by the 37th sec. of 41 Vic. expressly preserved intact. The plaintiff, therefore, has failed to show any right to have had granted to him the certificate which he demanded of the corporation officers, he having failed to pay the $200 established by the by-law of the city then in force, as the fee necessary to be paid to entitle him to such certificate.\nif a corporation, under color of passing a by-law in virtue of the powers vested in it, should, for the purpose of effecting a total prevention of the trade in spirituous liquors in the municipality, pass a by-law establishing such an extravagant license fee as would have the effect of total annihilation of such trade within the municipality, the question of the validity of such a by-law will be open to consideration upon a proceeding raising that question. No such question is involved in the present case, and it will be time enough to entertain it if and when it shall arise.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: M.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\nDemurrer\u2014Shareholder or contributory of bank\u2014Action against\u2014 Eight of set-off\u201445 Vic., ch. 23, sec. 76\u2014Construction of.\nAn action was brought by the bank of P. E. I. against the appellant on a promissory note, to which he pleaded set off of a draft made by the plaintiffs and endorsed to him; to this there was a replication that the defendant was a contributory on the stock book of the bank, and knew that the bank was insolvent when the draft was purchased; the defendant demurred on the ground that the replication did not aver that the debt for which the action was brought was due from the defendant in his capacity as shareholder or contributory:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the replication was bad in law ([1]).\nJ. I., the appellant, gave to one Q. his note for $6,000, which was en- dorsed to the bank of P. E. I.; the Union Bank of P. E. I. at the time held a check or draft, made by the bank of P. E. I., for nearly the same amount, and this draft the appellant purchased for something more than $200 less than its face value; being sued on the note he set off the amount of such check or draft, and paid the difference. On the trial he admitted he had purchased it for the purpose of using it as an off-set to the claim on his note, which he had made non-negotiable, and he also admitted that if he could succeed in his set-off and another party could succeed in a similar transaction, the Union Bank would get their claim against the bank of P. E. I., which had become insolvent, paid in full. The judge on the trial charged that if the draft was endorsed to the defendant to enable him to use it as a set-off, he could not do so, because he was a contributory within the meaning of the 76th section of the Winding-up Act, and that the Act which came into force on the 12th May, 1882, was retrospective as regards the endorsements made before it was passed, but within thirty days before the commencement of the proceedings to wind up the affairs of the bank. The jury under the direction of the judge, found a general verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the note and interest, which the Supreme Court refused to disturb. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that appellant having purchased the draft in question for value and in good faith prior to 26th May, 1882, the Canada Winding-up Act, 45 Vic. ch. 23, was not applicable, and therefore the appellant was entitled to the benefit of his set-off, and that the Winding-up Act was not retrospective as to this endorsement.\nBy sections 75 and 76 Vic. ch. 23, it is provided that if a debt due or owing by the company has been transferred within 30 days next before the commencement of the winding up under that Act, or at any time afterwards, to a contributory who knows,. or has probable cause for believing, the company to be unable to meet its engagements or to be in contemplation of insolvency under the act, for the purpose of enabling such contributory to set up by way of compensation or set off the claim so transferred, such debt cannot be set up by way of compensation or set off against the claim upon such contributory.\nHeld, that the sections in question only apply to actions against a contributory when the debt claimed is due from the person sued in his capacity as contributory.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a new trial.\nThe facts of the case and the pleadings are sufficiently set out in the above head note.\nL. H. Davies Q. C. for appellant:\nWhen appellant purchased for value the draft, he had a perfect right to do so, unless the statute 45 Vic. ch. 23 interferes.\nBut it is contended that sect. 76 of the Act respecting Insolvent Banks deprives the appellant of the ordinary right of set off as respects this draft, because he was placed on the list of contributories as the holder of some shares in the insolvent bank, and although it is not alleged he made any default in paying the calls on him as such shareholder.\nI maintain that this section does not touch the present case or take away his right of set off under the 60th section.\nThe note sued on is dated 1st May, 1882. The draft pleaded as set off was endorsed to the appellant 5th May, 1882.\nThe Act respecting Insolvent Banks was passed 17th May, 1882.\nThe commencement of the winding up was not till 26th May, 1882. And therefore the purchase of the draft by the appellant could not be in contravention of the Act, for the Act had not been passed at the time of the purchase.\nThe right of the parties must be determined by the state of facts existing at the time of the transfer of the draft. See remarks of Smith J. in Watson v. Midwales Railway Company ([2]).\nAgain, the appellant was placed on the list of contributories for one reason and one reason only, viz: Because he was a holder of some shares of Bank of P. E. Island Stock of the original value of \u00a310 or $32.44 each, and in respect of which he was liable to a call for $64.88 on each share. He has paid all calls and is not sued as a contributory.\nThis is a right to prove for a debt, and statutes affecting such rights are held not to be retrospective. Re Joseph Suche & Co. ([3]).\nThe right of set off is liberally allowed by the court, unless expressly taken away by statute, and in case of doubt will be allowed to prevail. The right of set off having been given by statute the onus of proof is on the party denying the right. Lindley ([4]).\nThis is shewn by Blackburn L.J. in Bailey v. Finch ([5]).\nThe fact that a statute provides that assets of a company being wound up shall be divided pari passu, does not deprive the defendant of the right of pleading set off in an action for calls by liquidators of a company being voluntarily wound up. Brighton Arcade Co., limited, v. Dowling ([6]); per Lindley L.J. in Mersey Steel Co. v. Naylor ([7]).\nThere were no equities attaching to this draft, nor is there any equity to prevent the holder of an overdue draft from indorsing it away to avoid set off. Re Commercial Bank ([8]); Quids v. Harrison ([9]).\nEight of set off is never an equity attaching to a bill, and even in the case of debentures it must be:\u2014\nAn equity subsisting at date of assignment.\nNot subject to a debt which arose afterwards on a previous contract. Re China S. S. Co. (8[10]).\nR. R. Fitzgerald Q.C. and F. Peters for respondents contended that this set off cannot be allowed:\u2014 First\u2014Because this transaction was only a contrivance to obtain a preference for the Union Bank over other creditors of the insolvent bank, and that appellant was not the real beneficial holder of the draft sought to be set off.\nFair v. McIver ([11]); Lackington v. Combes ([12]); Foster v. Wilson ([13]) ; Watson v. Mid Wales Railway Co. ([14]); London, Bombay and Med. Bank v. Narraway ([15]); Bailey v. Finch ([16]); Ince Hall Rolling Mills Co. v. The Douglas Forge Co. ([17]).\nSecondly\u2014Under the Winding-up Act, 45 Vic. ch. 23, this set off is taken away by section 76.\nThe appellant comes clearly within this section; he was a contributory, and he knew that the insolvent bank was unable to meet its obligations, and that it would go into insolvency under this Act so soon as it passed, and he had the draft transferred to him within the prohibited time, and for the purpose of enabling him to set it off against the claim upon him.\nThe word \"claim \" in the 76th section, is general, and includes all claims no matter whether for contribution or otherwise.\nThe object of this section was to prevent contributories from using the knowledge they had as shareholders to obtain a preference over other creditors. The disablity is personal to the contributory, and its object is to prevent the possibility of his using his position to secure an inequitable distribution of the assets of the insolvent company.\nThe respondents also contend that if the word \"claim,\" in section 76, means only (as the appellant contends) a claim against the contributory in his capacity as contributory, then it would follow that in an ordinary case a contributory would be allowed to set off any debt due by the insolvent company to him against calls made on him as a contributory, otherwise it was unnecessary to prevent it in the one case mentioned in the 76th section.\nSuch a conclusion cannot be correct, as it is contrary to the whole spirit of the statute, and to all the English authorities, which clearly establish that there is no right to set off as against calls on contributories. Grissell's case ([18]); Calisher's case ([19]) ; Gill's case ([20]) ; In re White House & Co. ([21]).\nAs to the transaction having taken place before the Winding-up Act was passed, and that the Act is not retrospective, we contend that it is unnecessary to claim any retrospective effect. The note sued on did not become due until after the Act passed, and no right of set off existed until it became due, our statute relating to set off being a transcript of the English statute. Smith, Fleming & Co.'s case ([22]).\nThe respondents also contend that set off is a matter of procedure only, and as a general rule statutes regulating procedure are retrospective in their effect. Maxwell on Statutes ([23]).\nSTRONG J.\u2014I think it was very clearly and satisfactorily proved that the appellant acquired the draft which he seeks to set off bond fide and for a valuable consideration, and that he does not hold it as a trustee for the Union Bank; nor was it indorsed to him in order to carry out any fraudulent or colorable contrivance to enable the Union Bank to obtain a preference.\nIf the 76th section does not apply to the case, there can be no doubt but that under the second part of the 60th section it was perfectly legal for the appellant to purchase this draft, and he was entitled to set it off against his promissory note given to Quirk and indorsed by the latter to the respondents, and now sued on in this action.\nI am of opinion that the 76th section does not apply for two reasons: In the first place, as the appellant bought the draft before the Act passed, to make it applicable to the appellant would be manifestly to give it an ex post facto effect, an objection which is not answered by calling the right of set off a mere matter of procedure. The rule being that an ex post facto construction will never be adopted when substantial rights are affected, even in respect of matters of procedure.\nNext, the 76th section, in terms, is, as plainly as words can make it so, confined to cases of set off by contributories against claims for contributions, and this is not such a claim. The only argument against this interpretation, which the language of the clause manifestly calls for, is that so to construe it, implies that in respect of all claims other than those transferred within the time limited in sec. 75, the contributory would have a right of set off against his liability for calls; whether such a consequence would follow or not, it is not necessary now to decide, but certainly such an argument is entirely insufficient to warrant a construction which would place a contributory, who has paid up his calls but who is also liable to the bank as an ordinary debtor, in a worse position than other debtors ; there is nothing in the statute depriving a debtor of the bank sued upon a promissory note from purchasing a negotiable instrument upon which then bank is liable, and setting it off; and a person who may happen to be a contributory, stands in no worse position in this respect than any other debtor of the bank, unless indeed we are to import by implication into the statute a prohibitory clause making a distinction between a debtor, who happens also to have been a contributory, and one who was not so liable; such a mode of construction I never before heard of, and no principle can be suggested, nor authority cited, to warrant it.\nI think, therefore, the respondent wholly fails in supporting the judgment of the court below which must be reversed, both as regards the refusal to grant a new trial and on the demurrer, and the rule for a new trial must be made absolute in the court below as being against the weight of evidence and for misdirection, and judgment entered for the appellant on the demurrer, with costs to the appellant in both courts.\nSir. W. J. Ritchie C.J. and Fournier and Taschereau JJ. concurred.\nHenry J.\u2014I have no doubt that the party was entitled to take the note that he did, and that having taken it before the call was made upon him, he had a right to set it up against the claim of the bank. If he had purchased it after the call was made, he would stand in a different position. Here the call is of a certain and definite nature, and not a mere matter of account between the parties. If a call is made upon a contributory he is bound to pay it, unless the bank owes him at the time, in which case he has a right to a set off. I therefore agree in the judgment of my brother Strong.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

A kind of type. 2. The membrane hinge for a black leaf, the whole bound by an elastic band to the ends or sides of the lower cover. 3. A totalling sheet.\nAfter the dissolution he proceeded to manufacture cheque books under his patent.\nThe plaintiffs instituted proceedings to restrain such manufacture, claiming that their patent was thereby infringed, and, on the hearing before the Chancellor, obtained the relief prayed for; the Court of Appeal reversed this judgment holding, that although the plaintiff\u2019s patent was infringed by the act of the defendant, yet, that the patent itself was void for want of novelty and could not be protected. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld,\u2014That the patent of the plaintiffs under which they claimed was a valid patent, and, as there was no doubt that it was infringed by the manufacture and sale of the defendant\u2019s books, the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed and that of the Chancellor restored.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing a judgment of the Chancellor in favor of the plaintiffs.\nOne J.R. Carter, in 1882, became the sole patentee of an alleged invention bearing the name of \u201cThe Paragon Black Leaf Cheque Book.\u201d In his specifications Carter stated that he claimed as his invention: \u201cA Black Leaf Cheque Book composed of double leaves, one-half of which are bound together, while the other half folds in as fly-leaves, both being perforated across so that they can readily be torn out; the combination of the black leaf bound into the book next the cover and provided with tape bound across its end; the said black leaf having the transferring composition on one of its sides only.\u201d By the letters patent Carter was to have the sole right to manufacture and sell these books for five years.\nIn anticipation of the patent Carter had sold half his interest in the invention to the defendant, with whom he had entered into partnership, and after the issue of the letters patent the one\u2011half interest was formally assigned to the defendant. The partnership between the defendant and Carter only continued for a few months, and on its being dissolved the defendant reassigned the half interest in the patent to Carter, and on the same day the whole interest was assigned by Carter to the plaintiffs. Shortly before the dissolution of partnership the defendant had obtained a patent for an alleged improvement on Carter\u2019s invention, to which he gave the name of \u201cButterfield\u2019s improved Paragon Cheque-book;\u201d in his specification he claimed the following as his invention:\n1. A kind of type effecting a saving in the labor and expense of printing in connection with counter chequebooks and other duplicating fly-leaf books.\n2. A membrane hinge binding the black leaf between the lower leaf of the book and the lower cover, and attached to the upper or clean side of the leaf at a point near the stub perforation (when said leaf is in position for use), and passing around the end of the carbon leaf to its lower or black side where it hangs loosely, preventing the soiling of the stub and forming a strong and pliable hinge for the bleak leaf.\n3. In a counter cheque-book provided with a hinged black leaf as described, totalling sheets printed on the inside of the covers of the book.\nThe defendant continued, after the dissolution, to make and sell cheque-books under his said patent, and the plaintiffs, claiming that their patent was thereby infringed, instituted proceedings to restrain such manufacture and sale, and the Chancellor who heard the cause gave judgment in their favor. This judgment the Court of Appeal reversed, on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 patent was void for want of novelty, holding also, that the dealings between the defendant and Carter did not estop the latter from questioning the patent. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. Cassels Q.C. for the appellants.\nIt is not necessary for the plaintiffs, who obtained a patent prior in point of date to that of defendant, to impeach the defendant\u2019s patent by scire facias, as was contended for by him in the court below. The plaintiff\u2019s case is established by the simple production of the patent referred to in the statement of claim. The judge who tried the case found the defendant\u2019s patent was an infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s. It may be his patent is an improvement, but then he is entitled to nothing more than the improvement, and cannot appropriate the invention of the plaintiffs.\nThe question of the patent being void for want of utility is not pleaded. There being no evidence on the part of the defence the patent is sufficient evidence of the utility. And if the question of evidence be looked at, the evidence is conclusive in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s contention.\nBy the specifications of the patent, Carter states that the object of the invention is to provide a check book, in which the black leaf used for transferring writing from one page to another need not be handled. The specification states that the leaf has a transferring composition on its bottom side only, and is provided with a tape, &c.\nFurthermore, it states that the patentee is aware that black leaves are used in other forms of books used in transferring writing from one page to another, but they are either loose in the book, and are therefore easily lost, and are dirty to handle, or are placed in the centre of the book, &c.\nThe learned judge in appeal says that it is even \u201cleft to be inferred that the leaf is to be bound in the book with the blackened side undermost.\u201d The learned judge has omitted to consider that the specifications expressly state that the leaf has a transferring composition on its bottom side only. Furthermore, the plan put in shows this to be the case, and the plan must be looked at to explain and illustrate the patent. The learned judge is also in error in considering that the only object of having a transferring composition on one side is to prevent the fingers from being soiled. The specification states that black leaves hitherto in use are dirty to handle. The learned judge seems to think that relates merely to the fingers in turning over the leaf. It is obvious that if there were a tape on either side of the leaf, it is immaterial whether it were black on one side or both, so far as this point is concerned, but the evidence in the case demonstrates that not merely by means of the leaf being blackened on one side only is it cleaner for the person using the book, but one important benefit arrived at is in regard to the goods purchased. The back of the customer\u2019s bill is not defaced, and this is shown to be a considerable benefit. In the case where the leaf is blackened on both sides, of necessity when the entry is made by the clerk selling the goods the paper resting upon the darkened side receives a certain amount of dirt from the carbon leaf. If this paper is then taken off, as is customary in shops, and placed upon the goods of the customer, it would have a tendency to dirty such goods; but in the case in question, with the leaf blackened on one side only, the paper upon which the memo, is written for the customer does not come in contact with the carbon, and cleanliness is thereby attained; and it is shown by the evidence that this is a matter of considerable moment. When the specifications state that the leaf is dirty to handle, they should be considered in a fair and liberal manner, and the patent should not be destroyed by a narrow scrutiny, and a meaning placed not intended and not contemplated. See Otto v. Linford[2]. There is an additional use in having the carbon blackened on one side, viz., that by virtue thereof the leaf given to customers can be written on both sides\u2014not being blackened by the carbon, it can be turned over and the other side utilized; and this is also shown by the evidence to be of considerable benefit.\nIt was argued by the defendant in the court below that by reason of the omission of the tape in the books manufactured by him the infringement was not proved. The learned Chancellor has disposed of this by his judgment, and it would appear that during the time that Carter and Butterfield were in partnership the books were manufactured without this tape, and the omission of this tape would not prevent the defendant from being liable. See Clarke v. Adie[3]; Dudgeon v. Thomson[4]; and Harrison v. Anderston Foundry Co.[5]\nFurthermore it is contended that by the double use of the leaf the defendant substitutes an equivalent for the tape. It is quite clear that the use of an equivalent would not prevent the defendant from being an infringer, and in this particular case it is not contended that the appellants omit an element, but the fact is that they use one element in a double capacity. In one capacity it is an equivalent for the tape. The appellants refer to Latta v. Shawk[6]; Curtis[7]; Seymour v. Osborne[8]; and numberless cases in the United States to the same effect, and Smith v. Goldie[9] in this court.\nR.E. Kingsford for respondent.\nIt is urged by the plaintiffs that the ground of the decision of the Court of Appeal is want of utility, and that this question was not raised in pleading, and that therefore the judgment should not have been given on this ground. A perusal of the judgment shows that this is not the ground, or the only ground\u2014besides, the point is sufficiently raised by the pleadings. At any rate the point arises upon the evidence for the plaintiffs, and if any technical difficulty arises in regard to the pleading, the court has power to amend, and it should be exercised in a case of this kind where the whole case rests on the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs.\nI contend that the appellant\u2019s alleged invention was not patentable, and there is no infringement.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s patent is for a combination, of which the tape is the distinctive feature\u201d. The alleged equivalent is, as pointed out in judgment of Court of Appeal, no equivalent. The combination is an entirety; if one element be given up, even if immaterial, the combination disappears. Vance v. Campbell[10]. A patent for a combination is not a patent for all and each of the parts. Treadwell v. Bladen[11]. A patent for a combination of three things cannot be a patent for a combination of two. Curtis on Patents[12]; Bump on Patents[13].\nNo one can, by combining several devices,\u2014each of which is old, (which is what the plaintiffs do when they abandon their tape) deprive others of the right to use them separately, or of the right to use them in new combinations, or of the right to use some of them in combination omitting others. Hailes v. Van Wormer[14]; referred to in Yates v. G.W.R.[15]\nThe plaintiff does not claim a black leaf check book, nor perforated leaves, nor the binding of the leaves, or the black leaves as part of his invention. His claim is for a combination of the black leaf bound into the book next the cover, and provided with a tape across its end. Of what then can there be an infringement? Not of the books nor the leaves, nor the black leaves, nor the binding. It is abundantly clear that the defen- dant\u2019s article does not, nor does his patent infringe upon what is covered by the plaintiff\u2019s patent, if anything is covered by it at all.\nAlthough patentee is the inventor of one part of a combination, still it is only claimed in combination with the other parts. A party does not infringe the patent unless he uses the whole combination. Foster v. Moore[16].\nThen as to the equivalent.\nIf the defendant uses an article that was not known as an equivalent at the date of the patent in substitution for another in a compound there is no infringement. Gould v. Rees[17]; Seymour v. Osborne[18].\nI also rely on the fact that the plaintiffs (who are now the appellant\u2019s) did not, by their pleadings or evidence, impeach the validity of the defendant\u2019s (respondents) patent, although they had express notice by the pleadings that the defendant intended to rely upon his said patent, yet they did not attack the same nor set up that the defendant\u2019s patent was void, as being in any way an infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s patent, nor did they seek to avoid it, nor show that the defendant was not making according to his patent, or infringing the plaintiffs\u2019 combination; and contend that so long as his patent was not impeached, and it was shown that in manufacturing the books claimed to be an infringement of plaintiffs\u2019 alleged patent he was working in accordance with his patent, the plaintiffs were not in a position to succeed as against him. See Copeland v. Webb[19].\nW. Cassels Q.C. in reply.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I agree with the Chancellor that there was an infringement of the plaintiffs\u2019 patent, and that the defendant is making substantially the same kind of books as those of the plaintiffs, with some slight modifications which may or may not be improvements.\nI think there was evidence of the utility of the invention, but that question was not tried in the Court of Appeal, and does not appear to have been raised in the pleadings; on the contrary, the statement of defence appears to me substantially to admit the utility of the invention.\nI think the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed and the Chancellor\u2019s judgment restored.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I think that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nHENRY J.\u2014The patent under which the appellants claim was a valid patent of a useful invention, and there can be no doubt that the respondent infringed that patent. I think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Edgar & Malone.\nSolicitor for respondent: R.E.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPatent\u2014Infringement of\u2014Combination\u2014New Result.\nH. obtained a patent for an oven, claiming to have discovered a way of building the same so as to economise fuel 5 the patent consisted of a combination of five parts, none of which were claimed to be new, the alleged invention consisting merely of the result.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Strong J. dissenting, that the combination, being a mere aggregation of parts not in themselves patentable, and producing no new result due to the combination itself, was no invention, and consequently it could not form the subject of a patent.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] setting aside a verdict for appellant (plaintiff below). In August, 1880, the appellant applied for and obtained a patent for a baker\u2019s oven (a patent having been previously granted to him, the specifications for which he had discovered to be defective) the object of which, as stated in the specification, was to economize fuel and allow the fire to be kept in the oven during the whole process of baking. The improvement for which the patent was applied for was stated to consist in placing a fire\u2011pot within the oven but below the sole. Separate doors and dampers were provided for the fire-pot, and it was so arranged that it could be fed with coal during the whole process of baking. The appellant stated in his evidence that what he claimed as his invention was as follows:\u2014\n1. A fire-pot or furnace placed within a baker\u2019s oven below the sole thereof, and provided with a door situated above the grate.\n2. A fire-pot or furnace placed within a baker\u2019s oven, provided with a door above the level of the sole of the oven, and connected to the said furnace by an inclined guide.\n3. In a baker\u2019s oven, a flue leading from below the grate to the main flue.\n4. A baker\u2019s oven provided with a circular tilting grate, situated below the sole of the oven and provided with a door.\n5. In a baker\u2019s oven, a cinder grate placed beneath the fire grate, in combination with a flue leading from below the grate to the main flue.\nAnd in his specification he said: \u201cWhat I claim as my invention is: In combination with a baker\u2019s oven, a furnace set within the oven but below the sole.\u201d\nThe Respondent, who carried on a bakery business in Toronto, having had occasion to build a new oven in connection with her business, the appellant brought suit against her for an injunction, alleging that such oven was made from the description in the specification for the above patent and was an infringement of the same. The respondent, in her statement of defence, denied that her oven contained the improvements set out in such specification, or any of them, or that it was an infringement of such patent, and the defence was also set up, that appellant\u2019s alleged improvements were not new and that the patent was void.\nThe cause was heard before Proudfoot V.C. who granted the injunction prayed for, and ordered a reference to the master to ascertain the damages sustained by the appellant. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, the majority of the Court holding that the subject of the appellant\u2019s patent was a mere aggregation of parts not new in themselves and producing no new result due to the combination itself, and therefore was not an invention, and, consequently, not patentable.\nW. Cassels Q.C. for appellant.\nThe patent in question was a patent re-issued, and although the elements of it are old, we claim the combination as new. It is the simultaneous action of all the parts working jointly together that creates the result.\nThe learned counsel then reviewed the evidence, contending that the combination obtained a new result, and relied on the following cases: Smith v. Goldie[2], and cases therein cited; Murray v. Clayton[3]; Spencer v. Jack[4].\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and Dr. McMichael Q.C. for respondent.\nThe evidence in this case clearly shows that the patent brought out no new element or factor; that there is neither novely nor utility in the invention, and that, as a combination, it produces no new results, but is simply an aggregate of separate results. The learned counsel cited and commented on the following cases, inter alia. Harriston v. Anderston Foundry Co.[5]; Hinks v. Safety Lighting Co.[6]; Adie v. Clark[7]; Pickering v. McCullough[8]; Cropper v. Smith[9].\nW. Cassels Q.C. in reply cited:\nOtto v. Linford[10]; Fay v. Cordesman[11].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014(After stating the particulars of the alleged invention, and referring to the judgments of the court below.)\nI agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the patent claimed by the plaintiff cannot be supported, and I think the appeal should be dismissed, on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s invention was not properly the subject of a patent for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Chancellor restored.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I agree with His Lordship the Chief Justice that the appeal should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014The appellant seeks to recover from the respondent damages for the infringement of a patent right claimed by him under letters patent issued to him on the 26th August, 1880, for what is called \u201cHunter\u2019s Improved Oven.\u201d His claim in the specification is: \u201cIn combination with a baker\u2019s oven a furnace I) set within the oven but below the sole A,\u201d and the patent right granted is for that combination. He claims nothing for any one or more of the several parts mentioned in the specification, which are employed merely to show the combination, and therefore we are to conclude none of them was new. They are described as follows:\u2014\n\u201cIn the drawing A is the sole of the oven; B its door, and C the raising over; in none of these do I claim anything peculiar, but instead of making the fire on the sole A, as is customary, I construct a fire-pot or furnace D within the oven, the grate E being below the level of the sole A. The fuel is fed through the door E, which can be made in any usual way; G is a cinder grate, either perforated as shown, or in any other form thought most desirable; an ash pit H, completes the furnace. The flues in the oven are of the usual kind, but in addition to that I make a special flue beneath the grate E, which is connected with the main flue of the oven E in any suitable manner; this flue has naturally a tendency to check the fire, and may be provided with dampers similar to those placed in the other flues. As is well known to those familiar with baker\u2019s ovens, a fire is made in the sole, and when the required temperature is obtained it is withdrawn, and the bread or other article to be baked inserted.\u201d\nThe respondent pleaded, amongst other things, as follows:\n2. In answer to the fourth paragraph of the said bill I admit that I have lately built a new oven, but I deny that such oven contains the improvements claimed by the plaintiff in his patent in the said bill referred to, or any of them, or that my oven is an infringement upon the alleged patent of the plaintiff.\n5. I am informed and believe, and charge the fact to be, that the means of heating ovens claimed by the plaintiff in his patent have been in public use in this Dominion for many years prior to the plaintiff\u2019s patent, and that there was and is no novelty and improvement on any other invention in the plaintiff\u2019s alleged invention.\n6. I submit that there was not prior to or at the date of the said patent, any novelty in the plaintiff\u2019s alleged invention, and that the same was not, nor was any part thereof, a new or useful invention or improvement upon a prior invention within the meaning of \u201cThe Patent Act of 1872.\u201d And that the improvements claimed by the plaintiff in his said patent are trifling and insignificant, and that the said alleged invention of the said plaintiff is not, and was not the subject of a patent, and could not be patented. And I further submit that the said patent is invalid and void.\n7. I submit that the specifications filed by the plaintiff on his application for the said patent do not clearly and distinctly state the contrivances and things which the plaintiff claimed as new, and for which he obtained the said patent, and that they claim more than the said plaintiff could in any event obtain a patent for, and I therefore submit that the said patent is void.\n8. I also submit that the said patent is void, because the same includes as new a contrivance which was, I believe, and charge the fact to be, well known and publicly used prior to the plaintiff\u2019s said patent.\nThe pleas therefore, put in issue all that was necessary to entitle the respondent to deny the infringement of the appellant\u2019s rights under the patent, and also to contest its validity.\nBy the evidence it is shown that all the combinations were used before the issue of the patent, except per- haps, one flue which is referred to in the specifications as before shown, and is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe flues in the oven are of the usual kind, but in addition to that I make a special flue beneath the grate E, which is connected with the main flue of the oven in any suitable manner; this flue has, naturally, a tendency to check the fire, and may be provided with dampers similar to those placed in the other flues.\u201d\nIt will be observed on referring to the patent and specifications, that the first does not grant, and the latter does not claim, any right for the combination of the flue in question. They are both limited to a combination of \u201ca furnace D set within the oven below the sole A.\u201d The erection therefore, of such a flue by the respondent, would have been no infringement of the patent right, and it is shown also that in the erection of the oven by her no such flue was constructed and therefore there could be no infringement of the right. The evidence establishes the fact, to my mind very conclusively, that the combination claimed by the appellant was not new when he obtained his patent, and that furnaces set within the oven and below the sole had previously been made and used.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the court below affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred with Ritchie C.J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Blake, Kerr, Lash & Cassels.\nSolicitors for respondent: McMichael, Hoskin & Ogden.\n[1] 10 Ont.

He claimed an exclusive right to the use of the name \u201cBeatty\u201d in connection with his copy book, and alleged that he had paid a larger sum on the dissolution than he would have paid unless he was to have the exclusive sale of these copy books.\nHeld, Affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Henry and Taschereau JJ. dissenting,\u2014That defendants had no right to sell \u201cBeatty\u2019s New and Improved Head-line Copy Book\u201d in any form, or with any cover, calculated to deceive purchasers into the belief that they were buying the books of the plaintiff.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing a motion to set aside a judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson in favor of the plaintiff[2]. In May, 1877, the plaintiff entered into partnership with the defendant Beatty, to carry on business under the name of Adam Miller & Co. A considerable part of the business was the manufacture and sale of head-line copy-books, and during the partnership Beatty designed a valuable copy-book which had a large sale, and to which was given the name \u201cBeatty\u2019s Head\u2011line Copy-Book.\u201d\nIn August, 1879, the partnership was dissolved by Beatty retiring, and he received $20,000 for his interest in the business. After the dissolution, in August, 1881, plaintiff registered the name \u201cBeatty\u201d in connection with Beatty\u2019s head-line copy-book.\nSubsequently to this Beatty entered into an engagement with the Canada Publishing Company, by which he was to prepare head-line copy books for the company. Such books were prepared and sold under the name of \u201cBeatty\u2019s New and Improved Head-line Copy\u2011books.\u201d\nThe plaintiff instituted proceedings against both Beatty and the company, alleging that the last mentioned copy-books infringed his trade mark, and that the public were deceived in purchasing such books, supposing they were the books of the plaintiff. The bill prayed for an injunction and an account.\nMr. Justice Ferguson, who heard the cause, gave judgment for the plaintiff, which was sustained by the Court of Appeal. From the judgment of the last-mentioned court the defendants appealed.\nThe facts are fully stated in the report of the case in 6 O.R. 68.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and J. Maclennan Q.C. for the appellants, the Canada Publishing Company.\nW. Barwick for the appellant Beatty.\nIn addition to the points raised by counsel for appellants, and cases cited which appear in the report of the case in 6 O.R. 68, the learned counsel relied on the following case and authorities. Pearson v. Pearson,[3] Sebastian on the Law of Trade Marks[4].\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and Z.A. Lash Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe publication by the defendants of their book was conceived in fraud, for the purpose of having the defendants\u2019 book sold as and for the plaintiff\u2019s book. The defendants, knowing what the public wanted and demanded was a book called \u201cBeatty\u2019s,\u201d made use of the name Beatty for this fraudulent purpose.\nIn preparing the cover for the defendants\u2019 book, the name \u201cBeatty\u201d was put in a prominent position because of its great value, and the name was made valuable in connection with copy books solely by the efforts and at the expense of the plaintiff and his firm. (The learned counsel then reviewed the evidence and contended that it was unquestionable that the book published by the defendants was meant to deceive, was calculated to deceive, and did deceive the public.)\nThe principle upon which the court should act in a case like the present, appears from the cases cited in the judgment in the court below[5].\nThe learned counsel also argued that the plaintiff had a right to restrain the defendants from infringing his trade mark, which consisted in the word \u201cBeatty\u201d and was a valuable asset of the firm.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J., after reviewing the facts presented on the appeal, and the judgments of the court below, proceeded as follows:\nIn my opinion the plaintiff had the exclusive right to use the name \u201cBeatty\u201d in connection with, and as denoting, copy books of his manufacture, and no one has the right to the word for the purpose of passing off his books as those of the plaintiff, or even when innocent of that purpose, to use it in any way calculated to deceive, or aid in deceiving the public, to the detriment of the plaintiff; but, claiming the interference of the court, they must be prepared to show that the public are deceived, and purchasers misled, or that there is a reasonable probability of parties being deceived. This, in my opinion, has been shown in the present case.\nI think the book, as published by the defendants, was calculated to deceive, and did deceive, and was intended to deceive purchasers. I adopt as perfectly applicable to the same the language of James and Thesiger L. JJ., in Metzler v. Wood[6]; James L.J. says:\u2014\nThere is really no question of law in this case, no question of the right of a man to the use of his own name, or anything of the kind. The simple question is: Did the defendant dishonestly pass off his work as the work of the plaintiffs? That really is the sole issue, and the Vice-Chancellor has found in favor of the plaintiffs. It appears to me impossible to doubt the correctness of his conclusion.\nAnd Thesiger L.J. says:\u2014\nThis is still more plain when we think of the class of persons who would be purchasers of this book, probably mothers of families, or governesses instructing young children, and who were told that \u201cBeatty\u2019s\u201d (substituting \u201cBeatty\u2019s for \u201cHemy\u2019s\u201d) was the best work for the purpose of so instructing children.\nThere is not a person that would not, unless thoroughly acquainted with both the works in dispute, be satisfied when he was presented with a copy of the defendants work, that he was receiving the well-known and popular copy book of Beatty as published by the plaintiff.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am sorry to differ from my learned brethren, but after a great deal of consideration have come to an opposite conclusion. The claim here is not made on a copyright, but merely to use a name as a matter of common law right in connection with \u201cheadline copy-books.\u201d There is nothing peculiar in \u201c headline copy books;\u201d all copy-books have a printed \u201cheadline \u201c and are so called\u2014they have been in use for a number of years in the United States, Scotland and England, and imported and sold as such in this country. The first series Beatty issued was printed as \u201cBeatty\u2019s System of Practical Penmanship,\u201d and had no reference whatever to \u201chead-lines,\u201d for such could form no distinctive character;\u2014subsequently Beatty, who had been in partnership with Gage the respondent, sold out his interest in the partnership, including his interest in the copy-book printed and published by Gage and him, to his partner, and on the dissolution the right to sell remained in Gage. Beatty subsequently prepared, and the appellants published copy-books under the name of \u201cBeatty\u2019s New and Improved Head-line Copy-Books.\u201d This title sufficiently distinguishes them from the respondent\u2019s book, printed and published as \u201cBeatty\u2019s System of Practical Penmanship.\u201d Under these circumstances what right had Gage to the sole use of Beatty\u2019s name? True, at first Beatty was a partner with him, and when they dissolved partnership Gage had, no doubt, a right to continue to use his name, but could he stop Beatty from using his own name on a different work? The appellants\u2019 company, a publishing firm, wanted a superior work to what was in use, and applied to Beatty, who had earned for himself a reputation as a penman, and he furnished the new work, and they published it as \u201cBeatty\u2019s New and Improved Head-Line Copy Books,\u201d These books are as different in general appearance from those published by respondents as two copy books could be, and they were made so as to prevent anybody acquainted with the subject matter from taking one for the other. Then the question arises: Did the appellant\u2019s adopt Beatty\u2019s name for the purpose of deceiving the public, and in order to palm off their goods for the plaintiffs goods? In my opinion there is no evidence to support that contention. There was no copyright of Gage\u2019s book, and it was admitted by all the judges that the law as to copyright did not govern the case, but the fact merely that appellants were using Beatty\u2019s name when selling their books was sufficient to give a right to plaintiffs to stop them from using it and interfere with their business. Suppose Beatty had patented a plough known as Beatty\u2019s plough, and sold his patent, and afterwards patented an improved article, not infringing the old, and called it Beatty\u2019s new and improved plough, could the owner of the original patent sue the maker of the improved article for infringement? I do not think he could. Here the copy book of the appellants did not infringe any right in the book published and sold by Gage. It appears to me the appellants did not usurp anything sold by Gage and they gave sufficient notice, by the title and appearance of those they published, to parties not to buy their books as being those sold by Gage.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nCan. Temp. Act\u2014Election under\u2014Scrutiny\u2014Powers of County Court Judge\u2014Matters affecting the election.\nA Judge of the County Court, in holding a scrutiny of the votes polled at an election under the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, has only to determine the majority of votes cast, on one side or the other, by inspection of the ballots used in the election, and has no power to inquire into offences against the Act, and allow or reject ballots as a result of such inquiry. (Henry J. dubitante.)\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick making absolute a rule nisi for a mandamus.\nAn election was held in the County of Westmoreland, N.B., on a petition for a repeal of an order in council declaring the second part of the Canada Temperance Act in force in the said county. The election resulted in the defeat of the petition, and the present respondent applied to the Judge of the County Court for the said county for a scrutiny of the votes. The petition presented to the judge for an order for such scrutiny contained the following, among other matters, into which he was requested to inquire:\u2014\nThat at one or more polling places in the parish of Botsford there was not a sufficient number of ballot papers provided by the Returning Officer at said poll, and that in consequence thereof many electors who attended at said polling places, were unable to vote at said poll and were refused liberty to vote, because of such deficiency of ballot papers.\nThat divers persons were admitted to vote against the petition who were not qualified to vote, some of whom personated others who were entitled to, but did not vote, and that persons were induced to vote against the petition by bribery and other corrupt practices.\nThat many persons entitled to vote and desirous of voting in favor of the adoption of the petition, were deceived by the nature and form of the ballot papers used thereat, and in consequence of such deception voted against such petition unwittingly.\nThe learned judge declined to enter into the consideration of the above matters, whereupon the respondent obtained from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick a rule nisi for a mandamus to direct him so to do. This rule was subsequently made absolute.\nThe parties against whom the petition was directed to be brought appealed from the judgment making absolute the rule nisi for mandamus, to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nA. G. Blair, Atty. Gen. for N. B., for appellants.\nThe principal question in the case is what is meant by a scrutiny of votes under sections 61 and 62 of the Canada Temperance Act, 1878? What are the powers of the judge, and what is the extent of the enquiry into which he may enter?\nSections 61 and 62 show clearly that the scrutiny intended by the Act is a scrutiny of the ballot papers only. The ballot papers, not the votes, are to be the subject of the scrutiny. In fact, unless reasonable grounds are shown to the judge by affidavit for a scrutiny of the ballot papers, he cannot proceed with the enquiry. The legislature, if intending to provide for a general enquiry into the validity of the election, would have required the affidavit to support the grounds, whatever they might be, on which the election was to be voided.\nSection 70 should not be read as throwing any light upon sections 61 or 62. That section is to be found classified under the head of penalties. The section does not create a tribunal nor enlarge the powers of any tribunal already existing. Its object was, no doubt, to provide, out of an abundance of caution on the part of the draftsman of the Act, against any proceedings bringing the election into question which might possibly be taken in the Supreme Court.\nI also contend that the writ of mandamus could not properly issue to compel Judge Botsford to enquire into the allegations in the third paragraph of section 8 of the petition.\n(a.) Because such an enquiry is not within his jurisdiction.\n(b.) Because he could not, if the allegations were proved, on such material, determine that the majority of votes was in favor of the petition.\n(c.) Because it is not alleged, and it does not appear, that there were votes enough refused in consequence of such want of ballot papers, to alter the result if all such votes had been cast for the petition.\nThe allegations in the fifth paragraph of section eight of the petition are covered in part by the allegations in section four, and the writ could not properly issue to compel the judge to enquire as to those matters.\nR. Barry Smith for respondent.\nThe county court judge, in addition to the powers conceded by the other side, is given the power to scrutinize the polling of votes so far as to ascertain if the poll has been conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Act, and if, on the evidence, he finds it has not been so conducted, to declare the polling of votes invalid See Canada Temperance Act, secs. 61, 62, 63, 64, 70, 86 and 89; 41 Vic. ch. 6 s. 14 (D), and Allen C.J. in ex parte Boyne[1].\nIt will be observed, in the first place, that in sec. 61 the word scrutiny is used, not recount. This word implies a looking into, an investigation, an enquiry and a result of the same. In law it is used in connection with elections in the sense of an investigation into the mode of carrying on the election, and of ascertaining whether it has been done in accordance with the law applicable to it, and a subsequent judicial determination of the question of its validity. This is the ordinary legal meaning of the word, and in the 61st and 62nd sections of this Act there is nothing to show that it is not used in the ordinary legal sense. On the contrary, the provision of the 62nd section for the taking of evidence shows that it is intended to be so used. For why, if the powers of the judge are limited to a mere recounting of the votes as shown on the ballot papers, should he take evidence? It is not necessary to take evidence to show that two and two make four, or what the number of ballot-papers before the judge may be. It is clear he can hear some evidence. Where is the line to be drawn, and what right has he to restrict the evidence when the Act does not do so?\nBy construing the 62nd section in the way contended for by the respondent, it is made perfectly consistent with the 70th section of the Act. If the 62nd section is construed to give the judge only the power to recount and declare the numerical majority of ballots, this section is meaningless, because there would be no tribunal having cognizance of the question, i.e., of the validity or otherwise of the poll. It will be noticed that in the 80th section of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874 this section is found, though with substantial differences. There the election is not to be declared invalid, &c., and the word election is used throughout, while here it is the polling of votes. The tribunal there referred to applies to any court which may have cognizance of the question, and by the very next Act, that relating to controverted elections, a tribunal is given cognizance of the question. Could it be reasonably contended that the 80th section referred to did not apply to the election court so erected? Here we have a tribunal established by the Act itself, and yet it is contended by the appellants that the 70th section does not apply to that tribunal It is said that the word used would have been \"judge\" not \"tribunal\" if the reference had been to the county judge, but it will be remembered that in different provinces different judges are to enter on the scrutiny under sec. 61, and it was convenient to refer to the judge who might sit, according to locality, by some general name. If the judge is not meant, what tribunal is referred to? To what other tribunal is given the cognizance of the question? And it is important to note the wording of the section. No polling of votes shall be declared invalid by reason of a non-compliance, &c., as to the counting of the votes, &c. Now the judge is made the final tribunal as to counting, at least, sec. 63, and so no appeal or certiorari would lie, if he acted within his jurisdiction, from his decision. Then the declaring the polling invalid must have reference to his decision since he only is given the cognizance of the counting of votes.\nNow, if the poll has not been taken, or if the votes have not been counted, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Act, and the result has been affected by such defective counting or taking of votes, the judge shall declare the polling invalid. That is the obvious effect of section 70. But to ascertain the defect, and to learn whether it is one that affects the result, and whether it is or is not in accordance with the rules and principles of the Act, requires evidence to be taken by the judge and the hearing of the parties or their counsel. Thus the 70th section and the 62nd are rendered harmonious, and the provision for taking evidence is at once made clear and effective. On the other hand the amendment to the Elections Act, providing for a recount, as has been said already, provides for application to a judge on affidavit of a credible witness, instead of a petition and affidavits which are commonly used in cases of scrutiny and are expressly required by this Act; it provides that the grounds of the application shall be, that such witness believes that a deputy returning officer has improperly counted or rejected ballot papers, or that the returning officer has improperly summed up the votes, while this Act provides that the petition shall shew \"reasonable grounds for entering into a scrutiny;\" it defines the duties and powers of the judge, and expressly limits them to taking care of the ballots, counting them, correcting the statements, sealing up the ballots and certifying them to the returning officer, while this Act says he shall hear evidence and hear the parties or their counsel, and may determine whether the majority of votes given was or was not in favor of the petition, and that no polling shall be declared invalid, &c., as by the 70th section. The difference between the powers given to the judge by the two Acts is very marked and it is submitted that the 62nd and 70th sections of this Act bear out fully the proposition contended for, that the judge has power, not only to recount, but to take evidence, and if it appears to him that the poll has not been conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Act, to declare such poll invalid. For these reasons the judgment of the majority of the court below ought to be affirmed.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE, C. J.\u2014Mr. Justice Palmer thus states the contentions in the court below. He says:\u2014\nThe applicant's contention is that the judge has jurisdiction, and ought to enquire into the number and the validity of the votes on both sides, and of the validity of the election itself, including the question whether it has been properly held, and all proceedings therein properly and fairly carried on in pursuance of the provisions of the Act; and in case it has not, to declare it void.\nThe other side contends that all such judge has power to do is, \"to inspect the ballots, and, from such inspection, to decide, from what appears on their face, whether they are good or not; then counting them, determine which side has a majority of votes.\"\nWith reference to the term \"scrutiny,\" Mr. Justice Palmer says:\u2014\nIt is a word commonly used in reference to elections and with reference to a full enquiry to determine both their result and validity.\nThat may, or may not, be so, but whatever may be the signification usually attached to the term in a general sense, when applied to elections the scrutiny provided for by the express terms of the Act is limited to a scrutiny of the ballot papers, and the duty of the County Court Judge to such a scrutiny, that is, to a critical examination of the ballot papers, and he is required, upon an inspection of the ballot papers and hearing such evidence as he may deem necessary in respect to such an examination, in a summary manner to determine whether the majority of the votes given as indicated by the ballots was or was not in favour of the petition. And section 66 provides that:\u2014\nIn case of such a scrutiny being entered into, then forthwith after the judge has determined whether the majority of the votes given was or was not in favour of the petition, the returning officer shall transmit his return to the Secretary of State, and shall send with it a report of his proceedings, in which he shall make any observations he may think proper, and to the state of the ballot boxes or ballot papers as received by him; and in the event of a judge having determined, after a scrutiny of the ballot papers, that the majority of the votes given was or was not in favour of the petition, such returns shall be based upon, and shall be conformable to, such decision.\nBut no power or authority is given to the County Court Judge, that I can discover, to try and determine the validity of the election apart from and beyond scrutinizing the ballot papers. With reference to section 70, so much relied on, I think it is only necessary to say that that clause, in my opinion, confers no such power on the County Court Judge, however applicable it may be to a tribunal having power to supervise the proceedings of the election, and determine whether it has been properly held and all proceedings rightly carried out in pursuance of the provision of the Act, and generally to deal with the validity of the election. If the legislature intended to give this power to the County Court Judge, they have failed to do so in express terms or to make such an intention apparent by any reasonable inference.\nI concur generally in the view expressed by Mr. Justice King in the court below, and also with the conclusion which has been arrived at by Mr. Justice Rose in a case lately decided in Ontario[2].\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am not very positive on this matter, and have formed no very decided opinion; and as the majority of the court take a different view, I will not express myself strongly in favor of the respondents.\nAn appeal is made to the people to decide by their votes whether or not they will adopt the second part of the Canada Temperance Act in a particular locality.\nAfter the election, the returning officer transmits to the government the ballot boxes and a list of the votes cast, with a report of the result of the election, whereupon, if the result is in favor of the Act, a proclamation is issued declaring the second part of the Act in force in that locality.\nIn the conduct of these elections there is something more than a mere executive power; there are penalties imposed by the Act for unlawful practices, such as bribery, treating, &c.; there are qualifications of voters required; and a question is sometimes raised as to these qualifications. In trying a cause under the Controverted Elections Act the judge supervises the whole proceedings, takes evidence in regard to the qualifications, &c., and decides whether a vote shall be struck off or not; and he may declare the election void.\nUnder the Canada Temperance Act the judge has power to decide whether the vote shall remain or be altered, but there is no power given to void the election, unless it be implied from the words of the Act.\nThe result is that bribery and all sorts of corruption may be practised, but the election will not thereby be avoided, unless power is given to somebody to inquire into such acts, and alter or not the result of the election accordingly.\nThe Act uses the word \"scrutiny,\" and I think Mr. Justice Palmer very properly defines it, as used in reference to elections. Scrutiny, in law, has a broad, definite meaning; it means anything and everything connected with an election.\nThere is no such thing as a scrutiny of the ballot papers spoken of, to be exercised by the County Court Judge, and I take it there is something more than mere counting of the ballots intended by the word scrutiny.\nWhether the ballot is right or wrong; whether parties are guilty of corruption or not, are matters into which there is no provision made by the Act to enquire, unless it can be done under the scrutiny.\nThe Act requires that on the day and at the place appointed by the judge, the returning officer shall attend before him with the ballot papers, and the judge on inspecting such papers, and on hearing such evidence as he may deem necessary, and, on hearing the parties or their counsel, shall, in a summary manner, determine whether the majority of the votes given was, or was not, in favor of the petition to the Governor General in Council.\nNow, what is the meaning of that? Nobody else has any authority to try out the question. Parties may prosecute under the Act, but that has no reference to the result of the election. On which side is the majority of votes? Does not that mean the majority of legal votes? Was it not the intention of the legislature that this judge should decide on the legality of the votes?\nIn this case it is in evidence, that in two balloting places the returns were wanting, there was no list got by the returning officer of the votes given at those polling places, nor did he ascertain the voting at those places before summing up as required by the Act. I take it that it came within the authority of the judge to include that as a part of the scrutiny provided by the Act, and to remedy any defects in that respect by the returning officer. If there was no list the returning officer was bound to get other evidence. That was not done by him in this case. Suppose that came before the judge, would he not have a right to ascertain the true number of votes cast at these polling places, that is to do what the returning officer omitted to do?\nIf the judgment of the court below is wrong, then corrupt or irregular practices will not avoid an election such as this. How can I come to the conclusion that the legislature intended this? I do not say that the judgment of the court below was right, but I very much doubt that the legislature did not intend that the County Court Judge should have the right to determine the election on the majority of legal votes cast.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal in this case should be allowed with costs, upon the ground that the Canada Temperance Act does not give to the County Judge, upon entering into a scrutiny of ballots, jurisdiction over the points which he refused to entertain for the want of such jurisdiction, and the rule nisi for a mandamus in the court below should be discharged with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: H. R. Emerson.\nSolicitor for respondent: R. Barry Smith.\n[1] 22 N. B. Rep. 241.\n[2] In re Canada Temperance Act, 9 Ont. R. 154.\n",

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nAdministrator, acts of\u2014Acting by agent\u2014Next of kin\u2014Costs.\nThe plaintiff wished to administer to the estate of his brother in the County of Westmoreland and Province of New Brunswick, but was unable to give the necessary administration bond until the defendant W. and one J. agreed to become his bondsmen, securing themselves by having the estate placed in the hands of the defendants. A portion of the estate consisted of some English railway stock which the defendants wished to convert into money, but plaintiffs would not assist them in doing so.\nIn passing the accounts of the estate in the Probate Court of Westmoreland County, it was found that there were several persons entitled to participate as next of kin of the deceased, and the respective amounts due the several claimants were settled by the court.\nOwing to the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to join in realizing the stock, however, the defendants were unable to pay some of these parties their respective shares, and finally, the plaintiff filed a bill to compel the defendants to pay him his portion of the estate, with $1,000 which he claimed as commission, and also to hand over to him the shares of the next of kin.\nAt the hearing a decree was made directing the estate to be disposed of by the defendants, and that they were entitled to their costs, as between solicitor and client, which could be retained out of the plaintiff\u2019s share of the estate.\nOn appeal Proudfoot J. reversed that portion of the decree which made the plaintiff\u2019s share of the estate liable for the defendant\u2019s costs, but the Court of Appeal restored the original judgment.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that as the misconduct of the plaintiff had caused all the litigation, the Court of Appeal had acted rightly in refusing to compel any of the other next of kin to bear the burden of the costs.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing a judgment of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice.\nThe facts are sufficiently set out in the above head note, and more fully in the report of the case in the Court of Appeal.\nO\u2019Sullivan for appellant contended that the suit was virtually an administration suit, and that the costs should not have been borne entirely by the plaintiff.\nJ. MacLennan Q.C. and Whiting for respondents, con- tended that the respondents had not been guilty of any breach of duty, and they could not in justice be saddled with the costs of a defence of a suit which was not necessary in their interest, and to which they were not parties. The construction put on the decree by the Court of Appeal gave justice to all parties. Stevens v. Banks[2]; Creigh v. Hedrick[3].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I had not on the argument, and have not now, any doubt in this case. I think the Court of Appeal was quite right; the whole difficulty and litigation in this case, arose from the unreasonable and unjust conduct of the original plaintiff. The next of kin are no parties to this proceeding, and as for the two suits with the estate, with them they have no concern; and so, from no principle that I can conceive, can the amount adjudged to them in New Brunswick be now reduced by charging them with the costs of this proceeding. The case of Boynton v. Boynton[4] clearly shows that the court did quite right in directing that the costs should be paid by the plaintiff, the executor of the original plaintiff (who also instituted this appeal).\nI do not think it necessary to add anything to what was said in the court below.\nFOURNIER, HENRY and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal is founded wholly upon a misconception, namely, that the bill filed by the plaintiff in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in the Province of Ontario was a bill for the administration of the estate of one John P. O\u2019Sullivan, deceased, who died intestate in the Province of New Brunswick, leaving property there to be administered. The bill of complaint states that the plaintiff claiming to be sole next of kin of the said John F. O\u2019Sullivan, and residing himself at Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, and being unable to procure the requisite bail to enable him to procure letters of administration of the estate and effects of his deceased kinsman, to be granted to him in the Province of New Brunswick, entered into an agreement with the defendants, bearing date the 2nd Sept., 1876, whereby, after reciting that the said John F. O\u2019Sullivan had then lately departed this life at Moncton, in the Province of New Brunswick, leaving personal property amounting to upwards of nine thousand dollars, and that the plaintiff, claiming to be brother and only next of kin of the said deceased, had applied for letters of administration of his estate, and that the Honorable Thomas R. Jones and the defendant Weldon had agreed to become sureties for the said plaintiff as such administrator upon being indemnified by the defendant Harty and one Patrick Brown, and that the plaintiff would hand over to the said Harty and Weldon the said personal property to be held by them until the final distribution of the estate, it was agreed as follows:\n1st. That the said plaintiff would, as soon as letters of administration should be granted to him, have the said personal property converted into money and deposited in the Bank of British North America at Montreal to the credit of the said defendants.\n2nd. That the said defendants should proceed to invest the said monies in good securities to the best advantage, and authorise and empower the said plaintiff to receive the interest and monies arising therefrom.\n3rd. That upon the final decree of distribution being made, and no other person successfully disputing the right of the said plaintiff as the next of kin of the said deceased, the said defendants would deliver and pay over to the said plaintiff ail the said monies and the securities in which the same might be invested, less expenses.\n4th. That the said defendants should not each of them be accountable for the other, or for any loss or damage arising from any invest- ments or any depreciation thereof, but that each should be liable only for his own wilful neglect or default.\n5th. That in order to ascertain whether there were any other persons next of kin of the deceased, the plaintiff should use all diligence in making enquiries for such persons as the defendants might direct.\nThe bill then alleges the granting of letters of administration of the personal estate and effects of the deceased to the plaintiff out of the proper court in that behalf, being the Westmoreland Court of Probate in the Province of New Brunswick; it then sets forth the placing in the defendants\u2019 hands certain personal estate of the deceased, in pursuance of the above agreement; it then alleges that upon the basis of the accounts rendered to the plaintiff by the defendants of their dealings with estate so placed in their hands, the plaintiff as administrator of the said estate passed his account in the said Court of Probate. The bill then alleges that on the taking of the said account the plaintiff was charged with the sum of $10,098.08 and was allowed the sum of $2,152.31 on account of disbursements, charges, expenses, and compensation in the winding-up of the said estate, and that the said sum of $2,152.31 included a sum of $1,000 allowed to the plaintiff by the \\said court for his commission and. other reasonable and necessary expenses as said administrator, leaving a balance chargeable to the plaintiff as said administrator of $7,945.77, as money in his hands to be divided among the next of kin, consisting of seven persons, including the plaintiff, who were found by the said Court of Probate to be the sole next of kin of the deceased. That immediately after the passing by the plaintiff of his account, the said Court of Probate, by a final order of distribution dated the 16th day of July, 1878, declared that the plaintiff was entitled as one of the next of kin as aforesaid to retain the sum of $1,135.11 out of the said sum of $7,945.77, and that the said six other next of kin, naming them, were each entitled to receive the sum of $1,135.11 out of the said sum of $7,945.77, and ordered and decreed distribution of the said last mentioned sum accordingly. That the plaintiff being desirous of receiving his said compensation of $1,000, so allowed to him as aforesaid, and of receiving his said share of $1,135.11, and also being desirous of paying the said several next of kin their respective shares so ordered and decreed as aforesaid and of winding-up the said estate, has applied to the defendants to pay over to the plaintiff the said monies in their hands, and the profits thereof, but that the defendants have refused and neglected, and still refuse and neglect, so to do, and the bill prayed that an account might be taken of all sums of money received by, or come to the hands of, the defendants for or on account, or for the use, of the plaintiff, and of the profits thereof and of all dealings and transactions of the defendants respecting the said monies and profits, and that the defendants might be decreed to pay to the plaintiff what, on taking such accounts, should be found due from the defendants to the plaintiff; that the defendants might be ordered to pay the costs of the suit, and for further relief such as the nature of the case might require. The short substance of the defendants\u2019 answers to this bill was that they had fulfilled their agreement with the plaintiff set out in the bill in every particular, that they had rendered him full account of all their dealings with the estate of the deceased come to their hands, that, in fact, it was upon such account that the plaintiff had passed his account with the other next of kin in the Probate Court, and that the sole impediment to the decree of that court being executed was that the plaintiff refused to execute a power of attorney to enable certain railroad stock of an English company, part of the deceased\u2019s estate, to be realized; that they claimed, as sureties of the plaintiff in his administration bond, to be entitled to relief from all liability upon the monies in their hands under the said agreement passing out of their hands, and the defendant Harty claimed a lien upon the plaintiff\u2019s share in the said estate for monies advanced by him to the plaintiff, and disbursed by the defendant Harty at the plaintiff\u2019s instance, and due by the plaintiff to him as remuneration for services performed by the defendant Harty in connection with the said estate, at the request of the plaintiff, and by way of cross relief the defendant prayed that the plaintiff might be ordered to specifically perform the said agreement upon his part, and to do and perform all acts, matters and things necessary to have said railway scrip converted into money; that the defendant Harty might be declared entitled to a lien on plaintiff\u2019s share of said estate for such remuneration as aforesaid, and that the plaintiff should be ordered to pay the costs of the suit, and that the defendants should have a lien therefor upon the plaintiff\u2019s share in the said estate, and that they should be relieved from all liability in respect of the administration bond executed on the letters of administration being granted to the plaintiff.\nIt will be seen from these pleadings that the subject-matter of this suit was wholly personal between the plaintiffs and the defendants alone, arising out of their contract set out in the agreement of the 2nd of Sept., 1876, and with which the other persons who proved to be next of kin to the deceased had no concern, and whose rights therefore could not be prejudiced by any decree to be made in this suit, to which they were no parties. The bill not only did not contemplate the taking under a decree to be made in this suit an account of the administration of the intestate\u2019s estate, for which purpose the other next of kin would be necessary parties, but on the contrary proceeded upon the basis that that administration account had been taken in the New Brunswick Probate Court, and sought relief personally in aid of the plaintiff against the defendants as his agents in respect of their dealings under the said agreement of the 2nd September, 1816, for the purpose, as was alleged, of enabling the plaintiff as administrator of the intestate\u2019s estate to comply with the terms of the order of distribution of the said estate made by the New Brunswick Probate Court. Now the decree made in this suit was to the effect that it should be referred to the Master to take an account of the dealings and transactions of the defendants with the trust estate in the pleadings mentioned since the first day of May, 1878 (that being the day on which the plaintiff passed his administration account in the New Brunswick Probate Court), and to find and state the balance coming to the plaintiff; and the court did order that in passing their said account the defendants should be allowed to retain out of any money in their hands their costs of this suit as between solicitor and client; and the court did further order and decree that the plaintiff should facilitate and assist the defendants in making sale of the railway scrip in the pleadings mentioned, and that all necessary papers and documents for that purpose should be executed, and that the amount realized from such sale should be accounted for in taking the account by the decree directed And the court did further order and decree that the defendants should within two months after the taking of the said account, settle the claims of the next of kin of the intestate John F. O\u2019Sullivan, other than the plaintiff, and that in default of their so doing the balance of the funds of the intestate\u2019s estate in the hands of the defendants should be forthwith, after the expiration of the said two months, paid by them into court to the credit of the cause, subject to the further order of the court, and that if, upon the defendants settling with the said next of kin other than the plaintiff as aforesaid any balance of the said estate, \u2018after deducting the costs by the decree given to the defendants and making the allowances found in their favor by the Master, should remain in their hands, the said defendants should forthwith thereafter pay such balance to the plaintiff. The Master by his report found, among other things, that the defendant Harty was entitled to be allowed, and that the Master therefore allowed him, the sum of $500 as a compensation for his personal services in the management of the estate. That he had taxed and allowed to the defendants the sum of $858.75 for their costs of suit. That on or about the 22nd day of June, 1881, the railway scrip in the decree mentioned was, without the assistance of the plaintiff, sold or otherwise disposed of by the defendants, and that the Master had in the account taken before him charged the defendants with the proceeds thereof, and that on or about the same 22nd of June the defendants had settled with the next of kin of the intestate other than the plaintiff, and had paid to each of them the sum of $1,135.11 being the amount coming to them respectively on the 1st of May, 1878,\nThe plaintiff appealed from this report to the Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, because the Master had, in taking the accounts directed by the decree, deducted from the amount with which the defendants were chargeable the sums paid to the next of kin other than the plaintiff before the taking of the said accounts, and had charged the defendants\u2019 costs and the allowance of the $500 made to the defendant Harty, against th\u00e9 balance thereafter remaining in the hands of the defendants, whereas, as the plaintiff contended, the shares of all of the next of kin should have been made to bear a proportion of the said costs and of the said allowance, and because (the said Master had by his said report improperly certified that the claims of the next of kin other than the plaintiff were settled by the defendants. The Vice\u2011Chancellor allowed the appeal and made an order to that effect; from that order an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which court reversed the order of the Vice-Chancellor and affirmed the Master\u2019s report, and it is from this judgment and order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario that this present appeal is taken. In my opinion the appeal must be dismissed with costs. It was contended that upon the true construction of the decree, as it stands, and which, until reversed on appeal, must bind, the defendants\u2019 costs, of this suit, and the allowance to the defendant Harty, as to the amount of which there is no contest, should be charged rateably to the shares of the whole of the next of kin and not to the share of the plaintiff alone. I have already pointed out that from the frame of the suit no such order could properly have been made, which would have been prejudicial to the interests of the next of kin other than the plaintiff, who were no parties to the suit; but the decree, in my opinion, is not open to any such construction. It contemplated, as it was proper that it should, that the next of kin other than the plaintiff should be paid the full amount found due to them respectively upon the plaintiff having passed his administration account in the New Brunswick Probate Court, and it enabled the defendants, or rather recognized the right of the defendants for their own protection, as sureties for due administration of the intestate\u2019s estate by the plaintiff, to settle directly with such next of kin, and all that the decree directed to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiff was the balance, if any, there should be after settling with said next of kin other than the plaintiff, and after deduction of the defendants\u2019 costs of suit and such allowances as should be made to them by the Master; and this is precisely what has been effected by the Master\u2019s report. Neither is there, in justice, any reason, even if the next of kin other than the plaintiff were parties to this suit, why they should contribute to the payment either of the defendants\u2019 costs of this suit or of the allowance of the $500 to the defendant Harty. The defendants do not appear to have committed any default in the performance of the agreement of the 2nd September, 1876, upon their part. The suit, therefore, was not occasioned by any fault of theirs, a fact sufficiently apparent by the decree, which gives to them their costs of suit as between solicitors and client in a suit which was purely personal on the part of the plaintiff and arising wholly out of a contract entered into between him and the defendants. Then as to the $500 allowed to the defendant Harty, it appears that the plaintiff agreed to give him this amount for services rendered by him, which, if he had not rendered, the plaintiff must needs have rendered himself or have gotten some other competent person to render, to enable him to discharge efficiently the office of administrator which he had assumed. The proper time and place to have had determined whether the other next of kin should contribute to this sum was when the administrator was passing his account in the New Brunswick Probate Court, when the sum of $1,000, which appears to have been an exceptionally liberal allowance, was made to the plaintiff for all services, commission, &c., which could be claimed by an administrator for. the administration of so small an estate as that of the intestate was, and as the defendant Harty acted in such administration solely as the agent of, and under contract with, the plaintiff, he is the sole person by whom services rendered under such a contract should be paid.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Edward Mahon.\nSolicitors for respondents: Britton & Whiting.\n[1] 10 Ont.

Ritchie C. J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nNegligence\u2014Defective sidewalk\u2014Lawful use of street\u2014Contributory negligence.\nIn an action against the town of Portland for damages arising from an injury caused by a defective sidewalk, the evidence of the plaintiff showed that the accident whereby she was injured happened while she was engaged in washing the window of her dwelling from the outside of her house, and that in taking a step backward, her foot went into a hole in the sidewalk, and she was thrown down and hurt; she also swore that she knew the hole was there. There was no evidence as to the nature and extent of the hole, nor was affirmative evidence given of negligence on the part of any officer of the corporation.\nThe jury awarded the plaintiff $300 damages, and a rule nisi for a new trial was discharged.\nHeld, Per Taschereau and Gwynne JJ., that there was no evidence of negligence to justify the verdict of the jury, and there must be a new trial.\nPer Henry J.\u2014That there was evidence of negligence on the part of the officers of the corporation, but the question of contributory negligence was not properly submitted to the jury and there should, therefore, be a new trial.\nPer Ritchie C.J. and Fournier J.\u2014That the plaintiff was neither walking nor passing over, travelling upon, nor lawfully using the said street as alleged in the declaration, and she was therefore not entitled to recover. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, discharging a rule nisi for a new trial.\nThe declaration in this case, after alleging that it was the duty of the defendants to keep in repair the streets in the town of Portland, stated that the plaintiff was walking and passing over and along Main street in said town, and, owing to the negligence of the defendants, was injured; and, in the second count, that she was travelling upon the said street and was injured; and, in the third count, that she was lawfully using the said street and was injured.\nThe evidence of the plaintiff at the trial showed that she was engaged on a certain day in washing the windows of her house on Main street; that being on the street in order to wash them from the outside, she had occasion to step back, and in doing so her foot went into a hole in the sidewalk and was caught there; her slipper came off, and she fell with her shoulder on the sidewalk adjoining the gutter; she also swore that she knew the hole was there.\nThis fall caused the injury to the plaintiff for which the action was brought, and the jury awarded her $300 damages; a rule nisi for a new trial was granted by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which was afterwards discharged. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nDr. Stockton for the appellants:\nIt was misdirection in the learned judge telling the jury that it was the duty of the town to keep the streets in repair so that all persons could pass in safety. The sidewalk where respondent says accident happened was put there by the parish; it was there when the town was incorporated. The street was not recorded. There was no proof that it was fifty feet wide, and unless recorded and fifty wide, by 38 Vic. ch. 92, the town could not spend money on it. In Dwyer v. The Town of Portland[1] it was held that no greater duty is cast upon the town since incorporation than existed before when the district was a parish.\nI contend also that the corporation is not liable because the Act 34 Vic., ch. 11, secs. 83, 84 and 85, only transferred to the corporation the powers formerly vested in the general sessions and commissioners and surveyors of highways on the streets in question, and left it discretionary with the town to make and repair the streets. The town only possesses the powers formerly exercised by the parish authorities.\nThis case is different from. Borough of Bathurst v. Macpherson[2]. The municipality there had original powers, and it was authorized to levy tolls as well as rates and taxes, and it does not appear there was any limit to that power. Yet in that case it is distinctly laid down that liability attaches only for misfeasance, not for non-feasance. In the present case the town did nothing; there was no duty by law cast upon it to do anything. On the contrary, it was prevented by law from expending money at the place where the accident is alleged to have happened. See also McKinnon v. Penson[3]; Gibson v. Mayor of Preston[4]; Blackmore v. Vestry of Mile End Old Town[5]; Hill v. City of Boston[6]; Burns v. City of Toronto[7]; Dillon on Mun. Cor.[8].\nI further contend there was contributory negligence on the part of respondent. She knew full well, as she states, of this defect in the sidewalk. She was not using the street for the purpose of passing to and fro, but for washing the windows by splashing water on them. She says: \"I knew the cracks were there, and stepped back quickly, and my foot went into the hole.\" In this case the respondent's want of thought or negligence concurred to bring about the accident and she cannot recover. Tuff v. Warman[9]. The question to be considered in every case is not whether the plaintiff's negligence caused, but whether it contributed to the injury. See Shearman & Redfield on Negligence[10].\nR. C. Skinner for the respondent.\nThe respondent held the right to use the sidewalk for the purpose for which she did, and she was not bound to remember there was a hole; it cannot be urged there was any contributory negligence because she forgot there was a hole at that particular spot.\nAs to the liability of the corporation I contend, outside of the question as to whether the doctrine in Dwyer v. The Town of Portland[11], by reason of the defence made at the trial of this cause, is applicable or not, that the evidence, at all events, shows that the appellants continued the planked sidewalk on the street, and repaired it from time to time; and that it therefore became their duty to keep it in a reasonably safe condition, just as if they had originally constructed it; and that the law would cast on them the duty of keeping it in such a state, as to prevent it causing danger to persons using it; that the appellants had by their charter the care and management of the street; and that this sidewalk was under their control, and they had no right to leave it (as they did leave it, under the evidence and finding of the jury) in a dangerous condition.\nThe learned counsel cited the following cases:\nWhitehouse v. Fellows[12]; Fletcher v. Rylands[13]; White v. The Hindley Local Board of Health[14]; Clarke v. The Town of Portland[15]; Borough of Bathurst v. Macpherson[16]; Blackmore v. Vestry of Mile End Old Town[17]; Kent v. Worthing Local Board of Health[18]. Dr. Stockton was heard in reply.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The declaration in this case alleges:\n1. That the town of Portland had the care, control, &c., of the public streets of the said town, and it was the duty of the town to keep the same in a safe and proper condition for the passage to and fro over and along the same of the citizens of the said town; that among the streets of said town is one known as Main street; that plaintiff was, on the 23rd of May, 1878, a resident of said town, and was then walking and passing over and along the said street; yet the said defendants, not regarding their said duty in that behalf, negligently, illegally and improperly left the said street in an unsafe, dangerous and improper condition for the passing to and fro over and along the same of the said citizens and other subjects, and thereupon the said plaintiff, Miriam Griffiths, whilst so walking and passing over and along said street, without any fault of her own, but by reason of such negligence and improper conduct of the said defendants, accidentally fell into a hole negligently and unlawfully left by the said defendants in said street, and thereby became and was greatly bruised, wounded and injured, so that the said plaintiff became sick and permanently disabled, and suffered great pain and distress for a long time.\n2. And for that the plaintiff says there is, in the town of Portland aforesaid, a certain other public street called Main street, leading from the city of Saint John to Indiantown, which said defendants are bound to keep in repair; that the same was negligently suffered by defendants to be out of repair, whereby the plaintiff, travelling thereon, and using due care, was hurt.\n3. And for that the plaintiff says there is, in the town of Portland, a certain other public strect called Main street, leading from the city of Saint John, which said defendants undertook to repair and keep in repair, but did so in so negligent a manner that a certain hole was allowed to be and remain therein, whereby the said plaintiff, lawfully using said street, and without negligence on her part, was hurt.\nAnd the plaintiff claims two thousand dollars.\nThe evidence of the plaintiff directly negatives the allegations of the said declaration; her statement is that:\nOn the 23rd of May, 1878, I went to wash the windows and was outside, and there was a hole, and as I stepped back my foot went into the hole and held my foot fast. My foot went into the hole in the sidewalk. My slipper came off, and I fell with my shoulder on the sidewalk adjoining the gutter. Somebody helped me into the house; I don't know who.\nOn cross-examination:\nThe holes were opposite our house. I knew the cracks were there, and stepped back quickly, and my foot went into the hole. About twelve or fifteen inches; I cannot say how long or how wide; they were wide enough for my foot to enter. The window was the far side. I came out of the shop door. The window was between the shop door and the hall door.\n(I was washing the room window. To the judge.)\nIt is quite clear from this that the plaintiff was not walking or passing along the street, nor, in the language of the second count, travelling thereon, nor, in the language of the third count, lawfully using the street in the way in which streets are provided to be kept in repair, namely, for the passing to and fro of citizens and subjects.\nThe witness says she knew the cracks were there, and while washing her windows stepped back quickly and her foot went into the hole; if this resulted in any injury to the plaintiff such as she complains of, which to my mind is extremely doubtful under the evidence, I think the accident was the result of her own negligence. Had she been passing along the street, or using it in a legitimate way, as she knew the hole was there, it would have been her duty to have avoided it and the accident would not have happened; as it was, if she chose to avail herself of the use of the street for the convenience of washing her windows, and, with the knowledge of the existence of the hole, carelessly stepped back into it and suffered injury thereby, I think she cannot hold the town liable therefor.\nChief Justice Allen was of opinion that if plaintiff was entitled to recover the damages were excessive, and I agree with him.\nMr. Justice Weldon, who tried the cause, and Mr. Justice Wetmore were of opinion that the evidence did not justify the finding of the jury, and I agree with them.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I think the evidence shows that the plaintiff is not entitled to retain her verdict, and that the appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY J.\u2014The plaintiff seeks to recover damages for injuries sustained by a defective sidewalk in the town of Portland. The sidewalk was for the use and accommodation of the people, not merely to go along to and fro, but to use for any lawful purpose. The plaintiff had a right to wash windows, which is a necessary act, and for that purpose could legally use the sidewalk. She was therefore engaged in a lawful act, but required to take proper precautions against accidents. It would be a question of fact for the jury whether due care was used or not. The town would not be liable if the plaintiff, by using ordinary care, could have avoided the accident.\nA person walking along the street should, in every case, use ordinary diligence, but if the plaintiff was doing something lawful, with her back to a hole in the sidewalk, was she called upon to reflect upon what was not within her view at the time? I think the evidence sustains the allegations of negligence against the corporation, but the question of contributory negligence was not submitted to the jury as I think it should have been; and therefore, they not having decided upon it, I think a new trial should be granted.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I think the appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal from a rule absolute issued out of the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick discharging a rule nisi for a new trial issued at the suit of the defendants.\nFrom the report which is presented to us of opinions of the judges of the New Brunswick Court, it appears that the issue of a rule absolute granting a new trial would have been more in accordance with the opinions of the majority of the court. The rule nisi was moved upon several grounds, namely: that the verdict was against the weight of evidence; that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence; that the verdict was against law and evidence and for excessive damages.\nThe learned chief justice was of opinion that the damages were excessive and that the evidence of the injury, of which the plaintiff complained, was not satisfactory, as she did not appear to have made any complaint about it for nearly two years.\nMr. Justice Weldon, who tried the cause and who was of opinion that the plaintiff's own evidence showed her to have been plainly guilty of contributory negligence, and he so charged the jury, was also of opinion that the evidence did not at all justify the verdict of the jury, and that the case should therefore be submitted to another jury. In this opinion Mr. Justice Wetmore concurred. There are thus three judges out of five of opinion that a new trial should be granted. I am of opinion, also, that this is the mode in which the rule nisi should have been disposed of.\nThe action is for a peculiar injury alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff by reason of a negligent breach by the defendants of a duty which it is alleged they owed to the public.\nThe declaration alleges that the defendants had the care, control and management of the public streets of the town of Portland, and that it was the duty of the defendants to keep the said streets in a safe and proper condition, for the passage to and fro over and along the same, of the citizens of the town of Portland, and of other good and worthy subjects of Her Majesty, and that the plaintiff on the 23rd May, 1878, a resident of the said town, was then walking and passing over and along a street called Main street in the said town, yet that the defendants, not regarding their said duty, negligently, illegally and improperly left the said street in an unsafe, dangerous and improper condition for the passing to and fro, over and along the same, of the said citizens and other subjects, and that thereupon the plaintiff, whilst so walking and passing over and along the said street, without any fault of her own, but by reason of such negligence and improper conduct of the defendants, accidentally fell into a hole, negligently and unlawfully left by the defendants in the said street, and thereby was bruised, injured and permanently disabled.\nThe gist of this species of action is negligence upon the part of the defendants in committing such a breach of a duty which they owed to the public as subjected them to conviction on an indictment as for a public nuisance, from which breach of duty the plaintiff suffered the peculiar private damage complained of, without any negligence on her own part contributing to the happening of the injury. The defendants pleaded the general issue, and at the trial it was agreed between the parties that under this plea the defendants should be at liberty to adduce any evidence, and urge any defence, which they might adduce or urge under any plea they could have properly pleaded. The object of this was, I presume, to enable the defendants to contest the alleged duty, the general issue having opened up every other ground of defence. At the trial the plaintiff, who was herself the only witness called to establish the breach by the defendants of the duty alleged to have been owed by them to the public, and of the happening of the injury of which the plaintiff complained, said merely that when washing the windows of the house in which she lived on Main street, from the outside, she stepped quickly backwards and her foot caught in a crack, or aperture, in the plank sidewalk, of the existence of which crack she was aware, but of the length and breadth of the crack, save that it was wide enough for her foot to catch in it, or of its being at all dangerous to persons walking along the sidewalk in the ordinary manner, or that it was of such a nature as to be a defect in the sidewalk, constituting a public nuisance, or that the plaintiff herself or any person had ever complained of the existence of the crack, or that any officer of the defendants had any knowledge of its existence, or that it had existed in the sidewalk for any length of time, there was no evidence whatever. It might, for all that appeared, have been a space between two planks not more than two inches wide and eight or ten inches long, which to any person seeing it would not appear to be at all dangerous to the public, or a nuisance. In short, the fact of the occurrence of the accident as stated by the plaintiff herself (when stepping quickly backwards where she knew the crack was), constituted the sole evidence of the negligence and breach of duty which constitute the foundation of the action.\nMaule J. in delivering the judgment of the court in Brown v. Mallett[19] says: The duty of the defendants (for the breach of which, causing damage to the plaintiff, the action was brought) is of a public nature, and the plaintiff, in order to succeed, must show a breach of a public duty as well as special injury to himself.\nTo the like effect are the observations of Park J. when delivering to the House of Lords the opinion of the judges in Lyme Regis v. Henley[20].\nIn order to make the declaration good it must appear: 1st. That the corporation lay under a legal obligation to repair the place in question; 2nd. That such obligation is a matter of so general and public concern that an indictment would lie against the corporation for non-repair; 3rd. That the place in question was out of repair; and lastly, that the plaintiff sustained some peculiar damage beyond the rest of the Queen's subjects by such want of repair.\nSo in the General Steam Navigation Co. v. Morrison[21] Williams J. asks:\nIs there an instance of an action sustained for a specific injury to a plaintiff from the breach by the defendant of a duty imposed on him by statute where the party could not have been indicted for a misdemeanor?\nAnd Jervis C.J., delivering judgment in that case, says:\nIt was contended that here is a statutable duty oast upon the defendant for the breach of which an action lies against him; no instance, however, could be shown of an action for a breach of duty imposed by a statute for which the party might not have been made responsible in another form.\nThat is by indictment.\nThe breach of duty therefore which gives to a plaintiff a private action for peculiar damage arising therefrom sustained by him, must be such as to warrant a conviction of the party guilty of the breach of duty upon an indictment.\nIn Merrill v. Inhabitants of Hampden[22] it is laid down as a principle of general application that such a state of repair as would exempt the defendants from liability in an indictment, will also exempt them from liability in a civil action. See also to the like effect Howard v. The Inhabitants of North Bridgewater[23]. And this, indeed, is the natural consequence, resulting from the fact that the private action is founded upon the breach of a duty owed by the defendants to the public, for the breach of such duty being cognizable upon an indictment, if the facts adduced in evidence be insufficient to sustain a conviction on the indictment, there cannot be said to have been any breach of duty committed, and so the foundation necessary to support the private action is removed.\nNow, in this case, the mere happening of the accident not being even prim\u00e2 facie evidence of negligence, nor indeed of the alleged defect being of that nature and magnitude to constitute a public nuisance, it was necessary for the plaintiff to have given affirmative evidence upon both of these particulars. Cotton v. Wood[24]; Hammack v. White[25]. This she did not attempt to do.\nIn the American courts the rule, which is a very reasonable one, appears to be that in an action of this nature against a corporation, it is necessary to bring home to some of the officers of the corporation actual notice of the existence of the defect which is relied upon, prior to the happening of the accident, so as to affect them with implied knowledge thereof, by showing the defect to have been so notorious that it is reasonable to fix the corporation with notice of it. See the cases collected in Castor v. Uxbridge[26], where that rule is followed, and it was held that to make a corporation liable they must have actual knowledge through their servants of the existence of the nuisance, or it must be shown to the satisfaction of the jury that their ignorance of it can be only explained by attributing it to negligence. In Boyle v. The Town of Dundas[27], the present Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, then Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, says:\nI cannot understand that it follows necessarily that because there may be a hole in a plank sidewalk, and a person accidentally trips or steps into it and is injured, that damages are recoverable. There must be some clear dereliction of duty, some unreasonable omission to fulfil a statutable requirement.\nAnd again:\nEveryone using a sidewalk must take on himself a certain amount of risk. To acquire a cause of action he must show an injury resulting from the walk being left in a dangerous state of non-repair.\nAnd again he says[28]:\nWe all know that small breaches in the surface of sidewalks are of every-day existence in every town. It is unreasonable to hold that a corporation neglects its duty, merely because such a breach or hole may be found in some street. The question should, I think, always be as to the general performance of their duty rather than an isolated instance of fault.\nIn that case a new trial was granted, and upon the second trial questions were submitted to the jury specially pointing to the questions whether the defect complained of constituted a nuisance\u2014whether the corporation had notice of it if it was\u2014and whether when the accident happened the plaintiff, from the knowledge she had of its existence, might have escaped the accident, and have prevented its occurrence if she had been looking where she was going. Similar questions appear to me to have been peculiarly appropriate in the present case, and if they had been put to the jury, and they had found in favor of the plaintiff, it appears to me to be impossible to have sustained such a verdict. So utterly defective was the evidence given by the plaintiff to entitle her to recover, that in my opinion she should have been non-suited if a non-suit had been moved for. To establish the defect in the sidewalk which was spoken of to be a public nuisance, upon the evidence as given, is a proposition, in my opinion, incapable of being sustained, and upon the point of negligence in the defendants, I am of opinion there was no evidence to go to a jury; while upon the question of contributory negligence, I agree with the learned judge who tried the cause that it was almost conclusive. Upon the question, whether the statute of the corporation of the town of Portland imposes upon the corporation the duty of keeping the streets and sidewalks in a sufficient state of repair, I am of opinion that the effect and intent of the statute creating the municipality, and placing under its exclusive control the public streets and highways, does impose upon the corporation the correlative duty of keeping them in repair. I think it is well laid down in Castor v. Uxbridge[29], upon the authority of the English and American cases there cited, that:\nWhere a public body is clothed by statute with authority to do an act which concerns the public interest, the execution of the power may be insisted upon as a duty, though the statute creating it be only permissive in its terms.\nUpon the whole, therefore, I am of opinion that a new trial should be granted, and that if the evidence upon the second trial should not remove the defects existing in that given in the former trial, the plaintiff should be non-suited.\nAppeal allowed with costs and new trial granted.\nSolicitor for appellants: A.

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nMarine Insurance\u2014Voyage policy\u2014Sailing restrictions\u2014Time of entering Gulf of St. Lawrence\u2014Attempt to enter.\nIn an action on a voyage policy containing this clause \"warranted not to enter or attempt to enter or to use the Gulf of St. Lawrence prior to the 10th day of May, nor after the 30th day of October (a line drawn from Cape North to Cape Ray and across the Strait of Canso to the northern entrance thereof shall be considered the bounds of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,)\" the evidence was as follows:\u2014\nThe Captain says: \"The voyage was from Liverpool to Quebec and ship sailed on 2nd April. Nothing happened until we met with ice to the southward of Newfoundland. Shortened sail and dodged about for a few days trying to work our way around it. One night ship was hove to under lower main top-sail, and about mid-night she drifted into a large field of ice. There was a heavy sea on at the time, and the ship sustained damage. We were in this ice three or four hours. Laid to all the next day. Could not get further along on account of the ice. In about twenty-fours hours we started to work up towards Quebec.\"\nThe log-book showed that the ship got into this ice on the seventh of May, and an expert examined at the trial swore that from the entries in the log-book of the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th of May, the captain was attempting to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\nA verdict was taken for the plaintiffs by consent, with leave for the defendants to move to enter a non-suit, or for a new trial; the court to have power to mould the verdict, and also to draw inferences of fact the same as a jury. The Supreme Court of New. Brunswick sustained the verdict. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Henry J. dissenting, that the above clause was applicable to a voyage policy, and that there was evidence to go to the jury that the captain was attempting to enter the gulf contrary to such clause.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] refusing to enter a non-suit or order a new trial.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear in the head note and in the report of the case in the- New Brunswick reports.\nC. W. Weldon Q.C. for respondent.\nMy first point is that the evidence shows that prior to the tenth of May the said vessel was attempting to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and there was therefore a breach of warranty.\nThe whole of a policy of insurance, as well as any contract, must be construed together and every part thereof given its full legal construction and meaning. Mr. Justice King seems to think this clause not applicable to this insurance, and in effect, in his judgment, strikes it out and considers it inconsistent. But the learned judge is wrong in this particular. This is a portion of the contract that cannot be rejected; whatever may be conjectured cannot alter its effect. It is reasonable on a voyage policy to warrant a vessel shall not use a certain sea before a certain time. For instance, a vessel might be insured on a voyage from Liverpool to San Francisco, with a warranty that she should not round or attempt to round Cape Horn during certain months, and clearly if she did so it would be a breach of warranty. In this case the vessel was in Liverpool, the underwriter in Canada; he had no knowledge of her sailing, and the underwriter might say: \"Yes, I will take the risk at 2 3\/4 per cent., provided you warrant your vessel will not enter or attempt to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence before the tenth May.\" We can fairly infer what is referred to by the House of Lords in the case of Birrell v. Dryer[2], and it would seem the very damage the underwriter wished to be avoided was encountered in this case. The words \"enter or attempt to enter,\" apply to two different acts\u2014the one, the actual entering the gulf, the other, the attempt to enter\u2014and it is immaterial whether it is successful or not; in either case it is a breach of warranty. Had the words been merely \"enter the gulf\" it is not disputed that a vessel sailing with the intention to enter would not commit a breach of warranty until the intention was carried out. Here the words are \"attempt to enter,\" pointing to something more than actual entry, i.e. the intention to enter and an effort to carry that intention into effect. Here the master evidently intended to enter the gulf, and prior to the 10th of May was endeavoring to carry out that intention. Birrell v. Dryer (1); Colledge v. Harty[3].\nDr. Stockton for respondents.\nThere was no breach of warranty in this case. A line drawn from Cape North to Cape Ray and across the Strait of Canso to the northern entrance thereof, shall be considered the bound of the Gulf of St. Lawrence seaward. The \"Prince Eugene\" did not enter or attempt to enter the gulf before the 10th of May. If the vessel were attempting to enter the gulf because sailing towards that line, then there was a breach of warranty under the policy from the moment the vessel set sail from Liverpool to Quebec. The policy covered a voyage from Liverpool to Quebec; it would be singular, if not absurd, to hold the prosecution of that voyage a breach of warranty of the very policy issued to cover that voyage. It is submitted the fair meaning of the clause is, that the vessel would not cross the line, or attempt actually to do so, until after the 10th of May. The attempt to enter the gulf would only be when the vessel reached the line and attempted to cross. It is not pretended the vessel crossed the line before the 10th of May, but was sailing towards it. The vessel sailed on the 2nd April; the policy was effected on the 3rd April. She was sailing towards the line at the time policy issued.\nWhat purported to be a chart was produced by appellant on the trial, and attemped to be used to show the position of the vessel at certain dates. There was no proof what kind of a chart it was, or by whom compiled; no evidence that it was accurate, or published by authority of the Admiralty, or any other competent authority[4]. The judge offered to admit chart, subject to objection, but it was not pressed. The rejection of questions put by appellant, and also the offer to admit chart, are fully alluded to in the judgment of King J. in the court below.\nC. W. Weldon Q.C. was heard in reply.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The warranty is in the policy, the parties have not chosen to strike it out or reject it, and we have no right to do so, but are bound to give it due effect if it is capable of being acted on, which I think it is quite as much in a voyage as in a time policy. I cannot see that the warranty is at all inconsistent with a voyage policy; the same reasons which would induce an insurer to prohibit the entering, attempting to enter or usage of the gulf within the times limited, would apply with equal force to, and was as necessary in, a voyage, as a time policy when the insurer is unwilling to take on himself the risk of the insured entering, or attempting to enter or use the Gulf of St. Lawrence prior to the 10th of May, or after the 30th of October; for, if the entering or attempting to enter or use, would be dangerous in the case of a time policy, it would be equally so in that of a voyage policy. Why should the assured not as well thus limit himself as to entering, attempting to enter, or using the gulf before or after the days named, in a voyage policy as in a time policy? In either case, the limit he puts on himself is precisely the same, and if he can make a warranty good in the one case, I can see no reason why he may not do so in the other; and if he chooses so to pursue his voyage as to amount to a breach of his warranty, clearly the underwriter may avail himself of it; and therefore, in my opinion, the real and only point in the question here is: Was there a breach of the warranty? That is to say: Did the vessel enter, or attempt to enter, or use the Gulf of St. Lawrence prior to the 10th day of May? The vessel did not actually enter the gulf until after the 10th of May, so that the only breach, if any, was: Did she, before the 10th of May, attempt to enter the gulf? And this, in my opinion, is a pure question of fact, which should have been submitted to the jury.\nThe respondent contends that the fair meaning of the clause is that the vessel should not cross the line, or attempt actually to cross, until the 10th of May; that the attempt to enter the gulf would only be when the vessel reached the line and attempted to cross.\nBut surely, if she had not reached the line, but there was ice between her and the line, and while, in attempting to force her way through the ice to reach and cross the line and enter the gulf, in so doing she received damage, could it be said she was not attempting to enter? Or could it be said that if and while so attempting she received damage, it was not the very damage from which the warranty was intended to protect the underwriters? The contention that \"attempting to enter\" means attempting to cross the line, and that there can be no \"attempt to enter\" until the vessel is at the line, appears to me to render the words \"attempting to enter\" meaningless; it is tantamount to saying that the vessel must come up to the line and actually cross (for it is difficult to see how, practically, she could just reach the line and not cross) which would not be an attempt to enter, but an actual entry. It is clear the warranty contemplates two distinct contingencies, one attempting to enter, the other actually entering.\nJudge Palmer says:\nIt must be borne in mind that this was a voyage policy, and under such a policy the vessel would have a right to sail on the voyage according to the representation made, or, if nothing said, then at any time; and when she arrived at the place where she would have to enter the gulf he would have to delay, and not attempt to enter until the time named.\nI cannot assent to this as good law. The duty was cast on insured to pursue his voyage, once entered on, without unnecessary delay or deviation; if he wished to prevent a breach of his warranty, he should have taken care to have started on his voyage late enough to prevent the necessity of attempting to enter or entering before the 10th of May. It would not do, in my opinion, for the vessel to lay at, or beat about, the mouth of the gulf, waiting until the 10th, to enable her then to enter and save her warranty. I think the evidence shows that the vessel, while pursuing her voyage, was attempting to enter the gulf, and would have done so but for the ice. This, in my opinion, was the very risk the warranty was intended to protect the underwriters from, viz., beating about in the ice attempting to enter the gulf. If, as suggested by Judge King, it could have been shown that at the time of the accident the vessel was so far from the line of the gulf, as fixed by the policy, that she could not have reached it by the 10th of May, or that she was so far from it that she could not reasonably, in the opinion of the jury, be said to be attempting to enter the gulf at the time of the loss, under such circumstances, the jury would be fully justified in finding that she was not attempting to enter, and so there had been no breach of warranty.\nMr. Justice King says:\nCapt. Thomas stated where the line was, but Capt. Smith might have a different opinion; or as, according to Capt. Thomas, the ship was about sixty miles from the line of the gulf at noon on the 7th May, and with an ordinary wind could run that distance in about eight hours, and with such winds as prevailed could have got to the line in twenty-four hours from where she was at noon of the 7th, but was hove to and was drifting, and was farther from the line on the 10th than on the 7th; the master might possibly have shown that if he had wished to enter the gulf, he could have done so, and that not doing so, and being prevented by no physical obstacle, as for instance by the ice, from doing so if he had so wished, he could not be said to be attempting to enter the gulf. In any point of view the plaintiffs were entitled to his evidence on the point, and the amendment should have been made only upon terms of postponement of the trial.\nBut it must be remembered that unnecessary delay in pursuing the voyage would vitiate the policy, such delay being tantamount to deviation, it being the clear duty of the master, having commenced the voyage, then to proceed to the place of destination by the shortest and most direct course usually taken by ships on the same voyage; this is a stipulation implied in all contracts of affreightment and all policies of marine insurance, liable, however, to be modified in respect of particular voyages by evidence of usage when common and established, or by express agreement when the language is clear and unambiguous[5].\nThe warranty certainly could not prevent him from completing the voyage, but if he entered, and so was guilty of a breach of his warranty, it would certainly be at owner's risk, for the simple reason that by the terms of his policy he assumed that risk. Per Tindal C.J. in McAndrews v. Adams[6]; Davis v. Garrett[7]; Freeman v. Taylor[8]; Mount v. Larkins[9]; Palmer v. Marshall[10].\nThis being the captain's duty, and he being within such a short distance of the mouth of the gulf and continuing on his voyage, he must, I think, be taken to be attempting to enter the gulf, and he only failed to do so by reason of the ice which he encountered in such attempt, and which caused the injury from which it was the object of the warranty to protect the insurers.\nThe appeal must be allowed, and the parties having made an agreement to that effect a non-suit will be entered, otherwise we could only have ordered a new trial.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY J.\u2014The respondents' ship sailed from Liverpool to Quebec on 2nd April. She was under an obligation not to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence before 10th May, or to attempt to enter. Some two or three days before that date the vessel got into the ice several miles south of the gulf, and was injured. A claim is made for particular average for damage sustained by the ice three or four days before the time. She met it on the sixth of May, and got into it that night or the night following, and sustained the damage for which the action is brought.\nNow, where did she meet the ice? To the southward of the coast of Newfoundland, the distance not being stated. She sailed for four or five days after, when she got into a field of thin ice, and after going through that, proceeded without meeting any more, and arrived at Quebec on the 30th or 31st of May. She did not enter the gulf before the tenth and the question is as to an attempt to do so.\nThe pleas of the defendants did not originally contain any allegation of breach of covenant. The captain was examined under commission, and there appears to have been no question raised as to the breach of covenant before the trial. At the trial an application was made to add this plea. The presiding judge to whom this application was made not only granted it, but required the parties to proceed with the trial.\nThere was no necessity to ask the captain when examined any question as to his intention, or as to his action from which such could be ascertained. The amendment having been made, we look for the testimony, and find there is no evidence as to the question at all. The defendant sets up an attempt to enter the gulf before the time mentioned as a defence. He says: \"You are entitled to recover in this case on all other points, but your right to recover in every other respect is of no avail because, on or before the 10th of May, you attempted to enter the gulf.\"\nThis is the defence, where is the evidence? If there is none, the defence should fail. If the captain intended and meant, and did attempt to break through this line before the 10th of May, the appellant is bound to give evidence of it. But does the fact of meeting the, ice away to the southward of this line prove that he started from Liverpool too soon, and that he necessarily throughout the passage was making the illegal attempt? The captain is under legal liabilities, and is bound to sail when the ship is loaded and ready for sea. What evidence is there to show the court or jury, that if he had waited two days longer he would not have met the same ice. Then how can it be said that it was sailing too soon that caused the damage? The defendant is bound to prove his defence and to make out a reasonably strong case. He must remove every reasonable doubt as to the fact alleged in defence. I think that courts should interpret conditions of this kind strictly.\nBut we are told that if he had not been attempting to enter the gulf he would not have been where he was. What evidence is there of that? I must say in this case that we should have some proof that the party did make the attempt. When did he attempt it? On what part of the voyage? When he left Liverpool, on the 10th of May, or when? If we are to decide upon the rights of parties on evidence as slim as this, I think we are not performing our legitimate functions.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the court below affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would have come to the same conclusion as my brother Gwynne. I think the appeal should be allowed, without costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I think there can be no non-suit upon the point as to there being, as was contended, no proof of damage on the voyage to Quebec to the amount of five per cent. upon the declared value of the ship. There was evidence upon that point to go to the court below acting as a jury, therefore there can be no non-suit; and as against the finding of the court upon that evidence, the point to be established by the appellant before us sitting in appeal is, that on this matter of fact they were clearly wrong. The appellant has failed to establish that point to my satisfaction. As to the breach of warranty the respondents having waived all claim to a new trial upon this point, leave to have which was reserved to them if they desired it, as a condition subject to which the plea was allowed to be added at the trial and consenting to have the question on the warranty determined by us upon the evidence as it stands, I am of opinion that a verdict and judgment thereon should be entered for the defendant in the court below upon the plea of warranty and breach thereof. I cannot entertain a doubt that according to the ordinary understanding of the language used in the warranty the evidence shows a clear attempt to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence prior to the 10th of May, and that it was by reason of this very attempt, against the consequences resulting from which the appellant was by the warranty protecting himself, that the injury to the insured vessel, for which this action is brought, occurred. Unless the evidence shows a breach of the warranty that the vessel should not attempt to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence prior to the 10th day of May, the warranty as to the attempt would be quite illusory, in fact a dead letter. No doubt that by using a printed form for time policies to frame a voyage policy thereon, there are matters appearing in the policy, as framed, which are inappropriate to a voyage policy and insensible, but this cannot justify us in expunging from the policy the warranty that the ship shall not attempt to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence prior to the 10th of May; for by so doing we should be plainly depriving the insurer of the benefit of a clause which is apparently a most reasonable one, upon which he relied for his protection from the injury to the vessel which has occurred. Judgment must, therefore, be for the appellant on the plea of breach of warranty, with costs in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Weldon, McLean & Devlin.\nSolicitors for respondents: A.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPetition of Right\u2014Provincial debt\u2014Liability of Dominion for\u2014Order in Councils\u2014Account stated\u2014Consideration\u2014Demurrer\u2014Right to Petition.\nPrior to confederation one T. was cutting timber on territory in dispute between the old Province of Canada and the Province of New Brunswick, the former having granted him a licence for the purpose. In order to utilize the timber so cut, he had to send it down the St. John River, and it was seized by the authorities of New Brunswick and on y released upon payment of fines. T. continued the business for two or three years, paying fines to the Province of New Brunswick each year, until he was finally compelled to abandon it.\nThe two Provinces subsequently entered into negotiations in regard to the territory in dispute which resulted in the establishment of a boundary line, and a commission was appointed to deter mine the state of accounts between them in respect to such territory. One member of the commission only reported finding New Brunswick to be indebted to Canada in the sum of $20,000 and upwards, and in 1871 these figures were verified by the Dominion Auditor.\nBoth before and after confederation T. frequently urged the collection of this amount from New Brunswick with the object of having it applied to indemnify the parties who had suffered by the said dispute while engaged in cutting timber, and finally by an order in council of the Dominion Government (to whom it was claimed the indebtedness of New Brunswick was transferred by the B. N. A. Act), it was declared that a certain amount was due to T., which would be paid on his obtaining the consent of the governments of Ontario and Quebec therefor. Such consent was obtained and payments on account were made by the Dominion Government, first to T. and afterwards to the suppliant to whom T. had assigned the claim. Finally the suppliant, not being able to obtain payment of the balance due by said order in council, proceeded to recover it by petition of right, to which petition the defendant demurred on the ground that the claim was not founded upon a contract and was not properly a subject for petition of right.\nFournier J. sitting in the Court of Exchequer, over-ruled the demurrer and gave judgment for the suppliant. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld,\u2014Reversing the judgment of Fournier J., (Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting,) that there being no previous indebtedness shown to T. either from the Province of New Brunswick, the Province of Canada or the Dominion Government, the order in council did not create any debt between T. and the Dominion Government which could be enforced by petition of right.\nAppeal from the judgment of Fournier J. in the Exchequer Court, over-ruling the demurrer of the appellant.\nThe petition of right, pleadings and facts are set out at length in the judgments of the Exchequer Court and of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe case was argued in the Exchequer Court by Laflamme Q.C., (A. F. McIntyre with him) for the suppliant, and by Gregory (W. D. Hogg with him) for the defendant.\nThe following is the judgment of the Court of Exchequer:\u2014\n[TRANSLATED.]\nFOURNIER J.\u2014\"The suppliant, as transferee of a claim of James Tibbits, claims from Her Majesty the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, established by an order in council, passed by the Dominion Government, as being the amount of said James Tibbits's claim against the late Provinces of Canada and New Brunswick.\n\"The facts which gave rise to the present petition relate as far back as 1842, and originated in a conflict of authority between the governments of Canada and New Brunswick with respect to certain territory around the sources of the rivers St. John and Cabaneau, each government claiming the said territory as being part of its province. James Tibbits, having obtained from the government of the province of Canada a license to cut timber upon a part of the disputed territory, cut a large quantity of timber which could only reach the market by being floated down the river St. John and other rivers flowing through New Brunswick. The government of New Brunswick caused the timber to be seized as it passed through their province, contending that it had been cut, contrary to the law, on their public domain. The timber was released to Tibbits only upon payment by him of fines and penalties. \"Notwithstanding this hostile intervention on the part of the government of New Brunswick, Tibbits continued to work the limits for two years, but heavier fines and penalties being again imposed by the government of New Brunswick, thereby absorbing all profits, Tibbits was compelled to cease his operations.\n\"The two governments interested in this conflict having referred the matter in dispute to arbitrators, the latter made an award, the provisions of which were incorporated in an Imperial statute, 14 and 15 Vic. ch. 63. By that act it was amongst other things enacted that the net proceeds of the funds arising from the disputed territory should be applied: 1st, to defray the expenses of arbitration: 2nd, to defray expenses of running the boundary line: 3rd, the balance of the funds to be applied towards the improvement of the land and water communications between the rivers St. \"John and the St. Lawrence. The commissioners appointed to run the boundary line between the two, provinces having finished their work others were required to strike a balance between the two provinces on the transaction. No report was ever made by the commissioners jointly, but Mr. Dawson, one of the two, by his report, dated the tenth day of August, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, found that the sum of twenty thousand and two hundred and sixty-three dollars and thirty-one cents was due by New Brunswick to Canada as a balance of all the transactions in reference to the territory in dispute. Afterwards Mr. Langton, Dominion auditor, to whom this matter was referred, came to the same conclusion, as appears by his memorandum upon the matter made on the thirty-first day of May, 1871.\n\"Tibbits frequently requested the government of Canada and of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec to obtain and be paid the balance found to be due by New Brunswick, in order that it might be paid over to himself and others who had been licensees of the territory by way of compensation to them for the serious losses they sustained in consequence of the action taken by the government of New Brunswick.\n\"The suppliant, in his petition, alleges that under the British North America Act the indebtedness of the province of New Brunswick to the late province of Canada became a liability of and was assumed by the Dominion of Canada, which has thereby become bound to recover the said amount from New Brunswick and to credit the same to the old province of Canada, now the provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively.\n\"By the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th paragraphs of his petition, which are so important that I quote them at length, the suppliant alleges that:\u2014\n\"14. The honorable the Privy Council of Canada, on the thirtieth day of August, eighteen hundred and seventy-seven, passed an order in council which was duly approved, to which said order your suppliant craves leave to refer at the trial of this petition, whereby it was acknowledged and declared that the said sum of twenty thousand two hundred and sixty-three dollars and thirty-one cents, with interest thereon at six per cent. per annum from the twelfth day of November eighteen hundred and fifty-six, was then due by the province of New Brunswick to the late province of Canada in respect of the matters aforesaid, which said sum with interest amounts to forty-five thousand four hundred and ninety-one dollars and thirteen cents.\n\"15. The said order in council declared that the province of Quebec had consented, as was in fact true, that the amount coming from the province of New Brunswick should be paid to the parties entitled to the same, and mentioned in the statement thereunto annexed, and agreed with the said Tibbits and the other licensees that upon the consent of the governments of Ontario and Quebec being given thereto the said amounts should be paid to the parties entitled to the same and mentioned in the statement thereunto annexed, and agreed with the said Tibbits and the other licensees that upon the consent of the governments of Ontario and Quebec being given thereto the said amounts should be paid to the respective claimants pro rat\u00e0 according to the amounts of their respective claims, subject to certain special conditions therein mentioned. By a statement annexed to the said order in council, it appeared that one James Tibbits was one of the said claimants for and in respect of a certain sum or balance of twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven dollars and ninety-four cents, as therein set forth and which was thereby awarded to him.\n\"16. The said order in council was duly communicated by the said government to the said Tibbits, and at his and the other claimant's request and solicitation the governments of Ontario and Quebec, to whom the said order in council had also been duly communicated, by the government of Canada, respectively, by orders in council duly passed and communicated to the said government, ordered the payment by the government of Canada of the said sum of money and interest to the said James Tibbits.\n\"17. In and by the said order in council of the thirtieth day of August, eighteen hundred and seventy-seven, it was provided that so much of the said amount as might be payable to the said James Tibbits as should be necessary to meet a certain alleged claim of the province of Quebec against the said James Tibbits, should be retained until the amount of his alleged indebtedness to the government of Quebec be ascertained either by agreement of the parties or by some process of law, but, as your suppliant alleges, all matters of account between the said government of Quebec and your suppliant have long since been settled by the payment by your suppliant of all amounts due by him to the said government of Quebec, so that the said government has no longer any claim to such moneys or any part thereof.\n\"The suppliant then avers that he obtained from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario by orders in council, dated the 3rd November and the 2nd January, their consent to the payment of the sum mentioned in the order in council of the 30th August, 1877, and that the Government of New Brunswick, although requested to pay the said sum, has refused to give any answer; and that the government of Canada, acting upon the said order in council, have paid on account of the amount so payable the following sums: five hundred dollars on the twenty-third day of August, eighteen hundred and seventy-nine, two thousand dollars the tenth of December, eighteen hundred and seventy-nine, to the said James Tibbits, with the consent of the suppliant, which consent was required by the government, two thousand dollars to the suppliant on the twenty-seventh of November, eighteen hundred and eighty, and five thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine dollars and thirty-two cents to the suppliant on the seventh of June, eighteen hundred and eighty-one. He further alleges that on the thirtieth day of August, eighteen hundred and seventy-seven, there was a settlement by said order in council between the said James Tibbits and the government of Canada, whereby the sum of twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven dollars and ninety-four cents was established as the amount then due to said Tibbits, and that the government agreed and consented to pay it to him with interest from the 12th August, 1877, so soon as authority thereunto should have been received from the governments of Ontario and Quebec, which authority was obtained in accordance with the order in council above mentioned. That the government of Canada have frequently admitted the justice of the suppliant's claim and promised to pay the amount, but that they have so far neglected to do so with the exception of the payments on account as aforesaid.\n\"The suppliant then alleges the circumstances under which he, upon the security of the said orders in council and with the knowledge of the government, advanced large sums of money, and that he subsequently obtained for the same a formal transfer from James Tibbits of his claim admitted by said order in council, and that the transfer was communicated to the government and accepted, and that they paid to the suppliant sums of money on account in accordance with the said order in council, and concludes by praying for the balance due after deducting the above payments, viz.: a sum of $25,400 and interest.\n\"In answer to suppliant's claim the Crown has filed two pleas, the first is a demurrer and the second is a plea to the merits of the claim.\n\"I have only to consider for the present the demurrer.\nThe grounds upon which the claim for the sum of money prayed for by the suppliant's petition is demurred to are:\u2014\n\"1. That the claim of James Tibbits, of which the suppliant is the assignee, does not arise upon contract, and, therefore, is not a claim such as to give the suppliant any remedy against the Crown under the Petition of Right Act, 1876.\n\"2. That the order in council of the 30th of August, 1877, mentioned in the fourteenth paragraph of the petition, does not make a settlement and account stated between the government of Canada and the said James Tibbits, nor make any liability on the part of Her Majesty to answer to the said James Tibbits or the suppliant, because the said accounting is alleged to be of moneys claimed by the said James Tibbits not upon contract.\n\"3. That the order in council of the 30th of August, 1877, does not establish any sum as due from the province of New Brunswick to the late province of Canada, for want of the assent of the Province of New Brunswick.\n\"4. That as the order in council provided that the amount payable to the said James Tibbits should be retained until the amount of his indebtedness to the government of Quebec should be ascertained, it is not alleged that such indebtedness has been either ascertained or paid.\n\"5. That the British North America Act does not create any liability on the part of the Dominion directly to creditors of a province for debts due by the province at the time of the union; and lastly, that any payments made to the suppliant on account of his claim were acts of bounty of Her Majesty, and not the payment of a legal debt.\n\"From this statement of the suppliant's petition and of the demurrer it is evident that the principal question which arises in this case is: Whether a petition of right lies under the above circumstances. As to the existence of the claim how can it be denied, after the passing of the order in council of the 30th of August, 1877, formally and finally determining the amount of the claim, it seems somewhat strange, after such recognition on behalf of the government of this claim, that the suppliant should be compelled to have recourse to this court in order that the claim be adjudicated upon. The defences which have been set up, on behalf of the Dominion Government, would surprise me still more were it not perfectly well known that, as a matter of fact, it is the province of New Brunswick which is opposing the payment of the suppliant's claim, and, the crown is here represented by counsel chosen by New Brunswick, and the objections now relied on were made more in the interest of the province than of the Dominion, for the order in council passed by the Dominion Government made a settlement of account with regard to this claim, and a portion of it has already been paid.\n\"As appears by the above statement of facts, the origin of this claim arose, as already stated, from a conflict between the late province of Canada and that of New Brunswick, and in consequence thereof the latter province was interested in the settlement of this matter. Yet, as it is alleged in the petition, the province does not seem to have taken any heed of the matter until the suppliant was forced to have recourse to this court to claim what he alleges is due to him, and even now the province does not appear as a respondent, Her Majesty, as representing the Dominion Government, being the only respondent in the case now before me.\n\"It cannot be denied that, under the 111th section of the British North America Act, the Dominion of Canada is liable for the debts and obligations of each province existing at the time of the union. It may be that this section alone would not give, to a creditor of the province, the right of action against the Dominion government. But in this case the government of Canada, in the exercise of the duties imposed upon them by section 111, have thought proper to have a settlement made, and an account stated by order in council of the 30th of August, 1877, of this claim which was pending against the government of New Brunswick and that of Canada since 1842. The Constitutional Act has not provided for any particular procedure to be followed in adjudicating upon such claims. I cannot presume that the province of New Brunswick was not called upon to defend her rights; on the contrary, admitting the averments ef the petition to be true, I must take it as proved that the same procedure was adopted with regard to the province of New Brunswick as was followed with the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. A frequent and lengthy correspondence took place between the Dominion government and the provinces; the latter were requested to give their consent, but the province of New Brunswick appears to have kept aloof, and not to have wished to be a party to the proceedings.\n\"Should this abstention, on the part of New Brunswick, prevent the Dominion government from effecting a settlement of this matter? Certainly not, and, especially if we take into consideration that the Imperial statute has not provided any particular procedure to be followed in settling such claims, the course which has been adopted by the Dominion government was, in my opinion, the only one left to them. It was impossible for the suppliant to proceed or take action against a province which had ceased to exist, and the Petition of Right Act, such as the one now in force, was not then in operation. The suppliant had therefore but one course left to him, and that was to petition the Dominion government, relying on section 111 of the British North America Act.\n\"It might be said, if the order in council passed on the 30th of August, 1877, founded upon the above section of the statute, was due to the initiative of the government, and passed simply in the ordinary discharge of a public duty, that it would not have given a right to the suppliant to claim his balance by petition of right, as was contended by the counsel for Her Majesty. But it is evident that the order in council was only passed after frequent and pressing solicitation on the part of those who were interested, and that it contained conditions to be complied with by these interested parties, and these conditions being accepted and performed by them a valid contract subsisted between the government and themselves, and it is upon such a contract that the question arises: Does a petition of right lie against Her Majesty? This, in my opinion, is the sole question to be decided on this demurrer.\n\"The government of the Dominion of Canada, interested in the settlement of this claim, stipulated by their order in council that the suppliant or his grantor (auteur) should first obtain the consent of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec in order to be paid the amount due to the suppliant by the old province of Canada, as stated in the order in council. The suppliant avers that he has obtained the consent stipulated; now does not the time occupied and necessary expenses incurred to obtain this consent constitute a valid consideration given by the suppliant and accepted by the government to induce them to pay the claim in question?\n\"This order in council has, in my opinion, created a contract for which the government have obtained a legal consideration, and although the consideration for the: amount which the government had to pay may appear small, still the following passage from Addison on Contracts is an authority that it is sufficient[1]:\n\"By the civil law if any one agreed to perform or effect anything, (whether that consisted in giving or doing something) on the understanding that another in his turn should do something, or give or deliver something, or vice versa, the person in whose favor the thing had been so delivered or done, was not permitted to be deficient in performing what was stipulated on his part, but was compelled to performance, so that, if there was a cause or consideration facti vel traditionis, a corresponding obligation or duty arose. So, by the common law, if anything is performed which the party is under no obligation to perform, or if anything is given or done at the request of the promissor as the consideration or inducement for this promise, whereby the promissor, or party making the promise, has obtained or secured for himself some benefit or advantage, or where, by the promisee, or party to whom the promise has been made, has sustained some trouble or loss, or suffered some injury or inconvenience, there is a sufficient consideration to render this promise obligatory in law and capable of sustaining an action. The mere surrender or delivery of a letter or other written document which the promisee has a right to keep and retain in his possession, is a sufficient consideration for the promise, although the possession of it may turn out eventually to be of no value in a pecuniary point of view, or no benefit may have resulted to the one party nor prejudice to the other from the surrender and delivery of the document.\"\nThe suppliant and his grantor certainly come within the case mentioned in the above authority. They were under no obligation to the Dominion government to take the necessary steps with the Ontario and Quebec governments to obtain the required consent. They took these steps at the request of the Dominion government, and the necessity to take them was imposed upon them as a condition precedent to their getting paid the amount of their claim, In executing this condition they necessarily incurred trouble and expense, and all this is sufficient, under the above authority, to render the promise on the part of the government obligatory in law, and to form a contract which, between subject and subject, would be capable of being enforced by a suit at law, and which, as between a subject and the government, is a good cause for a petition of right. The objection founded on the want of consent of the province of New Brunswick cannot be entertained.\nThe province of New Brunswick could not, by refusing to recognize this claim, or by neglecting to take part in the proceedings adopted by the federal government in order to effect a settlement, prevent the latter from doing justice to the suppliant. This settlement having been effected between the suppliant and the government by means of the order in council above mentioned, it cannot now be in the power of the Province of New Brunswick to nullify its effect by simply stating that she never consented to this settlement.\n\"The question at present to be determined is not whether the province could have had or not the means of proving that there was nothing due on this claim, but the question is whether the Federal Government has made a settlement and stated an account, and having done so whether it is not obligatory on both the parties to the settlement. This I have endeavored to show they have by what I have already said.\n\"The defence has also attempted to derive an advantage from the fact that there is a clerical error in a copy of the petition and to rely upon it as a ground of demurrer to the petition. The order in council imposed on Tibbits the obligation to pay off an alleged indebtedness which the Province of Quebec claimed for certain dues on timber cut on the disputed territory and in the 17th paragraph of the petition, the suppliant avers, by error of the copying clerk no doubt, that he, the suppliant, had paid whatever was owing to the Province of Quebec, instead of stating that the same had been settled by Tibbits. This is clearly an error, for there is no allegation in any of the paragraphs of the petition that the suppliant Dunn had ever been indebted to the Province of Quebec. There is only a reference that Tibbits owed certain sums for timber dues which had not been settled pending the settlement of this claim. We must therefore read paragraph 17 as alleging that James Tibbits, and not the suppliant, whose name is inserted by error, has fulfilled the obligation of satisfying the Province of Quebec. Notwithstanding this error the purport of the paragraph is easily ascertained and the objection founded on this error has no value.\n\"I cannot either entertain the objection founded on the fact that because a transfer has been made by Tibbits of his claim to the suppliant, of which the government received due notice, Her Majesty is not answerable to the suppliant therefor. No doubt it was in the Crown's option to refuse its consent to such a transaction, but so far from doing so, the Crown has formally acquiesced in the same by paying to the suppliant large sums of money on account after the transfer had been communicated to it.\n\"As upon demurrer all facts alleged must be considered as duly proved I am of opinion for the reasons above stated that the allegations in the petition are sufficient in law to justify the prayer, and I therefore dismiss the demurrer with costs.\"\nFrom this judgment the Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nA. G. Blair Atty. General of New Brunswick, (W. D. Hogg with him) for appellant.\nLaflamme Q.C. (il. F. McIntyre with him) for respondent.\nThe points relied on by counsel sufficiently appear in the judgments.\nThe following authorities and cases were cited and relied on: For appellant: Chitty on Contracts[2]; Evans v. Verity[3]; Lemere v. Elliott[4]; Rustomjee v. The Queen[5].\nFor respondents: Grant v. Eddy[6]; Canada Central Railway Co. v. The Queen[7]; Isbester v. The Queen[8]; Addison on Contracts[9].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014After giving a synopsis of the petition continued as follows:\u2014\nTibbits, without alleging or showing any indebtedness to him from the Province of New Brunswick, the old Province of Canada, or the Dominion, claims a right to recover from the Dominion an amount alleged to be due from the Province of New Brunswick, not to himself, but to old Canada. This claim is based on an order in council in which the Dominion Government admit and declare there is an amount due from the Province of New Brunswick to old Canada, the said order declaring that the Province of Quebec had consented that the amount coming from the Province of New Brunswick should be paid to the parties entitled to the same and mentioned in the statement thereto annexed, and agreed with Tibbits and the other licensees that upon the, consent of the Government of Ontario and Quebec being given thereto, the said amount should be paid to the respective claimants pro rat\u00e2 according to the amounts of their respective claims, subject to certain special conditions therein mentioned, that by a statement annexed to said order it appeared that Tibbitts was one of the said claimants for a sum of $20,897.14 which was thereby awarded to him. That the order in council was communicated by the Government to Tibbits and at his and the other claimants' request and solicitation the Governments of Ontario and Quebec, to whom also said orders had been duly communicated by the Government of Canada by orders duly passed and communicated to said governments, ordered the payment by the Government of Canada of said sum of money to Tibbits.\nThe order in council provided that so much of the amount payable to Tibbits as should be necessary to meet a certain alleged claim of the Province of Quebec against Tibbits should be retained until the amount of his indebtedness to the Government of Quebec should be ascertained.\nIt is then alleged that all matters of account between the Government of Quebec and the suppliant have long since been settled by the payment by suppliant of all amounts due by him to Government of Quebec, so that government has no longer any claim to such moneys. Unless Tibbits could show that he had a valid claim against New Brunswick, Canada or the Dominion, I am at a loss to understand what right he has to this money, or how, in the absence of any indebtedness of New Brunswick or the others to him, he can make out a legal claim enforceable against the Crown to the money in question.\nApart from the orders in council and the statement of the report of Mr. Dawson and Mr. Langton, none of which could establish an indebtedness from New Brunswick to Canada, no indebtedness of New Brunswick to Canada is shown, still less is any indebtedness of New Brunswick, Canada or the Dominion to Tibbits alleged or shown. The learned judge who heard this case thus states the question:\nThe question at present to be determined is not whether the province could have had or not the means of proving that there was nothing due on this claim, but the question is whether the Federal Government has made a settlement and stated an account, and having done so whether it is not obligatory on the both parties to the settlement. This I have endeavored to show they have by what I have already said.\nIn the absence then of an indebtedness from New Brunswick, or Canada, or of the Dominion, to Tibbits, where is there any foundation for a legal liability of or right in the Crown to hand over this money to Tibbits, or any contract capable of being judicially enforced alleged in the petition of right? Or, in the absence of any such indebtedness, how could an indebtedness of New Brunswick or Canada to Tibbits for the sum claimed be incurred by reason of the orders in council set out in the petition? The learned judge says the federal government made and settled and stated an account, but of what and with whom? Certainly not with Tibbits, with whom there was no pre-existing indebtedness so far as the petition of right is concerned, none is alleged to have existed, and consequently neither the province of New Brunswick, or the province of Canada, or the Dominion of Canada, had any account to settle or state with Tibbits. The cases are very clear that without a debt or liability no account could be stated or settled. An account stated must refer to to a debt due.\nIt is only necessary to refer to a few authorities to prove this conclusively.\nThus in Bates v. Townley[10], Platt B. says:\nAn account stated is the settlement of account, in which both parties or their agents agree upon the amount due from one to the other.\nIn Kirton v. Wood[11], per Tindal L. J.:\u2014\nOn account stated you must show some precise sum. See also Lane v. Hill,[12]; Wayman v. Hilliard.[13]; Wilson v. Marshall,[14]; Lemere v. Elliott[15]. In Wilson v. Marshall[16]:\nThe defendant promised the plaintiff orally, that if certain goods were supplied to A. a third party, he would see the plaintiff paid for them. The plaintiff accordingly supplied the goods, and A. left the country without having paid for them. The defendant subsequently orally acknowledged his liability to the plaintiff for the price of the goods.\nHeld, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover in any action upon the account stated founded upon the acknowledgment; for, although the admission of liability to pay a liquidated sum is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of an account stated, evidence had been properly given to show the nature of the consideration upon which it was founded, and it appearing that the sum acknowledged was not the subject of a direct liability from the defendant to the plaintiff, a verdict for the defendant had been rightly entered.\nAlthough an accout stated may be founded upon a mere equitable liability, it must be a direct liability from the defendant to the plaintiff.\nIn that case Pigott C. B. says:\u2014\nAlthough, however, the account stated may be founded upon a debt or liability, as an equitable liability,[17] still there must be such debt or liability from the defendant to plaintiff. French v. French[18]; Fetch v. Lyon[19]; Lubbock v. Tribe[20]; see the judgment of Parke B., Hopkins v. Logan[21]; Lewis v. Elliott[22]; Gough v. Findon[23]; Chitty on contracts[24].\nThe admission of a liability to pay a liquidated sum is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of an account stated. But the consideration of an account stated, (as in the case of French v. French and in the other cases of this class above cited) is always examinable, and it appears to me that if the sum acknowledged be not the subject of a direct liability from the defendant to the plaintiff, but the result of a collatral liability, for which only an action for damages would lie then consistently with the nature of the action upon an account stated such an action cannot be sustained as upon an account stated founded upon such a demand.\nI need not further refer to the peculiar nature of that action. It is explained in several of the cases cited at paragraph 4 especially in Mr. Justice Blackburn's judgment, re Laycock Pickles[25], and in the judgment of Parke B., Lubbock v. Tribe[26], and Hopkins v. Logan[27].\nIn Lemere v. Elliott[28] Martin B. says:\u2014\nThe old form of a count on an account stated was this:\n\"And whereas the said C. D. afterwards, to wit, on, &c., accounted with the said A. B. of and concerning divers sums of money from the said C. D. to the said A. B. before the time due and owing and then in arrear and unpaid. And upon that account the said C. D. was then and there found to be in arrear and indebted to the said A. B. in the sum of &c.\"\nWilde B.\u2014\nIn Porter v. Cooper[29] Parke B. said: \u2014\"I agree with what has fallen from my brother Alderson in the course of the discussion, that in the later cases the courts have deviated far from what was the original meaning of an account stated. I take the rule to be this: that if there is an admission of a sum of money being due for which an action will lie, that will be evidence to go to the jury on the count for an account stated.\"\nPollock C.B.:\u2014\nAn I O U professes to be the result of an account stated in respect of a debt due, and it is important not to make fiction supply the place of truth and say that an account has been stated in respect of a debt, when in reality there was none.\nMartin B.:\u2014\nAn account stated as that stated in the old form of declaration to which I have referred. No doubt what is said by Parke B, in Porter v. Cooper is the essence of it namely, that there must be an admission of a debt due. In Whitehead v. Howard[30], it was also said that there must be a real existing debt due.\nWilde B. \u2014\nI am of the same opinion. There was no sum admitted to be due for which an action would lie, and upon the substance of the transaction there was no debt to support an account stated.\nI am constrained to the conclusion that on the facts alleged in the petition the Crown entered into no legal or binding contract with Tibbits to pay him the money claimed enforceable by petition of right. I have had an opportunity of reading a carefully prepared judgment in the case by my brother Gwynne, in which he has discussed the question raised so fully and exhaustively that it would be waste of time to add anything further.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am sorry to say, that after hearing the reasons given for allowing the demurrer I am not yet convinced that the petition is not sufficiently framed to allow the parties to be heard on the merits.\nThe origin of the claim has not been referred to in the reasons I have heard. Now, this claim arises out of a license to cut timber by the Crown. That was a perfect contract between Tibbits and the Crown, and when the latter could only get his timber upon paying penalties, he was obliged to give up, and subsequently tried to get relief for the damage and loss he had sustained through the breach of contract. The Quebec government were willing to pay, but New Brunswick would not take any part in a settlement, and prevented, as much as it was in their power, a settlement.\nNow, the Dominion Government, in view of the power given to it by the 111th section of the British North America Act, took upon itself to settle this claim, as I think they had power to do. I am very willing to admit that before a settlement is made the party must show he has a claim. Now, I adhere to my former opinion, that the petition has alleged enough to show that the suppliant has a claim not only by alleging all and setting out all the facts since it originated, but also by stating, in the most positive way, that there has been an account stated and settled, and in support of that allegation he relies on the order in council, in virtue of which it is admitted he received payments on account. The New Brunswick Government is not represented in the case, but is acting as if it were. I do not think the Dominion Government would have ever consented to deny their liability under the most solemn Act they can pass, had it not been urged to do so in the interests of New Brunswick. In settling with Tibbits, I am of opinion that the Government of Canada, in case New Brunswick refused to proceed, had, under the British North America Act, a right to proceed ex parte. There is, it is true, no procedure provided by the Act, but if a province refused to settle, simply because they have no desire to pay, I think power is given to the Dominion to settle. The Dominion has admitted there was a debt and they bound themselves to pay it. Now, I do not say that because the Dominion have agreed to pay that the Province of New Brunswick is bound to recoup the Dominion Government. That is a matter which may be discussed hereafter. The suppliant in this case has furnished the consideration he was bound to furnish, viz., the obtaining of the consent of the provinces, which cost him time and expense, and that is a legal consideration for a contract. I cannot understand how the government can relieve itself from such a solemn obligation. I gave a written judgment in the court below to which I adhere, and the appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014We often hear the maxim repeated \"That the Crown can do no wrong.\" But if the Crown is to be judged by the action of the government in this case I think we can come to the conclusion that the Crown can do wrong. That they can solemnly promise to pay and then refuse to pay is prim\u00e2 facie evidence that the Government, at all events, can do wrong. This is involved in this case, and what is it founded on? Plaintiff was engaged in cutting timber and had obtained a license from the Province of Quebec and entered upon the business. New Brunswick, alleging claim to land upon which the timber was cut, had it seized, and it was released only on payment of fines. The respondent's assignor continued business for some years and then abandoned it. Finally the line between New Brunswick and Quebec was settled. After this it became a question as to how the accounts stood between the provinces on account of this land. A commission was appointed to ascertain this. One of the commissioners did not report, the other did and reported a large sum due by New Brunswick, and the account was subsequently investigated by the Auditor General and approved. Under these circumstances we can fairly assume that there was a debt, although there was no binding obligation on New Brunswick.\nSetting out with that, when confederation took place, the Dominion was saddled with the responsibility of paying the liability of each of the provinces. That being the case and the Government of Quebec finding that Tibbits had a legal claim and that New Brunswick had so much to pay, were willing that the Dominion Government should appropriate that amount to pay him and others similarly situated.\nHere then was a debt and liability admitted by the Province of Quebec to Tibbits which they requested the Dominion Government to pay, and they gave an order to the Dominion Government to pay the money. Now suppose the Dominion Government were in a position to say to Quebec \"we have paid that money.\" Could Quebec object to it? Could it be said the money had been paid illegally? It is admitted they paid portions of this amount and made a statement of account showing a balance due Tibbits, but through some influence the Government of New Brunswick have been mixed up with the case and raised objection to the payment of the balance. Why New Brunswick should have interfered and object to the Dominion paying what, at the request of Quebec, they had undertaken to pay, I cannot understand. The Dominion Government say that New Brunswick was opposed to the demand, and they, therefore, declined to pay the balance due to Tibbits. I am of opinion that it is too late to allege that as a defence. I cannot conceive any immediate interest New Brunswick had in the transaction or any right to interfere. We all know that an equitable consideration is sufficient on an account stated. We are told that here must be an indebtedness. The amount is not in doubt here. It has been well ascertained and fixed and the documents in the department shows the amount due. I think there was a good account stated. If a party is liable merely for damages but an account is stated and payments made on account would it not be a good account upon which an action would lie? I think there was a good claim and I am very much inclined to think that if a private individual had stated that account he would have been told \"Sir, you understood the matter and accepted an order from one party to pay money to another, you paid a part of it and stated an account showing a balance due and have entered into a binding contract to pay it.\"\nI think the respondent has a good claim against the Dominion Government for that balance and that demurrer should not be set aside.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion to allow this appeal. The petition of right shows no ground for a recovery against the Crown. There is no allegation that the Province of New Brunswick was indebted to the suppliant at the date of confederation. Even then it is doubtful if under section 111 of the British North America Act, he would have had a right of action against the government. Then there is no allegation that the seizure of the timber by New Brunswick was a wrongful act on the part of that government, for it is not averred that the timber was not cut on these lands of New Brunswick, and if cut on such lands it would then have been legally seized and legally taken out of the suppliant's possession; and if not cut on its lands then the seizure of this timber by New Brunswick would have been a tort, and not a debt or liability of the province under section 111 of the British North America Act.\nThe order in council embodies no contract between the Crown and the suppliant, but merely an arrangement between the Dominion and the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario.\nI fully concur in Mr. Justice Gwynne's notes of which I have had communication.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed, and that judgment must be ordered to be entered in the Court of Exchequer, allowing the demurrer. I find it difficult to understand upon what foundation it is that the suppliant's claim is intended to be rested, for Mr. Laflamme, as I understood him, at one time contended that the order in council of the 30th of August, 1877, operated as an acceptance by the Dominion Government of an order of the provinces of Quebec and Ontario to pay Tibbits a sum of money due by those provinces to him, out of their moneys in the hands of the Dominion Government, and their undertaking with Tibbits to pay him such sum. At another time he contended that the order in council operated as an adjudication by the Dominion Government which, as was contended, they were competent to make of a sum of money as being due from New Brunswick to old Canada and by the latter to Tibbits, and as a promise to Tibbits, founded thereon, to pay him; at another time, while expressly admitting that the petition of right must fail if it asserted a claim against the Dominion Government by way of indemnity for the original loss sustained by Tibbits in the exercise of his license rights, still he contended that the Dominion Government, as representing old Canada, was originally liable to Tibbits to pay him the amount claimed as a debt due to him by old Canada, and that the Dominion Government, by the order in council, ascertained and determined, as it is contended it was competent for them to do, that the amount claimed was such a debt. Again, he contended that the Dominion Government, in passing the order in council, acted in the double capacity of being itself the representative of the old provinces prior to confederation, and as being an arbitrator between the government of the province of New Brunswick and the governments of Ontario and Quebec, as representing old Canada; and as to the words in the order in council: \"Subject to certain conditions therein mentioned,\" he contended that taking paragraphs 17 and 25 of the petition of right together, they comprehended an allegation that all conditions were fulfilled, or that their fufilment was waived. Now, that the order in council in itself, irrespective of there having ever been any prior obligation or debt imposed upon, or incurred by either of the old provinces in existence, prior to confederation, is the sole foundation upon which the petition of right rests the suppliant's claim, and that this claim is for payment out of moneys alleged to have been due from New Brunswick to old Canada prior to confederation to the suppliant, as assignee of Tibbits, all sums of money not alleged as having been due to him, prior to the making of the order, but which, as the petition insists, became by the order in council a debt, due from the Dominion Government to Tibbits, appears to me, to be the only case to be collected from the petition, as being sought to be made by it. If the allegations in the petition leave any doubt upon this point, such doubt seems to me, to be wholly removed by the prayer of the petition, which is that the government of Canada may be declared, under the said order in council to be indebted in the said sum of $25,400, with interest thereon at six per cent. per annum, and may be ordered to pay the same to your suppliant. What the petition alleges in substance, is that the government of old Canada, prior to confederation, in the years 1842 and 1844, issued licenses to one Tibbits, to cut timber upon certain lands lying on the confines of the provinces of old Canada and New Brunswick, which lands the petitioner calls, disputed territory, that is to say, claimed by old Canada and New Brunswick respectively\u2014that the government of New Brunswick in the assertion of their claim, seized the timber when passing down through New Brunswick to the sea, and detained the same, until Tibbits paid certain charges demanded by New Brunswick\u2014that the sums so imposed upon, and paid by Tibbits, made the cutting of timber so unprofitable, that Tibbits ceased cutting anymore\u2014that the boundary being still in dispute, the matter was referred to arbitrators, who made an award determining certain boundaries, which boundaries an Imperial Act 14th and 15th Vic., ch. 63, fixed as the boundary between old Canada and New Brunswick\u2014and that the Act directed that the net proceeds of the funds in the hands of old Canada and New Brunswick respectively, arising from the territory in dispute between the provinces, should be applied: 1st, to defray the expenses of the arbitration; 2nd, to defray the necessary expenses of running the boundary line as settled, and in case such funds should prove insufficient the expenses to be borne equally by the respective governments, and 3rd, the balance of the funds to be applied towards the improvement of the land and water communication between the rivers St. John and St. Lawrence.\nNow stopping here for a moment, it is to be observed that there is no allegation whatever that any legal demand had accrued to Tibbits, either against old Canada or New Brunswick, for the seizure by New Brunswick of the timber cut by him under the Canada licenses or for any other cause whatever. For all that appears the act of the New Brunswick authorities in seizing that timber may have been quite illegal There is nothing from which it can be collected that the land upon which the timber was cut did not prove to be in old Canada; and as to the moneys received by New Brunswick, in respect of the timber seized, they were appropriated to specific purposes by the Imperial Act. It is not, however, upon the fund consisting of the proceeds of moneys arising from the territory which had been in dispute that the claim of the suppliant as the assignee Tibbits is made, but upon a sum of money alleged to have become due from New Brunswick to old Canada for the excessive outlay of the latter province in running the boundary fixed by the Act, the expense of which was directed by the Act to be borne equally by old Canada and New Brunswick respectively.\nThe petition then proceeds to allege that in the fall of 1855 a joint commission consisting of Messrs. Dawson and Cutler was appointed by the two provinces (old Canada and New Brunswick) to investigate and report upon the funds accrued from the disputed territory, and upon all questions of bonds to be prosecuted and enforced (referring to bonds given by certain licensees), or claims to be remitted in connection therewith; and the running of the boundary line having been finished, that the commissioners were required to ascertain the amount spent on that survey by each government and strike a balance between the provinces on the transactions. The petition then alleges that no such report was ever made by the said commissioners jointly, but that the said Dawson, by a report made by him alone, dated the tenth day of August, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, found that the sum of twenty thousand two hundred and sixty-three dollars and thirty-one cents was due by New Brunswick to Canada as a balance of all the transactions, the amount expended by the province of Canada in respect of the said boundary survey, having been largely in excess of the sum expended by the province of New Brunswick in respect of the same object, and that the same figures were afterwards arrived at by Mr. Langton, Dominion auditor, in a memorandum of his upon the matter, made on the 31st day of May, 1871, as showing a correct balance as aforesaid.\nNow, here it is to be observed that the petition does not allege, as a matter of fact, that the province of New Brunswick, prior to confederation, was indebted to the province of old Canada in the sum of $20,263.31 for monies expended by the province of old Canada in excess of the equal share of that Province in the cost of the boundary survey, but that Mr. Dawson had so found; and it is not alleged that Mr. Dawson alone, by a report of his not joined in by his co-commissioner, had, or could have, established such sum to have been due from New Brunswick to old Canada. It may be quite true that Mr. Dawson's report was a correct finding, that New Brunswick was indebted in such amount to Canada, but the fact of the existence of the debt is not alleged; all that is here alleged being that Mr. Dawson, in a report made by him, asserted the existence of the debt, and that Mr. Langton, Auditor-General of the Dominion after confederation, concurred in the figures as reported by Mr. Dawson. However, not to rest upon the nakedness of this allegation in the petition, we may assume it to be alleged that New Brunswick was at the time of confederation indebted to old Canada in the above amount, for the case made by the petition upon the basis of the existence of such debt, is in the 12th paragraph of the petition of right stated to be, that under the British North America Act the indebtedness of the said province of New Brunswick to the said province of Canada, became a liability of and was assumed by the Dominion of Canada, and thereafter the said Dominion became bound to recover the same amount so due from New Brunswick and to credit the same to the old province of Canada, now the provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively. With what view this paragraph was inserted in the petition, and what bearing it can have upon the case sought to be made for the suppliant, I find it difficult to understand: for, if, as is alleged in the paragraph the said debt of New Brunswick to the Province of old Canada became upon confederation a liability of and was assumed by the Dominion of Canada, the dominion became the debtor in lieu of old New Brunswick, and in such case could not be the creditor of, and entitled to recover the amount from, the Province of New Brunswick as constituted by the Confederation Act as debtor of the Dominion, and if, as is also alleged in the paragraph, the Dominion became bound to credit the same amount to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec that could only be by force of some provision of the British North America Act, and the obligation if existing and enforceable by process of law can only be so at the suit of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, or of one of them.\nThe petition then alleges that Tibbits frequently requested of the Governments of Canada and of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec\u2014that the balance due by New Brunswick might be obtained and paid over to himself and the several parties who had been licensees in the disputed territory, by way of compensation to them for the serious losses they sustained. Now, as there is no previous liability alleged as having accrued to Tibbits, either from old Canada or from the Dominion of Canada, or from the provinces of Ontario or Quebec to pay any sum by way of compensation to Tibbits for any losses he may have sustained by reason of New Brunswick having seized his timber, the requests which are in this paragraph alleged to have been made must be taken to have been made to the governments named in the paragraph for the gratuitous application of moneys alleged to have been due from the old province of New Brunswick to old Canada, by way of compensation for losses with the occuring of which it is not alleged that old Canada, or Ontario, or Quebec, had anything to do, and in respect of which it is not alleged either that the old Province of New Brunswick or the Dominion of Canada, as representing it, had incurred any liability. The petition then proceeds in its 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 24th and 25th paragraphs, to state the facts upon which, as is contended, the right of the suppliants to recover as assignee of Tibbits, which in paragraphs numbering from 18 to 23 inclusive, he is alleged to be, is founded.\nIn the 14th paragraph it is alleged that the Privy Council of Canada on the 80th day of August, 1877, passed an Order in Council whereby it was acknowledged and declared that the said sum of $20,263.31, with interest thereon at six per cent. per annum from the 12th November, 1856, was then due by the province of New Brunswick to the late province of Canada in respect of the matters aforesaid, which said sum, with interest, amounts to $45,491.13.\nIn the 15th paragraph it is alleged that the said Order in Council declared that the province of Quebec had consented that the amount coming from the Province of New Brunswick should be paid to the parties entitled to the same, and mentioned in a statement thereunto annexed and agreed with the said Tibbits and the other licensees that upon the consent of the Governments of Ontario and Quebec being given thereto the said amounts should be paid to the respective claimants pro rata, according to the amounts of their respective claims, subject to certain special conditions therein mentioned, and that, by a statement annexed to the said Order in Council it appeared that one James Tibbits was one of the said claimants for and in respect of a certain sum or balance of $27,897.94 as therein set forth and which was thereby awarded him. Reading this 15th paragraph grammatically, it simply alleges that the said Order in Couneil declared that the Province of Quebec had consented, &c. &c., and agreed with Tibbits and the other licensees that upon the consent of the Governments of Ontario and Quebec being given thereto the said amount should be paid to the respective claimants pro rata, according to the amount of their respective claims, subject to certain special conditions therein mentioned. This, it has been contended, is a narrow and incorrect reading of the paragraph, and it is contended on behalf of the suppliant that what the paragraph alleges is: that the Order in Council declared, &c., &c., and agreed with the said Tibbits, &c., &c., and so reading it the contention is that the paragraph in substance alleges that the Privy Council of Canada, by the said Order in Council, \"agreed with the said Tibbits and the other licensees, that upon the consent of the Governments of Ontario and Quebec being given thereto the said amount, should be paid to the respective claimants, pro rata, according to the amounts of their respective claims, subject to certain special conditions therein mentioned.\nThere is no allegation of the existence of any debt as having been due to Tibbits from the province of old Canada, which would justify the appropriation of any moneys belonging to old Canada by way of payment of any sum of money to Tibbits. No claim whatever of Tibbits against the Province of old Canada, either of the nature of a debt due to him or of damages recoverable by him as for the breach of any contract made with him is alleged. Assuming, therefore, the paragraph to be susceptible of the construction contended for by the suppliant, namely, as alleging that the Privy Council of Canada, by the Order in Council, agreed with Tibbits and the others, &c., &c., it amounts merely to an allegation that the Privy Council of Canada agreed with Tibbits and the others, that the amount due from New Brunswick to old Canada should be appropriated in payment to Tibbits and the others, pro rata, of the amounts of their respective claims as stated in a memorandum annexed to the Order in Council, not in discharge of any liability of old Canada to any of them, but gratuitously upon the Governments of Ontario and Quebec, assenting to such gratuitous appropriation of such fund and subject to certain special conditions in the Order in Council mentioned. If it were necessary for the decision of this ease to pass upon the validity of such an Order in Council, I, for my part, am prepared to hold that an Order of the Privy Council of Canada assenting to such gratuitous appropriation of monies belonging to old Canada upon the consent of the Governments of Ontario and Quebec being given to such gratuitous appropriation, does not constitute a debt due from the Dominion of Canada to Tibbits or give to Tibbits any claim against the public funds of the Dominion of Canada or of old Canada, under the control of the Dominion or against the Dominion Government, as representing old Canada or otherwise howsoever, which is recognizable or enforceable on a petition of right against Her Majesty. The Privy Council of Canada has not, by the constitution, any such absolute power of affecting the Dominion of Canada, or its public funds, with any liability under such a state of facts, and unsupported by any legal consideration. But it is unnecessary in this case to pass upon that point, for the only agreement alleged, if there is any, is to appropriate monies alleged to be due from New Brunswick to old Canada in payment to Tibbits, and others pro rata, certain sums mentioned in a memorandum annexed to the Order in Council, not merely on the consent of the Governments of Ontario and Quebec to such payment, but upon certain special conditions alleged to be mentioned in the Order in Council, and there is no allegation whatever as to the nature of those conditions, nor of their fulfilment, nor as to what would be the pro rat\u00e2 amount payable to Tibbits out of the particular fund mentioned, nor that such sum, or any part of it, remains unpaid. The 16th paragraph alleges, that the said Order in Council was communicated by the said government to Tibbits, and that at his, and the other claimants' request, the Governments of Ontario and Quebec, to whom the said Order in Council had also been communicated by the Government of Canada by Orders in Council duly passed, and communicated to the said government, ordered the payment of the said sum of money and interest to the said James Tibbits.\nThis paragraph is only material inasmuch as upon it the right of Tibbits, and of the suppliant as his assignee, to recover upon this petition of right is put by the judgment of the Court of Exchequer upon the contention that Tibbits and the others having, as is alleged in the paragraph, procured the Governments of Ontario and Quebec to pass the orders in Council, whereby they ordered the payment of the said sum of money to Tibbits, constitutes sufficient consideration, independently of the existence of any other, to support the promise by the Dominion Government to pay the said sum to Tibbits, which (as is also contended) is contained in the Order in Council. Whether the Order in Council can be construed as containing any such contract or promise, as made with, or to Tibbits, it is not necessary to decide, for, assuming it to be susceptible of that construction, I am of opinion that the consideration relied upon, however sufficient it might be to support a promise by a subject to a subject, to pay a sum of money, as to which I express no opinion, such a consideration cannot support a promise made by the Privy Council of Canada, so as to create a debt not founded upon any other consideration as due to Tibbits by the Dominion Government, recoverable by petition of right against Her Majesty as executive head of the Dominion Government. The public funds of the Dominion cannot be affected with a liability upon any such consideration. The 17th paragraph alleges that it was provided by the said Order in Council, that so much of the said amount as might be payable to the said Tibbits, as should be necessary to meet a certain alleged claim of the Province of Quebec against him, should be retained until the amount of his alleged indebtedness to the Government of Quebec should be ascertained either by agreement of the parties, or by some process of law, and the paragraph then proceeds thus:\u2014\nBut as your suppliant alleges all matters of account between the said Government of Quebec and your suppliant have long since been settled, by the payment by your suppliant of all amounts due by him to the said Government of Quebec, so that the said government has no longer any claim to such monies or any part thereof.\nThen, the 24th paragraph alleges that the Government of Canada have acted upon the Orders in Council passed as aforesaid by the Governments of Ontario and Quebec, and have paid on account of the monies of as aforesaid payable to Tibbits under the said Order in Council of the 3rd August, 1877, certain amounts set out and amounting in the whole to $10,239.32; and by the 25th paragraph the suppliant submits that on the said 30th day of August there was a settlement made and an account stated between the said Government of Canada and the said Tibbits, whereby the said amount of $27,897.94 was established on the amount then due to the said Tibbits, up to 12th day of August of that year, for the causes aforesaid, which sum with interest from the date last aforesaid was agreed to be paid by the said government, so soon as authority thereunto should have been received from the said Governments of Ontario and Quebec.\nNow, assuming the 17th paragraph to allege that all matters of account between the Government of Quebec and Tibbits, instead of \"between the said government and your suppliant\" as the paragraph does allege, had been settled by the payment by Tibbits of all amounts due by him to the said Government of Quebec, &c., &c., &c;, it is contended that this paragraph, so read, together with what is alleged in the 25th paragraph, amounts to an averment that all conditions mentioned in the Order in Council of the 30th of August, 1877, were fulfilled or waived, but there is no allegation that this condition referred to in this paragraph was the sole condition mentioned in the Order in Council, to which the words therein \"subject to certain special conditions in the said order mentioned\" apply; and as for the 25th paragraph, what is contended for in it is that what took place on the 30th August, 1877, when the Order in Council of that date was passed, was an account stated between the Government of the Dominion of Canada and Tibbits, whereby the sum mentioned in the order was found to be due from Canada to Tibbits, but as there is no previous transaction in the nature of a debt or contract alleged to have existed between the Government of Canada and Tibbits, in respect of which a valid account stated, could be had, it is futile to contend that the suppliants claim can be sanctioned as upon an account stated; moreover, the Order in Council which is relied upon as the sole evidence to establish the liability of the Government of Canada to Tibbits, does not establish or profess to establish the sum of $27,897.94, or any sum as then due by the Government of Canada or by any person to Tibbits; all that it professes to do is to refer to that sum as an amount mentioned in a memorandum annexed to the order, as an amount claimed by Tibbits to be the amount of his losses in getting out the timber which the authorities of New Brunswick seized, and to order that if the Governments of Ontario and Quebec should consent to the appropriation of the sum alleged in the order to be due from New Brunswick to old Canada towards the payment of such losses, and like losses of other persons similarly situated with Tibbits the same should be paid to Tibbits and the other licensees pro rata, that is in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims for their losses. And as for the allegation in the 24th paragraph, the payments therein alleged to have been made may have been the whole amount by the order directed to be paid to Tibbits as his pro rata share of the fund so appropriated, and, moreover, such payments having been so far as appears by the petition of right made wholly ex grati\u00e2 unfounded upon any legal consideration, such payments could never impose a legal obligation, giving to Tibbits or his assignee any claim enforceable by petition of right for the recovery from Her Majesty as executive head of the Dominion of Canada, or any further portion of his alleged losses. Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the petition of right fails to disclose any case sufficient to warrant a judgment against Her Majesty.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Geo.

(Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.) APPEAL from the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], sustaining a verdict for the respondent as administrator of his wife, on account of her death caused by negligence of the appellants.\nThe accident which caused the death of the respondent\u2019s wife occurred while she was driving along Dalhousie street in the city of Ottawa, at about ten o\u2019clock in the morning of the third day of September, 1881. It appeared that as she approached a railway crossing on the said street, a train belonging to the appellants\u2019 company was proceeding along the track at right angles to the said street, moving reversely, and struck the carriage in which the respondent\u2019s wife was driving, and she was thrown out and received injuries from which she died. Her husband, having obtained letters of administration, brought an action against the company, on behalf of himself and the children of the deceased, and alleged in his statement of claim, that the train causing the accident which resulted in his wife\u2019s death, had violated the Railway Act in several particulars: by not ringing a bell or blowing a whistle; by not having a man on the rear of the car to warn persons of the approach of the train; and by proceeding at a greater rate of speed than six miles an hour.\nOn the trial it was shown that the deceased had been accustomed to perform various household services, such as milking a cow, &c., and managed all the household affairs.\nThe jury found the railway company guilty of negligence, and gave a verdict for the plaintiff with $5,800 damages of which $1,500 was apportioned to the husband and the balance divided among the children. This verdict the Court of Appeal refused to disturb, and the company appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. for the appellants. In addition to the authorities and points relied on by counsel which are stated in the judgments of the court below[2], and in the judgments delivered in this court, Seward v. Vera Cruz[3]; and Savary et al. v. G.T. Railway of Canada[4] were cited.\nDalton McCarthy Q.C. and M. O\u2019Gara Q.C. for the respondent, cited Tilley v. Hudson River R.R. Co.[5]; McIntyre v. N.Y. Central R.R. Co.[6]; Chamberlain v. Boyd[7].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This action was brought by a husband, under Cons. Stats. of Canada, ch. 78, secs. 2 and 3, on behalf of himself and his children, to recover damages for the death of his wife caused by the negligence of the defendants and their servants. The sections of the statute referred to are as follows:\u2014\n2; Wherever the death of a person has been caused by such wrongful act, neglect or default, as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, in such case the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death has been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to felony. C.S.C., c. 78, s. 1.\n3. Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death has been so caused, and shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the person deceased, and in every such action the judge or jury may give such damages as they think proportioned to the injury, resulting from such death, to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action has been brought; and the amount so recovered, after deducting the costs not recovered from the defendant, shall be divided amongst the before-mentioned parties, in such shares as the judge or jury by their verdict find and direct. C.S.C., c. 78, s. 2.\nThe jury found that the death was caused by the negligence of the defendants, and awarded damages to the husband and to the children of the deceased being under age. The Queen\u2019s Bench Division (Chief Justice Haggarty and Mr. Justice Cameron) set aside this verdict and ordered a non-suit, Mr. Justice Armour dissenting; the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, three of the learned judges holding plaintiff entitled to recover, Burton J. dissenting. All the judges in both courts admitted that defendants had been guilty of negligence, but differed as to the meaning to be attached to the word injury used in the statute. Chief Justice Haggarty and Mr. Justice Burton held that the loss of the wife or mother, no matter how industrious, careful or attentive she might have been in looking after her husband\u2019s domestic affairs, and in promoting the material and moral condition and prospects of her children, was still sentimental, and not of a sufficient pecuniary character to support the action. The other judges held that what is meant by pecuniary loss in all the decided cases in which the expression had been used is the loss of some benefit or advantage which is capable of being estimated in money as distinguished from mere sentimental loss.\nThe evidence as to damages was to the following effect:\u2014The husband was married on 21st October, 1849; his wife was in her fifty-third year when she was killed; he was nine years her senior, and she was in the very best of health; they had had nine children, seven of whom were living aged respectively 30, 22, 21, 19, 16, 14 and 11. The five younger children, to whom the jury awarded damages, lived at home, and were not providing for themselves; the wife and mother managed the whole business of the house, made all purchases and repairs, and did everything about the house; the husband had nothing to do while she lived except to attend to the business of his office; she did a great deal of the house-work though they always kept one servant; she almost always milked the cow in preference to allowing the servant to milk her who did not understand her; and, to the question: Was she a careful mother? the answer was: Very much so; and to the question: As regards the education of her children? the answer was: Yes. The question now before us then is: What are the damages which the jury are authorized to give in proportion to the injury resulting from this death, to the parties respectively \u201cfor whom and for whose benefit such action has been brought,\u201d to be divided, after deducting certain costs amongst the parties in such shares as the judge or jury by their verdict shall direct.\nI cannot think the injury contemplated by the legislature ought to be confined to a pecuniary interest in a sense so limited as only to embrace loss of money or property, but that, as in the case of a husband in reference to the loss of a wife, so, in the case of children, the loss of a mother may involve many things which may be regarded as of a pecuniary character. The term pecuniary is not used by the legislature, and this, of itself, I think, affords a good reason for saying that that term should not be introduced in a narrow confined sense as applicable only to an immediate loss of money or property. In several of the United States of America, where the word pecuniary is introduced into a statute, it is not construed in a strict sense, and is held not to exclude the loss of maintenance or of the intellectual, moral and physical training which a mother only can give to her children. Therefore, a fortiori, the word should not be judicially introduced into our statute with a view to a narrow and strict construction.\nThe principles, so far as they are enunciated, in the English cases, in my opinion, support the views I have just expressed. In Pym v. The Great Northern Ry. Co.[8], Erle C.J., in delivering judgment, says:\u2014\nThe principle which governs these cases appears to us to be, to consider whether there was evidence of a reasonable probability of pecuniary benefit to the parties, if the death of the deceased had not occurred; land was it lost by reason of that death, caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of the defendants? If this were so, then there is a case which the judge must leave to the jury.\nAnd Pollock C.B., in Franklin v. South Eastern Ry. Co.[9], says:\u2014\nIn this case the plaintiff, as administrator of his son, sued (under the Statute 9 and 10 Vic., ch. 93) the defendants, by the negligence of whose servants his son\u2019s death was caused; and the question was if he was entitled to maintain the action, it being contended that it was necessary the plaintiff should show a damage, and that he had shown none.\nThe statute does not in terms say on what principle the action it gives is to be maintainable, nor on what principle the damages are to be assessed, and the only way to ascertain what it does, is to show what it does not mean. Now, it is clear that damage must be shown, for the jury are to \u201cgive such damages as they think proportioned to the injury.\u201d It has been held that these damages are not to be given as a solatium; but are to be given in reference to a pecuniary loss. That was so decided for the first time in banc in Blake v. The Midland Railway Co.[10] That case was tried before Parke B., who told the jury that the Lord Chief Baron had frequently ruled at nisi prius, and without objection, that the claim for damage must be founded on pecuniary loss, actual or expected, and that more injury to feelings could not be considered. It is also clear that the damages are not to be given merely in reference to the loss of a legal right, for they are to be distributed among relations only, and not to all individuals sustaining such a loss; and accordingly the practice has not been to ascertain what benefit could have been enforced by the claimants had the deceased lived and give damages limited thereby. If, then, the damages are not to be calculated on either of these principles, nothing remains except that they should be calculated in reference to a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit, as of right or otherwise, from the continuance of the life. Whether the plaintiff had any such reasonable expectation of benefit from the continuance of his son\u2019s life, and if so, to what extent, were the questions left in this case to the jury. The proper question then was left, if there was any evidence in support of the affirmative of it. We think there was. The plaintiff was old and getting infirm; the son was young, earning good wages, and apparently well disposed to assist his father, and, in fact, he had so assisted him to the value of 3s. 6d. a week. We do not say that it was necessary that actual benefit should have been derived, a reasonable expectation is enough, and such reasonable expectation might well exist, though from the father not being in need, the son had never done anything for him. On the other hand a jury certainly ought not to make a guess in the matter, but ought to be satisfied that there has been a loss of sensible and appreciable pecuniary benefit, which might have been reasonably expected from the continuance of the life.\nDalton v. The South Eastern Ry. Co.[11] and Franklin v. the same company[12] are to the same effect, and are commented upon in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania by Thomson J., in the case of The Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Adams[13] as follows:\nThe rule established in Dalton v. The South Eastern Ry. Co. and Franklin v. the same company is, that if there be a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage, the destruction of such expectation by negligence occasioning the death of the party from whom it arose will sustain the action. This is the settled rule in England for the right of recovery where the family relation exists in fact but not in law, so far as maintenance or support is concerned. It is high authority; it is a precedent we may safely follow. It seems to consort entirely with the highest dictates of reason and justice.\nAnd there are many cases in the United States directly in point on the question, among which the following may be noted:\nIn Tilley v. The Hudson River Railroad Company[14] Denio J. says:\nIt will not be essential to pass upon the other exceptions, except so far as may be useful for the purposes of another trial. We think it was not improper to allow the plaintiff to show the habitual occupation and employment of the deceased, for the purposes for which it was offered and received on the trial, namely, to show her general capacity and relation to her family. It is true that the testimony on that point was made to assume proportions beyond what seems to have been necessary for the purposes mentioned; but, it being competent, it was for the judge to determine the extent to which the examination might be carried.\nThe injury to the children of the deceased by the death of their mother was a legitimate ground of damages, and we do not agree with the defendant\u2019s counsel, that they ought to have been nominal The difficulty upon this point arises from the employment of the word pecuniary in the statute, but it was not used in a sense so limited as to confine it to the immediate loss of money or property; for if that were so, there is scarcely a case where any amount of damages could be recovered. It looks to prospective advantages of a pecuniary nature which have been cut off by the premature death of the person from whom they would have proceeded; and the word pecuniary was used in distinction to those injuries to the affections and sentiments which arise from the death of relatives, and which, though most painful and grievous to be borne, cannot be measured or recompensed by money. It excludes, also, those losses which result from the deprivation of the society and companionship of relatives, which are equally incapable of being defined by any recognized measure of value. But infant children sustain a loss from the death of their parents, and especially of their mother, of a different kind. She owes them the duty of nurture and of intellectual, moral and physical training, and of such instruction as can only proceed from a mother. This is, to say the least, as essential to their future well being in a worldly point of view, and to their success in life, as the instruction in letters and other branches of elementary education which they receive at the hands of other teachers who are employed for a pecuniary compensation.\nAgain in Tilley v. The Hudson River Railroad Company, Sedgwick\u2019s, leading Cases on Damages, p. 799, Hogeboom J. says:\u2014\nThe charge of the judge was explicit that the damages must be limited to pecuniary injuries; and he said that in estimating them they had a right to consider the loss (that is, the pecuniary loss) which the children had sustained in reference to their mother\u2019s nurture and instruction, and moral, physical and intellectual training. I think this does not imply that the children are necessarily and inevitably subjected to such a loss, but leaves it to the jury to determine whether any such loss has been in fact sustained, and if so, the amount of such loss. This is the fair scope and meaning of the charge, and if it was not sufficiently explicit, should have been made so by a direct request for such purpose. This understood, I regard it as unexceptionable. It is certainly possible, and not only so, but highly probable, that a mother\u2019s nurture, instruction and training, if judiciously administered, will operate favorably upon the worldly prospects and pecuniary interests of the child. The object of such training and education is not simply to prepare them for another world, but to act well their part in this, and to promote their temporal welfare. If they acquire health, knowledge, a sound bodily constitution, and ample intellectual development under the judicious training and discipline of a competent and careful mother, it is very likely to tell favorably upon their pecuniary interests. These are better, even in a pecuniary or mercenary point of view, than a feeble constitution, impaired health, intellectual ignorance and degradation and moral turpitude. To sustain the charge, it is enough that these circumstances might affect their pecuniary prospects. It was left to the jury to say whether in the given case they did so or not, and if so to what extent. * * *\nThe charge is supposed to have been particularly objectionable because it set before the jury moral training and culture as one of the sources of pecuniary benefit, which the jury were at liberty to consider. * * *\nBut I think it defensible on the grounds already advanced, that moral culture, like bodily health and mental development, improve and perfect the man and fit him for not only a more useful but a more prosperous career, for worldly success as well as social consideration. It is not essential to show that they necessarily result in direct pecuniary advantage; it is sufficient that they may do so; that they often do so; that it is possible and not improbable that such may be the result, and that, therefore, these items may be set forth and presented for the consideration and deliberation of the jury, to be disposed of as they shall deem to be just. I think the exception is not well taken if they may possibly result in pecuniary benefit and do not tend in a contrary direction. I concede these are quite general and to some extent loose and indefinite elements to enter into a safe and judicious estimate of actual pecuniary damage, but I am unable to find in the statute a restriction which shall confine it within narrower limits.\nIn the Pennsylvania Railway Co. v. Goodman[15], the following doctrine is laid down:\nDamages in a case like this, where the plaintiff is entitled to recover, should be given as a pecuniary compensation, the jury measuring the plaintiff\u2019s loss by a just estimate of the services and companionship of the wife of which he was deprived by this accident, that is, of their value in a pecuniary sense\u2014nothing is allowable for the suffering of the deceased nor for the wounded feelings of the plaintiff. Of course the jury will examine the testimony to aid them in ascertaining the damages, as well as every other point in the issue they are trying. But if damages are to be given at all, there is no reason why they should be nominal merely; they should be a just compensation for the value of the companionship and services lost to him by reason of this unfortunate collision.\nWhen charging the jury, the judge said:\nAfter commending this case to your most careful consideration, I have only to add, that if you should arrive at the conclusion that, according to the evidence in regard to the facts and the law as given to you by the court applicable to the facts which you find to be proved, the plaintiff is entitled to recover, you will enquire and assess the amount of damages to be awarded to him for the injury he has sustained. The law is, that the damages for such an injury are to be a pecuniary compensation, to be measured by the value of the loss of service and companionship sustained by the plaintiff. There is evidence before you in relation to the condition of the family of the plaintiff, his occupation and business, the age, health and character of his wife for industry and careful management These are all considerations that may enable you to form a correct judgment as to the amount of damages you should award the plaintiff if, according to the law and the evidence, he ought to recover.\nWhen delivering the judgment of the court, the judge said:\nLooking at the entire charge on the subject of damages, we think it clearly confined the damages to a pecuniary compensation for the loss of Mrs. Goodman\u2019s service. The court told the jury in express language that nothing is allowable for the suffering of the deceased, nor for the wounded feelings of the plaintiff. They said, also, that the plaintiff\u2019s loss was to be measured by a just estimate of the services and companionship of the wife. It is thought that this meant, by way of solace, for the loss of companionship. But all the judge said on this point made it evident he did not mean compensation by way of solace, and could not have been so understood by the jury. Companionship was evidently used to express the relation of the deceased in the character of the service she performed. He merely meant to say that the loss should be measured by the value of her services as a wife or companion. The form of expression, perhaps, was not the best selection of words, yet it certainly meant no more than that the pecuniary loss was to be measured by the nature of the service characterized as it was by the relation in which the parties stood to each other. Certainly the service of a wife is pecuniarily more valuable than that of a mere hireling. The frugality, industry, usefulness, attention, and tender solicitude of a wife and the mother of children, surely make her services greater than those of an ordinary servant, and therefore worth more. These elements are not to be excluded from the consideration of a jury in making a mere money estimate of value. Finding no error We can reach, the judgment must be affirmed.\nAnd in McIntyre v. New York Central R.R. Co.[16] in the judgment of Fullerton J., we find the following:\u2014\nWhen we consider the defect which the statute was designed to remedy, it was taking too narrow a view of the matter to say that the word pecuniary was used in so limited a sense as to embrace only the loss of money.\nSuch a limitation would, in many cases, render the statute a mere mockery, because it would afford no substantial aid in the very case in which it is most needed. The loss of the society of a deceased relative, the injury to the affections of those surviving, cannot be regarded as being within the remedy of the statute, because in no sense can the loss be regarded as pecuniary. But to children the loss of a parent involves the loss of many other things which this court has heretofore regarded as of a pecuniary character, and as the subjects of consideration by a jury in assessing the damages under the statute.\nI think the statute intended that where there was a substantial loss or injury there should be substantial relief. I cannot think that in giving compensation to a child for the loss of its parent the legislature intended so to limit the remedy as to deprive the child of compensation for the greatest injury it is possible to conceive a child can sustain, namely, in being deprived of the care, education and training of a mother, unless it could be shown that the loss was a pecuniary loss of so many dollars or so much property, a construction which, in ninety\u2011nine cases out of a hundred, would simply amount to saying that though there was an almost irreparable injury, affecting the present and future interests of the child, no compensation was to be awarded; in other words it would be, in effect, to deny to a child compensation for the death of a mother by negligence in almost every conceivable case.\nI think the term injury in the statute means substantial injury as opposed to mere sentimental, and I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that a husband or infant children may not, in the loss of a wife or mother, and did not in this case by such a loss, sustain a substantial injury and one for which it was the intention of the legislature to indemnify the husband and children. I am free to admit that the injury must not be sentimental or the damages a mere solatium, but must be capable of a pecuniary estimate; but I cannot think it must necessarily be a loss of so many dollars and cents capable of calculation. The injury must be substantial; the loss, a loss of a substantial pecuniary benefit, and the damages are not to be given to soothe the feelings of the husband or child, but are to be given for the substantial injury. It may be impossible to reduce such an injury to an exact pecuniary amount. In estimating the pecuniary value of such an injury courts and juries, will, no doubt, be governed by a consideration of the relative positions of the parties, such as the relative positions of husband and wife, the ages of the children, and the duties discharged by the mother, and in the consideration of all the surrounding circumstances will give such damages as will afford a reasonable pecuniary compensation for the substantial injury sustained. No doubt this rule may be somewhat loose and indefinite, but the rule as to many injuries for which the law gives compensation is not less so.\nI cannot, therefore, appreciate the force of the argu- ment as to the difficulty of fixing a pecuniary estimate upon the loss which the husband or child may sustain, as affording any reason against awarding him or them a just and reasonable compensation. There are abundant cases in our law where there is the same difficulty in reducing the injury to a pecuniary standard; in actions of slander for words actionable in themselves where special damage is not required to be proved; libel, breach of promise of marriage, and many others where substantial injury is complained of, but the amount of damage is left to the discretion and judgment of the jury; there are no judicial tables by which the amount of such damages can be ascertained, nor any judicial scales on which they can be weighed, yet pecuniary damages are, without difficulty awarded, assessed by the good sense and sound judgment of the jury, upon and by reference to, all the facts and circumstances of each particular case, and who are, as Lord Campbell expresses it, to take a reasonable view of the case and give a fair compensation.\nThere may, doubtless, be cases in which neither the husband nor children would be entitled to recover, because there may be cases where the wife and mother was incompetent, from physical infirmity, to render any services or benefit to her husband or children, but whom, on the other hand, might be a burthen to either or both; or there may be cases where the conduct and example of the mother may be baneful, and so far from being beneficial to the children may be positively injurious; it would seem obvious in such cases, that there being no substantial injury there could be no damage. But, on the other hand, let us suppose \u00e0 case of a household of children too young to work, practically managed and maintained by the energy, activity, frugality, intelligence and industry of a wife and mother; is the loss of such a wife and mother no substantial pecuniary injury to the husband and child? Or suppose the father of this family unable to work, or, if able to work, a poor man, dependent on his daily labor, with wages insufficient to enable him to employ a servant; who has a comfortable, happy home under the care and administration of such a wife; the wife is taken away; in what condition would that husband and those motherless children be left while their father was earning his scanty wage, the children neglected, the family meals uncooked, the household uncared for? Or take the case of a mother, a widow, with no means but her daily labor, who, by such daily labor, supports her children, clothes, educates, and brings them up in comparative comfort, who is killed by negligence and her children are thrown on the world, homeless, motherless and penniless, and yet, when all or any of them seek compensation for this grievous substantial injury inflicted on them by negligence, are they to be told that they have sustained no appreciable injury capable of pecuniary compensation, and that the injury they have sustained is purely sentimental? Truly, the daily suffering of the bereaved father and the motherless children would tell a very different tale.\nI must confess myself at a loss to understand how it can be said that the care and management of a household by an industrious, careful, frugal and intelligent woman, or the care and bringing up by a worthy loving mother of a family of children, is not a substantial benefit to the husband and children; or how it can be said that the loss of such a wife and mother is not a substantial injury but merely sentimental, is, to my mind, incomprehensible. And if the injury is substantial, the only mode the law could provide for reimbursing the husband and children is by a pecuniary compensation, and so, in my opinion, in the eye of the law, the injury is a pecuniary injury. But it is said that this may lead to investigations of a very disagreeable and undesirable character. That, in my opinion, must be left to the discretion of those putting forward claims involving such a result; but on a fair claim, such as the present, it would seem somewhat strange that the party at whose hands the claimants have suffered should be permitted to say they should not be allowed to recover because in some doubtful cases the investigation may be made unpleasant or inexpedient. To allow an objection such as this to prevail or have any weight whatever as a bar to the right to recover would, in my humble opinion, simply be to put pure sentiment in the way of law and justice.\nThe evidence in this case shows that the husband was receiving benefits and advantages from the services of his wife capable of pecuniary computation, and had such reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit from the continuance of such services by the continuance of the wife\u2019s life as would entitle him to damages under the statute; and, as to the children, I agree with Mr. Justice Armour that there is an education in religion, morals and virtue which, owing to the peculiar confidence inspired by the relationship of mother and child, can be imparted to the children by the mother alone; I think that such education is a benefit and advantage to the child and is capable of being estimated in money, and that the deprivation of a mother\u2019s superintendence and care of the children, occasioned by the death of the mother, is a pecuniary loss to the children. Although those children, or some of them, being still under age, may have passed from mere childhood, they were still in a position where a mother\u2019s care and supervision and moral, physical and intellectual training was, if possible, more important, more necessary, more valuable to them, and more difficult to be supplied, than in the case of very young children. Fournier J.\u2014I entirely concur with the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice and I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed. I entirely agree with the Chief Justice in this case.\nThe action was commenced under the statute passed by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, which is a copy of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, and it was in consequence of the death of the plaintiff\u2019s wife being caused by what was not contested to be, the defendant\u2019s negligence\nThe question is whether the husband of the deceased wife is entitled to bring this action in the capacity he has done, and whether the children are entitled to relief. I have looked at the statute very attentively and it allows a jury to award damages for injury caused by negligence under the circumstances in evidence in this case. The lady would have been entitled, had she survived the injury she sustained, to have brought, with her husband an action for damages. But it is said that Lord Campbell\u2019s Act was never intended to give to the survivor any right to recover damages except for a specific pecuniary loss\u2014that is, if she lived, the husband would recover damages for any loss he could show he had sustained, but if she died, he has no remedy except for technically a pecuniary loss.\nLooking at the law applicable to that subject at the time that statute was passed, we are to find out what the latter intended, and how far parties were to be compensated for loss sustained. In the case before us this lady was proved to be a dutiful wife and mother, industrious and hard working, even to the milking of the cows, and we are told that the loss of her services would not be a pecuniary, but a sentimental loss. Here is an actual substantial loss independent of any sentimental feeling. It is clear, to my mind, that nothing but absolute value could compensate for it. It is truly said that in England no sentimental damages can be recovered, and that there must be actual pecuniary loss. The statute does not provide for the recovery of damages for mere grief or loss of society, &c., to be ascertained solely, as must be the case, by the testimony of the interested party, for nobody else can measure or appreciate it. To that extent I admit the decisions go in England. And in this case we have no right to go beyond the decisions in England in limiting the operation of this statute. Under all the circumstances I think we are bound in this case to sustain the verdict of the jury awarding damages for a bona fide absolute loss, for I consider it is a pecuniary loss which the respondent and those for whom he is acting have sustained, which it takes money or money\u2019s worth to make up, and which can be ascertained by evidence as easily and effectually as may be done in cases of slander and many others.\nI am therefore of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Justice Gwynne, whose reasons for judgment I have had occasion to read.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action brought by William P. Lett as administrator of his deceased wife, who was killed by a collision on the defendants\u2019 railway, to recover damages from the defendants under the provisions of chapter 128 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario. The action is brought for the benefit of the husband himself, and of seven surviving children of the marriage, of the respective ages of 30, 22, 21, 19, 16, 14 and 11 years. At the trial it appeared that the deceased was possessed of a small income derived from real estate, of which her husband upon her death became tenant by the courtesy. The plaintiff testified that during the life of his wife she managed this property, and received the income without any interference upon his part, and that she always applied the income for the support of the family. The child aged 30 who was a married daughter, gave evidence that her mother was in the habit of assisting her with meat, butter, money and clothes to the value, as she believed, of about $100 per annum, but it is unnecessary to deal with this evidence as the jury allowed nothing to this daughter; the child aged 22, a son, who was in the receipt of a small income from an office held by him, gave evidence that he by contract with his mother, paid her ten dollars a month for his board, and that she was in the habit of making him little presents from time to time, which however were about balanced by money given by him to his mother in excess of the ten dollars per month agreed upon for his board; it is unnecessary also to deal with this evidence as the jury allowed nothing to this son either.\nThe husband made no claim, as by way of compensation for any loss alleged to have occurred in respect of the income which the wife possessed from her real estate, and the only evidence given in support of the husband\u2019s own claim for compensation for the injury alleged to be sustained by him, resulting from his wife\u2019s death was in the following language of the plaintiff:\u2014\nHis wife he said was at the time of her death 53 years of age and he 62. She managed the whole business of the house, made all purchases and repairs, and did everything about the house. He had nothing to do while she lived, except attend to the business of his office from which he received an income of sixteen hundred dollars per annum. They always kept one servant, but the wife did a good deal of the household work, she mostly always milked the cow in preference to allowing girls to milk her, who did not understand her. The child, aged 21, is a daughter whose education was complete at the time of the death of the mother, and she, he said, had been trained in domestic affairs by her mother, since whose death she \u201cruns the house.\u201d\nWhen asked to explain the pecuniary damage occasioned to him by his wife\u2019s death, he replied that he would sustain the loss of her management. In support of the right of the children to compensation for injury resulting to them from the death of their mother, the only evidence given, apart from that of the son and daughter, to whom the jury allowed nothing, was that of the plaintiff, who, in reply to a question, whether the deceased was a careful mother, said that she was very much so. And upon the question being repeated in the form, whether she was a careful mother as regards the education of her children? he answered yes.\nUpon this evidence the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff with $5,800 damages, distributed as follows:\u2014To the plaintiff himself, $1,500; to the child aged 21, a daughter, $600; to the child aged 19, a son, $400; to the one aged 16, a son, $800; to the child aged 14, a daughter, $1,200; and to the child aged 11, a son, $1,300. Upon a rule being obtained in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario to set aside this verdict and for a new trial upon the grounds, among others, that the verdict was against law and evidence and the weight of evidence, and upon the ground that no cause of action was established, there being no pecuniary loss established, or that there was no right to recover on behalf of the children, as the death of Mrs. Lett was no pecuniary injury to the children, even if it was established to be to her husband, and on the ground that the damages were excessive, the majority of that court being of opinion that there was no evidence proper to be submitted to a jury of any injury resulting from the death of Mrs. Lett within the meaning of the 128th chapter of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, made the rule absolute for entering a non-suit. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, this rule was set aside and the rule nisi for the new trial discharged with costs, thus leaving the verdict of the jury to stand. It is from this judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the present appeal is taken, and the question presented to us by it, is whether or not the evidence given of the sustaining by the persons, or any of the persons for whose benefit the verdict has been rendered, of injury resulting from the death of the deceased was of such a nature as that the verdict rendered for the plaintiff can be sustained in whole or in part, within the true meaning of chapter 128 of the Statutes of Ontario.\nThis statute in so far as the point in question is affected, is identical in its provisions with the Imperial Statute 9 and 10 Vic., ch. 93, commonly called Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. The rule to be collected from the decisions in the English courts, I think, is that damages are not recoverable by a husband upon the ground merely of his being deprived of his wife; or per quod consortium amisit, nor by children, upon the ground merely of their being deprived of their mother; but that the loss (by the death) of all those benefits which being procurable with money are capable of pecuniary estimate, and which the parties in whose behalf the action is given by the statute had actually enjoyed, and but for the death, might have reasonably expected to continue to enjoy; and the disappointment by the death of the reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit in the event of the continuance of the life of the deceased, are injuries which may be compensated with damages recovered in an action under the statute.\nThe circumstances under which parties may recover depend, as it appears to me, much upon the condition in life of the parties claiming and the nature of the benefit or services, the loss of which, resulting from the death, constitutes the injury in respect of which compensation is claimed. Evidence which would be sufficient to warrant a recovery in the case of parties in a humble condition of life, might be quite insufficient and inappropriate in the case of parties in wealthy, or even in comfortable circumstances; for example the loss of his wife by a poor man having a family depending for their support upon his manual labor and who is compelled of necessity to depend solely upon his wife for the management of his little household affairs and the care of his children, may, perhaps, be said to be a proper subject of compensation in money, to enable him to supply, albeit imperfectly by hired assistance, the necessary services which his wife during her life had rendered, while a claim by a wealthy man, or by a man in comfortable pecuniary circumstances, for the loss of his wife, although such wife had during her life taken such control and management of her household affairs and such care of her children as a good wife and mother, having regard to her husband\u2019s circumstances, might naturally be expected to take, could not reasonably be entertained. So likewise in the case of parents of good education but of narrow means, wholly insufficient to pay for a good, liberal education for their children, but who, being themselves competent to give such an education; had assumed the duty, the loss to the children of such parents, or of such a parent, may be said to be as susceptible of pecuniary estimate as would be the loss of a parent having in his life\u2011time abundant means to procure the education of his children, which means terminated with his life. Of this latter nature was the case of Pym v. The Great Northern Railway[17], where the points decided and the rationale of the decision are thus stated:\nAs the benefit of education and the enjoyment of the greater com- forts and conveniences of life depend on the possession of pecuniary means, to procure them the loss of those advantages is one which is capable of being estimated in money; in other words, is a pecuniary loss, and therefore the loss of such advantages arising from the death of a father whose income ceases with his life is an injury in respect of which an action can be maintained on the statute. A fortiori the loss of a pecuniary provision which fails to be made, owing to the premature death of a person by whom such provision1 would have been made had he lived, is clearly a pecuniary loss for which compensation may be claimed.\nThe English cases beyond doubt establish that if there be a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage, the extinction of such expectation by negligence occasioning the death of the party from whom the expectation arose will sustain the action. Some of the American courts, it must be admitted, have gone far beyond the decisions in the English courts. In Pennsylvania Road Co. v. Goodman[18] the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania held, that a husband was entitled to recover by way of compensation for the loss of his wife, damages measured by the value of her services as a wife or companion. If this be sound law, there cannot well be conceived any case of an action by a husband for the loss of his wife not resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff upon the bare evidence of the death having been caused by the act or default of the defendant, such a decision seems to amount to one that the action lies\u2014per quod consortium amisit\u2014I cannot concur in this view. The cases on the contrary in which a husband can obtain damages for the loss of the services rendered by a wife are, in my judgment, very exceptional, and each case must be governed by its own peculiar circumstances; the condition in life of the husband and the evidence of the nature of the particular service, the loss of which is made the subject of the claim. In Tilley v. H.R.R. Co.[19] a majority of the Court of Appeals in the State of New York held, that those losses which result from the deprivation of the society and companionship of relatives, as being incapable of being defined by any recognized measure of value are excluded, and are not therefore the subject of compensation in damages under their statute, which is similar in substance to ours, but that in an action brought to recover damages on behalf of children for injury occasioned to them by the death of a mother, the jury in estimating damages had a right to consider the nurture, instruction and the physical, moral and intellectual training which they might have received from their mother had she continued to live, and that they were not restricted by the arrival of the children at their majority. From a reference to the report this does not appear to me to be laid down as an abstract proposition of law applicable in every case, but as having reference to the particular evidence given in that case as to what the mother had been in the habit of doing in her life time. The learned judge who read the judgment of the majority of the court there says:\nIf they (the jury) are satisfied from the history of the family or the intrinsic probabilities that damages were sustained by the loss of bodily care or intellectual culture or moral training which the mother had before supplied, they are at liberty to allow for it.\nAnd again he says:\nThat which had been already given and of which the children had already reaped the benefit, could not be increased by the continued life of the parent, nor curtailed by her sudden death\u2014the result had been already realized, but her sudden and wrongful removal was the withdrawal, the permanent and perpetual withdrawal, of a moral and intellectual fund from which the children were constantly deriving pecuniary aliment and support, and it is the withdrawal which formed the basis of the whole allowance of any damage arising from this source.\nHaving regard to the evidence in that case in so far as it appears in the report, I am not prepared upon a similar case arising under our statute to adopt the judgment of the majority of the court as above announced. Pecuniary compensation proportionate to an injury done to a person by such person being deprived of anything should be the value expressed in money of the thing of which they have been deprived. What in the supposed case a child is deprived of by the loss of his or her mother, is the possibility of receiving from the mother that care in sickness in case the child should be afflicted with sickness, that a mother naturally would give, and only a mother can give, and of that motherly advice and moral instruction which it might naturally be expected that, and it is therefore probable that, a mother would take the opportunity of giving to her child. There is no standard, as it appears to me by which a pecuniary value could be set upon the probability of the necessity for such maternal care in sickness arising or upon such maternal care in case the opportunity for its display should arise, nor upon such material advice and moral instruction in case they should be given, nor does the loss of such maternal care and advice constitute, in my opinion, such a disappointment of a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage as is cognizable under the statute. These benefits which spring from parental love and affection are neither procured nor procurable with money, and are therefore insusceptible of having a pecuniary value attached to them, and their loss, therefore, cannot be estimated in money. To throw a case into a jury box, with a charge that the action lies on proof of death by negligence of the defendants, and that it rests with the jury to measure the value of the loss to a child of the possibility of benefit of which it is deprived by the death of its mother, without any standard existing by which the estimate can be made, could not fail to result in a verdict for the plaintiff in every case with damages against defendants, by way merely of punishing them for their having caused the death, a result which cannot have been within the con- templation of the statute, which only authorizes damages to be given proportionate to the injury resulting from the death to the parties on whose behalf the action is brought. In the case before us the only evidence in support of the verdict, in so far as it is in favor of the children, is that the deceased was a careful mother as regards the education of her children, but this carefulness is quite consistent with her not having herself taken any part in imparting their education to them. The plaintiff admitted that the education of the daughter who was 21 years of age was completed at the time of the death of the deceased, at which time also the younger children appear to have been going to school for their education; but it was contended that whether the education of any of them had or not been completed, or whether any of them had arrived at full age was of no importance, for that this right to recover damages rested wholly upon their having been deprived by their mother\u2019s death of the possibility of their receiving that maternal care in case of sickness, and that good advice and moral instruction which it was naturally and reasonably to be expected that a good and virtuous mother would, if she had lived, have given to her children. In my judgment there is no standard by which a pecuniary estimate can be made of the injury resulting to the children from their being deprived of the possibility of their receiving such maternal care and advice, and that therefore such an injury is not cognizable under our statute. If the loss of maternal advice be a ground for compensation that would open enquiries as to the nature, the quality and value, of the advice, of which having been given there should be some evidence. This, in my opinion, never could have been contemplated by the statute, and no defendant could venture to enquire into such particulars without exposing himself to heavy damages for his temerity. At the trial there was, I think, some evidence given having relation to an injury resulting to the married daughter which could not have been withheld from the jury, for upon her behalf it was said that she was in the habit of receiving annually pecuniary assistance from her mother, which may have come out of the income which her mother derived from her real estate, but as this estate has devolved upon the father for his life, and as the daughter is, perhaps, as likely to receive from him the same benefit she was accustomed to receive from her mother, she seems, and with reason I doubt not, to be content with the verdict of the jury, which allows her nothing. She has made no complaint against that verdict, and is no party to the question before us, which, in so far as the children are concerned, is whether the verdict in favor of those of them in whose favor it has been rendered can be sustained, and I am of opinion it cannot, and that there was no evidence given which warrants a verdict in their favor. In support of the verdict, in so far as the amount awarded to the husband of the deceased is concerned, the only evidence offered was that of the husband himself, who attributes the injury resulting to him to the loss of the management of his affairs by his wife, and the statement that she \u201cmostly always milked the cow in preference to allowing girls to milk her who did not understand her.\u201d In what the pecuniary injury to the husband consists in respect of this milking of the cow does not appear. It is not suggested that the deceased milked the cow for the purpose of relieving, or that she did thereby in fact relieve, her husband from any expense whatever. It is not pretended that the plaintiff derived any pecuniary benefit from the circumstance of the cow having been milked by the deceased, which he has lost by her death, nor that since her death he has been put to any greater expense in the matter than he was put to during her life. He cannot, therefore, recover any sum by way of compensation in damages in respect of this particular item. There remains to be considered only the ground upon which the plaintiff in his evidence rested his claim for compensation for the injury resulting to himself personally, namely, the loss of her management of his household affairs. Whether in an action of this description there be anything peculiar in the condition in life of the parties, or whether there be anything exceptional in the nature of the services rendered by a wife to her husband, in respect of the loss of which by her death damages are claimed on behalf of the husband, are, no doubt, questions for the jury; but if there be not anything in the evidence disclosing anything peculiar or exceptional in those particulars, there can be nothing to submit to the jury unless the mere proof that the defendants caused the death of the wife be sufficient to entitle the husband to compensation in damages for injury resulting to him from her death; for the control and management of her husband\u2019s household affairs by a wife is an incident to her character as wife, and is part of the duty which, as a wife, she assumes and is, in fact, the management of her own affairs as much as of his\u2014their joint affairs,\u2014and every husband when he loses his wife by death loses the benefit of having his household affairs managed by his wife; such management is an incident to the consortium, and if the loss of the consortium be not sufficient to entitle him to compensation, the loss of that which is an incident to the consortium cannot. There is nothing in the evidence in the present case which distinguishes it from the case of damages sought to be recovered merely upon the ground of the loss of consortium, and as that is not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to damages, the verdict rendered in his favor cannot I think be sustained. It is not suggested that any evidence has been withheld which might have been given or that there is any further evidence which could be given upon another trial, nor, if there be any such evidence, has any explanation been offered for its not having been given, the only question appears to be whether or not the rule to enter a non-suit, which was granted by the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the Supreme Court of Justice for Ontario, should be maintained, the rule nisi having only asked for a new trial. The Ontario courts have ever since the passing of 37 Vic., ch. 7, s. 33, now sec. 283 of ch. 50 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, exercised the jurisdiction upon the argument of a rule nisi for a new trial, of granting a rule to enter a non-suit when the court was of opinion that the evidence given did not warrant any verdict in favor of the plaintiff; the section under consideration provides that\nEvery verdict shall be considered by the court, in all motions affecting the same, as if leave had been reserved at the trial to move in any manner respecting the verdict and in like manner as if the assent of parties had been expressly given for that purpose.\nThis seems to be the exercise of a wholesome jurisdiction when there is no evidence given sufficient to sustain a verdict for the plaintiff for any amount, and as for the reasons already given, I am of opinion that the verdict for the plaintiff cannot be sustained, the appeal should be allowed, and the rule to enter a non-suit reinstated.\nAppeal dismissed with costs[20].\nSolicitors for appellants: Pinhey, Christie & Christie.\nSolicitors for respondent: O\u2019Gara & Remon.\n[1] 11 Ont.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE CHANCERY DIVISION OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE FOR ON CARIO.\nDeed\u2014Construction of-Estoppel\u2014Misrepresentation.\nG. M., a man of education, well acquainted with commercial business, executed a bond to pay certain sums of money, in certain events,` to the Merchants' Bank of Canada. By an agreement, bearing even date with the bond, it was recited inter alia . that in consideration of a mortgage granted to the bank by M. Bros. & Co., the bank had agreed to make further advances to M. Bros. & Co., joint obligors with G. M., and parties to the agreement, and that the agreement was executed to secure the bank in case there should be any deficiency in the assets of the firm, or in the value of the property comprised in said mortgage, and to secure the bank from ultimate loss. The agreement contained also a proviso that if the firm should well and truly pay their indebtedness, then the bond and agreement should become wholly void. In a suit brought upon the said agreement against G. M., alleging a deficiency in the assets of the firm and indebtedness to the bank, G. M. pleaded that the agreement had been executed by him on representation made to him by one of his co-obligors that it was to secure the bank against any loss which might arise by reason of the refraining from the registration of the mortgage, or by reason of any over valuation of the property embraced in the mortgage, and not otherwise. The bank, the plaintiffs, made no representations whatever to the defendants.\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the Court below, Gwynne, .J., dissenting), that G. M. was bound by the execution of the documents, and was liable upon them according to their tenor and effect.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Ferguson, J., sitting as a judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario[1].\nLeave to appeal direct to the Supreme Court of Canada, without any intermediate appeal being first had to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, was given by Gwynne, J., under sec. 6 of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879, on the ground that the Court of Appeal for Ontario would be bound by the case of Cameron v. Kerr[2], whereas the appellant sought to avoid the effect of that decision in this action.\nThe facts of the case, as set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson in the court below, are as follows :\n\"On and prior to the 26th day of January, 1874, the commercial firm, Moffatt Bros. & Co., being composed of Lewis Moffatt, Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt and Lewis Henry Moffatt, were largely indebted to the plaintiffs for advances made, and the plaintiffs held the commercial paper of the customers of the firm for such advances, this being the kind of paper upon which the advances had been made ; and the firm then applied to the plaintiffs for additional advances for a limited period, and it was agreed that such additional advances should be made upon the plaintiffs receiving security for the indebtedness of the firm, which was $153,011. In pursuance of this agreement, a mortgage upon certain lands and premises was executed by the members of the firm. The proviso in the mortgage.so far as material here was as follows Provided this mortgage to be void on payment of $153,011 in nine months from the date hereof (the 26th January, 1874), and all bills of exchange, promissory notes, drafts and other paper on which the firm were liable to the plaintiffs on the 31st day of December, 1873, together with all renewals, substitutions and alterations thereof, and all indebtedness of the firm to the plaintiffs in respect of the same, and it was in the proviso stated that the mortgage was. intended to be a continuing security to the plaintiffs for the amount, notwithstanding any change in the membership of the firm either by death, retirement therefrom, or addition thereto, and that the mortgage was also to secure and cover any sum due, or to become due, in respect of interest, commission upon the notes or renewals, or other commercial paper. This mortgage was in favor of Archibald Cameron, who was a trustee for the plaintiffs.\n\"On the same day (the 26th January,1874) an agreement was executed between Lewis Moffatt of the first part, Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt of the second part, the defendant of the third part, and the plaintiffs of the fourth part. This agreement recited the facts of the indebtedness, that the plaintiffs had refused to make further advances to the firm, and had threatened to close the account and, compel immediate payment thereof, unless they received additional security for the advances, and that the mortgage bearing even date with the agreement had been executed.\n\"The agreement further recited that in consideration of the security, the plaintiffs had agreed to make further advances to the firm, and that the agreement was executed to secure the plaintiffs in case there should be any deficiency in the assets of the firm, or in the value of the property comprised in the mortgage, and to secure the plaintiffs from ultimate loss, and contained a covenant by the parties thereto of the first and second. parts, that the capital of the party of the second part, then invested in and forming part of the assets of the firm, should not be withdrawn therefrom until the mortgage should be fully paid and satisfied, unless with the consent of the plaintiffs. Also a covenant by the parties to the agreement of the first, second and third parts in consideration of the premises, and of the acceptance by the plaintiffs of the mortgage and agreement to pay to the plaintiffs, and the covenantors thereby declare themselves jointly and severally indebted to the plaintiffs, their successors and assigns in the sum of ten thousand dollars, to be well and truly paid in nine months from the date of the agreement, as secured by a money bond bearing even date therewith. The agreement also contained a proviso, that if the party of the second part thereto should not withdraw his capital from the firm until the indebtedness of the firm to the plaintiffs shou;d be paid and satisfied, and that if the firm should well and truly. pay their indebtedness to the plaintiff's, then the bond and agreement should become wholly void. The agreement also provided that the plaintiff should be at liberty to deal with the firm or their successors, and to make such business , arrangements as they might deem just and proper, and that nothing thereby done should alter, impair, diminish or render void the liability of the parties to the mortgage bond and agreement, and that the doctrines of law and equity in favour of a surety should not apply to the prejudice of the plaintiffs in consequence of any act done, committed or suffered by them, unless the parties or some one of them shou'd have previously notified the plaintiffs of their objection thereto.\n\"One the same day a money bond in the penal sum of $20,000 in favour of the plaintiffs was executed by Lewis Moffatt, Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt and the defendant. The condition of the bond was that if the obligors and each of their heirs should jointly and severally well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the plaintiffs, their successors and assigns, the just and full sum of $ 10,000 in nine months from the date thereof without any deduction, &c., then the bond to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\n\"The plaintiffs bring this suit upon the said agreement and bond against George Moffatt as a sole defendant, alleging that the indebtedness of the firm Moffatt Bros. & Co., to them the plaintiffs, continued from the date of the time of the giving of the securities as aforesaid to the time of an assignment in insolvency of the said firm \"on the 12th day of August, 1875 ; and that it has continued to a large extent thence hitherto, and the plaintiffs allege and charge that the said firm did not well and truly pay their indebtedness to the plaintiffs, and that there is a deficiency in the assets of the firm and in the value of the property mortgaged to the extent of $50,000; and that they, the plaintiffs, are entitled to be paid the sum of $10,000 and interest by the Defendant George Moffatt, and ask that it may be declare that the sum of $10,000 is due and payable by the defendant under and by virtue of the said agreement and bond, and that the defendant may be ordered toll pay the same and interest and the costs of this suit.\n\"The defendant, in his defence, says that shortly before the execution of the documents that have been before mentioned, he was informed by Lewis Moffatt that at the request of the plaintiffs he had agreed to execute a mortgage upon certain real estate to secure the then indebtedness of the firm to the plaintiffs, and that the property to be comprised in the mortgage had been by him represented to the plaintiffs as being of the value of $50,000 ; and that he was desirous that the execution of this mortgage should not become known through. the registration thereof, and so impair the credit of the firm, and that he and the plaintiffs had agreed that they should refrain from registering the mortgage, and also from having a valuation made of the property; and that he Lewis Moffatt on the same occasion stated that the plaintiffs were willing to agree to the foregoing-provided he could give them security against any loss which might arise by reason of the refraining from the registration of the mortgage or by reason of any overvaluation of the property embraced in the mortgage, and that upon these representations, he, the defendant, consented to become surety for such purposes and not otherwise; and that Lewis Moffatt thereupon presented certain documents to him the defendant for execution\u2014at the same time informing him that they had been prepared in accordance with the understanding before mentioned as to the nature and extent of the intended suretyship by his solicitors, who were also the solicitors for the plaintiffs, and that relying on the assurance of the said Lewis Moffatt, and the said solicitors through him, that the documents correctly expressed, and ,were strictly in accordance with the nature and ex- tent of the suretyship which he had agreed to enter into, he executed the documents without reading them 3, or examining their contents, and without consulting a legal adviser or obtaining advice respecting them ; and that if he, the defendant, had known that the tenor and effect of the documents were in any respect different from, or could be construed to increase the liability that he had as aforesaid consented to assume, he would not have executed them. The defendant also says that he never agreed to become in any way liable as surety for any deficiency in the assets of the said firm, and that the documents sued on cannot, nor can either of them be held to so operate. He also says that the mortgage was agreed to be given and was intended to, secure the plaintiffs against any loss, and none other\u2014that they might sustain upon the commercial paper of the customers of the said firm held by the plaintiffs on the 31st day of December,1873 ; and the then existing indebtedness of the said firm to the plaintiffs as 'represented by the said commercial paper, and all renewals, alterations or substitutions thereof ; and that the said indebtedness so secured had long before this suit been extinguished and ceased to exist, and this the defendant says is an effectual bar to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendant contends that the mortgage was not a continuing security for any amount of indebtedness up to the of $153,011; but only a continuing security for the due payment of the bills and promissory notes in existence and under discount on the 31st day of December, 1873 ; and any renewals, alterations and substitutions of the same, and that he cannot be made liable as surety otherwise, and he alleges that all such bills and notes had been paid; and satisfied before this suit.\n\"The defence also alleges that large portions of the said $158,011 were not at the time, the 81st December, 1873, debts contracted to the plaintiffs, nor for which the plaintiffs could legally take and hold the mortgage as additional security, and that as to debts not con-1 tracted at the time of the giving of the mortgage, and all renewals and substitutions therefor, the mortgage was and is null and void; and the defendant sets up and relies upon the plaintiffs' charter and the General Banking Acts.\n\"The defendant pleaded by way of supplemental answer, stating the transactions somewhat, but not I think materially differently, and in this supplemental answer he alleges that the agreement and bond sued upon were given for the purpose of guaranteeing and securing the plaintiffs that the property contained in and covered by the mortgage was not overvalued on the estimate of value placed upon it by the firm, and that the same was of the value of $50,000; and for no other purpose, and that the bond and agreement so far as they purport to contain any further or other guarantee do not express the true intention, object and agreement of the parties ; and that they were executed by mutual mistake, and that the property was of the value of $50,000 ; and that no breach of the agreement and bond occurred, and the defendant asks that these documents should be rectified so as to express the true agreement between the parties to them. At the close of the evidence, however, defendant's counsel by leave amended the supplemental answer by striking out the 7th and 8th paragraphs of it so as to abandon any claim to have the document reformed.\"\nThe judgment appealed from was rendered on the 26th April, 1883, and was in favor of the respondents for the full amount payable under the bond, $10,000, and interest from the date of the commencement of the action, with costs. Dalton McCarthy, Q. C., and J. H Ferguson for appellants:\nUnder the agreement, the appellant's liability was limited to the indebtedness of the firm at the time of the execution of the agreement, and that indebtedness has long been extinguished. It was never suggested or intended that the mortgage was to be a continuing security for anything more than the due payment of bills and promissory notes in existence, and under discount at the date of the agreement, and any renewals, alterations and substitutions of the same, and he cannot be made liable as surety otherwise. If the agreement and bond are drawn to express a wholly different contract from what was intended, such as to make the appellant liable to the respondents for any deficiencies in the assets of the firm of Moffatt & Co., or that he was to save the bank from ultimate loss on its transactions with that firm, prima facie the agreement and bond on the evidence adduced in the case are not the deeds of the appellant, and are not binding upon him. See Thoroughgoods' Case[3], Comyn's Digest[4], Edwards v. Brown[5], Simmons v. G. W. R. Coy.[6], Kennedy v. Greene[7], Vorley v. Cooke[8].\nThe present is not a case where the interest of the third party can intervene. It is a question between the original parties alone, and there has been no negligence here which the plaintiffs can avail themselves of against the defendant. No estoppel can arise in such a case. See Swan v. North British A. Co.[9].\nBut even if the appellant is bound by the documents in their present form, we submit that the bond as controlled by the explanatory agreement must be held to be only collateral, and his liability thereon can extend only to such of the indebtedness of the firm as existed at the date of the agreement and as was secured by the mortgage; and the evidence shows that all the paper held by the bank at the time of the agreement had been paid and retired, and that the respondents held no renewals or substitutions thereof secured by the mortgage when this suit was brought. Corley v. Lord Stafford[10], Royal Canadian Bank v. Cummer and Mason[11].\nC. Robinson, Q. C., and J. F. Smith with him for respondents:\nThe appellant and all the parties to these documents were intelligent men of business, and merchants of long standing The appellant was in addition a director of various corporations, and knew thoroughly what he was about, and no one ever attempted to mislead him. He says he did not read the documents, but he evidently had read the guarantee in its original shape, when the documents sued on were presented to him for execution, and had declined to execute it. He afterwards executed it in its altered form on or about 5th February, 1874, subsequent to the execution of the other documents.\nOn the other hand, the respondents never had any doubt as to what security they required for the continuance of the account ; and although at this distance of time it is not possible to recall what took place verbally during the negotiations, the various letters in the case in connection with the documents leave no doubt as to what the respondents intended to have as security, what they believed they got, and what they have since acted and relied on, viz., security from ultimate loss in case there should be any deficiency in the assets of the firm. The counsel relied on the cases cited in the judgment of Ferguson, J., in the court below[12], and particularly on Campbell, v. Edwards[13]; Foster v. McKinnon[14]; Dominion Bank v. Blair[15] ; Hunter v. Walters[16].\nIt is said that the indebtedness under the mortgage in the pleadings mentioned has been extinguished and paid off. This question was raised in an action on the mortgage, in the suit of Cameron v. Kerr, and was decided by Blake, V. C., in favor of the ]Bank ; and on being carried to the Court of Appeal for Ontario it was again decided in favor of the respondents by an unanimous judgment of that court[17]. The respondents rely on that case and the authorities there cited, as well as on the expressed intention of the parties in the instruments, and on the evidence; and also on the letters of Mr. Lewis Moffatt. The evidence on this point in this action does not materially differ from that in the case last cited. The object of the taking of the securities was to protect the respondents from ultimate loss on the account, which had grown too large, and had become weak. This account consisted of commercial paper, discounted for the firm, and endorsed by them. On the 31st December, 1873, the date fixed by the parties, it amounted to $153,011, and that amount was made payable in nine months. From that date to the insolvency of the firm (11th August, 1875) the amount of their indebtedness to the bank, although it sometimes increased, never fell below $140,000. This account is kept in banks in a book called the \"Liability or Discount Ledger,\" and is altogether distinct from the ordinary \" Deposit Ledger,\" which is entirely a record of cash transactions. By the contention of the appellant, the debt was all paid off by the time the mortgage was executed. At the time of the insolvency, the indebtedness of the firm amounted to a much larger sum than the amount secured. The entries in the , Liability Ledger of the respondents show this. As to the method of keeping the accounts: see The City Discount Co. (Limited) v. McLean[18]; Fenton v. Blackwood[19], and Cameron v. Kerr[20].\nDalton McCarthy, Q. C., in reply, cited The Commercial Bank v. The Bank of Upper Canada[21].\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nIn no sense, in my opinion, can Lewis Moffatt be said to have been the agent or representative of the bank in obtaining the defendant's signature to the bond and agreement, nor should the defendant have dealt with or treated him as such ; and if Lewis Moffatt made false representations as to the contents of the bond and agreement, and, if the defendant, a man of business, or, as Mr. Justice Ferguson expresses it, a gentleman of education and well accustomed to commercial business, having been for many years a member of a large and prominent commercial firm, who carried on their business in Montreal, and having been a director in several business corporations for several years, chose, well knowing, as he must have done, the relative positions of Lewis Moffatt and the bank to one another, to act on such representations, and, without reading the bond and agreement, or satisfying himself as to what the contents really were, when he could easily have done so, to execute the same and permit Lewis Moffatt to deal with such bond and agreement so executed by delivering the same to the bank to be acted upon, and they, there being no fraud or misrepresentation on their part, innocently acted upon the faith of the bond and agreement being- valid, the defendant is estopped as between himself and the bank so acting. If the defendant chose to rely on the understanding and belief which he says he derived from Lewis Moffatt, no representations having been made to him on the part of the plaintiffs, as he says, that he is aware of, and did not choose to read the document, or make other enquiries as to its contents, he has only himself to blame.\nMr. Justice Ferguson says[22]:\u2014\nJackson Rae, who was the plaintiffs' manager at Montreal, and whose evidence was also taken under a commission, says : \" The special conditions referred to in my last answer consisted of the requirement of collateral security of a satisfactory character, and the bank preferred to exact personal security.\" This, however, the firm could not find, but offered instead mortgages covering real estate in the city of Toronto and elsewhere. After much negotiation, the bank at length consented, provided it could be offered in such a shape and of such value as would be satisfactory. The pro, posed security when defined, was valued by the firm at $75,000 or over, and the firm urged the bank to waive a formal valuation by some independent party, and as an inducement offered to give the bank personal security td the extent of $10,000, to protect it from loss consequent upon over estimate. Subsequently it was further urged upon the bank to waive registration of the mortgage deeds, and that personal security to the amount of $50,000 would be furnished to secure the bank against any injury that might be suffered in consequence of the non-registration. After much negotiation, it was ultimately agreed that if satisfactory personal security were given for the said $50,000, to cover non-registration, and to the extent of $10,000 to cover any possible ultimate loss there might be on the account, the bank would comply with their request to waive registration and special valuation. The evidence of Mr. Rae, the solicitor, who acted for the plaintiffs, is very positive as to the arrangement being in fact as it is stated in the agreement. He appears to have no doubt on the subject, his letter of the 30th of December, 1873, to the plaintiff; then manager at Montreal, speaks of the $10,000 as being in addition to the other security. The recollection of Mr. Lewis Moffatt appeared to be very imperfect regarding many of the particulars of the transaction. Both he and the defendant appear to be under a mistake as to the amount of the valuation of the property embraced in the mortgage, about which so much was said, and he had entirely forgotten that he had taken the documents to Montreal at the time of the execution. I think it a fair conclusion upon the evidence, and that I must find that the transaction or: arrangement made between him and the plaintiffs, was stated in the documents. The bank - the plaintiffs\u2014did not make any representation whatever to the defendant. Mr. Lewis Moffatt was not the agent for the plaintiffs, I think, as was contended : his representations were not, I think, in any sense, representations of the plaintiffs ; it is not shown that any representation was made to the defendant after the 21st of December, 1873, which was nearly a month before the execution of the papers ; none was made to him at the time of their execution, and I am of opinion that the weight of authority binding upon me shows that the defendant by executing the documents sued on, under the circumstances disclosed in the case, became liable upon them according to their tenor and effect.\nIn this Conclusion I concur; and, under these circumstances, I think, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Ferguson in his judgment.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI entertain exactly the same view. A gentleman of intelligence and education, accustomed to mercantile transactions has a document placed before him, and he signs it. The plaintiffs having acted upon it, the defendant is, in my opinion, answerable for the continued indebtedness of the firm with which the agreement was made, and there is evidence that the firm was really indebted (upon going into insolvency) to an amount larger than the agreement, for which this was the security. Under the circumstances in connection with this bond, if the party could get clear of the effect of an obligation of that character, a solemn document involving thousand of dollars, if he signs it under a misapprehension, I do not know where the end would be, from the facilities which would be afforded to parties to avoid the payment of liabilities, or to avoid their liability for the enforcement of documents which they executed. I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs, and the judgment of the court below affirmed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe evidence appears to me to establish beyond all doubt that the utmost extent `of the intention of the bank authorities in procuring the preparation and execution of the bond sued upon, was that it should operate, when executed, only as a guarantee to the extent of $10,000 for payment of the balance, if any, which, upon taking a final account of the commercial paper, which at the time of the execution of the bond represented the debt for which the mortgage was given, and of all notes, drafts, &c., in renewal of or which might be, given in substitution for any of such commercial paper, as the lands conveyed by the mortgage executed by Messrs. Moffatt Brothers & Co. at the same time should be insufficient to pay; and that this is the extent of the appellants liability upon the bond is, in my opinion, the proper construction to be put upon it, in view of all the surrounding circumstances. The bank were advised that the mortgage o could not be taken to secure future advances, and they were willing, upon being secured the then existing debt of Moffatt Brothers & Co., to make them advances to the amount of thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars upon commercial paper of theirs for a limited period of nine months. The mortgage was, therefore, designedly limited to securing the then existing debt, and the design of the bond was to guarantee to the extent of ten thousand dollars, any balance which might remain unpaid after realizing upon the commercial paper representing the debt, and upon the mortgaged lands. The security of the then existing debt is the object of all the instruments executed simultaneously with the mortgage. True, it is that the promise upon the part of the bank (upon the then existing debt being secured as it was by those instruments) to make further advances to Messrs. Moffatt Brothers & Co. upon further commercial paper to be furnished by them is recited, but all liability under the instruments, of the parties executing them, is limited to the amount of the then existing debt as set out in the mortgage, and represented by the commercial paper of Moffatt Brothers & Co. then held by the bank. By the mortgage which is executed by Messrs. Moffatt Brothers & Co., that is to say, by Lewis Moffatt, Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt and Lewis Henry Moffatt, as mortgagors, after reciting that the mortgagors are indebted to the Merchants Bank for debts contracted by the said mortgagors to ,the said bank in the course of banking, and for which the said bank now hold the commercial paper of the customers of the said mortgagors upon which the said advances have been made, and the said mortgagors have applied to the said bank for additional advances for a limited period to which the said bank has agreed upon receiving security for the present indebtedness ; and it is intended by these presents to carry out such agreement, it is witnessed, that in consideration of one hundred and fifty-three thousand and eleven dollars, being the amount of the indebtedness of the mortgagors to the said bank on the 31st day of December now last past, and still unpaid, and of 5 per cent, the lands therein mentioned, are conveyed to Mr. Cameron, manager of the Merchants Bank at Toronto, in fee, subject to a proviso therein contained, that the mortgage should be void on payment of one hundred and fifty-three thousand and eleven dollars in nine months from the , date thereof, and all bills of exchange, promissory notes, drafts and other paper upon which the said Moffatt Brothers & Co. were liable to the said bank on the 31st of December last preceding the date of the mortgage, together with all renewals, substitutions and alterations thereof, and all the indebtedness of the said mortgagors to the said bank in respect of the said sum, this indenture being intended to be a continuing security to the said bank for the above amount, notwithstanding any change in the membership of the said firm, either by death, retirement therefrom, or addition thereto, and also to secure and cover any sum due, or to become due, in respect of interest commission upon the said notes or renewals, or other commercial paper, and taxes and performance of statute labor. The mortgage then contains a covenant by the mortgagors to pay the said mortgage debt and interest. The bond is then executed on the same day by Lewis Moffatt and Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt, two of the above mortgagors, and by George Moffatt, the appellant, as their surety in the penal sum of $20,000, conditioned for the payment to the bank of $10,000 in nine months from the date thereof, and on the same day is executed an instrument explanatory of the whole transaction, This indenture recites that the firm of Moffatt Brothers & Co. are indebted to the bank, and that the bank had refused any longer to make advances to them, and had threatened to close their account and to compel immediate payment of their debt, unless the bank should receive additional security for said advances, and that the parties of the first, second and third parts to the said indenture, that is to say, the said Lewis Moffatt, and Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt, and the now appellant George Moffatt had agreed to give such security, and for that purpose that the said Lewis Moffatt, Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt, and one Lewis Henry Moffatt had executed a mortgage of even date to the bank to secure the same, and that in consideration of such security the said bank had agreed to make further advances to said Moffatt Brothers & Co., and that the indenture now in recital was executed to secure the bank in case there should be any deficiency in the assets of the said firm, or in the value of the property comprised in the mortgage and to secure the bank from ultimate loss. The indenture then witnessed that in consideration of the premises Lewis and Kenneth Moffatt covenanted with the bank, that the capital of Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt then invested in and forming part of the assets of the firm of Moffatt Brothers & Co., should not be withdrawn therefrom until the said mortgage should be fully paid and satisfied, unless with the consent in writing of the bank and the said Lewis Moffatt and Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt and the appellant George Moffatt, jointly and severally covenanted with the bank that in consideration of the premises and of the bank's acceptance of the said mortgage, and the indenture now in recital, to pay to the bank the sum of ten thousand dollars in nine months from the date of the said indenture as secured by money bond bearing even date with the said indenture. The indenture then contained a clause by which it was declared that if the said Kenneth Mackenzie Moffatt should not withdraw his capital from the said firm of Moffatt Brothers & Co., until the indebtedness of the said firm to the bank should be fully paid, and if the said firm of Moffatt Brothers & Co. should well and truly pay their indebtedness to the said bank, then the said bond and this indenture now in recital should become wholly void. Now, it appears to me, to be very obvious that what is meant by the word \" indebtedness \" here used is the then existing debt se- cured by the then existing commercial paper upon which the moneys constituting the debt were advanced , by the bank, and in further security for which the mortgage was given, and it is also, in my opinion, obvious that the words ultimate loss,\" as used in this indenture, apply to any loss, if any there should be, upon a final account being taken of the moneys which the bank might receive in respect of the commercial paper then in existence, which constituted the debt secured by the mortgage as additional security, and in respect of all renewals thereof and of all commercial paper which might be accepted by the bank in substitution of such notes, &c., and renewals, and of the moneys arising from the sale of the mortgaged lands. It was only with that debt and with any loss arising in respect of it, that the appellant had anything to do. He never was asked to guarantee and never contemplated guaranteeing the bank against any loss, if any should arise in respect of the future advances which, upon the then existing debt being secured, they promised Moffatt Brothers & Co. to make to them. For such advances the bank were to look alone to the personal credit of Moffatt Brothers & Co., and to the commercial paper upon which such future advances should be made. That this was the clear intention of the bank is apparent from some of the letters which were produced in evidence.\nOn the 29th December, 1873, Mr. Jackson, the general manager of the bank at Montreal, writes to Mr. Cameron, the manager of the bank at Toronto, as follows :\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Referring to the correspondence between us on the subject of Messrs. Moffatt Brothers & Co's. account, I have now to inform you the firm desire to make over security on real estate to extent of $75,000 in value to protect the bank from ultimate loss on ;he same, and in consideration thereof to procure from the bank an increase temporarily in their present line of discount to the extent of $35,000. I hand you herewith the firm's statement of affairs also that of Mr. Moffatt's private estate, and I wish you to ascertain from him in what way he proposes to make up the required amount of security, and then submit the whole matter to Messrs. Smith, Rae & Fuller in order to ascertain :\n1st. That the bank can legally possess the proposed security and hold it as a protection against ultimate loss on the bills now current or renewals thereof.\n2nd. Can any portions of the private estate property be legally pledged to the bank for the same purpose.\n3rd. A proper valuation of the property proposed to be mortgaged will be required.\n4th. Can this agreement which is now proposed to be made to continue for the period of, say nine months, at the end of which time the bank shall have the right to discontinue discounting for the firm and to recover as best it can upon the bills and securities then in its possession.\nI am now awaiting statement of the present position of the firms account with you, on receipt of which, and of Messrs. Smith, Rae and Fuller's report, the board will decide what course shall be taken in regard to the application.\nNow, from this letter, which shows the origin of the transaction, it is apparent that what the bank contemplated getting additional security for was the then existing debt\u2014and protection against ultimate loss on the bills then current or renewals thereof. They were not asking for any security for the future advances contemplated to be made to Moffatt Brothers & Co. upon the then existing debt being secured. At this time the guarantee bond sued upon was not contemplated. By a letter of the 30th December, 1873, addressed to Mr. Jackson Rae by Messrs. Smith, Rae & Fuller, they send him their report upon the question submitted to them as contained in the above letter of the 29th December In this letter the solicitors of the bank wrote to the general manager as follows :\u2014\nBe Moffatt Brothers.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Mr. Cameron has handed us your letter of yesterday in this matter, and, also the enclosed statement of Mr. Moffatt, and we have seen Mr. Moffatt as to it. On the points stated in your letter, we are of opinion that the bank can take a mortgage or mortgages from the different members of the firm- as additional security for the present indebtedness of the firm to- the bank on the bills now our. rent or renewals thereof.\n2nd. That the private property of any member of the firm can be\npledged for that purpose.\n3rd. Mr. Moffatt is very much averse to greater publicity being given to this matter than is absolutely necessary, and he has gone over the valuation of the properties with us. The first property is a farm, regarding which we know nothing. The second, a part of Collingwood harbor, which had for a long time a merely speculative value. For the last few years it has risen much, and two years ago seven acres were rented for seven years, and one condition of the lease is that the tenant was to erect, keep, and have, at the expiration of the term a saw mill costing at least $6,000. This mill has been built and other improvements made, which, in Mr. Moffatt's opinion, are worth the sum at which the whole property is valued. The warehouse has been valued at $35,000 by the officer appointed by the company in which it is mortgaged for $20,000. As to the mills we know nothing. As to the house Mr. Moffatt states that he holds a policy on the building and contents for $30,000, which he will assign, and the land is certainly valued low at $30 a foot.\nMr. Moffatt offers, in case the bank has any-doubt, to give in addition a bond for $10,000 from himself and his brothers George and Kenneth, but does not wish the valuation made for the reason we have before given.\n4th. The agreement can be drawn as you propose and for the period; upon this point we had no conversation with Mr. Moffatt.\"\nNow, the bond as here offered, is plainly contemplated as being collateral to the mortgage and as additional security for the same debt as that intended to be secured by the mortgage and as a protection to the bank against ultimate loss on the bills then current, which represented that debt or renewals thereof, in case the property proposed to be mortgaged should prove insufficient for that purpose. The idea that it should operate as a security for any part of the future advances, promised to be made by the bank upon the then existing debt being secured, does not seem to have been entertained by anyone.\nOn the 14th January, 1874, the Messrs. Smith Rae and Fuller again wrote to the general manager of the bank as follows\nRe Moffatt Brothers.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014we have consulted (confidentially) with Mr. Bethune in this matter and have come to the conclusion that the best course to take is to take a mortgage in the usual form. This can be G taken to Mr. Cameron so that some publicity will be avoided. Your first letter to us proposed to take security upon the real estate for the then indebtedness of the firm being $152,000, and we understand that the bank has arranged to make a further advance to the firm in all of $30,000 in their line of discounts. If this be so, then we do not think these additional advances will be secured by a mortgage under a possible interpretation of the Act, and that it is not your intention to do so; simply the present indebtedness and any renewals of paper securing it.\nAgain on the 16th January, 1874, they write to him as follows:\u2014\nRe Moffatt Bros. & Co.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014We have received your telegram and also your letter of the 15th instant. We had previously settled and partly engrossed mortgage and copies covering the properties submitted by Mr. Lewis Moffatt, in which mortgage all the members of the firm, viz., himself, his son and Col. Moffatt join. A bond from Mr. Lewis, Moffatt, Col. Moffatt and George Moffatt, of Montreal, for $10,000, and, also an agreement showing that this $10,000 should be payable in the event of any loss or deficiency in payment of the mortgages, and enabling the bank to make any arrangement with Moffatt Brothers & Co., they deemed proper. We had drawn the mortgage for $153,011, the balance due on the 31st of December, and all renewals or substitution on this account up to this amount. Mr. Bethune agrees with us, and, in fact holds a much stronger opinion than we do regarding the impropriety of taking a mortgage to cover future advances, he holds that this mortgage and bond being given partly upon the promise of further advances is on that account made stronger against any other creditors, and that if taken to cover future advances, the whole security might be set aside. In that view we had advised Mr. Cameron to open a separate account for the future advances beyond $153,011, and to take care that the paper taken on that account should be unexceptionally good. In this view the bank is not likely to sustain much loss as all the private estate of Messrs. Lewis and Col. Moffatt would be liable for $153,011 and George Moffatt for $10,000, should there be any deficiency on this account, On the 24th January, 1874, Mr. Jackson Rae, the general manager of the bank, wrote to Mr. Cameron, the manager at Toronto, a letter in which occur the following passages:\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I have had several interviews with Mr. Moffatt recently, ' and he has produced the various mortgages executed in your name in trust for the bank in accordance with the views of your solicitors. The bank has (executed) the $10,000 guarantee bond from Lewis George and Col. Moffatt, and all the documents have been placed in Mr. Moffatt's possession for transmission to your solicitors at Toronto. Mrs. Moffatt's signature to the deeds has yet to be obtained. When this is done, the mortgage. may be considered effected. The bank has agreed to delay registration for the period of ten days from this date to enable Mr. Moffatt to procure a bond of indemnity signed by Messrs. Henry Covert and George Moffatt protecting the bank to the extent of $50,000 from any evil consequences which might result to it by refraining from registering the mortgage. If Mr. Moffatt fails to satisfy the bank in regard to this matter within the time named, registration must then proceed.\nYou will be careful to preserve the old account at about the sum named in the mortgage ($153,011), the additional advances or increased accommodation must be carried on in a new account, which you will understand is not secured, and therefore the paper composing it must be carefully selected. This new account is in accordance with your solicitor's advice.\nThe indemnity referred to in this letter as to be executed by Messrs. Henry Covert and George Moffatt protecting the bank to the extent of $50,000 from any evil consequences which might result to the bank by reason of its refraining to register the mortgage was given ; but it is unnecessary to set out here, for it is not alleged, that any evil consequences did result from the non-registration of the mortgage, nor is any claim now made by the bank as accruing under this guarantee ; all that is, in question in this suit is as to the liability of the appellant, George Moffatt, under his guarantee bond for $10,000.\nA question having arisen as to whether the bank had agreed to, give up the guarantee bond for $10,000 upon receiving the above guarantee to the extent of $50,000 executed by Messrs. Covert and George Moffatt, and a letter having been written upon the subject, of the date: of the 7th February, 1874, by Messrs. Smith, Rae and Fuller to the general manager of the bank, the latter replies thereto by a letter dated the 9th February, 1874, addressed to Messrs. Smith, Rae and Fuller as follows:\nI have received your letter of the 7th instant enclosing the document as stated, which I now return herewith to be placed in charge of the Toronto branch. Mr. Moffatt is in error as to the willingness of the bank to surrender the bond for $10,000 or the deed of agreement in consequence of the execution of the bond of indemnity by H. Covert and G. Moffatt. The latter was taken merely between the bank from loss in consequence of consenting to withhold the mortgage from registration. The bond for $10,000 was accepted in lieu of the requirement as to valuation, and the agreement provides for the continuance of Col. Moffatt's money in the concern as long as the firm continues indebted to the bank.\nCol. Moffatt's capital never was removed from the firm, so that no question arises upon that point. The sole question is as to the liability of the appellant under that bond as a collateral security to the mortgage of even date therewith, and in view of the above documents and letters relating to the preparation and execution of the documents, it is, in my opinion, impossible to hold that the bond was prepared or executed with any intent, that it should operate directly or indirectly as security for any part of the future advances which might be made by the bank to Messrs. Moffatt Brothers, or as any protection to the bank against any ultimate loss, if any should arise, upon the taking of an account of such subsequent advances, or for any other purpose than to secure the bank against ultimate loss on an account being taken of the bills, &c., then current, or any renewals thereof, or any paper expressly taken by the bank in substitution for any such paper after realization of the properties comprised in the mortgage. It was as a security against loss in respect of the then existing debt alone that the bond was given, and its operation cannot, in my opinion, be , extended beyond that purpose.\nBy the contemporaneous agreement executed for the purpose of defining the extent of the operation of the bond, it is declared to be void if Kenneth McKenzie Moffatt shall not withdraw his capital from the firm, and if Moffatt Brothers & Co., shall well and truly pay their indebtedness to the bank, which indebtedness clearly, as it appears to me, is the only debt which then existed, and to secure which the mortgage was given, and which in that mortgage is described as being $153,011, consisting, as is recited in the mortgage, 'of bills of - exchange, promissory notes, drafts, and other paper upon which the said firm of Moffatt Brothers & Co., were liable to the said Merchants' Bank at Toronto, on the 31st December, 1873, together with all renewals, substitutions and alterations thereof, and all indebtedness of the mortgagors to the bank in respect of said sum, and also any sum then due or to become due in respect of interest or commission upon the said notes or renewals or substitutional paper.\nNow, to entitle the bank to recover against the appellant upon this bond, it appears to me to be clear that the onus lies upon them to show that of the. moneys constituting the debt of Moffatt Brothers & Co. to the bank, when the bond was given, secured by commercial paper held by the bank, there still remained after realizing upon the properties comprised in the mortgage a sum due to the bank. For any amount so established to' be due within the stem of $10,000, the appellant would be liable; but until there should be established to be such ultimate loss upon taking an account, apart altogether of all future advances, of the paper held by the bank at the time the mortgage was given, and of all renewals thereof, and of all commercial paper, if any, accepted by the bank in actual substitution for any of such paper, and after realization of the mortgaged lands no action could be sustained against the appellant upon his bond. To the taking of such an account, it was absolutely necessary that an account of the secured debt and of the paper held by the bank representing such debt, and of all renewals thereof and of all paper accepted in substitution therefor, should be kept quite separate and distinct from an account of the future advances. And this was well understood by the bank as appears from Mr. Jackson Rae's letter of the 24th January, 1874, to Mr. Cameron, giving him very peremptory instruction to that effect and giving the reason therefor, namely, that any debt to arise in respect of the subsequent advances was unsecured otherwise than by the notes, bills, &c., upon which such subsequent advances should be made, which paper was, therefore, to be most carefully selected by Mr. Cameron. That a loss should arise in respect of the paper which was to be so carefully selected was never contemplated or anticipated. The bank kept no account of the transactions in relation to the old secured debt separate and distinct from the account kept of the subsequent advances. What they did, and the manner in which the paper representing the old secured debt was dealt with, was this: They continued the account in which the old debt appeared and of the subsequent advances as one account. The customers of Messrs Moffatt Brothers, who were primarily liable upon some of the commercial paper held by the bank representing the old debt, paid the amounts due on such paper to the bank direct and retired the paper. What amount was so paid to the bank direct, and what notes, bills, &c., were so retired does not appear. Other makers of notes and acceptors of bills held by the bank representing the old debt, were in the habit of paying the amounts secured by such paper to Messrs. Moffatt & Co., who were in the habit of paying the sums so paid to them , into their credit in the bank. The proceeds of the new discounts constituting the further advance were deposited by the bank to the credit of Messrs. Moffatt Brothers in the same account. The amount to their credit on this account during the first six months after the execution of the mortgage and bond was $1,094,973, of which from 20 to 25 per cent. consisted of cash deposits and the residue of the proceeds of the discounts upon new paper.\nBy cheques given by Messrs. Moffatt Brothers upon this account, and by direct payments to the bank made by parties, the customers of Messrs. Moffatt, who were primarily liable on the notes and bills, the whole of the notes and bills which the bank had held representing the original debt, which was collaterally secured by the mortgage and the guarantee bond now sued upon were paid, and the notes and bills taken up. No renewals or substitutional paper having ever been given for any of such paper.\nPayments so made operated, in my opinion, as direct payment, discharge and extinguishment of so much of the original debt as was represented by the notes and bills taken up, of which the appellant is entitled to the benefit.\nBesides the 'subsequent advances made by the bank to Messrs. Moffatt Brothers upon customers paper the bank advanced to them from $50,000 to $60,000 upon what they knew to be accommodation paper, which moneys were also entered to the credit of the firm in the same account. The result of the taking an account of all these transactions blended into one, 'is that, after realizing upon the property mortgaged there still remains due to the bank by Messrs. Moffatt Brothers a sum about the same precisely as the amount of the advances made by the bank upon the accommodation paper. An amount so arrived at cannot, in my opinion, be said to be within the appellant's guarantee. The loss which the bank are seeking indemnity from the appellant for, more properly may be said to have arisen by reason of the bank's own improvidence in making the advances which they made upon the accommodation paper.\nIt is contended, however, that the bank is entitled to recover this loss from the appellant upon his bond, notwithstanding that the loss should be attributable wholly to the subsequent advances, and even though traceable specially to the advances made upon the accommodation paper, by reason of a clause in the instrument, which provides for defeasance of the bond, which is as follows:\nAnd it is further agreed, that the said parties of the fourth part, (the bank) shall be at liberty to deal with the said Messrs. Moffatt Bros. & Co. or their successors, and to make such business arrangements as they may deem just and proper, and that nothing thereby done shall alter, impair, diminish, or render void the liability of the parties to the said mortgage bond or this agreement ; and that the doctrines of law and equity in favor of a surety shall not apply to the prejudice of the parties of the fourth part (that is the bank) in consequence of any act done, committed, or suffered by them, unless the parties hereto, or some, or one of them, shall previously, in writing, notify the parties of the fourth part of Their objection thereto.\nIt is impossible to construe this clause which specially provides that no business arrangements which the bank should make with Messrs. Moffatt Brothers & Co., should have the effect of altering or diminishing the liability incurred by the appellant as appearing in the previous part of the instrument, should nevertheless have the effect of altering by increasing that liability by making the appellants' bond, which, as I have shown, was given and accepted as, and intended to be, a guarantee in respect of the old debt only, and the commercial paper representing it, to be a guarantee also against loss in respect of 'the subsequent advances, including not only those made upon business paper , but those also made upon accommodation paper. So to construe this clause would be to defeat the plain intention of all parties at the time of the execution of r\u2022 the bond. In so far as the clause can affect the appellant, it can only relate to such business arrangements as the bank and Messrs. Moffatt may deem just and proper in relation to the subject-matter with which the appellant' is concerned, namely, the old debt and the business paper. representing it, and the doctrine of law and equity in favor of a surety which are not to \u00b0 be asserted to the prejudice of the bank, must be limited to the same subject-matter in respect of which the appellant is a surety ; and sufficient effect can be given to the clause by construing it as providing that the surety should not avail himself of the doctrine of discharge from his liability by reason of any extension of time which might be given to the parties primarily liable upon the banking paper representing the original debt, by renewals, or by reason of the discharge of any of such parties by reason of the bank accepting substitutional paper in lieu of the current paper or renewals thereof. In the view which I take of the documents and of the intention of the parties to them, The City Discount Co. v. McLean[23] and Fenton v. Blackwood[24], and such like cases have no application whatever to the present case, which, in my judgment, does not present any question arising upon the rule in Clayton's case as to the right, in the absence of specific appropriation, of applying the oldest item on the credit side of an account in payment of the oldest item of debt. What the evidence shows, in my opinion, is the retirement of the notes and bills which constituted and represented the old debt by specific payment directly to the bank of some of those notes and bills by the parties primarily liable thereon, and by equally direct and specific payment of the residue of such bills and notes by cheques given to the bank by Messrs. Moffatt Brothers upon a fund over which they had, as is admitted, absolute control, and which fund was composed in part of moneys expressly placed in their hands for the purpose of retiring such notes, &c.\nUpon such notes having been retired in the manner above stated, and not by renewal or substitutional paper, so much of the old debt, as those notes respectively represented, was paid and extinguished, and nothing has occurred to deprive the appellant of his right to compel the bank to show that the loss in respect of which they now claim indemnity from him, arose wholly out of the transactions connected with the old debt apart from all the subsequent advances ; and as the bank has not only failed in establishing this to be the fact, but in my judgment have, on the contrary, shown that it have risen wholly in respect of the subsequent advances, and specially by reason of the advances made upon the accommodation paper, this appeal should be allowed with costs, and the action in the court below against the appellant be ordered to be dismissed with costs[25].\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Ferguson & Ferguson.\nSolicitors for respondents: Smith, Smith & Rae.\n[1] 5 Ont.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nSt. John City Assessment Act, 1882 (45 Vic., ch. 59. N. B.)\u2014Chartered Bank\u2014Assessment on capital stock of\u2014Par value\u2014Real and personal property of Bank\u2014Payment of taxes under protest.\nBy sec. 25 of the Saint John City Assessment Act of 1882 it is provided that \"all rates and taxes levied and imposed upon the city of Saint John shall be raised by an equal rate upon the value of the real estate situate in the city, and part of the city to be taxed and upon the personal estate of the inhabitants and of persons deemed and declared to be inhabitants or residents of the said city. * * * * * And upon the capital stock, income, or other thing of joint stock companies, corporations, or persons associated in business.\" And after providing for the levying of a poll tax, such section goes on to say that \"the whole residue to be raised shall be levied upon the whole ratable property, real and personal, and ratable income and real value, and amount of the same as nearly as can be ascertained, provided that joint stock shall not be rated above the par value thereof.\"\nSec. 28 of the same Act provides that \"all joint stock companies and corporations shall be assessed, under this Act, in like manner as individuals; and for the purposes of such assessment the president, or any agent, or manager of such joint stock company or corporation shall be deemed and taken to be the owner of the real and personal estate, capital stock and assets of such company or corporation, and shall be dealt with and may be proceeded against accordingly.\"\nJ. D. L., the President of the Bank of New Brunswick, was assessed, under the provisions of the above Act, on real and personal property of the bank valued, in the aggregate, at $1,100,000. The capital stock of the bank at the time of such assessment, was only $1,000,000, and he offered to pay the taxes on that amount which was refused. It is not disputed that the bank was possessed of real and personal property of the assessed value. On appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, refusing a certiorari to quash the said assessment.\nHeld, (Fournier, J., dissenting,)\u2014That the real and personal property of the bank are part of its capital stock, and that the assessment could not exceed the par value of such stock, namely, $1,000,000.\nThe Chamberlain of the city of Saint John is authorized, without any previous proceedings, to issue execution for taxes if not paid within a certain time after notice. In order to avoid such execution, the Bank of New Brunswick paid their taxes under protest.\nHeld,\u2014That such payment did not preclude them from afterwards taking proceedings to have the assessment qualified.\nAppeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to make absolute a rule nisi for a certiorari to quash an assessment made by the city of Saint John upon the Bank of New Brunswick under the provisions of the \"Saint John City Assessment Act of 1882,\"[1].\nIn 1883 an assessment was made upon the Bank of New Brunswick, under the \"Saint John City Assessment Act of 1882,\" on a valuation, by the assessors of the city of St. John, of the real and personal property of the bank amounting to $1,100,000, being $42,200 real estate and $1,057,800 personal estate. The sections of the Act 45 Vic., ch. 59, N.B., under the authority of the assessment was made are referred to at length in the judgments hereinafter given. The amount of the assessment was $12,760, or 1.20 per cent. of the estimated value of the property.\nAt the time of such assessment, the par value of the stock of the bank was $1,000,000, and Mr. Lewin, the president, gave notice to the chamberlain of the city, that he objected to the assessment on the ground that the property of the bank constitutes the joint stock of the corporation, and offered to pay a rating upon $1,000,000, the par value of the stock. This offer the city would not accept, and the taxes were paid under protest, the bank being desirous of avoiding an execution to recover them.\nA rule nisi for a certiorari to quash the rate was obtained by the bank, and argued in Michaelmas term, and a majority of the court ruled that the assessment was not an improper one and dismissed the rule. The bank then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nC. W. Weldon, Q.C., for the appellants, cited on the question of the validity of the assessment: Ex parte Bank of New Brunswick[2]. And on the question of payment: Peyser v. Mayor[3]; Tuttle v. Everitt[4]; Mayor v. Riker[5].\nTuck, Q.C., for the respondents, cited Ex parte Lewin[6]; Queen v. Wilson[7].\nRITCHIE C.J.\u2014The appeal in this case is made by Mr. James D. Lewin, who was assessed as president of the Bank of New Brunswick, for the amount of certain taxes levied on the bank. Under the Assessment Act of the province the capital stock of the bank may be assessed up to its par value, but not beyond that. In this case the assessors have assessed the stock up to its par value, and have also assessed the real and personal estate of the bank. I think that the sliding scale intended by the Act was a sliding scale downwards and not upwards, and that the real and personal property of the bank are part of the capital stock of the bank. I am of opinion that the assessment is wrong, and that the appeal should be allowed. I agree with Mr. Justice Fraser in his construction of the statute, and I have nothing to add to what he has said. I do not consider that the bank has waived its right to object by paying the taxes. In New Brunswick they have a very summary way of collecting taxes. They issue a notice to the party, and if he does not pay within ten days they issue execution without any further notice to the party and without a judgment This bank was threatened in this way, and those who controlled its affairs paid the taxes. I do not think that circumstance should prevent them going to the Court of Appeal, for it may be they would not have paid it but for the fact that they were liable to have their property seized.\nSTRONG J.\u2014 These are two appeals which, as they raised precisely the same questions, were argued together. The appellant is the president of the Bank of New Brunswick, and he complains that the bank, in his name as its president, was over-assessed by the assessors of rates for the city of St. John for the years 1882 and 1883 to the amount of $100,000 in each year. Upon the application of the appellant the Supreme Court of New Brunswick granted rules nisi calling upon the assessors to show cause why a writ of certiorari should not issue to remove into the Supreme Court the assessment lists for the years mentioned with a view to the assessments complained of being quashed. These rules, after argument, were discharged, Mr. Justice Weldon and Mr. Justice Fraser dissenting from the judgment. As has been stated, the amount of the alleged over-assessment complained of was the same in each of the two years, 1882 and 1883, the only difference being that this sum in 1882 was made up of $42,800 for real estate and of $57,200 for personal estate, and in 1883 of $37,000 for real estate and $63,000 for personal estate; the $100,000 thus arrived at being in each year added to the sum of one million dollars, the par value of the amount at which the capital of the bank is fixed by a statute of the Dominion.\nThe assessments were made under the authority of the \"St. John City Assessment Act of 1882,\" (45 Vic., ch. 59).\nThe provisions of that Act material to the question which the court is called upon to decide are the 25th and the 28th.\nThe 25th section enacts that:\u2014\nAll rates and taxes levied and imposed upon the city of St. John shall be raised by an equal rate upon the value of the real estate situate in the city and parts of the city to be taxed, and upon the personal estate of the inhabitants, and of persons deemed and declared to be inhabitants or residents of the said city, wherever such personal estate may be, and upon the income of inhabitants and, of persons deemed and declared to be inhabitants or residents, as aforesaid, for the purpose of taxation, being the income derived and coming in any manner, except from real or personal estate actually assessed under this law, and upon the capital stock, income or other thing of joint stock companies, corporations or persons associated in business and otherwise as hereinafter provided, and shall be made and levied as follows, that is to say, there shall be levied a poll tax of one dollar upon all male inhabitants of the city of the full age of 21 years, not being paupers, for the purposes set forth in the first section of this Act, on each side of the harbour, and, after levying any other poll tax authorized by law to be included in the general assessment, the whole residue to be raised shall be levied upon the whole ratable property, real and personal, and ratable income, and joint stock, according to the true and real value and amount of the same, as nearly as the same can be ascertained, provided that joint stock shall not be rated above the par value thereof.\nThe 28th section is as follows:\u2014 All joint stock companies and corporations shall be assessed under this Act in like manner as individuals, and for the purposes of such assessment the president or any agent or manager of such joint stock company or corporation, shall be deemed and taken to be the owner of the real and personal estate, capital stock, and assets of such company or corporation, and shall be dealt with and may be procecded against accordingly.\nThe appellant objects that to the extent of $100,000, there have been double assessments, the sum of his argument being that the real estate and personal estate making up that amount form part of the capital of the bank, and that the maximum valuation which can be placed upon the capital is by force of the concluding words of the 25th section \"provided that joint stock shall not be rated above the par value thereof,\" the amount at which the capital of the bank is fixed by statute, in other words its \"par value\" and not its actual market value.\nNothing can be better established by authority than that acts of this kind are, as against the subject, to be strictly construed, and there is to be no liability to taxation unless the tax is imposed by unambiguous language. And again we are to make every presumption against an intention to impose a double burden. It appears to be very clear that by the express words of the 25th section the assessment in the case of joint stock companies and corporations is to be on the capital stock.\nThen the capital stock is not to be limited to the active capital, that in actual use for banking purposes, but includes also investments in real estate and in personal property as the rest or reserve fund in the present instance. That these investments and rests may have been additions to the original amount of the capital not positively authorized by statute can, it is conceived, make no difference; de facto, it is capital, and that is sufficient for the present purpose. It may, however, be incidentally remarked that there would appear to be nothing illegal in these investments and accumulations, although not directly authorized by statute; at all events the only persons who could possibly complain would be shareholders, who might perhaps insist that all net earnings should be divided as profits. But however this may be, there can be no question that reserve funds and investments in real estate form part of the capital and must increase the credit of the bank, and so tend to increase the value of the shares.\nThe real question in dispute is not, however, whether the funds and property, the value and the amount of which is represented by this $100,000, is actual capital, but whether the capital, including these additions, is, for the purposes of taxation, to be taken at its actual or estimated value, or at the aggregate amount of the shares into which the whole statutory capital of one million dollars is divided. The answer to this must depend on the construction to be placed upon the concluding words of the 25th section; \"Provided that joint stock shall not be rated above the par value thereof.\"\nIn the first place I am of opinion that this provision is not to be confined to the assessment of shares in the hands of individual holders, but applies also to the assessment of the corporate body itself in respect of its capital. As I have said before, the rule is that there is to be a strict construction against the burden of the tax, and it is also the rule that where there is an exemption or restriction, that it is to be liberally construed in favor of persons for whose benefit it is enacted. Now here the words \"joint stock\" are used generally, and not in any way restrained to \"shares\" in a joint stock or capital, but in their primary signification apply to an assessment of the capital of a joint stock company as a whole, at least as obviously as to an assessment of the fractions or shares of such a whole.\nAgain, in the preceding part of the same section we find these words:\nAnd upon the capital stock, income or other thing, of joint stock companies, corporations or persons associated in business and otherwise as hereinafter provided.\nTherefore subsequent provisions which are in their nature applicable, are by this reference expressly made to apply to the assessment of the capital of corporations and companies, and this by itself is sufficient to entitle corporations to the benefit of the restriction contained in the proviso at the end of the same clause. This provision being thus applicable, the question is narrowed to this: What meaning is to be attributed to the expression \"par value?\" Apart from the well known meaning which these words have acquired in the language of commerce and finance, their abstract meaning is of course \"equal value.\" Then, equal to what? The answer must of course be, equal to the nominal value of the shares. But heaving regard to the very general use of the expression with reference to capital of corporations held in shares, it, of course, means that the shares are to be taken to be of the same value as that for which they were originally and nominally issued. Therefore, as one of the 10,000 shares or fractions into which the capital is divided, is not to be assessed at any higher value than its nominal face value of $100, so the aggregate capital represented by these 10,000 shares must, if there is any force in language, be subject to the same restriction. Thus, giving the section in question a strict verbal construction, the result at which I arrive is in favor of the appellants contention, and in statutes of this kind, this mode of construction is not merely permissible, but is made imperative, by authorities which cannot be questioned, and which are too well known to make it desirable to refer to them specifically.\nWhen we come, however, to consider what the consequences of applying the mode of assessment adopted in the present case to joint stock companies, such as manufacturing companies whose whole capital may be invested in lands, buildings and plant, as put in the very clear and able judgment of Mr. Justice Fraser, we see at once that the construction contended for by the respondents cannot possibly be correct in view of the great injustice to which such an interpretation would lead.\nThis consideration alone, even if the words of the statute were much less favorable to the appellant than I think they are, would have led me to the same conclusion. I forbear from entering at length into this part of the case, because I entirely adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Fraser, which seems to me to have received no answer.\nLastly, it is said that the appellant is not entitled to the writ, as regards the taxes for 1882, for the reason that he voluntarily paid the taxes for that year, and consequently has no locus standi for the present purpose.;\nI do not think that this objection applies to an application of this kind made with a view to quash the assessment, even though it might be a defence to an action for money had and received.\nIf money is paid under pressure of an execution irregularly issued, or under threat of an execution on a judgment illegally or irregularly entered up, which execution it is in the power of the judgment creditor immediately to put in force, the money cannot, it is true, as long as the judgment or execution stands, be recovered back. But if the judgment be set aside, an action for money had and received will then lie, for there will be nothing to justify its receipt. And it will be no answer to the application to set aside the judgment that the money has been paid, unless it appears that the payment was not induced by the pressure of the writ or of the threat of the writ, but was made voluntarily, that is in such a way as to indicate an intention to waive and abandon the right, afterwards to call the validity, of the judgment in question. This motion for a writ of certiorari in order that the assessment may be quashed, I consider analogous, not to an action to recover the money, but to an application, to set aside the judgment. That the payment of the taxes involved any waiver of the right to call the legality of the assessment in question in this way, is negatived by the protest which accompanied it.\nWhether, as regards an action for money had and received, a payment of taxes assessed in this way is subject to the same legal considerations as the payment of money recovered by a judgment, is a point which does not at present arise, and which need not therefore be further considered.\nI am of opinion that both appeals must be allowed and the rules for the writs of certiorari made absolute in the court below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the court appealed from.\nHENRY J.\u2014I think the taxation to the extent of a million is all the city authorities are justified in imposing. The general assessment law provides for the taxation of real and personal property; but special provision is made for banks, namely, that they may be taxed up to the par value of their capital stock. It appears to me that this is intended to cover everything so far as banks are concerned, and to exclude the idea of taxing their real and personal property.\nThe law of the province lays down a particular mode in which banks shall be assessed, and when it mentions that particular mode, it prevents the general provisions with regard to taxation from operating in the case of banks. These remarks apply of course only to resitend banks, foreign banks being taxed upon their income. I think that the taxation of the stock to the amount of one million dollars must be held to include all the taxes which can legally be levied on the bank, and that therefore the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion, that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: G.

The habendum in the deed was \u201cto the full end of the term for which the letters patent are granted.\u201d The consideration was $4,500, of which $1,500 was paid down, and mortgages given on the land on which the business was carried on, and on the chattels for the residue. The patent expired on the 19th July, 1877, and C.P. renewed it in his own name for the further term of five years, and P. et al. having made default in June, 1878, C.P. filed his bill asking for payment of the balance of purchase money, or in default for a sale of the land. Almost at the same time P. et al. brought a suit against C.P. to enforce specific performance of the agreement for sale of the patent right for the full period to which C.P. was entitled to renew the same under the patent laws.\nHeld,\u2014In the suit Peck et al. v. Powell, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that under the agreement and assignment plaintiffs were entitled to the extension as well as the current term.\nAnd in the suit Powell v. Peck et al., affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that C. P. was entitled to a decree for the redemption or foreclosure of the mortgaged premises with costs.\nPer Strong, J.,\u2014According to the principles upon which a court of equity acts in carrying into execution by its decree such contracts and agreements as are properly the subject of its jurisdiction, the court will always execute the whole or such parts of the agreement as remain executory, but if the parties have thought fit before the institution of the suit, to carry out any of the terms of the contract, such executed portions will not be disturbed.\nPer Henry and Gwynne, JJ.,\u2014That the decrees in the Court of Chancery should be consolidated and the decree for sale in default of payment in the suit of Powell v. Peck et al., delayed until P. had assigned the renewal term.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the decree of the Court of Chancery[2]. The respondent, (Charles Powell,) sued the appellants, (Peck, Coleman and Brett,) to enforce payment of a mortgage for $3,000 due to respondent in respect of a sale by him to them of his interest under a patent for an improved pump. Almost at the same time the appellants, Peck et al., began the suit of Peck v. Powell, to enforce specific performance of an agreement dated 1st June, 1877, for sale of such patent right for the full period to which respondent was entitled to renew the same under the patent laws.\nThe defence set up in the suit of Powell v. Peck, was the same as the case which Peck et al. sought to make in Peck v. Powell, namely, that when the agreement of the 1st June, 1877, was made, Powell falsely represented that letters mentioned or referred to in the said agreement for certain new and useful improvements, known as the \u201ccone pump and its connections,\u201d had ten years to run, whereas the fact was, that unless in the meantime renewed, said letters would have expired in a few weeks, and Peck et al. claimed in consequence of such misrepresentation that they were not bound to pay the mortgage money sued in Powell v. Peck, and that Powell\u2019s proceedings should be restrained until Powell had made good his representations and carry out his contract with respect to said patent.\nPowell answered that he never intended to sell, and Peck et al. never intended to purchase any more that the limited interest conveyed in the assignment of the 1st June, 1877.\nThe agreement and assignment are set out in the judgment of Ritchie, C.J.\nThe causes were heard together in the Court of Chancery, and in the Court of Appeal, and there was but one argument in both appeals before the Supreme Court of Canada. Hector Cameron, Q.C., and Fitzgerald with him, for appellants.\nDalton McCarthy, Q.C., and Moss, Q.C., for respondent.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014There are two appeals of Peck et al. v. Powell standing for judgment.\nThe first turns upon the question whether the patent rights which had been sold by Powell for five counties included all rights of renewal, and the second turns upon the right of vendor to foreclose a mortgage given by purchaser to secure balance of purchase-money.\nThe patent is dated 19th July, 1872, and expired on the 19th July, 1877.\nThe assignment by Powell to Peck and others, though dated 1st June, 1877, was not executed till the 23rd June, 1877, less than one month before date of expiring.\nThe assignment of Powell to Peck is as follows:\nWhereas, I, Charles Powell, of the city of Toronto, in the county of York, did obtain letters patent of Canada for certain new and useful improvements in pumps known as \u201cthe cone pump and its connections,\u201d which letters patent bear date the 19th of July, 1872.\nAnd whereas, O.G. Peck, John Coleman and George Brett are desirous of acquiring an interest therein:\nNow this Indenture Witnesseth, that for and in consideration of the sum of six thousand five hundred dollars to me in hand paid, the receipts of which is hereby acknowledged, I have granted, sold and set over, and do hereby grant, sell and set over unto the said Peck, Coleman and Brett, all the right, title and interest which I have in the said invention, as secured to me by said letters patent, for, to and in the limits of the counties of York, Halton, Peel, Simcoe and Ontario, and in no other place or places, the same to be held and enjoyed by the said Peck, Coleman and Brett for their own use and behoof of their legal representatives, to the full end of the term for which the said letters patent are granted, as fully and entirely as the same would have been held by me, had this grant and sale not been made, save and except such portions of the above territory as may have been sold by the patentee before the 1st day April, 1877.\nIn testimony hereof I hereunto set my hand and affix my seal this 1st day of June, 1877. The memorandum of bargain and sale of same date is as follows:\nSaid Powell agrees to sell, and the said Peck agrees to buy, the said Powell\u2019s right, title, and interest in the said Powell\u2019s pump manufacturing business, together with the land on which the buildings stand, at or for the sum of four thousand five hundred dollars, payable as follows:\u2014Fifteen hundred dollars, the 16th day of June instant, with interest at 10 per cent.; also, the sum of three thousand dollars, to be secured by first mortgage on the property, (with insurance clauses,) and machinery and plant, stock on hand and chattels. One thousand dollars to be paid on the first day of June, 1878; one thousand dollars on the first day of June, 1879, and one thousand dollars on the first day of June, 1880, together with the interest at the rate of eight per cent. per annum, payable half\u2011yearly, on all unpaid sums, on, the first days of June and December in each and every year until fully paid and satisfied; the first payment of interest on the three thousand dollar mortgage on the 1st day of December next ensuing; the payment of the above-named $1,500 is to be made secure by assignment of mortgage from Mrs. Ogle R. Gowan to C.

Powell.\n(Signed), CHARLES POWELL, OGLE E. PECK, JOHN COLEMAN, GEORGE BRETT.\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\nThe right of extension being, under our law, secured by statute to the holder of the patent, whether he be the patentee of his assignee, I agree with Mr. Justice Patterson, that when Powell, by his agreement of 1st July, 1877, undertook \u201cto assign his interest in his pump patents to Mr. Peck for the counties of York, Peel, Simcoe, Halton and Ontario;\u201d and, when by his deed of the same date, he granted, sold., and set over to Peck, Coleman and Brett, \u201call the right, title and interest which I have in the said invention, as secured to me by said letters patent for, to, and in the said limits of the counties of York, etc.,\u201d he parted with all his interest, so far as the five counties were concerned; and that part of his interest, and, in fact, the only substantial part which existed when he executed these documents, was the statutory right of extension The deed has an habendum \u201cto the full end of the term for which the said letters patent are granted, as fully and entirely as the same would have been held and enjoyed by me, had this grant and sale not been made, save and except such portions of the above territory as may have been sold by the patentee before the first day of April, 1877.\u201d And I also agree with him that this had not the effect of restricting the previous grant to the term existing at the time so as to exclude the grantee from the right of renewal or extension; on the contrary, that it makes it more clear that, within the limits of the territory described, the grantor divests himself of all title up to the last moment of the current term, and thus to affirm the status of the grantee as being at, as well as before, the expiration of term of five years, the holder of the patent and the person entitled under section 17 to the extension, so far as the right had relation to that territory.\nAnd Powell having taken the extension in his own name for the whole Dominion, he should be decreed to execute such instruments or do whatever acts may be necessary to vest in Peck and Coleman their right and title in such extension. I think, therefore, that Peck, as to the case of Peck v. Powell, should have a decree affirming his right to the patent in these five counties (of York, Peel, Simcoe. Halton and Ontario,) and as to the case of Powell v. Peck, Powell should have a decree of foreclosure.\nSTRONG J.\u2014In the case of Peck v. Powell I agree in all respects with Mr. Justice Patterson, who has shown in his very clear judgment that the principles of the English and American cases as to the right of an assignee of a patent to the benefit of the statutory extension, do not apply to patents issued under the Dominion Statute applicable to this patent. In the United States the renewal was granted under the former Act of Congress (now repealed), not as a matter of right, but in the; discretion, judicial, or quasi-judicial, of commissioners after a hearing of the parties interested. In England, in like manner, the extension is granted by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, who are also bound to hear the parties.\nUnder the Dominion Statute applicable to this patent the extension is not a matter of judicial discretion, but can be claimed as an absolute right by the holder of the patent, just as a renewal of a term can be claimed by a lessee whose lease contains a covenant to that effect. And I am of opinion, therefore, that the analogy between an assignment of a patent granted under this statute, and the assignment of a lease with a right of renewal, is perfect. The appellants could not insist upon a partial renewal confined to the five counties in respect of which the respondent agreed to assign to them, but so soon as a renewal was obtained by the latter he became, under the words of the agreement to sell and assign all his right, title, and interest in the patent, a trustee of the renewed patent for the appellants in respect of those counties. This, then, being the proper construction and effect of the written agreement entered into between the parties, the decree pro- perly directed a specific performance of that agreement according to the construction mentioned, by ordering an assignment of the renewed patent for the renewed term of five years, unless the evidence shows that there was some mistake in the agreement, which, on the ordinary principles applicable to relief by way of specific performance, made it improper so to carry out the contract. After attentively considering the evidence, I see no sufficient ground for withholding from the appellants the relief sought to which they are prim\u00e2 facie entitled on the construction of the agreement in the way I have mentioned, and as it has been construed by Mr. Justice Patterson. I think, therefore, the decree was entirely right and ought to be affirmed, and that the order of the Court of Appeal to the contrary should be reversed. I may add that although I do not proceed entirely upon the same grounds as those the Chancellor placed his judgment upon, I am far from saying that if the case depended upon the considerations with which he dealt, the decree would have been wrong; on the contrary I incline to think that in this view also the appellants would have been entitled to succeed. I have no doubt whatever that the case in the aspect in which I view it, is open on the pleadings, the agreement is set forth in the bill and the material facts stated; it is not incumbent on a plaintiff in equity to set forth in his bill the arguments by which he intends to sustain his case, he can claim any relief which his allegations of fact entitle him to consistently with the relief prayed.\nI cannot, however, agree that the decree pronounced in Powell v. Peck was correct, nor can I assent to the modification of that decree proposed by Mr. Justice Patterson; on the contrary, for the reasons which I will proceed to state, it appears to me very clear that the order of the Court of Appeal reversing it ought to be affirmed, though I am led to this conclusion by reasons altogether different from those upon which the majority of the court of below acted. Although the agreement of the 1st June, 1870, was executory, being in terms an agreement to assign and not a final or completed assignment, the consideration paid and given for it was executed, part of that consideration being the mortgage, the foreclosure of which is now sought in this suit. A compliance with the equitable obligations to carry that agreement into specific execution was not a condition precedent to the right to enforce the security for the purchase-money, more especially after the purchasers had already to some extent had the benefit of the patent. Nothing can, as it appears to me, be better established both at law and in equity than that the obligations of the vendor, in respect of the assignment and conveyance of the patent, and those of the purchaser in respect of the payment of the purchase-money under this security given for it, had (having regard to the way in which the parties had acted under it) become distinct and independent. At law they would be clearly so regarded. Had the respondent (the mortgagee) sued at law upon the covenant in the mortgage deed to recover the money secured by it, there would have been no legal defence to the action founded on the omission or refusal of the plaintiff in the action to assign the renewed term. Then what equity could have been asserted to restrain such an action? None that I can see, for if the obligations of the vendor in respect of the assurance of the thing sold, and those of the purchaser in respect of the price, are independent at law, I am not aware of any principle upon which they could be differently construed in equity after the contract has been executed on the part of the purchaser to the extent of paying or securing the price, more especially after there has been a partial performance by the vendor and a partial enjoyment of the consideration for the mortgage by the purchaser, For to say that the vendor shall not in such a case be entitled to realise his security for the purchase money, is tantamount to saying that he shall have nothing for the valuable consideration the purchaser has already had the benefit of. The only way in which justice can be done in such a case is by treating the liabilities of the parties in equity, as at law, as independent of each other, and leaving the purchaser to his remedies upon the contract at law and in equity. This is very analagous to a case in which a purchaser of land under an executed contract of purchase sues his vendor in equity, for a specific performance of the covenant for further assurance. In such supposed case I have never understood that if the purchase money happens to be unpaid and secured by mortgage, the court will enjoin the mortgagee (that is the vendor) from enforcing his security until he has executed the further assurance. The only case so far as I know, or have been able to discover upon looking into authorities in which a court of equity has ever interfered with a security for the purchase money upon a ground of a breach of the vendor\u2019s covenants in the conveyance, is where there has been a breach of the covenant against incumbrances; in that case, which, however was always regarded as exceptional, some authorities decided in the Ontario Court of Chancery do, it is true, countenance the principle that the court will give the purchaser a lien, for the encumbrance which constitutes a breach of the covenant, upon the unpaid purchase-money secured by mortgage; in other words, it will set-off what the purchaser may be liable to pay to the holder of the paramount incumbrance against the unpaid purchase\u2011money secured by mortgage; and this, it was formerly held, would be done even against an assignee of the mort- gage[3]. This doctrine has, however, been much narrowed, if not entirely displaced, by a later decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Eagleson v. Howe[4], which latter case restored the authority of a former decision of the late Vice-Chancellor Esten (a very high authority on such a question) in the case of Tully v. Bradbury[5]. If, however, the case of Henderson v. Brown stood unimpeached, it would not help the mortgagor, since in the case to which it applied, the relief afforded amounted to nothing more than a set-off or recoupment of liquidated and ascertained sums, which is not the case here. If the purchase-money here had not been secured by an executed and completed security, but the provisions of the agreement respecting it had remained wholly executory, the case would have admitted of very different considerations, for, in that case, the court, in decreeing a specific performance, would have provided for the execution of the reciprocal covenants or stipulations on both sides.\nAccording to the principles upon which a court of equity acts in carrying into execution by its decree such contracts and agreements as are properly the subjects of its jurisdiction, the court will always execute the whole, or such portions of the agreement as remain executory, but if the parties have thought fit before the institution of the suit to carry out any of the terms of the contract, such executed portions will not be disturbed. But I cannot distinguish between the case of a mortgage given to secure the purchase-money and that of the actual payment of the money; and, in the latter case, I take it to be altogether out of the question to say that a court of equity would, if there appeared to be some further interest which a purchaser was entitled to call upon the vendor to assure to him, under a covenant for further assurance, the purchasers right to which was disputed by the vendor, and, in the judgment of the court, wrongfully disputed, merely upon that ground, decree a repayment of purchase-money already paid, more especially in a case like the present where part of the benefit of the purchase had been actually enjoyed by the purchaser. A fair test of the correctness of such a principle as that just adverted to is to put the converse case of a purchaser, suing in equity for a further assurance under the vendor\u2019s covenant to that effect, being met by the objection, that he was not entitled to maintain his suit for the reason that he was in default as regards the payment of his purchase-money. In that case I apprehend there could be no doubt that the non-payment of the purchase-money would be no defence to the relief by way of further assurance, and if this is a correct assumption, reciprocally, the refusal to execute a further assurance could be no defence to an action for the purchase-money, either at law or in equity. In such a case the liabilities would be regarded as distinct and independent. The case of Gibson v. Goldsmid[6], appears to be a clear authority for this. In that case a partnership had been dissolved, and certain foreign shares in a joint stock company, which had belonged to the partnership, were transferred to the plaintiff, it being recited in the deed of dissolution that they were transferable by delivery. The deed contained a covenant for further assurance. It afterwards appeared that the shares in question were not transferable by delivery, but that a formal written transfer was necessary, which being refused by the other partner, a suit was brought against him for specific performance of the covenant for further assurance, to which it was set up as a defence that the plaintiff was himself in default to the defendant in respect of a covenant, to indemnify him against partnership debts, contained in the same deed. To this defence, which was assumed by the court to be founded on fact, the Master of the Rolls in the first instance gave effect by making the payment of any balance found due in an account to be taken under the indemnity covenant, a condition precedent to the relief the plaintiff sought; but upon appeal the Lords Justices (Knight Bruce and Turner) reversed this decree and directed a performance of the covenant. In the valuable judgment of Lord Justice Turner the grounds of the decision are fully and clearly stated: He says it was argued on behalf of the defendant \u201cthat he who seeks equity must do equity;\u201d but, as the Lord Justice shows very clearly, that maxim is not adopted by the court in the wide and popular sense often attributed to it, but as meaning that a Court of Equity will impose upon the plaintiff, as a condition of relief, submission to equities which the defendant, if a plaintiff, could actively assert against him in respect of the same subject matter, but not a submission to such equitable rights as the defendant could actively, as plaintiff, enforce against the defendant in respect of distinct and independent matters; and he quotes, with approval, a passage from the judgment of Sir James Wigram in Hannam v. Keating[7] to this effect. The Lord Justice then proceeds to point out that in the case before the court the covenant for indemnity was a distinct and independent matter.\nThat case seems to me here an authority on two points: first, it establishes that even where covenants are still executory, they will, if independent and distinct, according to the proper legal construction of the instrument, be regarded as separate subjects of relief in equity; and secondly, that a defendant cannot merely, owing to his position on the record, and upon a construction and application of the maxim \u201cthat he who seeks equity must do equity,\u2019\u2019 insist on a right to interpose obstacles to the equities asserted by the plaintiff, which he could not assert as a plaintiff seeking relief. The present case is much stronger than that cited, for here the plaintiff is not seeking to enforce an executory covenant but something entirely foreign to the original agreement, namely, to realize the security given in satisfaction and discharge of the original liability for the payment of the price, and therefore to enforce an executed\u2014not an executory\u2014part of the original agreement. That the respondent\u2019s position on the record as plaintiff can make no difference, as compelling him to submit to a different measure of equity from that which the defendant could enforce against him if their relative positions were reversed, is also, as has been shown, a point conclusively settled by Gibson v. Goldsmid, and the cases there referred to.\nI repeat that if the agreement of the 1st June, 1870, had not been in any respect carried into execution by the appellants (the mortgagors), but if the clauses of that instrument to be performed on their part had been left, as the expression is, in fieri, then, no doubt, in decreeing specific performance, the court would have taken care to provide that they should not be compelled to pay their money or execute the security for it, until their rights under the contract were properly assured to them. But where the appellants executed the mortgage deed without insisting on a precedent or contemporaneous performance by the vendor of the obligations, on his part, they voluntarily put it out of the power of the court so to protect them and waived any claim which they might have had, to retain the purchase money in their own hands until the vendor\u2019s obligations to them were duly performed, and by so doing they must be considered as indicating an intention thenceforward to rely solely upon such remedies as they might have against the vendor upon the stipulations contained in the contract.\nThe result is, that my judgment must be that the decree in Peck v. Powell should be restored and affirmed, and the order of the Court of appeal reversing it should be discharged; and that the decree in Powell v. Peck, (the foreclosure suit) as entered under the order of the Court of Appeal, should be affirmed.\nThere should be no costs to either party of this appeal, and in the Court of Appeal there should be no costs. In the Court of Chancery Peck should have all the costs of Peck v. Powell as provided for by the decree in that case, and in Powell v. Peck the plaintiff should have only the costs of an ordinary foreclosure suit, to be added to the debt in the usual way.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I have had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that Powell always had an interest in the five counties. I think, therefore, the plaintiffs in that suit were entitled to recover. In fact, at the time that the agreement was made the patent right had expired within a few days, and, if he did not convey the right to the two renewals, and the right as far as these five counties were concerned in these renewals, he gave no value at all to the parties for the mortgage they gave as security for the payment of the amount agreed upon. I think, therefore, independently of the legal construction of the document, that the parties intended that should be the case. The difficulty I see in the matter is this: The second renewal has been obtained, the third may be obtained by Powell hereafter.\nIn the case of Powell v. Peck et al., I do not think Powell should obtain the benefit of the foreclosure of the mortgage and the payment of the mortgage money, until he conveys the right to the five counties to the defendants, and gives security that he will obtain an extension of the right for another five years, and give them the benefit of it. It appears to me that is necessary to secure them. Otherwise, he may not renew that patent; he may not pay the money on it and in that case these parties will lose; and they cannot themselves do so under the Act. Powell must renew it, and, if he does, he will become the trustee for the benefit of those parties as far as the five counties are concerned. I think, under the circumstances, as he has contested and kept back all these matters since almost the time of the first agreement, he ought not to get costs for the foreclosure of the mortgage or to get the foreclosure until he gives value. I think the two matters ought to be held, and referred back to the court for a decree to be passed in accordance with the suggestion of the judgment of my learned brother Gwynne on the subject, and left there for the court to take measures to secure the rights of the parties.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The late learned Chancellor of Ontario, Chancellor Spragge, before whom the above cases were tried together had such infinitely superior opportunity of eliminating the truth from the contradictory evidence of the respective parties who gave their evidence before him, than a judge of a Court of Appeal can possibly have, that I can have no hesitation in adopting the conclusion of fact arrived at by him, namely, that there was a representation made by Powell, the defendant in one of the above suits and the plaintiff in the other, that the patent in the cone pump an its connections, which, in the month of June, 1877, he was selling to Peck, Coleman and Brett, for the counties of York, Halton, Peel, Simcoe and Ontario was good for ten years, and that it was upon the faith of this representation that Peck, Coleman and Brett signed the agreement of the 1st of June, 1877, which was in evidence. In the learned Chancellor\u2019s criticism of the evidence bearing upon this question, I entirely concur. But I am of opinion, further, that the said agreement of the 1st June, 1877, and the assignment in pursuance thereof, dated on the same 1st of June, although executed later on in that month, were in their terms sufficient in equity, if not in law, to pass to Powell\u2019s said assignees all right and title to renewal of the letters patent for the said article, which, he (Powell) then had, as regards the said five counties, and to make him a trustee for his said assignees of any renewal of the said letters patent, which should be obtained by him as regards those counties. By the agreement Powell undertook to assign his interest in his pump patents to Mr. Peck for the above named counties, and by the assignment, after reciting that on the 19th day of July, 1872, he had obtained letters patent of that date for certain new and useful improvements in pumps known as \u201cThe Cone Pump and its Connections,\u201d and that O.G. Peck, John Coleman, and George Brett were desirous of acquiring an interest therein, it is witnessed, that for the consideration therein mentioned, he, the said Powell, did thereby grant, sell and set over unto the said Peck, Coleman and Brett:\u2014\nAll the right, title and interest which I have in the said invention as secured to me by said letters patent, for, to, and in the limits of the counties of York, Halton, Peel, Simcoe and Ontario, and in no other place or places, the same to be held and enjoyed to the said Peck, Coleman and Brett for their own use and behoof of their legal representatives to the full end and term for which the said letters patent are granted, as fully and entirely as the same would have been held by me had this grant and sale not been made.\nNow, by force of the Act respecting patents of invention then in force, 32 and 33 Vic., ch. 11, as a right, title and interest, which Powell then had in his invention as secured to him by the said letters patent of the 19th July, 1872, was the right, at, or before the expiration of the five years mentioned in the said letters patent of obtaining an extension of the said letters patent for another period of five years, and of obtaining again after the expiration of such second five years a further extension for other five years. It was thus, in point of fact, substantially true that the letters patent of the 19th July, 1872, were in the month of June, 1877, good for the period of ten years, which, as matter of fact, the learned chancellor has found that Powell represented them to be, and upon the faith of which representation Peck and his co\u2011purchasers completed the purchase; and as this right of obtaining such extensions of the said letters patent of the 19th July, 1872, was a right incident to the said letters patent and vested in Powell, as the then holder thereof, it was a right which the terms of assignment executed by Powell as affecting the said five counties were sufficient to pass in equity, if not in law, to Powell\u2019s assignees; and when Powell by an instrument duly executed under the statute procured to issue to himself an extension of the said letters patent for a second period of five years from the 19th of July, 1877, over the whole of the Dominion of Canada, or a much larger portion thereof than was composed within the five counties to which the assignment of the date of the 1st June was limited, he became a trustee of such extension of the said letters patent and of all benefit thereof, as to the said five counties for the use and behoof of his said assignees, and having wholly repudiated such position, and having insisted upon retaining for his own use and benefit such extension of the said letters patent as well over the said five counties as over all other parts of the Dominion, and upon his having the right of disposing of the said extension, as to the said five counties as he might think fit, the decree of the learned chancellor of the 2nd day of April, 1879, in the suit of Peck et al. v. Powell, that the defendant Powell should, by a good and sufficient deed, free from incumbrances, assign and transfer to the plaintiffs therein the patent right secured by such extension for such second period of five years as regards the said five counties, and that he should do all things necessary to convey and assign to the plaintiffs by a good and sufficient conveyance in the law, the further right to obtain a further extension of the said letters patent, as affecting the said five counties, for the further period of five years from the expiration of the said second period, such deed to be approved by the Master in case the parties should differ about the same, and that the said defendant should pay to the said plaintiffs all costs as were by the said decree directed to be paid to them, was a decree quite warranted by the fact as found by the learned chancellor, and by the true construction of the agreement and assignment in the plaintiff\u2019s bill, relied upon and proved in evidence. This relief, as well as relief by way of an injunction as prayed for by the bill, was relief properly granted to the said plaintiffs under the case made by the bill, and established in evidence, and under the prayer for general relief, as well as under the special relief prayed for by the bill. It may be that by force of the statute 46 Vic. ch. 19, the latter part of this decree would be now unnecessary if the defendant Powell should execute a good and sufficient deed in the law, transferring to the said plaintiffs all right, title, and interest vested in him, in and to the said extension of the said letters patent obtained in the month of July, 1877, in so far as the said five counties are concerned, so that the plaintiffs may register the same according to law, but in view of the persistent contestation and denial to the present time by the defendant Powell of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to the benefit of such extension, and the assertion by him of his own sole right and title therein and thereto, the plaintiffs are, in my opinion, entitled to the full benefit of the decree of the learned chancellor for the execution by the defendant of a good and sufficient deed in the law, transferring to the plaintiffs, free from incumbrances, such extension of the said letters patent and all the said respondent\u2019s right, title and interest therein and thereto as regards the said five counties.\nThe case of Powell v. Peck et al. was a bill praying for payment of money secured by mortgage on certain lands therein mentioned, and in default thereof for a sale of the mortgaged lands. To this bill the defendants set up by way of defence the agreement for the sale by Powell of his interest in the cone pump patent over the afore-named five counties, and the deed of transfer thereof, as set out in the bill of complaint at the suit of Peck et al. v. Powell, and averring by way of defence the several matters alleged in their bill and the payment into court of the sum of $735, in pursuance of an order made in the said suit wherein they were plaintiffs, they prayed, by way of cross relief, relief similar to that prayed for in their bill of complaint, and they, by their said answer, offered to pay to the plaintiff Powell the sum for which the mortgage in question was given, in accordance with the terms of the said mortgage as soon as the plaintiff should make good his representations and assurances, but they submitted that until the said plaintiff should do so they were not under any default, and that the plaintiff had no claim against them in respect of the said mortgage. The plaintiff, having joined issue to the said answer, relied upon the contention which he set up by way of defence to the bill at the suit of Peck et al. Both cases were tried together, and at the same time as the learned chancellor made the decree above set out in the case of Peck et al. v. Powell, lie made a decree in the mortgage suit to the effect that the bill of complaint of the plaintiff Powell should be dismissed with costs, but without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to take proceedings on the mortgage in his bill mentioned, so soon as he should make good to the defendants, Peck et al. the consideration for which the said mortgage was given. Assuming the decree of the learned chancellor in the case at the suit of Peck et al. v. Powell to be, as I think it was, correct, I can see no substantial ground of objection to his decree in the case of Powell v. Peck et al., the plaintiff therein having persisted throughout, as indeed he still did, upon these appeals, that all that he transferred or agreed to transfer to Peck et al. was an interest in the cone pump and its connections until the 19th July, 1877.\nIn my opinion, therefore, these appeals should be allowed with costs to be paid by the respondent to the appellants, and as the appellants by their answer to the respondent\u2019s bill have offered to pay to the respondent the sum for which the mortgage was given, so soon as the plaintiff in that suit should make good to them the benefit of their purchase of the patent right in the said cone pump over the said five counties for the full period of such patent right, we may, I think, vary the decrees as made in the Court of Chancery by consolidating the two suits into one and directing one decree to be made therein to the effect following: Direct the suits to be consolidated and declare that the agreement of the 1st June, 1877, in the second paragraph of the bill of complaint of Peck et al. v. Powell is valid and binding upon the parties thereto, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to have the representations of the defendant Powell in said paragraph set out made good and decree the same accordingly. Declare that the said instrument under the hand and seal of the said Powell of the date of the same 1st of June, whereby the said Powell purported to grant, sell and set over unto the said Peck, Coleman and Brett in the agreement mentioned all right, title and interest, which he, the said Powell, had in the said invention of the cone pump and its connections therein mentioned secured to him by letters patent thereof as respects the counties of York, Halton, Peel, Simcoe and Ontario, was sufficient to transfer, and did transfer to the grantees therein named all his, the said Powell\u2019s, right, title and interest in and to the said letters patent and to the said patented article, as regards the said five counties, including in such rights and interest all right to the benefit of any extension that might be granted of the said letters patent under the provisions of the statute in that behalf (32 and 33 Vic., ch. 11), in so far as such five counties are concerned, and declare that the patentee, Powell, having by an instrument duly executed under the provisions of the said statute procured to himself an extension of the said letters patent of the 19th July, 1872, for five years from the 18th of July, 1877, over the whole of the Dominion of Canada, he thereby became and now is a trustee for his said assignees named in the said deed of transfer of the 1st of June, 1877, of the benefit of such extension, in so far as the same relates to and affects the said five counties. Order and decree that the said Powell do forthwith assign and transfer to the plaintiffs, Peck and Coleman, by a good and sufficient conveyance in the law free from all incumbrance, all benefit of, and all the right, title and interest of the said Powell in and to the said extension of the said letters patent from the 19th July, 1877, in virtue of the instrument securing or purporting to secure the sums to him in so far as such extension relates to the said five counties. Such conveyance to be approved by the master, in case the parties differ, about the same, in which all propel parties are to join as the master shall direct, order and decree, that the defendant Powell do pay to the plaintiffs Peck and Coleman, all costs of the said consolidated suits, less \u2018 such costs as shall be taxed as consequent upon adjournment of the hearing of the cause of Peck at al. v. Powell, obtained upon the part of the plaintiff therein, which costs are to be taxed and allowed to Powell by way of set-off against the costs hereby made payable by him; and upon the execution by Powell of such good and sufficient deed as aforesaid, decree that an account be taken of what remains due to Powell upon the security of the mortgage in the pleadings mentioned in case the parties differ about the same with the usual decree for sale of the mortgaged premises in default of payment of costs up to the hearing, to be paid by Powell, and subsequent costs and further directions reserved.\nIn Peck et al. (plaintifs) v. Powell (defendant)\u2014Appeal allowed without costs.\nIn Peck et al. (defendants) v. Powell (plaintiff)\u2014Judgment of Court of Appeal varied as to costs of that court.

The mortgage conveyed the unexpired portion of the current term, and \u201cevery renewed term\u201d K., shortly after giving the mortgage, conveyed the equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises to one O\u2019S. for a nominal consideration, and in trust to carry out certain negotiations for K., who then left the country and was absent for several years. During his absence, the lease of the ground mortgaged to the company expired, and was renewed in the name of O\u2019S.\nDefault having been made in the payment of interest under the mortgage, a suit was brought against O\u2019S. for foreclosure, the mortgagees having knowledge of his want of interest in the premises. Prior to such suit, O\u2019S., fearing that such proceedings would be taken against him, had executed a deed of re-conveyance of the equity of redemption to K., but such deed was never delivered.\nO\u2019S. then filed an answer and a disclaimer of interest in such suit, but he was afterwards persuaded by the mortgagees to withdraw the same, and consent to a decree, and a final order of foreclosure was made against him. Pursuant to this order the company subsequently sold the mortgaged premises to the defendant D. for a sum less than the amount due under the mortgage; the deed to D. recited the proceedings in foreclosure, and purported to be made pursuant to the final order of foreclosure.\nK. brought a suit against the company and D. to have the decree re-opened and cancelled, and the deed to D. set aside, and prayed to be allowed to come in and redeem the premises.\nHeld,\u2014affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Strong and Henry J J. dissenting,\u2014that even if the decree of foreclosure was improperly obtained, and consequently void, yet the sale and conveyance to D. were a sufficient execution of the power of sale in the mortgage, and passed the renewed term conveyed by the mortgage.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of Proudfoot V.C. In August, 1875, the appellant mortgaged certain leasehold premises in Toronto to the respondents, which mortgage contained a proviso, that in default of the payment of the moneys thereby secured the mortgagees should have power to sell the mortgaged premises by private contract or at public auction, and without previous notice to the mortgagor.\nIn December, 1876, the appellant conveyed the equity of redemption in the said mortgaged premises to one O\u2019Sullivan for a nominal consideration, which conveyance, the appellant alleged, was only intended to convey such equity of redemption in trust for certain purpose agreed upon between him and O\u2019Sullivan.\nThe respondents took possession of the mortgaged premises in January, 1877, and the same were leased to one Patrick Scully for five years from the first day of January in that year, the appellant being a party to the indenture of lease.\nThe original lease to appellant expired in July, 1878, and O\u2019Sullivan procured a renewal in his own name, appellant being then absent from the Province and his whereabouts not known.\nIn November, 1878, O\u2019Sullivan, being threatened with suit for foreclosure of the mortgage, &c., conveyed the equity of redemption to appellant by deed purporting to be executed 15th November in that year, having previously notified respondents that he had no interest in the mortgaged premises, but that the same belonged to the appellant.\nOn 21st November, 1875, respondents filed a bill against O\u2019Sullivan for foreclosure of said mortgage, and the latter at first took steps to defend such suit and filed a disclaimer, but he afterwards withdrew such defence and consented to a decree against him in the suit foreclosing his equity of redemption in the said mortgaged premises, which decree was made in May, 1880, In September, 1881, the respondents sold the premises to the defendant Damer, reciting in their deed the proceedings against O\u2019Sullivan and their title to the premises under the final order of foreclosure in such suit.\nThe appellant only ascertained the fact of the suit against O\u2019Sullivan and the making of the decree on his return to the Province of Ontario subsequent to their occurrence, and he notified the defendant Damer that he was interested in the premises before the said sale, and also notified the respondents not to sell. After the sale he filed a bill to have the final order of foreclosure re-opened and cancelled, the sale to Damer set aside and an account taken of what was due on the mortgage.\nProudfoot V.C. before whom the cause was heard, made a decree in favor of the appellant, holding that the decree of foreclosure was improperly obtained on account of the knowledge in respondents of want of title in O\u2019Sullivan, and ordered the account prayed for by the respondents. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, holding that notwithstanding the recital of the proceedings of foreclosure in the deed to Damer, the same could operate as an execution of the power of sale in the mortgage, and that such power authorized a sale of the renewal term as well as of the original.\nThis appeal was brought from the last-mentioned judgment.\nDalton McCarthy Q.C. and Plumb for appellant:\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal have found that, although the company had assumed to sell by virtue of their title acquired by foreclosure, yet the sale, though invalid upon the strength of their title, could be upheld as an exercise of their power of sale in the mortgage, because\u20141. The power of sale, though only expressed to be exercisable upon the original term of years mortgaged was nevertheless exercisable upon the renewal term; and 2. That although it was the expressed intention of the company to convey to Damer by virtue of their foreclosure title recited upon the face of the conveyance, yet the title could, to the extent of its invalidity, be fed out of the unexercised power of sale.\nUpon the first point, Mr. Justice Osler delivers the judgment of the court, Mr. Justice Burton merely saying that after considerable doubt he concurs; and the ground on which the learned judge bases his conclusion is, that a renewal term is considered as a graft upon the old lease, and \u201csubject in equity to the same mortgage as affected it\u201d[2].\nNow it must be borne in mind that the mortgage from Kelly to the Imperial of the 7th August, 1875, was by way of demise or sublease under the then current term. Habendum is as follows: \u201cUnto the said mortgagees, their successors and assigns for the residue now unexpired of the term of years thereby created, and every renewed term, save and except one day thereof.\u201d\nThe covenant for further assurance extends to the \u201cterm of years\u201d only, but not to renewal terms, and the power of sale by express language only extends to and is exercisable upon the \u201cterm of years or such part or parts thereof as they may deem expedient.\u201d\nIn order to warrant the conclusion of Mr. Justice Osler, the authorities which he cites should show that not only is the renewal term subject to the same equities which affected the original term, but also to every legal incident created by express contract between the parties, and advisedly limited to the duration only of the original term.\nThe cases cited by the learned judge at page 538 of the report, show that there will adhere an equitable lien upon the renewal term corresponding in equity to the legal charge created upon the original term\u2014but not one of them goes the length of even raising the suggestion that a power of sale or other arbitrary remedy for enforcing the lien by the unaided hand of the person claiming it, of his own mere motion and strict right, without the assistance of a court of equity, will be implied as an incident to or attribute of that equitable lien.\nThe very fact in the cases referred to, that the persons asserting the right had to resort to courts of equity for a declaration of it, negatives the presumption of the continuance of a remedy whose exercise would have lain in their own hands.\nThe doctrine of the attachment by way of equitable lien upon the renewal term of a mortgage or other charge previously existing upon the expired term is a creation of the courts of equity, and can be called into action only by the intervention of the remedial power of the court; and it is submitted that the learned judges of the Court of Appeal lost sight of the origin of the principle and unwarrantably extended it in declaring that there was inherent in that equitable lien an incident which enabled its exercise at the mere motion of the claimant lien-holder without the intervention or aid of the court.\nPowers of sale must be free from doubt, and will not be implied in a subsequent mortgage. Curling v. Shuttleworth[3]; Coote on Mortgages[4]: Nor will a power of sale be implied in a conveyance absolute in form by way of mortgage. Pearson v. Benson[5]; Fisher on Mortgages[6].\nA power of sale exercisable without notice has been held to be oppressive. Miller v. Cook[7]. As to the second point decided by the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, that although it was the expressed intention of the company to convey to Damer by virtue of their foreclosure title, recited upon the face of the conveyance, yet the title could, to the extent of its invalidity, be fed by the unexercised power of sale. It is admitted in all the cases cited and by the learned judges in the Court of Appeal themselves, that where one has a power and an interest, the question of the execution or not of the power is wholly decided by the apparent intention to execute or not to execute it.\nThe apparent intention of the grantors, the company, in this instance, was to convey by virtue of their supposed interest acquired by foreclosure and not by virtue of their power of sale, and the deed upon its face bears evidence of the fact, and in this view of the case the authorities cited in the judgment of Mr. Justice Osler are authorities in favor of the appellant, notably Maundrell v. Maundrell[8]. See also Rawle on Covenants[9]; Bowman v. Taylor[10]; Lainson v. Tremere[11]; Carver v. Jackson[12]; Van Rensselaer v. Kearney[13].\nUpon either or both of these points the appellant submits that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed.\nJames Maclennan, Q.C., for respondents:\nThe sale to Damer, whether treated as a sale after foreclosure, or as an exercise of the power of sale contained in the mortgage to them, was effectual, and the same should not be disturbed. See Grugeon v. Gerrard[14].\nGalt, counsel for Damer, contended that he was a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value of the said lands and pre- mises without notice of any equities in favor of the appellant, and that he was entitled to protect his purchase by claiming the benefit of all the rights which his co-respondents had at the time of the assignment by them to him.\nThe learned counsel also relied on the judgments delivered in the court below and cases therein cited[15].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J., after reciting portions of the mortgage and of the deed to Damer, proceeded as follows:\u2014\nThe recitals would seem to be inconsistent with the execution of the power, but the nature and effect of the instrument is entirely consistent therewith, and demonstrates, I think, a practical intent to execute the power, though, no doubt, the recital would show that the deed was executed on the assumption that the foreclosure was valid and that the property had thereby absolutely passed to the mortgagees.\nThe power authorized the defendants to convey the interest mortgaged absolutely; the deed executed purports to do, in express terms, that which the mortgagees had the right to do, if not under the decree of foreclosure then under the power.\nThen why should the deed, notwithstanding the recital, not receive its legal effect, and be treated as a good execution of the power, the legal effect of the deed being precisely the same, whether under a valid decree, or, there being no valid decree, under the power, the intent being to do what the decree, if valid, would authorize, or what, if invalid, the power would authorize.\nAs, therefore, the mortgagees had power to give the deed effect, either by virtue of the foreclosure or of the power, the legal effect of the deed being strictly in accordance with the power, that is to say, the deed intending to do the very thing which could be done under the power, why should it not have that effect? The mortgagees clearly intended to convey the property absolutely; the power gave them authority so to convey, and in conveying it absolutely they necessarily executed the power; and it not being alleged that the recital in any way affected the sale or the plaintiff\u2019s interest under it, or that he was in any way damnified by the execution of the power in the manner it was done. Where the nature of the interest is in accordance with the power, and the intention is clear to effect that which the power authorized to be done, I think we should be departing from recognized principles if we held that it does not demonstrate an intention to execute the power, or that the power is not thereby executed.\nThere can, I think, be no doubt that an instrument may be an exercise of a power, though on its face it does not so purport. In Blake v. Marnell[16] the Lord Chancellor says:\nIt is perfectly clear and well established that the recital of a power s not essential to the due execution of it; it is sufficient if the estate over which the power extends is dealt with in a manner which can be effectual only by reference to the power.\nIt was argued that the power did not extend to the renewed lease. I think it did; that it was the intention of the parties that the mortgagees should have the security of the power of sale for realizing the money secured by the mortgage so long as the mortgage remained unpaid, and it should, therefore, be held to cover the renewed term, as well as the term originally assigned.\nI think the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed, and this appeal dismissed with costs. STRONG J.\u2014I entirely agree with both the courts below, that the foreclosure proceedings were imperfect to the extent that the decree was a nullity. Even if the purchaser Damer had had no notice that the decree was valueless for the reason that the equity of redemption was not vested in the defendant I should have thought it no bar to the plaintiff\u2019s right to redeem, but as it is it is plain that he had notice\nThat the power of sale extended to the renewed term is, I think, clear. The words of the habendum include any renewed term which, indeed, without such words would be a graft on the mortgagees\u2019 interest, though but for the words of the power of sale, or, rather, one word in the power of sale, the latter might not have extended to the renewed interest. As the power is framed, however, it is very clear that it does comprehend a renewed term, for it is not merely a power to sell \u201cthe said term of years,\u201d in which case it would have been confined to the current term, but to sell \u201cthe said land,\u201d meaning, of course, all interest in the lands to which the mortgage applied.\nUpon the remaining question, however, I differ very widely from the Court of Appeal. I quite agree in the law, or rather the rule, of construction as stated by both the learned judges in the Court of Appeal whose judgment we have, Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Osler, but I differ from them in their application of it to the case before us.\nThe rule of construction is laid down by Lord Eldon in Maundrell v. \\Maundrell[17], by Lord Romilly in Carver v. Richards[18], and by Lord Justice Christian in Minchin v. Minchin[19], and that rule, I apprehend, may be expressed as follows: If a man has a power but no interest, or not such an interest as will enable him to pass the estate which he purports to convey, he will by his conveyance, although he uses words applicable only to the conveyance of an interest and not to an appointment or the execution of a power, be held to have intended to execute the power, more especially in favor of a purchaser for value. This is as high as the rule can be put, perhaps more strongly than it is found actually expressed anywhere. And it should be added that even if it is shown that the party had no knowledge of the existence of the power, that makes no difference, it will still be presumed, in the absence of any indication of an intention to the contrary, that he purposed to execute it. The reason of the rule is said to be this, that when a person proposes to convey an, estate it will be assumed that he intended his assurance should operate in any possible way in which it could operate, provided no contrary intention is indicated. In some cases it is said that where there is a general intention to convey it will be presumed, in the absence of any indication of a contrary intention, that the party meant to do so by the exercise of all powers vested in him which may be requisite to make his conveyance effectual. And it makes no difference that the grantor was not even aware of the existence of the power. But in every judicial expression of the rule it will be found that there is an exception of the case where a contrary intention appears on the face of the deed. And it is not enough that it may be inferred from the circumstances that the grantee would have executed the power if he had been aware that he possessed it, if the terms of the deed are inconsistent with the actual execution of it[20].\nFrom some authorities it might be supposed that if the deed can take effect at all by way of conveyance of an interest, whatever, that interest may be, it will not be presumed that there was an intention to execute the power, but that is not the latest and best statement of the principle. If it were it might be said here that as the legal estate vested in the mortgagee passed, the deed would operate as a mere transfer of the mortgage, but I admit with the Court of Appeal, that this is not enough to exclude the operation of the rule of construction mentioned, for I think it sufficiently appears here on the face of this deed that there was an intention to pass an absolute interest to the grantee, and that the deed was not intended to take effect as the mere assignment of a mortgage. That the foregoing is a correct statement of the law sufficiently appears from the case of Carver v. Richards[21], referred to in the judgments of the learned judges in the court below, and also from Minchin v. Minchin, ubi sup, where Lord Justice Christian states the law in terms which Mr. Farwell, in his treatise on Powers[22] has summarized as follows:\u2014\nAll that is requisite is an intention on the part of the donee that the fund shall pass to some one who is an object of the power. When that intent appears, and the only means which the person so intending possesses of giving effect to it is by an exercise of a power of which he is donee, then, though his mind is a mere blank as to the execution of power, though he has forgotten its existence, or never knew he had it, the law will presume that he must have meant to make use of the only means within his reach of achieving his express purpose. This is subject to one exception, which is theoretical rather than practical. When what we find is not merely the absence of a positive intention to exercise the power, but the demonstrated presence of a positive intention not to exercise it, then it will be held not to have been exercised, even though the intention to pass the subject is expressed.\nThe question, and I freely admit the only question here is, whether there does appear on the face of the deed any expression of an intention contrary to or inconsistent with the design of executing the power of sale. In most of the cases we find that the question has gen- erally arisen with reference to a general power of appointment, and by a general power I mean a power which the donee can exercise in favor of any objects and in any way he thinks fit and in respect of which he is in no sense a trustee for another. I concede, however, that though a power of sale in a mortgage is neither a power over the legal estate (for that estate is actually vested in the mortgagee) but is a mere equitable power to be executed for the benefit of the mortgagor as well as for that of the mortgagee, there is no reason why the same principle should not be applied as in the case of general powers of appointment of the legal estate.\nIt must, however, be remembered that the power of sale is a power to sell and convey the equity of redemption only, and that the conveyance of the mortgagee for the purpose of carrying out a sale under it operates on the legal estate as a conveyance strictly and not as the execution of a power, from whence it follows that if the equity of redemption is gone by foreclosure or otherwise the power is also extinguished.\nThe application of these principles in the present case depends altogether on whether it appears by the deed of the first of October, 1881, whereby the loan company conveyed to the defendant Damer, that the mortgagees did not intend to execute their power of sale. This deed contains a recital, as follows:\u2014\nAnd whereas default being made in payment of the moneys due under the said mortgage from said William Kelly to the Imperial Loan and Investment Company, the said Imperial Loan and Investment Company exhibited their bill of complaint in the Court of Chancery for Ontario, and thereafter by an order of the said court made in the said cause, and dated the fifteenth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and eighty, it was ordered that the said Dennis Ambrose O\u2019Sullivan stand absolutely debarred and foreclosed of and from all right, title and equity of redemption of, in and to the said leasehold premises, I regard this recital as amounting in effect to a recital that the power of sale was extinguished and gone. It recites the fact of the foreclosure and the legal effect and consequence of the foreclosure was of course to destroy the power which was incidental to the equity of redemption, the estate which was cut off and barred by such a decree. It is, therefore, for the present purpose, tantamount to a recital that the mortgagees had become the absolute owners of the estate, and that the power of sale no longer existed. Had there been such a recital in terms, there could have been no question that the deed would have disclosed an intention not to execute the power, and I am unable to distinguish between the extreme case which I put and that before the court. I am therefore of opinion that the recital demonstrates a very clear intention not to execute the power of sale by an exercise of which alone can the plaintiff\u2019s right of redemption in the present case be barred.\nI have heard no answer to this proposition or argument, the factum does not contain any, and all the authorities I have looked at suggest none. I am compelled, therefore, to say that I arrive at this conclusion without the slightest doubt or hesitation. Although, as I have said, the principle upon which a general power of appointment is held to be executed by a deed not referring to it and containing only operative words technically applicable to a conveyance may be applied in a case like the present, yet I must add that there are reasons why the expression of a contrary intention which, in the case of a power of appointment may be considered to some extent technical only, is in the case of a sale by a mortgagee as in the present instance, substantial as well as technical. The mortgagee is, in respect of the power, a trustee to some extent for the mortgagor, and is bound to use reasonable care and diligence in selling; it is not, as in the case of a power to appoint in favor of any persons the donee may please to select as the objects of his bounty altogether a matter of indifference to him whether he carries out his purpose by a conveyance of an absolute estate or by an exercise of the power of sale; a mortgagee, who supposes himself to have the absolute estate, may for reasons of his own, choose to sell for a price less than he would think himself bound to demand if he knew he was actually executing a fiduciary power in respect of which he was liable to be called to account by the mortgagor. I mention this not at a reason why any other or different mode of construing this deed than that before stated should be adopted, but as a reason why the rule in question should here be strictly applied, as we should otherwise be making a precedent which might in other cases involve practical consequences to the prejudice of the mortgagors.\nThe principle of construction before mentioned as applicable to powers is not confined to such cases but is general, and is also the test applied when a grantee who has prim\u00e2 facie a right to elect that the conveyance under which he takes stall operate either at common law or under the statute of uses, is sought to be restrained to one mode of operation. Hayes on Conveyancing[23].\nIt also applies when a person, having both a beneficial and fiduciary interest in property conveys by general words of conveyance by which prim\u00e2 facie he will (notwithstanding the case of Faussett v. Carpenter[24] which, according to Lord St. Leonards, is now generally regarded as an erroneous decision) he intended to convey all his interest as well that which he has as a trustee as that of which he is the beneficial owner, unless from the recitals of the deed a contrary intention can be gathered. Strong v. Hawkes[25].\nI refer to these other instances for the purpose of showing that from the wide extent of the rule, any innovation upon it may have an application to cases not confined to the circumstances presented by the case now before us.\nI am of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to a decree for redemption and that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIES J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nHENRY J.\u2014The appellant was mortgagor of the premises in question and the respondent company were the mortgagees. Subsequently to the mortgage the appellant assigned the equity of redemption to one O\u2019Sullivan, but in trust to raise money and pay off the mortgage. The appellant removed to California and his address was not known to O\u2019Sullivan when subsequently the respondent company threatened to foreclose O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s interest. He, therefore, having no interest in the property and wishing to be clear of further responsibility about it, on the 15th November 1878, re-conveyed the property to the appellant. On the 21st November, 1878, the company knowing that O\u2019Sullivan had no beneficial interest in the property, filed a bill against him to foreclose the mortgage, setting it forth and alleging that he was entitled to the equity of redemption.\nO\u2019Sullivan, after having filed an answer and disclaimer of the interest in the property, was induced subsequently by the solicitor of the company to withdraw his answer and disclaimer and consent to a decree for foreclosure, which was passed and hears date the 14th January, 1879. A final order of foreclosure was made on the 15th of May, 1880.\nIn September, 1881, the company agreed to sell the property to the defendant Damer for $20,000, which was less than the amount of their claim. Before the contract was completed by a conveyance, the appellant, as admitted by Damer in his evidence, notified him not to purchase the property as he had an interest in it.\nOn the 1st October, 1881, the company executed a conveyance to Damer by which after reciting the original lease, the assignment thereof to Kelly, that Kelly had, on the 7th August, 1875, assigned the same and all his interest therein by way of mortgage to the company, that he had subsequently assigned all his interest to O\u2019Sullivan, whose equity of redemption therein had been foreclosed by the final order of foreclosure of the 15th May, 1880, that in pursuance of the covenant for renewal, Northcote, the original lessor had, on the 1st July, 1878, executed a lease of, and demised the land to O\u2019Sullivan for 21 years, and the said lease, term and premises had become vested in and were then lawfully held by the company, and that the assignee had agreed with the assignors to purchase the lease and premises; the company granted, &c., to Damer, \u201cthe said parcel of land and all other the premises comprised in and demised by the said in part recited indenture of lease together with the said indenture of lease and the right of renewal thereof,\u201d &c. Habendum to the assignee for and during the residue of the said term granted by the said indenture of lease and the estate term and right of renewal, if any, and other interest of the assignors therein.\nThe instrument contains the usual covenant for title right to convey and further assurance.\nThe learned judge held that the decree and final order of foreclosure were void as against the plaintiff, that O\u2019Sullivan could not be treated as a trustee within G.O. Chy. 58,61, O.J. Act, Rule 95, for the purpose of represent him, and that even if he could be so treated, yet that the re-conveyance had been executed before the filing of the bill; therefore the plaintiff was at that time the owner of the equity of redemption and the proper party to the action, of which the company had notice.\n(2) That the sale to the defendant Damer could not be supported as an exercise of the power of sale in the mortgage, as it did not profess to be made under the power, but under the title gained by means of the foreclosure suit.\n(3) The plaintiff was entitled to redeem, subject to Damer\u2019s right to compensation for improvements.\nThe questions to be determined are:\n(1) Whether the decree and final order of foreclosure in the action against O\u2019Sullivan affected the rights and interests of the appellant.\n(2) If not, whether the defendant Damer is affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings.\n(3) If he cannot rely upon a title acquired by his co-defendant under the foreclosure, whether their conveyance to him can be upheld as an effectual execution of the power of sale in their mortgage.\nThe first question is answered by all the learned judges in the court below, and I think properly, that the decree and order did not affect the rights or interests of the appellant.\nAs to the second question I have only to say that after notice of the appellant\u2019s interests he can stand in no better position than that of the company; and now as to the third and only remaining, can the conveyance to Damer be upheld as an effectual execution of the power of sale in the mortgage?\nIt is no doubt well settled law, that where a party makes a conveyance under a power, it is unnecessary to refer to the power, and that where a party has an interest and a power and makes a conveyance beyond his interest, but within the power, the conveyance is to be understood as an execution of the power for the same reason, namely, that it is unnecessary to set forth the power, and as if the company in this case had made the conveyance without having had recourse to measures for foreclosure and decree and order.\nIn the case of Maundrell v. Maundrell[26] cited by Mr. Justice Osler herein, where a man had interests in two different estates and powers over them, he executed an instrument reciting the power over one of them and his interest in it, and as to it expressly executed his power and conveyed his interest by lease and release. As to the other, he recited, not that he had power to appoint, but that he was seized in fee and conveyed his interest in it by lease and release. It was held that the latter estate passed out of his interest only, and not by force of the power, from the apparent intention not to execute the power.\nIn this case the respondent company in their conveyance show most clearly their intention not to execute the power. There is no reference to the power but it recites the lease to the appellant and the mortgage, his subsequent assignment to O\u2019Sullivan and the foreclosure of O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s equity of redemption; a further lease from the lessor of the appellant to O\u2019Sullivan in pursuance of a covenant for renewal, and alleges that the last mentioned lease, term and premises had become vested in and were lawfully held by the company.\nIf the decision in Maundrell v. Maundrell above referred to is correct then we must hold that the conveyance to Damer was made under the foreclosure and not in the execution of the power. A sheriff or other officer making a levy or distress under a defective warrant may justify under another and a good one. The issue in such a case relates to the act of levy or distress. If the officer was justified by either warrant the taking was lawful and that is the only question; or if the officer was justified in the act of taking, no wrong was done\u2014but that is a case very different from the one under consideration. In fact, the law as to powers and their execution is settled upon principles peculiar to it and them, and in the application of them little can be gained by analogy from decisions on other subjects, and each case must, pretty much, depend on its own circumstances.\nThe Lord Chancellor says, Roake v. Denn[27]:\nNow the law applicable to this question, as has been stated by the Lord Chief Baron, has been settled by a long series of decisions, from the case which has been referred to in the time of Sir Edward Coke, Sir Edward Gere\u2019s case, down to the present time, that if the will, which is insisted upon as the execution of the power, does not refer to the power, and if the disposition of the will can be satisfied without their being considered to be an execution of the power unless there are some other circumstances to show that it was the intention of the devisor to execute the power of appointment by the will, under such circumstances the courts have uniformly decided that the will is not to be considered to be an execution of the power. Now in this case there is no reference in the will to the power; there was other property in the county of Surrey, sufficient to satisfy the terms of the will; and there is no circumstance whatever to satisfy my mind, as I conceive it ought to be satisfied, that there was a manifest intention in the testatrix to execute an appointment under the power given by this will.\nIf the company had nothing but the power, the conveyance in question, we would, I think, be bound to conclude to have been made in execution of it; if the company had not, as in this case, set out their title by the foreclosure. Independently of that foreclosure the company had an interest as mortgagees, and that interest was covered by the conveyance to Damer. They had therefore an interest to be assigned but they had no other unless by the foreclosure or by an execution of the power by a conveyance which, though silent as to the power, did not show they were not acting in the execution of it.\nThey had given one or more notices to the appellant that they would sell or lease under the power, but it is shown they never did.\nMr. Boulton, their solicitor, in his evidence, on being shown one of the notices identified it and said: \u201cYes, and we attempted to sell and failed in so doing, and after several efforts to realize upon the property in some way, by lease or otherwise, I got instructions to take proceedings for foreclosure;\u201d and Mr. Boulton admits that the sale was not made under the power but under the foreclosure.\nSuch being the case how can we, in opposition to facts so fully and plainly proved, arrive at the conclusion that there was any execution of the power. I can find no case or decision to sustain the proposition that where a party in the conveyance distinctly shows he is not executing a power that conveyance can be held to be an execution of it. See Sugden on Powers[28], He says: \u201cIt is intention that in these cases governs, therefore, where it can be inferred that the power was not meant to be exercised, the court cannot consider it as executed.\u201d Again at p. 353: \u201c A power will not be deemed to be executed contrary to the intention of the party where he supposes a different power to be vested in him.\u201d\nThe case of Maundrell v. Maundrell is on principle very similar to this one. In that case the instrument recited the power as one of the properties, and in the other was recited not that he had the power but that he was seized in fee and so conveyed it. Here the company in their conveyance did not recite the power but a title in fee through the foreclosure. I think to decide in favor of the respondents in this case would be to reverse the judgment in the other case with which I have compared it, which, as far as I can discover, has never been overruled. I am of opinion, for the reasons given, that the appeal herein should be allowed and the usual decree for redemption in the court below to be made with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed. The mortgage clearly gives the power to sell, and the sale, as it was made, must be held to be an execution of that power. To hold the contrary would be to defeat the intention of the mortgage.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\nSolicitors for respondents Imperial Loan Co.: Boulton, Rolph & Brown.\nSolicitors for respondent Damer: Caston & Galt.\n[1] 11 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPossession fraudulently obtained by defendant\u2014Plaintiff not put on proof of title\u2014Tax sale\u2014Rev. Stats. Ont, ch. 40 sec. 37; 33 Vic., ch. 33.\nN., respondent, as assignee in insolvency of H., who bought a lot of land from the purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale for taxes, filed a bill in Chancery under the Ontario Administration of Justice Act against W. & O\u2019N. (appellants), who were in possession, praying inter alia that defendants be ordered to deliver up possession of the lands and to account for the value of trees, &c., cut down and removed. W. by his answer adopted O\u2019N.\u2019s possession and claimed under conveyance from the Crown and impeached the validity of the sale for taxes. O\u2019N. by his answer alleged he was in possession under W. At the trial it was proved that H. gave a lease of the lot to one T. for four years, and that O\u2019N. went to T. while he was still in possession, and by fraudulent representations induced T. to leave the place and thereby obtained possession for the benefit of W. The Court of Chancery for Ontario held that appellants were obliged to yield up possession to the respondent before asserting any title in themselves. The Court of Appeal for Ontario varied the decree by declaring that the decree was to be without prejudice to any proceeding the appellant W. might be advised to take to establish his title to the lands in question within two months from the date thereof.\nHeld, Per Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier and Henry JJ., affirming the judgment of the Courts below,\u2014that the appellants, having gone into possession under T., were estopped in this suit from disputing their landlord\u2019s title, and that the respondent was entitled to an injunction to restrain appellants from committing waste and to an account for waste already committed. Per Strong J.\u2014The decree made by the Chancellor would have constituted no bar to a subsequent action at law or suit in equity by W. to impeach the tax sale, and should not have been varied by the Court of Appeal.\nPer Gwynne J.\u2014The case should have been disposed of upon the issue as to the valibility of title upon which the plaintiff had by his bill rested his case; and as the appellants had failed to prove that the taxes had been paid before the sheriff\u2019s sale, the Ontario statute, 33 Vic., ch. 23, had removed all errors and defects, if any there were, which would have enabled the true owner, at the time of the sale, to have avoided it, and pursuant to the provisions of ch. 40, sec. 87, R.S.O., the respondent was entitled to recover possession of the land in question and to have execution therefor, but not to an order for an injunction or any direction for an account, the statute authorizing title to real property to be tried in a Court of Chancery not justifying a judgment of a more extensive character than would have been pronounced in a court of common law if the action had been brought there,\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario varying a decree of Chancellor Spragge[1] in favor of the respondent.\nThis suit was commenced on the 23rd day of December, 1880, in the Court of Chancery for Ontario, by the respondent Nelles against the appellants White and O\u2019Neil, to recover possession of the north 100 acres and the south 30 acres of lot No. 1, in the 10th concession of the township of Colchester.\nThe respondent by his bill set up that he claimed title from one John Hargreaves, an insolvent; that Hargreaves held possession of the lands from the time of his acquiring the same, in the year 1876, down to the month of October, 1880, when, as alleged in the 4th paragraph of the bill of complaint, the respondent contended that the said land becoming unoccupied, the appellant Solomon White, wrongfully and without any color of right, put the appellant James O\u2019Neil into posssession of the lot.\nThe respondent by the said bill also alleged that the appellant O\u2019Neil resided upon the land and held possession of it as tenant to or agent of the appellant White, and that he refused to deliver up possession to the respondent.\nIn the fifth paragraph of the said bill the respondent alleged that the appellant White claimed to have some interest in a part of the land, but denied the appellant White\u2019s title, and alleged that if he ever had any title it had been barred by the statute of limitations.\nThe bill also alleged that the title of Hargreaves was founded upon a sale of the land for taxes, and that the appellants contended that the sale was invalid for the reasons alleged in the answer.\nThe respondent by the said bill set up that all the proper proceedings had been taken under the statutes respecting the sale of lands for taxes, and that the tax sale was valid. The respondent also alleged that the purchaser at the said sale, and his assignees and Hargreaves, had paid taxes and made large, valuable and lasting improvements upon the lands.\nThe prayer of the bill was that the appellants might be restrained from committing acts of waste; ordered to account for the value of timber and other trees cut down and removed; to deliver up possession of the lands, and that, in that event, the respondent\u2019s title being defective, the respondent might be declared entitled to a lien upon the lands and premises for the improvements, taxes and interest.\nThe appellants answered the said bill disclaiming the title to that part of the land described as the south 30 acres of lot No. 1; but the appellant White claimed to be entitled as owner in fee simple in possession of the north 100 acres of the said lot. And the appellant O\u2019Neil claimed title as his tenant. The appellants also set up as a defence that the said alleged tax sale under which the said respondent claimed title was invalid and void, for the reasons in the said answer referred to.\nThe case was heard before Spragge, Chancellor of Ontario, at Sandwich, on the 26th day of April, 1881.\nHis Lordship held, as will appear from his reported judgment[2], where the facts will be found more fully stated, that the tax sale was invalid, but that the respondent was entitled to succeed upon another point, namely, that Hargreaves, claiming to be entitled under the tax sale, had, in 1872, put one Thompson into possession of the land; that afterwards, in 1878, he gave him a lease for four years, from the 1st April, 1878; and the defendant O\u2019Neil went to Thompson, while he was still in possession, and by fraudulent representations had induced Thompson to leave the place, and that O\u2019Neil had entered under White, and that upon the authority of Doe Johnson v. Baytup[3], the appellants were obliged to yield up possession to the respondent before asserting any title in themselves.\nA decree was then drawn up ordering a perpetual injunction as against the appellants, and ordering the appellants forthwith to deliver up possession of the land to the respondent, and to account for the timber and other trees cut upon the same.\nThe appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which dismissed the said appeal with costs, but varied the decree complained of by declaring that the said decree was to be without prejudice to any proceedings which the appellant White might be advised to take to establish his title to the lands and premises in question within two months from the date thereof, and also declaring that in the event of the appellant, White, paying such costs, and taking any proceedings to establish his title to the land, he should have liberty to bring any action for that purpose within the time thereinbefore limited as of the 27th day of April, 1882.\nJ. Bethune Q.C. for appellant:\nThe respondent having based his right to recover upon the tax sale, and not having raised any question whatever as to any fraud on the part of the appellant O\u2019Neil in taking possession of the land in question, it was not open to the respondent at the trial to raise the point upon which the decree proceeded; and the court having found that the title of the respondent was bad, ought not to have acted upon the principle referred to by Doe Johnson v. Baytup,[4] even if the evidence established the facts to be within the law as laid down in that case, because the point was not made by the pleadings, and in any event was not one which could be relied upon in a suit in chancery, which was brought for purposes of determining finally and conclusively the question of title, and not merely the question of possession. If the decree as originally made had stood, the appellants\u2019 title would have been extinguished, and the appellants would have had to account to the respondent for trespass committed upon the lands in question, even although the respondent did not possess a scintilla of title to the land. It is quite clear, however, that no ground existed for applying the authority of the case Doe Johnson v. Baytup.\nThe appellants, however, contend that even trying this suit as an action of ejectment, the respondent ought not to have been allowed to recover possession, because the unexpired term which had been granted to Thompson by Hargreaves from the 1st of April, 1878, for four years, had not expired; and so it appearing that there was a present right of possession in Thompson., even if Hargreaves\u2019 title was valid, the respondent ought not to have been allowed to recover even possession of the land; and contend also for the reasons referred to by the learned Chancellor in his judgment[5], that the tax sale was invalid.\nFurther, the appellants, claim, have proved a paper title to the lands in question, which if not strictly proved was sufficient to have warranted the Court of Appeal in allowing the appellants to give further evidence by production of title deeds to show clear proof of their title under the Crown, and that if it were necessary to establish a title to the lands, the Court of Appeal ought not to have refused the cross relief sought by the appellants in this action, and directed the bringing of another action; because it will be observed that by the 15th clause of the answer, the appellants sought, by way of cross relief, that their title might be declared valid and that the title of the respondent might be declared invalid, and there was therefore no reason why that question ought not, even if the cause had been sent back for trial, to have been determined in the cause, instead of being required, as the Court of Appeal did not require it, to be determined by independent suit.\nS.H. Blake Q.C, and Lash Q.C., for respondent:\nAt a time when the respondent was in the lawful occupation of the premises in question the appellants procured possession thereof under such circumstances as warranted the court of first instance in holding that the appellants were bound to restore such possession to the respondent, and that finding has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe learned counsel cited the following authorities:\u2014As to the effect of the wrongful possession, see Cole on Ejectment[6]; Adams\u2019 Ejectment[7]; Doe dem. Hughes v. Dyball[8]; Johnson v. Baytup[9]; Loveland v. Knight[10]; Walker v. Friel[11].\nAs to validity of sale some taxes in arrear for the time mentioned in statute, Edinburgh Life Association v. Ferguson[12]; McKay v. Chrysler[13]; Fenton v. Mc-Wain[14]. As to irregularities not vitiating sale, McKay v. Chrysler13; Bank of Toronto v. Fanning[15]; Silver-thorne v. Campbell[16].\nAs to confirmation of the title of respondent by payment of taxes, making improvements, &c., Fraser v. West[17].\nAs to confirmation of title by possession and delay in attacking tax deed, Statutes of Limitations[18]; Tax Statutes[19]; Hamilton v. Eggleton[20].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014After stating the facts as hereinbefore set forth, proceeded as follows:\u2014\nThe appellants submit that the decree, originally made by the Court of Chancery and varied by the Court of Appeal, was erroneous and should be reversed, and the bill dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s evidence is to the following effect:\u2014\nHargreaves purchased from Meyer and gave him a farm worth over $1,000 for it.\nSome few years after, in 1872, he placed Thompson as tenant. He was there continuously till he made lease in 1879. The lease is dated 11th April, 1879, to be computed from 26th April, 1879, for four years, with provision that he should not assign, sub-let, or transfer without permission; that he never gave permis- sion. That he paid the taxes from 1865 till 1877 and failed to pay in 1878, in all thirteen years. He had a shanty and a stable put up and eight acres cleared. The shanty was put up the year Thompson was put in possession and no deed was ever tendered him, and he never heard of White\u2019s claim previous to 1870. White came to his house about 1873 or 1874 and did not then offer to pay the taxes. No possession till 1872\u2014wild land in 1873.\nThomas Adair, who was asked by Nelles to get possession of land from O\u2019Neil, in his evidence says:\u2014\nHe did not get possession, and found O\u2019Neil in possession in December, 1880, and he refused to go off, and says he found timber had been cut and that O\u2019Neil admitted he had cut it. After O\u2019Neil was made a prisoner White said that the wrong man was taken up, that he was the party.\nJames Thompson in his evidence says he rented the place from Hargreaves and went on in 1872, and stayed on between seven and eight years steady, and then was off and on the balance of the time, and cleared off a piece and fenced it, and put up a log stable and shanty.\nThomas Thompson gave the following evidence:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You rented this place from Mr. Hargreaves? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014When did you first go on? A.\u2014It would be in 1872.\nQ.\u2014How long did you stay on? A.\u2014Well, it was between seven\nand eight years steady and then I was off and on the balance of time afterwards.\nQ.\u2014And were there any improvements done or made during the time you were there? A\u2014Yes; I cleared off a piece and fenced it and put up a log stable and shanty.\nQ.\u2014O\u2019Neil is in possession there now for Mr. White; how did he get in? A.\u2014Mr. O\u2019Neil came down to me, it would be last June some time, and he told me about Hargraves and the assignee, some party of his coming down, and they were going to seize the things that I had there, that is on the place, and that I had better let him have possession and he would remove the things; so I gave up a day or so afterwards, and O\u2019Neil was in possession.\nQ.\u2014He told you that who was going to seize? A.\u2014It was the assignee\u2019s party, he didn\u2019t know his name, but he had sent him down there and was going to seize my things. Q.\u2014That Hargraves had become insolvent? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014How did he get in, had you any one living in the house or had you the house locked? A.\u2014The house was locked.\nQ.\u2014Did he get into the house? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014How? A.\u2014I cannot tell you exactly; I told him to go and get the key; there was a family going in previous to that and this party had locked up the house and I told O\u2019Neil to go to him and they would give him the key and they had not done so, for the party brought the key to me afterwards.\nQ.\u2014What did he say about his taking possession? A.\u2014He said it was likely there would be some dispute about it and he would hold it for a term.\nHis Lordship.\u2014Did he say in what capacity he proposed to act?\nMr. Boyd.\u2014How was he going, what claim did he make? A.\u2014Well, he did not say to me, not then exactly, I think he did afterwards.\nQ.\u2014What did he say? A.\u2014He told me that Mr. White had given him power to come and take possession.\nHis Lordship.\u2014Is he a defendant?\nMr. Boyd.\u2014Yes, my Lord.\nMr. Gibbon.\u2014He disclaims any right in himself.\nMr. Boyd.\u2014You had a lease at that time from Hargreaves? A.\u2014Yes\nQ.\u2014And by the terms of that you were not to assign or transfer without his leave? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Did you get his leave? A.\u2014No; but I wrote to Mr. Hargreaves and did not get any answer back.\nQ.\u2014And you thought that this was the best thing to do to keep out of trouble? A.\u2014Well, when I get no answer.\nQ.\u2014He said there was a man coming down to seize? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Did you believe that at the time? A.\u2014Yes, and I told O\u2019Neil to remove part of my things and he did take them up to his place.\nQ.\u2014Why did you want them removed? A\u2014I did not want them seized, for I did not want any trouble at all.\nMr. Boyd.\u2014Did you find out it was true what O\u2019Neil told you, that there was going to be a seizure? A.\u2014Well I did not get any satisfaction, but I did not see any parties.\nQ.\u2014There was no seizure? A.\u2014No.\nHis Lordship.\u2014When was it that O\u2019Neil came? A.\u2014It would be in June last, June sometime.\nMr. Boyd.\u2014You were living in possession up to that time? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And had your things in the house? A.\u2014Yes; I had some things there.\nQ.\u2014A sleigh? A.\u2014Yes; it was not in the house, but there were other things; a stove, etc. On behalf of the defendants Solomon White in his evidence says, that he sent to Messrs. Harris & McGee the deed and money for taxes to be tendered to Mr. Hargreaves; and Labadie, another witness, says he sold the lot to Charles Baby in 1855 and paid all the taxes.\nI quite agree that the defendant White, having obtained possession through O\u2019Neil by the means detailed, cannot be permitted to dispute the plaintiffs title until plaintiff is first placed in the situation he was before the possession was taken by O\u2019Neil. White, through O\u2019Neil, came into possession under Thompson or in collusion with him both White and O\u2019Neil obviously well knowing that Thompson was in possession under Hargreaves, and could no more dispute plaintiff\u2019s title than Thompson could. He could neither by purchasing Thompson\u2019s right, nor by colluding with him, put himself in a position to dispute the landlord\u2019s title. This case, it is clear, comes quite within the principle of the case of Doe Johnson v. Baytup[21], referred to by the learned Chancellor and on which he acted, as also Doe Hughes v. Dyball[22]; Doe Bullen v. Mills[23], and of the case of Doe Bliss v. Estey[24], which last case seems to me on all fours with this case, the marginal note of which is:\nThe defendant obtained possession of land from the plaintiff\u2019s tenant by representing that he had the title to it and threatening to eject the tenant. Held, in an action of ejectment by the landlord, that the defendant was estopped from disputing his title and setting up an adverse title in himself.\nI was a party to this judgment and I have not since its delivery heard anything to make me doubt its correctness.\nThe case of Doe Knight v. Lady Smythe[25] is also in point. Dampier J. says:\nIt has been ruled often that neither the tenant, nor any one claiming by him, can controvert the landlord\u2019s title. He cannot put another person in possession, but must deliver up the premises to his own landlord. This (he says) I believe has been the rule for the last twenty-five years, and I remember was so laid down by Buller J. upon the western circuit, and I have no doubt has been the rule ever since.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This was a suit in chancery instituted under the Ontario \u201cAdministration of Justice Act,\u201d by Nelles as assignee in insolvency of Hargreaves against White & O\u2019Neil. The Bill was filed on the 31st December, 1880. The suit was a mixed one being an amalgamation of an action of ejectment to recover possession of land, and a bill for an injunction to restrain trespass in the nature of waste, and for an account of the waste committed.\nThe facts are as follows: The plaintiff\u2019s title is under a sale for taxes of the 100 acres sought to be recovered being the north 100 acres of lot No. 1, in the 10th concession of the township of Colchester. It is designated as lot 1 and 4, because it is lot 1 of the original survey by Barwell, and lot 4 of a subsequent survey of the 1st concession by Smith. The sale for taxes took place in 1860, and the sheriff\u2019s deed was given in pursuance of it. The real purchaser at the tax sale was Jeffreys, who purchased in the name of Godbold, Godbold having assigned his nominal purchase to Jeffreys, the sheriff\u2019s deed was made to Jeffreys, who afterwards conveyed to Brunton. Brunton subsequently conveyed to Heathfield and Heathfield to Meyer, from whom Hargreaves purchased and obtained a conveyance. This is the plaintiff\u2019s title so far as the paper title is concerned. It is impeached by the defendants who were in possession, upon the ground that the tax sale was invalid. 1st. because some of the taxes for which the land was sold had been, as is sworn by Labadie, a former owner, paid by him. These taxes so alleged to have been paid were the taxes from 1852 to 1856, the sale having been for an arrear of taxes from 1853 to 1858. 2nd. The tax sale is impeached on account of an alleged misdescription of the land.\nThe plaintiff, however, sets up an alternative title by estoppel against the defendants, which, if well founded, precludes them from questioning the validity of the sale for taxes, at least in the present suit. This title by estoppel is said to arise under the following circumstances: Hargreaves leased the land to one Thompson, who remained in possession until 1880 (some seven or eight years he says in his evidence) when he gave up possession to the defendant, O\u2019Neil, who was a tenant to or in some way claimed under the defendant White, White himself asserting a title derived from the original owners of the land, and which, if sufficiently proved and if no estoppel were in the way, would entitle him to impeach the tax sale. After Thompson had been in possession for some time, a formal lease from Hargreaves to Thompson for four years, from 20th April, 1879, was executed, and the term created by it was therefore an existing term, when the defendants obtained possession from Thompson. It is contended by the plaintiff that the defendants, having thus gone into possession under Thompson, were estopped from disputing their landlord\u2019s title.\nIf this contention is well founded, it is obvious that it will be immaterial to consider the sufficiency of the proof of White\u2019s paper title, some deeds in which are proved only by secondary evidence, consisting of memorials executed by the grantees, and respecting which an important question in the law of evidence might have to be determined. And we shall also be relieved from considering the validity of the sale for taxes, which indeed would only, in any case, have had to be determined in the event of the defendant White\u2019s title being held to be established by legal proof.\nReverting, then, to the question of estoppel, upon which, as it appears to me, this appeal can well be disposed of, let us consider it in its bearing upon the suit in both the aspects of an action of ejectment, and a suit in chancery for an injunction and account, which the bill presents.\nFirst, as regards the plaintiffs right to recover in ejectment.\nUpon the evidence the facts cannot be disputed, that O\u2019Neil obtained possession from Thompson; that when he so obtained possession he was in privity with White; that the possession he obtained was for the benefit of White, and that at the time of the filing of the bill he was in possession under White, and claiming as his tenant, as he admits in his answer. Upon this state of facts the law is clear. As a tenant is estopped from setting up a title paramount, so all persons acquiring possession from the tenant, are in like manner estopped. This is so very elementary a principle of the law of landlord and tenant, that it scarcely requires to be vouched by a reference to authority. The case cited in the respondent\u2019s factum[26] is, however, at once a sufficient authority on the law and an example of its application directly to the point. The only difficulty in the plaintiff\u2019s way would arise from the fact that the four years for which the lease was granted not having expired when the bill was filed in December 1880, the defendants would be entitled, at all events, to retain the possession during the residue of the term. This objection is, however, susceptible of two conclusive answers. White in his answer confines his defence to an assertion of his title paramount, as the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale of the interest of one Pratt, in whom, as he alleges, the title of the patentee of the Crown had by mesne conveyances become vested; and to an impeachment of the validity of the sale for taxes. He nowhere claims title as the assignee of Thompson. The other defendant, O\u2019Neil, by his answer merely alleges that he is in possession under White. This mode of pleading his defence would alone amount to a disclaimer by White of any right of enjoyment for the residue of the term to which he might otherwise have been entitled. But there is a still more conclusive answer than this arising from the terms of the lease by Hargreaves to Thompson. This lease was produced and proved at the trial; it is referred to in the depositions of both Hargreaves and Thompson. The reference to it in the evidence of the former is as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Then after you bought what did you do with the property, Mr. Hargreaves? A\u2014With this 100 acres?\nQ.\u2014What did you do with it? A.\u2014Some time afterwards\u2014some few years afterwards I placed on Mr. Thompson as a tenant.\nQ.\u2014Were there two lots? A\u2014There were.\nQ.\u2014When did you first place him on there? A\u2014In 1872.\nQ.\u2014And was he on from that till you made this lease in 1879?\nA.\u2014He was.\nQ.\u2014Continuously on there? A\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Is this (now produced) the lease you made to him, your signature? A.\u2014Yes. (See lease dated 11th April, 1879, to be computed from the 20th April, 1879, for four years.)\nQ.\u2014And there is a provision in this that he should not assign or sublet or transfer without your permission? A\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Did you ever give your permission to any transfer under this, or assignment of it to O\u2019Neil? A.\u2014No.\nAnd Thompson, in his deposition, speaks of it thus:\nMr. Boyd.\u2014You had a lease at that time from Hargreaves? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And by the terms of that you were not to assign or transfer without his leave? A.\u2014Yes\nThis lease although thus produced has not, however, been printed in the case as it undoubtedly ought to have been, and we are left to ascertain its terms as we best can by inference or presumption. It will be observed that it is said both by Hargreaves and Thompson, that the lease contained a provision against transfer or assignment, but whether such provision was a mere personal covenant not to assign, or extended to the term itself either made it unassignable or provided for its cesser on assignment, we have nothing to tell us. This is, of course, very material on the present question. It was incumbent on the appellant in printing the case, to comprise in it all material evidence, and as he has thought fit to suppress this exhibit, the lease, which was of course attainable by him, even if it was not in the possession of the officer of the Court, we are, I think, authorized in making against him the presumption that the proviso in question was in such a form as to operate as cesser or avoidance of the term upon an assignment being made, more especially are we entitled to do so, as having regard to the well known practice of conveyancing, of which we can take notice, such a proviso would be in the ordinary course, and the presumption thus made would be consistent with the probable fact. It follows that the appellant could have no benefit from the lease, and that upon the ground before indicated a recovery in ejectment would have been inevitable.\nThen as regards the equitable side of this composite suit, it is clear that the right which a landlord has to an injunction restraining his tenant from committing waste and to account for waste already committed, extends to all persons claiming under the tenant, and who like him are incapacitated by the doctrine of estoppel from setting up a superior title, and for the reasons already given, the defendants here are in the position of such persons.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the decree of the Court of Chancery was entirely right and should be affirmed. \u201cWith regard to the variation or addition made to that decree by the Court of Appeal, I must add that I think no such addition was called for since the decree made by the Chancellor would have instituted no bar to a subsequent term at law or writ n equity by White to impeach the tax sale. It could, however, if limited to a mere saving of the appellant\u2019s right to bring such action or suit, do no harm as it would be merely expressing what the law implied, but n limiting a term within which the action or suit vas to be brought to two months, I think the order of the Court of Appeal was wrong. Any question of he statute of limitations as a bar to a future suit was proper question to be determined in that proceeding.\u2019 am of opinion the order of the Court of Appeal should be varied by striking out this limitation of the appellant\u2019s right to sue to two months, and that in other respects the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and HENRY JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This was an action in the nature of an action of ejectment instituted in the Court of Chancery or the Province of Ontario, under the provisions of ch. 40 of the Revised Statutes of that Province, entitled An Act respecting the Court of Chancery.\u201d The 86th section of that Act enacts that:\nThe Court of Chancery shall\u2019 have jurisdiction in all matters which would be cognizable in a court of law.\nAnd the 87th section that:\nWhere a suit is instituted or where a petition is filed in the court for the purpose of establishing the title of the plaintiff or petitioner to any real property, no objection to such suit or proceeding shall be allowed upon the ground that the plaintiff or petitioner should first have sued at law or would have an adequate and complete remedy law by action of ejectment or otherwise; and if it appears upon the hearing or other determination of such suit or proceeding, that the plaintiff or petitioner is entitled to the possession of such real property, he may obtain an order against the defendant or respondent for the delivery of such possession, and writs of execution shall issue accordingly.\nThe plaintiff in his bill claims title as assignee in insolvency of one John Hargreaves, against whom a writ of attachment under the Insolvency Act of 1875, issued upon the 24th day of January, 1880, and that the said John Hargreaves acquired an estate in fee simple in the land in question by purchase in the year 1867, and from the time of his so acquiring the said land, held possession of the same up to the month of October, 1880, \u201cwhen the said land, becoming unoccupied, the defendant Solomon \u201cWhite wrongfully and without any color of right, put the defendant James O\u2019Neil into possession of the said lot, and the said James O\u2019Neil now resides thereon, and holds possession as tenant or agent of the defendant Solomon White; and the defendants, notwithstanding the plaintiff has requested them to deliver up possession to him, refuse to do so, and continue in possession of the said land as trespassers.\u201d The bill further alleged that the defendants contend that Hargreaves\u2019 title was founded upon a sale of the land for taxes, and that the said sale was invalid, but the plaintiff alleged that all proper proceedings were had and steps taken and things done as required by the statutes in that behalf, and that the said sale was and is valid.\nAnd the bill further alleged that since the said sale for taxes the purchaser at the said sale and his assignees, and the said Hargreaves, were, and had been, in continuous occupation of the said land, and had paid the taxes continuously to the present time, and the plaintiff relied upon the various statutes relating to sales of land for taxes, and covering defects in such sales. The bill further alleged that Hargreaves, and those through whom he claimed under title derived from the tax sale, had paid taxes and had made large and valuable lasting improvements, and the plaintiff claimed that in the event of plaintiff\u2019s title proving defective, he is entitled to a lien on the said land for the taxes so paid, and interest at ten per cent. and for said improvements. The bill also alleged that since the defendants had been in possession of the land, they had cut down and removed, and applied to their own use divers valuable timber and other trees, which were growing on the land, and that they threaten to continue so to do. And the bill prayed:\n1. That the defendants might be restrained by injunction from committing such acts, and that they should account for the value of the timber and other trees cut down, &c.\n2. That they should be ordered to deliver up possession of the said land to the plaintiff forthwith.\n3. That in the event of the plaintiff\u2019s title being defective, he might be declared to be entitled to a lien on the said land for the value of the improvements made thereon, and the taxes paid and interest.\n4. That all proper directions might be given, and accounts taken, and for further relief.\nThe defendants by their answer insisted that the defendant Solomon White had title in himself to the land in question under title derived by divers mesne conveyances from the patentee of the Crown, and that the plaintiff\u2019s title depended on the validity of a tax sale, which was had on the 13th March, 1860, which sale, as they alleged, was invalid for divers errors and defects in the assessment and proceedings, to have the land sold for arrears of taxes, and, further, for the reason that as the defendants were informed and believed the taxes for the years 1853, 1854, 1855, 1856 and 1857, and for which the land was sold, had been duly paid, and satisfied prior to the said sale\u2014and the defendant Solomon White prayed by way of cross relief that the said tax sale and the registered proceedings regarding the same might be declared invalid and void.\nAt the trial a warrant from the treasurer of the county of Essex, bearing date the 1st December, 1859, addressed to the sheriff of that county, in which county the land in question is situate, directing the sheriff to sell the land in question with other lands for arrears of taxes, was produced. The treasurer of the county proved that by the books in his office (he himself was not treasurer prior to, or at the time of, the sale) the taxes in arrear at the time of the sale which took place in March, 1860, were taxes which accrued due in the years 1853 to 1858, both inclusive. The sheriff\u2019s deed, dated the 18th March, 1861, to one Jeffery, as assignee of the person to whom as highest bidder at the sale the land had been knocked down, was produced and deeds passing the title from Jeffery to Hargreaves were also produced. The deed to Hargreaves was dated the 4th November, 1867, and was executed by one Meyer, who had purchased from one Heathfield, on the 14th May, 1862. It was also proved that Meyer paid up all the taxes which had accrued from 1859 to 1865, inclusive, and Hargreaves all the taxes which accrued due from 1865 to 1811 inclusive.\nThe defendant, White, gave evidence of the title in virtue of which he claimed to be seised of an estate in fee simple in the land in question.\nThe learned Chancellor, before whom the trial took place, instead of adjudicating upon the tax title, in virtue of which the plaintiff claimed and which the defendants disputed, and as to the validity of which they had joined in an issue which they had gone down to try, and in support of which the plaintiff had given all the evidence that he could give, rendered a verdict for the plaintiff upon a ground not taken or suggested by the plaintiff on the record or at the trial, namely, that it appeared in the evidence that the defendant O\u2019Neil, upon Hargreaves becoming insolvent, went to the land and represented to one Thompson, then in possession as tenant of Hargreaves, that the latter having become insolvent Thompson\u2019s chattels on the place would, or might, be seized, and that Thompson becoming alarmed removed his chattels and left the place, and that O\u2019Neil moved into it claiming that the defendant White had an interest in the place and that he, O\u2019Neil, was there for him.\nThe learned Chancellor was of opinion that under these circumstances the principle of Doe Johnson v. Baytup[27] applied, and that the obtaining possession in this manner was such a fraud as estopped the defendants from putting the plaintiff to proof of title. The appeal is against this judgment of the learned Chancellor and the decree made in pursuance thereof.\nThe case, in my opinion, should have been disposed of upon the issue as to the validity of the title upon which the plaintiff had by his bill rested his case, the evidence upon which was fully entered into by both parties; by the plaintiff in support of the validity, and by the defendants in support of the grounds urged by them to establish the invalidity of the tax title. The evidence offered by the defendant, in support of the contention that the taxes for the years, for the alleged arrears in respect of which the land was sold, were paid before the sale was, in my judgment, wholly insufficient to establish that any such payment had been made for all or for any of such years, or to cast a doubt on the validity of the sale upon the ground that it took place when there were no taxes in arrear to justify a sale. There would be no security whatever in any title acquired upon a sale for arrears of taxes if a title held under a deed executed in 1861 followed by the payment of taxes ever since by the purchaser at the tax sale and those claiming under him, could be now avoided upon such evidence as that upon which the defendants relied. Whether there were any such errors or defects in the assessment roll or in the proceedings taken to effect the sale as would not now at this distance of time be relieved against under the provisions of the 156th section of chapter 180 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, it is unnecessary to determine, for it is clear to my mind that as the defendants have failed to prove that the taxes had been paid before the sale, the Ontario Statute, 33 Vic., ch. 23, has removed all errors and defects, if any there were, which would have enabled the true owner at the time of the sale to have avoided it.\nBy the 1st and 2nd sections of that Act it is enacted that in all cases where lands which were liable to be assessed according to the true intent and meaning of the statutes in that behalf, have, or any part thereof has, been sold and conveyed under color of such statutes for taxes in arrear and the tax purchaser at any such sale had, prior to the first day of November, 1869, paid at least eight years taxes charged on the said lands, although he shall not have occupied the said land or any part thereof, provided that the owner has not occupied the said land or some part thereof for one year between the sale by the sheriff and the said first day of November, such sale shall be deemed valid, notwithstanding the taxes and the sheriff\u2019s fees and charges for which the lands were sold were not imposed and charged in due form as required or authorised by the said statutes or any of them or exceeded the amount lawfully chargeable, and notwithstanding any defect in the warrant to sell, or that such warrant was issued too soon, and notwithstanding any irregularity in the notices of sale or the advertising and publishing thereof or in, or as to, the time and place of any such sale, or as to any adjournment of sale, and notwithstanding that there was on any such lands any property that might have been distrained, and notwithstanding that the lands have been assessed against some person as resident or occupant when they should have been assessed as non-resident lands, or were assessed as non-resident lands when they should have been assessed against the owner or occupant, or both, and notwithstanding any informality or defect in the keeping of the accounts of the taxes charged against such lands, or with which they were chargeable, and notwithstanding any other omissions, insufficiency, defects or irregularities whatsoever, as regards the assessment or sale, or the preliminary or subsequent steps required to make such sale effectual in law; and the 14th section of the Act enacts\u2014that the words \u201ctax purchaser,\u201d shall apply to any person who purchased, theretofore, at any sale under color of any statute authorizing sales of land for taxes in arrears, and include and extend to all persons claiming through or under him. The case of the plaintiff, as representing Hargreaves, comes precisely within the provisions of this statute, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover in virtue of the title asserted by him in his bill.\nIt becomes unnecessary, under these circumstances, to express any opinion upon the question raised, and so strongly pressed by the learned counsel for the appellant, namely, whether or not the facts in evidence as to the mode in which O\u2019Neil entered into possession of the land, bring the case within the principle upon which the learned Chancellor proceeded, or whether the principle itself is applicable in this case in view of the special title asserted by the plaintiff in his bill, as to the validity of which the parties had joined in issue, which they had gone down to try, and in view also of the fact that the plaintiff did not assert any claim based upon the principle upon which the learned. Chancellor proceeded, but had, on the contrary, averred in his bill that the defendant \u201cWhite, finding the land unoccupied, put the defendant O\u2019Neil in possession. The plaintiff, therefore, under the provisions of the 87th section of ch. 40 of the Revised Statutes, was entitled to a judgment in his favor for the delivery up of the possession of the land by the defendants to him, and the decree to that effect must be sustained; but I cannot see upon what principle that judgment, which is simply in the nature of a judgment in an action of ejectment, should be supplemented with an order for a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from the committal of further trespasses upon land, of which, by force of the judgment, they will no longer be in possession. The only purpose that I can see which can be sought to be obtained by such an order would be to give to the plaintiff, in addition to the ordinary remedies which the law affords to all owners of real property for the redress of wrongs committed upon their property by trespassers, such further remedy and protection in the enjoyment of their possession as the fear of incurring the fines and penalties attending the committal of contempt of court may afford, and this is a species of remedy the application of which is not, in my judgment, to be extended so as to become an incident attached to a recovery in an action of ejectment. The statute which authorized actions of ejectment to be tried in the Court of Chancery does not, in my opinion, sanction the introduction of this novelty, the decree, therefore, should, in my opinion, be varied by removal from it of the clause as to the injunction.\nIt may be very desirable and reasonable that a plaintiff, having established his title to real property, should in the same action wherein such title is established, to avoid a multiplicity of suits recover damages in the nature of mesne profits during the time he was wrongfully kept out of possession until judgment, and as part of such damages the value of such timber as may have been cut upon the premises and disposed of by the defendant during the time that he was so in possession until judgment. But the statute which authorizes actions of ejectment to be tried in the Court of Chancery makes no provision for the recovery of damages by way of mesne profits, or otherwise, in a different manner when the action is brought in the Court of Chancery from that in which they are recoverable when the action of ejectment was brought in a court of common law; in which case either party is entitled to insist that those damages should be assessed by a jury. There is no statute which, in my opinion, warrants the substitution by the Court of Chancery of the dilatory and expensive process of enquiries and the taking of accounts before a master in chancery, as to damages recoverable by way of mesne profits consequential upon a recovery in an action of ejectment for the simple, direct and much less expensive assessment of such damages by a jury when the case is tried before a jury, or by a judge when it is tried by a judge without a jury. The direction, therefore, for the taking of the account which is ordered by the judgment and decree of the learned Chancellor, and which necessitates the re-opening of a question which was thoroughly, and at considerable expense, entered into at the trial, and which, if mesne profits were recoverable in the action brought for trying the title, ought to have been determined by the learned judge himself upon the evidence taken by him, who when trying the case without a jury was substituted for a jury, seems to me not to be warranted by any statute. The learned counsel for the appellant did not, however, as I understood him, object to the account ordered upon this ground: his objection was that as the learned Chancellor had not adjudicated either in favor of the plaintiff or of the defendants, upon the title to the fee in the land as asserted upon the record, but expressly abstained from doing so for the reason given by him, and as the timber belonged to him in whom the right to the fee in the land was, it was premature to order the defendant, whose title to the fee as asserted by him might be good, to account for the timber cut by him to a person, who upon the the title being tried might be found to have no title to the land. This objection appears to me to be well founded, and, in fact, to be unanswerable if the judgment of the learned Chancellor is to be maintained upon the ground upon which alone he proceeded, he having, for the reason given by him, expressly and purposely declined to determine the question of title to the fee simple in the land, which was the sole question upon which the parties had joined issue, which they had gone down to try, and upon which the right to an account in respect of timber cut depended.\nIn my opinion the decree and judgment of the Court of Chancery should be varied so as to change it into a simple judgment within the provisions of the 87th section of ch. 40 of the the Revised Statutes of Ontario, namely, that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the land for the recovery of the possession of which the action was brought, and that he do have execution therefor accordingly, without more, thus giving to the plaintiff the same judgment as he could have had if the action had been brought in a court of common law instead of in the Court of Chancery. The Ontario statute which has authorized title to real property to be tried and determined in a Court of Chancery equally as in a court of common law, never authorized, or, in my opinion, contemplated the application of different principles in trying the title, varying according to the court in which the action should be brought, or the pronouncing a judgment in the Court of Chancery of a more extensive character than could have been pronounced by a court of common law, if the action had been brought there, the judgment in both courts should be the same, namely, that the plaintiff should recover the possession of the land for which the action was brought and that he should have execution therefor.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; counsel for respondent assenting, the order of the Court of Appeal was varied by extending the time given the appellant While for bringing an action to establish his title for three months from the pronouncing of the judgment of the Supreme Court.\nSolicitor for appellant White: H.T.W.

Under 44 and 45 Vic. ch. 40 sec. 2 (P.Q.), passed on a petition of the Quebec Central Railway Company, after notice given by them, asking for an amendment of their charter, the town of Levis passed a by-law guaranteeing to pay to the Quebec Central Railway Company the whole cost of expropriation for the right of way for the extension of the railway to the deep water of the St. Lawrence river, over and above $30,000. Appellants, being ratepayers of the town of Levis, applied for and obtained an injunction to stay further proceedings on this by-law, on the ground of its illegality. The proviso in section 2 of the Act, under which the corporation of the town of Levis contended that the by-law was authorized, is as follows: \" Provided that within thirty days from the sanction of the present Act, the corporation of the town of Levis furnishes the said company with its said guarantee and obligation to pay all excess over $30,000 of the cost of expropriation for the right of way.\" By the act of incorporation of the town of Levis, no power or authority is given to the corporation to give such guarantee. The statute 44 and 45 Vic. ch. 40, was passed on the 30th June, 1881; and the by-law forming the guarantee was passed on the 27th July following\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, L.C., appeal side, and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, that the statute in question did not authorize the corporation of Levis to impose burdens upon the municipality which were not authorized by their acts of incorporation or other special legislative authority, and therefore the by-law was invalid, and the injunction must be sustained. (Ritchie C. J. dubitctnte.)\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in this case.\nBy the Quebec statute 44-45 Vie. chap. 40, the Quebec Central Railway Company was authorized to construct a railway from certain wharves in the town of Levis to the frontier of the State of Maine using for that purpose such portions as it might see fit of the Levis and Kennebec Railway, which it had acquired at sheriff's sale\nThe second section of this statute enacts that in constructing the line of railway, the company shall be bound to continue from the present terminus of the Levis and Kennebec Railway into Notre Dame ward and erect a station there and thence through certain other wards and certain villages to arrive at deep water in Lauzon ward. This obligation, however, was only-imposed upon the company \"provided that, within \"thirty days from the sanction of the present Act, the c corporation of the town of Levis furnishes the said company with its valid guarantee and obligation to pay all e excess over thirty thousand dollars of the cost of expropriation, for the right of way upon the said described \" route in so far as the said route traverses the parish of \" Notre Dame de Levis Notre Dame and Lauzon wards \"in the town of Levis and the villages of Bienville and \"Lauzon, following the brown line shown on the plan \" of the said company, to be deposited for reference in \" the Public \"Works Department of this Province, to the \" point of intersection with the red line upon said \" plan.\"\nThe statute was sanctioned on the 30th of June 1881\nOn the 27th of July following, the corporation of the town of Levis passed a by-law (referred to at length in the judgments of this court) which purports to declare and enact that it e engages by these presents to pay, and guarantees to pay, to the said company \" the said excess of cost of expropriation beyond $30,000, provided the line passes according to the brown line to the intersection with the red line on said plan. The by-law so far followed the wording of the statute but it also added to its proviso a qualification which is not found in the statute, and says: \"The whole such as shown in the s said plan at the time of the passage of the said Act a and according to the breadth and depth at that time e estimated and reported on by the engineers of the g grounds to be expropriated on said survey.\"\nThe Quebec Warehouse Company the appellants, as proprietors and ratepayers within the town of Levis, applied for a writ of injunction to restrain the corporation and the railway company from carrying out or acting upon this by-law, and on the 16th of August the writ issued returnable on the 1st September, 1881.\nThe grounds invoked in support of the injunction were \u2014\nThat the corporation had no power to enter into any such guarantee or contract.\nThat the by-law was not in conformity with the law which gives it the right to grant aid to railways, that it was not accompanied with the formalities prescribed by that law, and that it made no provision for any assessment or for a sinking fund to meet the liability to be incurred under it.\nThat the by-law was null because it fixed no amount and assumed an unlimited liability.\nThat the by-law referred to a guarantee for a line not mentioned in the statute, but mentioned in a certain report made by engineers.\nThat the by-law was illegal and null.\nIn answer to these pretentions the corporation pleaded:\u2014\u2014\n1. That at the time of the issuing of the writ of injunction, the by-law had been adopted and published as required by law and within the delay fixed by the statute, that the delay for giving the guarantee had also expired, that nothing more could be done to give the guarantee or to proceed further upon or in virtue of the by-law, that the powers of the corporation were at an end in this matter, that there was nothing left which the corporation could be restrained or prevented from doing, and that consequently the writ of injunction was without cause, object or effect.\nBy a second plea, the corporation contended that the by-law was valid and authorized by its act of incorporation stud by the statute above referred to that the only possible effect of the variance between the by-law and the statute would be to restrict the liability of the corporation, and that the Warehouse Company have no interest in setting it up.\nUpon the issue thus joined between the parties, the Superior Court in the first instance declared the injuncion perpetual, on the ground that the by-law was ultra vires. Upon appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, this judgment was reversed and the injunction was dissolved, the respondent being declared authorized by law to adopt the by-law.\nIrvine Q.C., for appellants.\nLanguedoc for respondents.\nThe points of argument relied on by counsel and cases cited are reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The questions to be decided in this case are entirely points of law, there being no controversy as to the facts.\nAn Act was passed by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, in the year 1881, amending the charter of the Quebec Central Railway Company. This Act authorized the company to extend their line to the deep water of the river St. Lawrence, and obliged them to continue it \" from the present terminus of the said Levis and Kennebec Railway, in the parish of Notre-Dame de Levis into Notre-Dame ward, in the town of Levis and erect a station there; thence, traversing Lauzon ward, in the said town of Levis, and the villages of Bienville and Lauzon, to arrive at deep water in said Lauzon ward; provided that, within thirty days from the sanction of the present Act, the corporation of the town of Levis furnishes the said company with its valid guarantee and obligation to pay all excess over thirty thousand dollars of the cost of expropriation for the right of way upon the said described route, in so far as said route traverses the parish of Notre-Dame de Levis, Notre-Dame and Lauzon wards, in the town of Levis, and the villages of Bienville and Lauzon, following the brown line shown on the plan of the said company to be deposited for reference in the Public Works Department of this province, to the point of intersection with the red line upon said plan.\"\nAfter passing of this Act, the council of the town of Levis passed a by-law, which is as follows:\u2014\nBy-law concerning the railway to be built by the Quebec Central Railway Company:\nSeeing that by the Statute of this province, adopted at the last Session of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, and entitled \"An Act to amend the plans of the Quebec Central Railway,\" it was, amongst other things, declared that the intended road to be constructed should be according to the plans mentioned in the said Act, provided that within thirty days of the sanction of the said Act the corporation of the town of Levis engages by its legal authority to pay to the said company, and guarantees to pay to it, for the whole cost, over and above the thirty thousand dollars appropriation, for right of way on the line mentioned in said Act, always providing the said line passes through the parish of Notre-Dame de Levis and Notre-Dame and Lauzon wards, in the town of Levis, and villages of Bienville and Lauzon, according to the brown line marked on the plans of the said company, deposited for reference in the Department of Public Works of this province, just to the point of intersection with the red line on said map.\nConsidering that it is opportune to give the said guarantee and obligation in order to secure in the interests of this town, the building of the said road according to the brown line in the said plan, it is by the present by-law declared and enacted:\u2014\nThe corporation of the raid town fully appreciating the value and advantage which will accrue to it by the said Act, and in order to give effect to it the corporation) engages by these presents to pay, and guarantees to pay to the said company, the whole cost over and above the thirty thousand dollars expropriation, for right of way on the line mentioned in said Act passes through the parish of Notre-Dame de Levis and Notre-Dame and Lauzon Ward, in the town of Levis and the villages of Bienville and Lauzon, according to the brown line marked on the plan deposited as aforesaid. just to the point of intersection with the red line on said plan. The whole such as shown in the said plan at the time of the passage of said Act, and according to the breadth and depth at the time estimated and reported on by the engineers of the grounds to be expropriated on said survey. The present obligation and guarantee must be applied to and cover the cost of expropriation of the necessary ground to erect a station of the said road, such as projected, in Notre-Dame ward of this town.\nGEORGE COUTURE,\nMayor.\nThe appellants being ratepayers of the town of Levis, and having an interest in the expenditure of the funds of the corporation, applied for and obtained an injunction to stay further proceedings on this by-law, on the ground of its illegality, and it is the legality of that by-law which is now in question.\nThe parties admitted that the various publications of notice required by law to be made respecting the by-law were duly made. The inclination of my mind was to confirm the judgment of the court below and dismiss the appeal, but the rest of the court being strongly of opinion to reverse, I do not feel sufficiently strong in my opinion to differ from them; I, therefore, assent to the dismissal of the appeal, but with hesitation and doubt.\nSTRONG J \u2014.The decision of this appeal depends entirely upon the question whether the 2nd section of the Act of the Province of Quebec 44 and 45 Vic. chap. 40, conferred power upon the corporation of the town Of Levis to give the guarantee mentioned in that clause to pay the excess over $30000 of the costs of expropriation required for the extension provided for by the Act, and concurring in opinion with the minority of the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of Mr. Justice McCord in the Superior Court, I am of opinion that no such authority was conferred. It is manifest that such a guarantee would be altogether ultra vires of the general statutory powers of a municipal corporation in the Province of Quebec, and that the by-law authorizing it must be altogether void unless it can be referred to some special legislative authority. Then the only authority of the kind which has been or could have been invoked is this section 2, which appears to me to be altogether insufficient for the purpose. There are no enabling words in this clause, the material part of which is as follows:\nProvided that within thirty days from the sanction of the present Act the Corporation of the Town of Levis furnishes the said company with its valid guarantee and obligation to pay all excess over $30,000 of the cost of expropriation.\nThis provision does not assume to give the power; it rather assumes that the council already had or would obtain it. It is impossible, having regard to the general principles upon which private acts of parliament and acts imposing taxation and public burdens are to be construed, to say that a provision of this kind contained in a private act\u2014to which the general public are in no sense parties\u2014expressed in this indirect way can have the effect of authorizing the imposition of a serious public burden. Such a power is not even necessary to be implied from the language used, and even if it were necessary implication would be insufficient, direct and express words granting the power being indispensable in such a case. I construe the act as saying that the extension may be constructed, provided the Levis Council, either already having or procuring by legislation the right so to do, shall give the required guarantee; just this and no more is what is said, and this is insufficient to sustain the impeached by-law. It is well established by authority that an erroneous assumption in an Act of Parliament of a particular state of the law has not the effect of altering the law so as to make it conform to the mistaken impression of the legislature See the cases collected in Maxwell on Statutes ([1]).\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed the injunction discharged and the action dismissed in the Superior Court with costs to the appellants in all the courts.\nFOURNIES J\u2014I am of the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice McCord in his jugement. It is shown very clearly that the town of Levis had not the power to vote money for the railway. We find no special statute\u2014except that passed at the instance of the Quebec Central Railway for their own purposes\u2014 in which it is incidentally assumed that if the corporation pass a by-law for $30,000, such work shall be done. Evidently the writer of the bill thought the power existed, but it is clear that the town had no such power, and Judge McCord has given very strong reasons for the decision that there is no authority in the town to pass such a by-law.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of opinion that the corporation of Levis had not the power to impose the tax that has been contested here and I am also of opinion that the proceedings by injunction were justifiable. The time had passed, of course, for the carrying out of what was intended, provided the railway company objected to it; but if they chose to consent to it, it was within the power of the corporation to have passed the resolution for taxation at any time afterwards. Therefore in my opinion, the injunction was the proper remedy to stop them from agreeing with the railway company to carry out what was mentioned in the Act of Parliament. It is true the Act of Parliament laid an obligation on the railway company to take a particular course, provided the corporation were willing and took the proper means for paying a certain amount. I presume it was understood and believed at that time that the corporation had power under its charter to impose the tax; so no power was given by that Act to impose that tax. As there was no power given to the corporation to impose the tax upon the inhabitants, and their charter did not give it to them, I hold, therefore, that there was no authority for imposing the taxation upon the inhabitants of the town. Under the circumstances then, I think the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and that the injunction should not have been dissolved\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is a proceeding by petition under the provisions of the statute of the Province of Quebec 44th and 45th Vic. ch. 40 at the suit of the Quebec Warehouse Co. as ratepayers of the town of Levis, praying for an injunction to restrain the corporation of the town of Levis from proceeding further with carrying out the requirements of a certain by-law, passed by the council of the corporation and which as is contended is ullra vires or in any way to act thereon. The only objections made to the right of the petitioners to main-fain the proceeding instituted by them are:\u20141st. That the by-law, the validity of which is impugned, is a good and valid by-law and is authorized by Act of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, 44th and 45th Vic. ch. 40\n2nd. That the by-law having been passed, as it appeared to have been two days before the filing of the petition praying for an injection, nothing remained to be done under it that could be restrained by injunction; and\n3rd. That no injury can be sustained by the petitioners justifying the interference of the court by way of injunction.\nThe Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway Co. v Worksop Local Board of Health ([2]); Mac-Cormack v. The Queen's University ([3]); Pallison v. S Gilford ([4]); and Evan v. The Corporation of Avon ([5]); were relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents for the purpose of establishing, as he contended that they do establish, that according to the practice prevailing in the English courts, as to granting injunctions, the petitioners in the present case have no right to the relief by way of injunction prayed for by them, but these cases, rightly understood do not support that contention. In The Manchester Sheffield 8c Lincolnshire Railway Co. v. The Workshop Local Board of Health, the plaintiffs, who were owners of the Chesterfield and Gainsborough Canal which runs through Workshop, filed their bill whereby they prayed for an injunction to restrain the defendants the district board of health from diverting water from the canal and from fouling and polluting the water in the canal by using it to cleanse drains and sewers; and, also, to restrain them from permitting a sewer already constructed by them to communicate with a covered drain or water-course at the bottom of the Doncaster road and a tunnel under the plaintiffs' railway, or from using the same without the consent in writing of the plaintiffs first obtained for that purpose.\nV. C. Sir W. P. Wood, before whom the application for the injunction first came, being of opinion that the case, which was peculiar in its circumstances, was properly one for an action at law, made an order which, though not in terms for an injunction, had the effect of an injunction until further order, with liberty to the plaintiffs to bring an action. On appeal from this order the Lords Justices slightly varied it, directing the application for an injunction to stand over until further order, with liberty to either party to apply to the Court as they might be advised either before or after the hearing Upon the case being brought to a hearing before the Master of the Rolls, although he was of opinion that the course suggested by the Vice Chancellor would under the circumstances of the case, have been the most satisfactory to have been adopted, nevertheless he made a decree granting to the plaintiffs an injunction to restrain the defendants from permitting to remain open and also from opening or permitting to be opened any side sewer or other sewer in the plaintiffs bill mentioned so long as the said main sewer shall run through the said covered drain in the plaintiffs' bill mentioned, or otherwise discharge itself into the canal of the plaintiffs all parties to have liberty to apply as they might be advised, and the plaintiffs to be at liberty to bring such action as they might be advised. In pronouncing judgment the Master of the Rolls, Sir John Romilly, said:\u2014\nI think it impossible for this Court to grant a mandatory injunction to compel the defendants to undo all the works which, as they allege, are absolutely necessary to a plan they will have to form for the drainage of this district under the duties imposed upon them by the Legislature, and by which they will, as they allege, carefully guard against the evil apprehended by the plaintiffs. If it should hereafter appear that the defendants are not acting bon\u00e2fide, that their assertions are devoid of truth this court must deal with them as best it can, but at present I am of opinion that this court must give faith to the solemn and repeated assertions that they do not intend to inflict this injury upon the plaintiffs.\nAnd being of opinion that the Acts under which the defendants exercised their power did not justify them polluting the water of the canal or entitle them to drain their sewer into it without the sanction and consent of the plaintiffs he made a decree for an injunction to issue to the extent above stated That case is obviously distinguishable from the present one as also is MacCormack v. The Queen's University. In that case a petition was filed by three graduates of the university as petitioners, praying\\ that it might be declared that a royal charter granted to the university in 1866, was inconsistent with one granted in 1864, and that a resolution of the senate accepting the supplemental charter might be declared void; and for an injunction against doing any act to accept the same, or conferring any degrees in pursuance of its provisions; to this suit the university and the members of the senate were made parties respondents, but the attorney general was not a party, and the point adjudged was that the granting of university degrees is a branch of the royal prerogative, as also is the deputing of the power to a university and that if the acceptance of the supplemental charter by the senate alone was as was con-tended by the petitioners, invalid, no degrees could be conferred under it, and if, notwithstanding the university or senate should affect to exercise the power, they would be arrogating to themselves the exercise of the Queen's prerogative, and moreover, there would be injury to the public by the giving of titles which were represented to be valid degrees, but which upon the supposition would be worthless, and if, On the contrary, the petitioners were wrong in their view as to the invalidity of the acceptance of the charter, then they would be, by their suit, seeking to interrupt the due exercise of the Queen's prerogative by those to whom she had deputed it and to deprive all the Queen's subjects who might claim degrees under the powers conferred by the supplemental charter, of the advantages to which they are entitled; and so that the rights either to be asserted by the petitioners, or to be defended against them, were those of the Queen and the public, and that the attorney general alone was the proper person to represent such rights. Upon the authority of Evan v. The Corpora-lion of Avon, it was held that a graduate as a member of a corporate body, equally as any other plaintiff, in order to maintain a suit against the corporation must show some injury to himself as an individual to be redressed or prevented and it was held that the conduct of the majority of the senate in assuming to accept the supplemental charter on be-half of the university, and proceeding to act under it and grant degrees under it, was not an injury to an individual graduate which the Jaw could recognize. In Evan v. Avon it was decided that a suit, against a corporation not within the operation of 5 & 6 Wm.IV. ch. 76, to enforce public trusts, must be filed by the attorney general and not by an individual. In that case a single burgess filed his bill against a municipal corporation not within the Municipal Corporations Act, and praying for an injunction to restrain them from selling certain property and for an account. The Master of the Rolls, pronouncing judgment dismissing that bill upon a general demurrer filed thereto, says:\nPrima facie an ordinary municipal corporation, which is not within the Municipal Corporations Act, and it is admitted that this corporation is not within that Act, has full power to dispose of all its property like any private individual, and the burthen of proof lies on the person alleging the contrary to establish a trust. The trust may be of two characters, it may be of a general character or of a private and individual character. For instance, a person might leave a sum of money to a corporation in trust to support the children of A.B. and to pay them the principal upon attaining twenty-one, that would be a private and particular trust which the children court enforce against the corporation if the corporation applied the property for their own benefit; on the other hand, a person might leave money to a corporation in trust for the benefit of the inhabitants of a particular town, for paving, lighting or such like, that would be a general trust for the benefit of all the inhabitants, and the proper form of suit in the event of every breach of trust, would be an information by the attorney-general at the instance of all or some of the persons who were interested in the matter. If there was a particular trust in favor of particular persons, and they were too numerous for all to be made parties, one or two might sue on behalf of themselves and the other cestuis que trustent to enforce the private and particular trust.\nAnd the Master of the Rolls being of opinion that no trust in favor of the plaintiff was sufficiently alleged on the face of the bill, dismissed it. In Pallison v. Gilford the plaintiff, who was tenant for a term of years of the right of shooting over an estate the owner of which advertised it for sale in lots as suitable for building on, but gave full notice of the right of shooting, filed his bill for an injunction to prevent the intended sale, and the Master of the Rolls- Sir G. Jessel, dismissed the bill. In delivering judgment, he likened the notice of the intended sate which had been published by the defendant to information expressly given to the public who might contemplate becoming purchasers, that \"there were some plots one of which was particularly pointed out very eligible for building purposes, but recollect there is a right of shooting over all the plots, and you take subject to that right, and you must be careful not to make such an erection as will interfere with the. right of shooting.\" The principle upon which he proceeded was that laid down by Lord Cottenham in Harris v Taylor ([6]) where it was held that if an act threatened to be done could by any possibility be done in such a way as not to prejudice the right of the party complaining, it would not be restrained. The principle, says the Master of the Rolls, is this:\u2014\nIf you say the defendant is going to do an unlawful act you must prove that it is necessarily unlawful, it is not enough to say it may be unlawful.\nThe case of Winch v. Tue Birkenhead, Lancashire & Cheshire Ry. Co., and others ([7]), has more application to the present case than any of the above cited cases. What was asked by the plaintiff, who was a shareholder in the B. L. & C. Ry. Co. was that an injunction should be granted restraining that company from acting upon an agreement, which, as was contended, was vitra vires, entered into by and between them and two other rail-way companies who were also defendants, and the in-junction was granted. The Vice-Chancellor, Sir James Parker, giving judgment, says:\u2014\nI can see nothing in all that has taken place to prevent Mr. Winch, who is a shareholder in this company, from coming and seeking to restrain an infringement of the constitution of this company as it is established by law. Seeing that upon the evidence there was an intention, not disputed or contradicted, to act on this agreement on obtaining the sanction of a meeting of shareholders without going to Parliament, I think the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction in the terms of his notice of motion to restrain the Birkenhead Company from making over to the London & North-Western Railway Company, the Birkenhead Company line of railway, plant, or property, or any part thereof, on the footing of the agreement, and that the L. & N. W. Ry. Co. may in like manner be restrained from taking possession of the said lines of railway, &c., &c., on the footing of the agreement.\nIn Hoole v. The Great Western Railway Company ([8]) Lord Cairns L. J. and Sir John Rolph L.J were of opinion that if an individual shareholder of a company. having an interest, complains of an act of the whole company or the executive of the company as ultra vires, he may maintain a bill in his own name without suing on behalf of others to restrain the corporation from doing any act which is ultra vires\nIn Russell v. Wakefield Water Works Company ([9]) Sir G. Jessel M. R., pointing out the exceptions to the rule laid down in Foss v. Harbottle ([10]) says:\u2014\nThere are cases in which an individual corporator sues the corporation to prevent the corporation either commencing or continuing the doing of something which is beyond the powers of the corporation Such a bill may be maintained by a single corporator not suing on behalf of himself and of others as was settled in the House of Lords in a case of Simpson v. Westminster Palace Hotel Company. If the subject matter of the suit is an agreement between the corporation, acting by its directors or managers, and some other corporation or some other persons, strangers to the corporation, it is quite proper and quite usual to make that other corporation or person a defendant to the suit, because that other corporation or person has an interest, and a great interest, in arguing the question and having it decided once for all, whether the agreement in question is really within the powers or without the powers of the corporation of which the plaintiff is a member, so that in those cases you must always bring before the court the other corporation.\nIn Simpson v. Westminster Palace Hotel Company ([11]) the Lord Chancellor, Lord. Campbell states the law to be that if an attempt to do an act which is ultra vires is made by a joint stock company, although the act be sanctioned by all the directors and by a large majority of the shareholders, any single shareholder has a right to. resist it, and a court of equity will interpose on his be-half by injunction. In Cohen v. Wilkinson ([12]) Lord Chancellor Cottenham held the right of an individual member of a company to restrain the company from applying its funds to a purpose different from that to which he had subscribed, to be well settled by the court; and in Carlisle v. The South-Eastern Railway Company ([13]) he held the right to file a bill to restrain a railway company from declaring a dividend under circumstances which would be a violation of the Act of parliment put incorporating the company, was a right common to all the shareholders, and that such a bill upon behalf of a plaintiff and all other shareholders, except the directors would be one of the ordinary description in which the practice of the court permits such representation in pleading. In Patterson v. Bowes ([14]) the Court of Chancery for Upper Canada in 1853 held the principle upon which Winch v. Birkenhead Railway Co.; Cohen v Wilkinson, and Carlisle v. The South Eastern Railway Co., were decided to be applicable in the case of a municipal corporation, and entitled a ratepayer of the city of Toronto to maintain a bill on behalf of himself and all other ratepayers of the city against the mayor and the corporation of the city, to compel the former to account to the corporation for various large sums of money alleged to have been realized by him by the purchase of certain debentures of the corporation from persons who became entitled to them for value such sums so alleged to have been realized by the mayor being alleged to have accrued by reason of certain by-laws of the corporation to the passing of which the mayor had been a party.\nThis practice has been pursued in the courts of Upper Canada and Ontario ever since, and upon the authority of what is said by the Lords Justices in Hoole v. The Great Western Railway Co., by the Master of the Rolls in Russell v. The Wakefield Waterworks Co., and by Lord Campbell in Simpson v. Westminster Palace Hotel Co., and upon principle, it appears to me that a corporator, who is or may be injuriously affected in his rights or property by an Act of the executive of a municipal corporation which is ultra vires, may seek redress by process of injunction to restrain the corporation from committing the act, if it be not yet committed, or from doing anything under or in furtherance of such act, if already committed, equally as such person could apply for and obtain an order of the court for the quashing of a by-law of the corporation, which was not within the power and jurisdiction of the corporation to pass; and as the Act 41 Vic. ch. 14 specially authorizes the proceeding by way of injunction in such a case in the courts of the Province of Quebec, it cannot, I think, be doubted that in the present case the complainants have such an interest, and are or. may be exposed to such prejudice as entitles them to maintain the proceeding instituted by them in this case, if the obligation purported to be entered into by the executive of the corporation of the town of Levis, with the Quebec Central Railway Company be, as it is charged to be, ulivo, vires.\nIt is urged that the obligation having been completely entered into, as it appears to have been, just two days before the proceedings in this case were instituted, the complainants are now too late to object; but what is complained of is that the entering into the obligation was illegal as ulivo, vives, and as it purports to be an obligation to pay in a future event what may prove to be a very large sum of money, which could be paid only out of trust funds under the control of the executive of the corporation, in which every corporator is interested as a cestui que trust, if any such funds there be, or by levying a rate upon all the ratepayers of the town, the levying of which might involve the ruin of all of such ratepayers; what the complainants have a right to restrain and what they seek to restrain, is the doing of anything under or in furtherance of, or in discharge of the illegal obligation so entered into, and among such things to restrain the delivery of the document purporting to be the obligation of the corporation of the town of Levis to the Quebec Central Ry. Co., and to restrain that company from receiving and acting under it as a legal obligation or agreement. For determining whether it be or be not a legal obligation or agreement the present proceeding seems to be the most proper, the most convenient and effectual to be adopted, instead of the complainants standing by and looking on without complaint at the railway company incurring, it may be, an enormous expense upon the faith of the obligation and agreement being legal, and only tailing proceedings to avoid the obligation and its effect after such expense should be incurred. The case of Blake v. The City of Brooklyn, decided by the Supreme Court of the State of New York ([15]) and the cases upon which it proceeded, to which we have been referred by the learned counsel for the defendants, are quite distinguishable from the present case. In Blake v. The City of Brooklyn the matter complained of was an alleged injury to certain real estate of the plaintiff, which the corporation of the city of Brooklyn were proceeding to have filled up under authority claimed to be vested in them to make local improvements in the city, and the court held that in the absence of an allegation that the injury occasioned by the filling up of the lots would be parable, or that such filling up would cause any damage or injury whatever to the lots, an injunction to forbid the filling up would not be; but that the plaintiff should assert his remedy if any at law. And it was also held that an injunction to restrain the collection of an assessment not yet laid for the expense of such filling up ought not to be granted, and that the court would not interfere by injunction to review or correct such proceedings of a municipal corporation unless they were productive of peculiar or irreparable injury or must lead to a multiplicity of suits. In that case the plaintiff was the sole person concerned in the injury complained of. In the present case the obligation and agreement which is impugned, if enforced, may produce irreparable injury to all the ratepayers of the town of Levis, and unless the validity of the agreement shall be enquired into and determined in a suit instituted like the present, the questioning its validity would of necessity lead to a multiplicity of suits. But as the Act 41 Vic. oh. 14 specially authorizes the proceeding by injunction if the act complained of is ultra vires and as the Superior Court in the Province of Quebec dispenses law equally upon equitable as upon legal principles, the above cases can have no application whatever to the present suit. The only point, therefore, open to enquiry is whether the obligation or agreement which is impugned was Or not ultra vires of the municipal council of the corporation of the town of Levis. That town was incorporated and has its powers defined and prescribed by the Statute of the Parliament of Canada, 24 Vic. ch. 70 as consolidated and amended by the Act of the Province of Quebec 36 Vic. ch. 60, and it is.. admitted that under these Acts the corporation had not any power or authority whatever to enter into the agreement purported to be entered into with the Quebec. Central Railway Company, nor had it any power to enter into such an agreement unless such power he given by an Act passed by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec entitled \" An Act to amend the charter of the Quebec Central Railway Company,\" 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 40 The second section of that Act enacts that the said company shall be bound to continue their line from the present terminus of the Levis and Kennebec Railway along a particular course specified in the Act.\nProvided that within thirty days from the sanction of the Present Act, the corporation of the town of Levis furnishes the said company with its valid guarantee and obligation to pay all excess over thirty thousand dollars of the cost of expropriation for the right of way upon the said described route, and in default of said guarantee and obligation being so furnished, the said company shall be relieved of the obligation to adopt the route and erect the station described in this section, and shall have the right to avail itself of the provisions of section one of this Act.\nNow, this Act does not profess to confer upon the corporation of the town of Levis or upon the municipal council thereof any greater powers than were already conferred, nor to subject the ratepayers of the town to any greater burthen than were already imposed upon them by the Acts of incorporation of the town. The clause in question seems to have been inserted in this Act, which is an Act, as its object indicates, promoted by and in the interest of the Quebec Central Railway Company, under the mistaken impression that the corporation of the town of Levis had power to enter into the obligation and agreement mentioned in the section, but promotors of legislation\u2014and legislators themselves \u2014are not exempt from the human frailty of acting under erroneous impressions. As then it is admitted that apart from the Act 44 & 45 Vic. ch. 40 the council of the municipality had no power whatever to enter into such an obligation as that which is impugned, and as that Act does not confer any additional powers upon the council nor subject the ratepayers to any additional burthens, but only authorizes and requires the railway company to adopt a particular route in the event of the corporation entering effectually into a legal obligation, into which, as now appears, it cannot legally enter, the plaintiffs are entitled to a perpetual injunction restraining the corporation of the town and the Quebec Central Railway Company from proceeding further in any way by or under or in virtue of the instrument of the 2lth day of July, 1881, purporting to be an obligation or guarantee of the corporation of the town of Levis, and restraining the said railway company from accepting it as a legal obligation or as having any binding effect or validity whatever, and from acting under it.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be allowed with costs, and a perpetual injunction be ordered to issue in the court below to the above effect.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Irvine & Pemberton.\nSolicitors for respondents: Boss\u00e9 & Languedoc.\n[1][1] Ed.2, p. 374 to p. 381.\n[2] 3 Jur.

S., employed as his agents in Liverpool J. & Co., the defendant J. being a member of their firm, and as agents in New York he employed the firm of S. & B., of which the defendant S. was a member. In the course of his dealings with these agents he became indebted to both firms for acceptances by them of his drafts, made when he was in want of money, towards the payment of which they received the freights of his vessel and remittances in money. On one occasion he said that he would give to the Liverpool firm a mortgage on the \"Tsernogora\" or the \"Magnolia\" when they should require it, and in a subsequent conversation with a member of the firm he agreed to give such mortgage on certain conditions which were not carried out. He also promised the firm in New York to give them security in case anything happened, and mentioned as such security a mortgage on the \"Tsernogora.\" According to f.'s own statement he had sufficient property to pay his liabilities when these conversations took place. A few weeks after these conversations took place, F. executed a mortgage of 20\/64 shares of the \"Tsernogora\" in favor of the defendants J. and S. and had the same recorded, and within thirty days thereafter a writ of attachment in insolvency was issued against him. The plaintiff, who was appointed assignee of F.'s estate by his creditors, filed a bill to have the mortgage set aside, claiming that it was void under section 133 of the \"Insolvent Act of 1875.\" The defendant J. did not answer the plaintiffs bill, and the other defendants denied that the mortgage was made in contemplation of insolvency, and also claimed that as it was made under the provisions of the \"Merchants' Shipping Act\" (Imperial), it was not affected by the \"Insolvent Act of 1875.\" The judge in equity, before whom the cause was heard, made a decree in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the mortgage to be set aside, and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia dismissed an appeal from that judgment. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Henry J. dissenting, that the promise to give security \"in case anything should happen\" could only mean \"in case the party should go into insolvency,\" and that the transfer was void under section 133 of the \"Insolvent Act of 1875.\"\nHeld, also, that the provisions of the \"Merchants' Shipping Act\" did not prevent the property in the ship passing to the assignee under the Insolvent Act.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment of the judge in equity.\nThe facts of the case are fully reported in the judgments delivered by the court, and in the report of the case in the court below.\nPelton Q.C., and Gormully for the appellants, contended that the plaintiffs could not set aside the mortgage from Flint to Snow and Jones: 1st, because the mortgage was not executed in contemplation of insolvency or in violation of the Insolvent Act, but in good faith for sufficient consideration, without knowledge of insolvency and in pursuance of a previous agreement, and fresh advances, and extended accommodation and payments were made and given on the faith of such agreement by the defendant Snow, and the firm of which he was a partner, to the defendant Flint, and on this branch of the case relied on the following cases: Campbell v. Barrie[2]; Allan v. Clarkson[3]; Ex parte Winder in re Winstanley[4]; Ex parte Wilkinson in re Berry[5]; Bittlestone v. Cooke[6]; and Bills v. Smith[7]; and Williams on Bankruptcy[8]; and McWhirter v. Thorne[9]. And because under \"The Merchant Shipping Act of 1854\" (Imperial), and the Colonial Laws Validity Act (Imperial), and under the Statutes of Canada, the right and title of the defendant Snow under the mortgage could not be defeated or affected in any way by the provisions of the Insolvent Act and amendments; citing McLachlan on Shipping[10]; Merchant Shipping Act, 1854[11]; Statutes of Canada, 1873[12]; Bell v. Bank of London[13]; Kitchen v. Irvine[14]; Cahoon et al v. Morrow[15].\nBingay Q.C. and Graham Q.C. for respondent.\n1. There is no repugnancy between the Merchants' Shipping Act, 1854, and the Insolvent Act, 1875. There may be an incidental interference in the operation of the latter as there is in Canada in respect to legislation of the Dominion and the provinces, but there is no conflict between the two Acts. See Citizens' Insurance Co. v. Parsons[16] B. N. Act, secs. 91, 56. All Dominion legislation and all the provisions of the Civil Code respecting ships would be repugnant if the Insolvent Act is. The Dominion Parliament has full power under the B. N. A. Act to legislate in respect to insolvency and shipping. The Merchant Shipping Act provides for title to shipping. The Insolvent Act says a trader in insolvent circumstances cannot make a transfer. Bell v. Bank of London[17]; Lindon v. Sharpe[18].\n2. The onus is on defendant to show that the alleged previous agreement which is used to support this transfer was made bon\u00e2 fide, and when the insolvent was in such circumstances that he could lawfully make such a transfer. Wilkinson re Barry[19].\nThere must be other evidence than that of the parties to the agreement. Morton v. Nihan[20].\nThe agreement was to postpone the security until Flint was on the verge of insolvency, and cannot support the transfer. Kerr on Fraud[21]; Ex parte Burton[22]; Ex parte Kilner[23].\nThe section of the English Bankruptcy Act is different, and the agreement cannot be imported into our statute, except on the theory that it was an agreement such as in equity would be specifically performed. Even in such case, if a secret agreement can be used to support a transfer, the sections respecting fraudulent preferences are useless.\nSir J. W. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The facts and pleadings, as stated in the judgment of the judge in equity, are as follows:\u2014\nThis is a bill at the instance of a creditor assignee under the insolvent Debtors' Act to set aside a bill of sale by way of mortgage by Thomas B. Flint, one of the defendants, to Thomas C. Jones and Ambrose Snow, also defendants. The bill sets out that a mortgage on 20\/64 shares owned by him in the ship \"Tsernogora\" was executed by the defendant Flint in favor of the defendants Jones and Snow on the 15th April, 1879, in pursuance of an alleged previous agreement made with them severally to give them security pro rat\u00e2 on the ship for advance made by them severally to him in his business. That Flint was then largely indebted and in insolvent circumstances, and that on the 13th day of May, 1879, and within thirty days from the making of the mortgage, he was placed in insolvency and the plaintiff appointed assignee. That the defendant Flint's shares in the \"Tsernogora\" formed the principal part of his assets, and that the mortgage had been made fraudulently and in contemplation of insolvency. The bill prayed that it be set aside and the registry cancelled, &c.\nThomas C. Jones, defendant, one of the mortgagees, did not appear. Flint and Snow the other mortgagees appeared and answered separately, Flint denying that he was in insolvent circumstances, and that the mortgage was made in contemplation thereof, and both of them setting up a previous verbal agreement that Flint would give to Snow and his partners, the firm of Snow & Burgess, security for further advances to be made by them to him, which advances to a large amount had been made by them to him in reliance upon such agreement or promise, and that such agreement was made with Flint without any knowledge on their part of his being in insolvent circumstances.\nIt appeared by the evidence that Flint, who was a barrister by profession residing at Yarmouth, in the Province of Nova Scotia, was and had been for some years previously, a ship-owner. He owned shares in several ships which he employed in general carrying trade. His agents in Liverpool, England, were T. C. Jones & Co., and in New York Snow & Burgess. At the time of his failure he owned property, valued at schedule rates, as follows:\u2014\nReal estate\n$ 9,350\nMortgage on real estate\n800\nPersonal chattels,\n1,300\nShares in \"Tsernogora\"\n12,500\nShares in four other vessels\n10,450\nDebts and balances due him\n3,500\nTotal\n$37,800\nLIABILITIES.\nDirect\n$ 36,000\nIndirect\n40,000\n$ 76,000\nThe assignee proved that these properties were scheduled at higher rates than they would bring, the bulk of his real estate was mortgaged for its full value and about the same time as the mortgage on the \"Tsernogora\" Flint's share in two other vessels were mortgaged and other securities given by Flint to creditors some of whose claims had not matured. All of the parties in whose favor Flint had endorsed to the amount of $40,000 in all were really in insolvent circumstances, and to his knowledge were then badly strapped (to use his own expression) for money. Their temporary solvency depended on the stability of parties abroad and especially upon Charles Gumm & Co., of Liverpool, England, and their failure which was evidently not entirely unanticipated by Flint and the news of which was received by him before the execution or registry of the mortgage to Jones and Snow, threw the whole of them including Flint into a state of hopeless insolvency.\nIt is needless to discuss the evidence to show that Flint knew or at least feared that he was about to become insolvent and whatever promises he made to the mortgagees to give them security it appears to me to be so clear on his own evidence that he was induced to give the security at that time by the fear of insolvency at a very early period that it would be a work of supererogation to insert in this judgment the elaborate analysis of the evidence on that point of the case which I have prepared. What I have to say on another ground of defence will incidentally throw some further light upon it.\nThe defendant's second defence set out in the Bill was that admitting the mortgage to have been made in contemplation of insolvency the statute did not apply because it was made to fulfil an agreement which had been previously made between the parties which agreement was not made in contemplation of insolvency and that the court would uphold the conveyance made in pursuance of that agreement as if it had been made at the time and under the circumstances attaching to the agreement.\nHe informs us in his evidence that he had a conversation with Alfred Snow, one of the firm of Snow & Burgess, at their office in New York, about 1st November, 1878, more than six months before the mortgage was executed. That for some time previous to that date he had been in the habit of drawing on Snow & Burgess when he wanted money and at the same time sending them as collateral security joint and several notes from himself and the parties in Yarmouth for whom he was in the habit of endorsing, viz., Rogers & Co., Horton, Kelly & Lewis. The amounts of these drafts were paid as they became due by freights of Flint's vessels and by remittances from him to them. Mr. Snow at that conversation told him that they objected to the note as collateral security for the drafts and asked for other security and Flint promised that he would \"give them security in case anything should happen.\" He mentioned among other things the \"Tsernogora,\" \"they said they would leave it to me to protect them, they had security at the time in collateral notes, I did not increase my indebtedness to them, they were not consulted with reference to the mortgage before my giving it, the did not demand the mortgage previously to its being given, the giving of the mortgage was Voluntary on my part.\" In his cross-examination he says that \"they consented to continue the business with the understanding that they were to be kept secured.\" But he subsequently modifies this by the statement \"that he agreed to give them collateral notes whenever I drew on them and told them I would give them a mortgage on the 'Tsernogora' in addition to the notes should they want additional security.\" This they never did, they received the collateral notes with every draft without demanding additional security or even mentioning the matter after that conversation.\nHe states that he had this conversation and promise, in his mind when he put Snow's name in the mortgage. His original intention was to give each of the parties\u2014Jones & Co. and Snow & Burgees\u2014a separate mortgage each on ten shares of the ship, and he had a week previously made drafts of these mortgages, but finally, obviously on receipt of news of Gumm & Co.'s failure, he hurried the two into one brief mortgage and hastened to the office of the registrar to get the mortgage entered as soon as possible.\nWhile I am by no means prepared to say it is necessary that a previous arrangement to give a security, must be such a technical binding contract that specific performance could be enforced in equity, or damages for a breach recovered at law, after a careful consideration of the evidence, I find it extremely difficult to say, that in this case there was any bon\u00e2 fide agreement binding or not binding, to give the mortgage; but assuming there was, I think the evidence abundantly shows that the mortgage was to be given as the mortgagor says only, \"in case anything should happen,\" which I can only take to mean \"insolvency,\" and that when actually given, it was given in contemplation of insolvency, and therefore a violation of sec. 133 of the Insolvent Act of 1875, which enacts:\nIf any sale, deposit, pledge or transfer be made of any property real or personal by any person in contemplation of insolvency, by way of security for payment to any creditor, or if any property, real or personal, movable or immovable, goods, effects, or valuable security, be given by way of payment by such person, to any creditor whereby such creditor obtains or will obtain an unjust preference over the creditors, such sale, deposit, pledge, transfer or payment shall be null and void, and the subject thereof may be recovered back for the benefit of the estate by the assignee, in any court of competent jurisdiction; and if the same be made within thirty days next before a demand of an assignment, or for the issue of a writ of attachment under this Act, or at any time afterwards, whenever such demand shall have been followed by an assignment, or by the issue of such writ of attachment, it shall be presumed to have been so made in contemplation of insolvency.\nIn view of the object and policy of this Insolvent Act being to secure a general and equal distribution of an insolvent estate among all the creditors of the insolvent, and with that view to prevent preferential dealing with creditors with a view to insolvency, can it be said that this promise to give security in case anything should happen, was not by its very terms to be carried out only in the event of insolvency, or with a view to insolvency? And, as clearly established by the evidence, it was, in furtherance of this intention, only given when ruinous insolvency had overtaken the mortgagor.\nThe authorities, in my opinion, clearly establish that any promise that a creditor shall have priority in the event of bankruptcy is contrary to the policy of the bankruptcy laws and void.\nIn ex parte Burton in re Tunstall[24] the marginal note is as follows:\u2014\nShortly before a trader filed a liquidation petition he executed a bill of sale of substantially the whole of his property, to secure the repayment of an advance which had been made to him two months previously. At the time when the advance was made the borrower agreed to give a bill of sale to secure it; but the agreement was that the bill of sale was not to be signed until the tender \"lost confidence\" in the borrower. Held (reversing the decision of Bacon C.J.), that this amounted to an agreement to postpone the giving of the bill of sale until the grantor should be on the verge of bankruptcy; and that, consequently, on the principle of ex parte Fisher it could not support the deed. James L.J.:\nThere we held that it is a fraud on the bankrupt law for a man to undertake to give his creditors a bill of sale when required, that is to say, when the circumstances of the debtor shall be such as to require the creditor to demand it. That decision established an exception upon an exception. That which is void is an assignment of all a man's property for a past consideration. But a court of equity regards that which has been agreed\" to be done as done, and therefore it has said that, if it was really part of the understanding when the money was advanced that a bill of sale should be given, then that agreement would be the same thing as if the bill of sale had been actually given at the time. The bill of sale would be sustained by the previous agreement. But ex parte Fisher established this exception upon that exception to the rule, viz., that if the bargain be not an out-and-out one, but only an agreement to give the bill of sale when required, then it is only a device to enable the debtor to acquire false credit, and the creditor is not entitled to avail himself of it in the event of the debtor's bankruptcy. It is a fraud on the bankrupt law. To my mind that is exactly the present case. The bill of sale was not to be signed till the borrower had \"lost the confidence\" of the lender:\nThesiger L. J.:\nThe only question is whether, at the time when the advance was made, there was such an agreement to give the bill of sale as this Court can give effect to. The debtor's evidence is that the bill of sale was not to be signed till Whitehead had \"lost confidence\" in him. If that evidence is not displaced it brings the case within the principle of ex parte Fisher, which is not to be frittered away by nice distinctions, and the evidence of Whitehead admits something of the same kind, for he says that the bill of sale was not actually signed till he had lost confidence in the debtor.\nEx parte Kilner in re Barker, Baggalay L.J.[25]:\nThe principle applicable to cases of this description is enunciated by Lord Justice Mellish, in giving the judgment of the court in ex parte Fisher[26], in these terms: \"Although we do not dispute the rule that where a sum of money is advanced on the faith of a promise: that a bill of sale shall be given, such sum is to be treated as a present advance on the security of a bill of sale, we do not think this rule will protect transactions where the giving of the bill of sale is purposely postponed until the trader is in a state of insolvency, in order to prevent the destruction of his credit, which would result from registering a bill of sale. We think that such a postponement is evidence of an intention to commit an actual fraud against the general creditors.\" He dealt with the particular circumstances of that case, and said that there was evidence \"from which we infer that it was understood between the bankrupt and Mr. Wells, from the commencement of the advances, that a bill of sale was to be given, if required, by Mr. Wells, though, for the purpose of protecting Mr. Ash's credit in the meantime, the giving of the bill of sale was purposely postponed until he was unable to go on, and was in a state of insolvency.\" Now I think it is clear from the way in which the principle is enunciated by Lord Justice Mellish, that it must be for the court in each case that comes before it to take into consideration all the surrounding circumstances, and to see whether, having regard to these circumstances, there is evidence of an intention to commit an actual fraud against the general body of creditors.\nThesiger L.J.:\nShe relies upon a prior agreement which she says supports the bill of sale on the principle laid down in Mercer v. Peterson[27] and cases of that class. Those principles are undoubtedly binding upon this court, but I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that their application in any particular case ought to be most carefully guarded, because it cannot be disputed that they do, unless they are applied with very great caution and under the most careful limitations, open the door to very considerable frauds. It appears to me, therefore, right that the court should require from any person setting up a bill of sale, executed under such circumstances as those which exist in the present case, very clear evidence that the agreement which is set for the purpose of rendering the bill of sale valid was a bon\u00e2 fide agreement, or, in other words, using the expression of Lord Justice Mellish in ex parte Fisher[28], that it was not an agreement that the bill of sale was to be delayed until such time as the trader should be in a state of insolvency, in order to prevent the destruction of his credit which would result from the registration. I think that the decision in ex parte Fisher supplied a most wholesome corrective to the dangers which, as it seems to me, may arise from the principles laid down in Mercer v. Peterson[29], and that we ought to apply the doctrines laid down by Lord Justice Mellish to their full extent, and to require, in this and similar cases, a very clear explanation of the reason why the giving of the bill of sale was delayed. Here no explanation whatever is given of the delay, and I should infer from the evidence that the intention of the parties at the time when the agreement of November, 1877, was made, that no bill of sale should be required until the debtor should be in a state of insolvency, in other words, the execution of the bill of sale was postponed for the purpose of protecting his credit.\nI am clearly of opinion that the Dominion Parliament in legislating on the subject of bankruptcy and insolvency, had full power and authority to declare that an insolvent trader in Canada should not make a transfer of his property, including his ships registered in Canada in contemplation of insolvency, and that sec. 133 applies to this mortgage so made.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Unless the mortgage which is impeached by the bill in this case can be referred to some prior agreement, it is clear that it must be held to be void as a voluntary preference within the terms of section 133 of the Insolvency Act 1875, for it was given within thirty days next before the issuing of the writ of attachment, and moreover, the mortgagor, Flint, is proved to have been insolvent at the time and the evidence shows that it was given voluntarily, that is without any pressure on the part of the mortgagees. The real question is, therefore: Was there a prior agreement come to in good faith, sufficient to make the security unimpeachable on behalf of the creditors? Flint in his evidence thus states the prior agreement to which he attributes the giving of this mortgage, he says:\u2014\"When I was in New York in the fall of 1878, I had a conversation with Snow and Burgess about drawing on them, and told them I would see my account protected in case anything happened, and mentioned amongst the securities the \"Tsernogora.\" The learned judge in equity before whom this cause was originally heard, construed this reference to the case of anything happening to mean in case there was any danger of loss to the creditors arising from the insolvency or probable insolvency of the debtor. In this, he was, I think, entirely right. Can we then consistently with authority hold that such an agreement as this, to give security in case of insolvency or apprehended insolvency, leaving it to the debtor himself to determine when the occasion has arisen, takes from the transaction of the mortgage the character of a voluntary preference which standing alone must be attributed to it. I am clearly of opinion that it does not The cases of ex parte Fisher[30], re Tunstall[31], and ex parte Kilner[32], are all in point to show that such an agreement is in itself invalid, as being a fraud on the Insolvency Act, and therefore one which can give no support to a security otherwise void as a voluntary preference. In the cases cited the security was prim\u00e2 facie void under the Bankruptcy Acts as comprising all the debtor's property, and it was in each case sought to support it by proof of a prior agreement to give security \"when required\" or \"if required,\" which was held insufficient, the court saying that it was a fraud on the Bankruptcy Act to agree with a trader that he should give security if he got into difficulties, but meanwhile should enjoy the benefit and credit of appearing to be the absolute and unencumbered owner of the property. The agreement in the present case seems still more objectionable for it leaves the giving of the security to the voluntary act of the debtor, Who is himself to determine when it is to be given, and who, therefore, has it in his power, if he thinks fit so to do, to withold it altogether. There is no reason why the principle of the cases cited should not apply to the case of an agreement to give security on specific property as well as on all the insolvent's property when the security is given under such circumstances that standing by itself it would be a fraudulent preference. The security being prim\u00e2 facie void as a voluntary preference under the 133rd section of the Act the onus was on the mortgagees, if they could, to displace presumption by evidence. All they have shown for that purpose is a previous arrangement to give security which was in itself a fraud on creditors and on the Insolvency Act.\nI see nothing in the point that ships registered under the Merchants' Shipping Act do not pass to the assignee. The Insolvency Act was clearly constitutional and has been so held by the Privy Council. No proper Insolvency Act could have been passed unless it made provision for the disposition of all the insolvent's property. Property in British registered ships must, therefore, like other property, be held to vest in the assignee. If, for the purpose of perfecting the assignee's title, it is requisite that some assignment of the vessel should appear on the registry the judge has power to compel the insolvent to execute such an instrument.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014For the same reason I am in favor of dismissing the appeal. The court of Nova Scotia was unanimous in holding that the mortgage was given in contemplation of insolvency. The contention, that the moment a mortgage or bill of sale of a ship is registered, no matter by what fraudulent means it is obtained, the title is absolute and unimpeachable, is untenable. You can find nothing to support this view in the Merchants' Shipping Act. The provision in the statute is simply to afford a ready means of disposing of this kind of property, giving a power of sale to the mortgagee so that he may dispose of it in the most summary manner. That is the only object of the law in giving that form of title and making it absolute, but it does not prevent the title being attacked by all regular modes. I do not consider that this kind of property is exempt from being attacked for fraud. For these reasons, viz: the contemplation of insolvency and that the title is not so absolute so as to prevent it being attacked for fraud, which are the reasons given by both the Equity judge and the majority of the Supreme Court judges, I am in favor of dismissing the appeal.\nHENRY J.\u2014I regret that I cannot come to the same conclusion on either of the two points which have been mentioned by the Chief Justice and my brother Fournier.\nWe are certainly governed by the decisions which the learned Chief Justice has referred to, and the law which he has laid down, but I maintain that the circumstances are different from those in the cases to which he has referred. It is under the 133rd section that the party respondent seeks to set aside this mortgage, and I may here state that the Insolvent Debtors' Act being in curtailment of common law rights of the parties must be strictly construed. The 133rd section says[33]:\nNow, that is the assumption that is made, and that is all that the Act says\u2014that if it is done at any time and it is proved that it is an unjust preference that is given to a creditor and that it is done by the person in contemplation of insolvency, then it is void.\nIn the first place, we must see whether it was done in this case in contemplation of insolvency. We are to take the evidence of Flint, and if we come to the conclusion that his evidence is totally unreliable, we can come to the conclusion that it was done in contemplation of insolvency; but if his statement is true that it was not done in contemplation of insolvency, because he swears most positively that when that was done (and several cases have been decided in this court that favor the same position that he occupied) that it was not so done in contemplation of insolvency, that he expected to tide through, and that he expected by making this arrangement with Snow and Jones and Co., that he would be in such a position that he would be able to carry through his business, then the provision of that section has not been violated. That is his sworn testimony; it is not contradicted, nor do I see any reason to disbelieve it, and, therefore, I think that in this respect the allegation that the act complained of is against the provision of the statute has not been sustained by the evidence.\nIn the next place the presumption arising from the fact that the mortgage was given within thirty days, is capable of being rebutted, and I think the evidence here rebuts it to this extent, that if the parties under the agreement obtain advances from other parties on an undertaking to secure them, this clause has no effect whatever and the implication in respect of the thirty days is in fact completely negatived. Section 131 says:\nA contract or conveyance for consideration respecting real or personal estate, by which creditors are injured or obstructed, made by a debtor unable to meet his engagements with a person ignorant of such inability, whether such person be his creditor or not, and before such inability has become public and notorious, but within thirty days next before a demand of an assignment or the issue of a writ of attachment under this Act, or at any time afterwards, whenever such demand shall have been followed by an assignment or by the issue of such writ of attachment, is voidable, and may be set aside by any court of competent jurisdiction upon such terms as to the protection of such person from actual loss or liability by reason of such contract, as the court may order.\nNot one tittle of evidence is given to show that the parties to whom the mortgage was given were aware of the inability on the part of Flint to meet his engagements. On the contrary the whole of the members of the firm swear most positively that they had no idea of it. What should the court do under such circumstances? They might make an order, under the terms of this clause of the Act, that the party should give up the security, but that he should be reimbursed for any advances that he had made in consideration of that security. I therefore think, under this clause of the Act, the plaintiff is not entitled to succeed, and he has not sought redress under that section of the Act, but under the 133rd section, which, I think, has a totally different object in view. Then we must also look to the 132nd section, which enacts:\nAll contracts or conveyances made and acts done by a debtor, respecting either real or personal estate, with intent fraudulently to impede, obstruct or delay his creditors in their remedies against him, or with intent to defraud his creditors, or any of them, and so made, done and intended, with the knowledge of the person contracting or acting with the debtor, whether such person be his creditor or not, and which have the effect of impeding, obstructing or delaying the creditors of their remedies, or of injuring them, or any of them, are prohibited and are null and void.\nUnder that section of the Act there is no evidence to show that the parties who obtained the mortgage had any fraudulent intention, or in fact, had any information that this party was making an assignment when in embarrassed circumstances. As to that part of the case then I think it is necessary to look at some of the evidence that has been given. I will not read it over. I have noted the different pages at which it is to be found, and have come to the conclusion that a careful reading of the evidence, and a comparison of the evidence of Flint, of Snow and others, will not establish the position that Flint was to give the security only when the other parties required it or became doubtful of him. or when in a state of insolvency; the evidence does not sustain any one or other of these positions; the advances were made solely on the condition that he was to secure them. Six months before this assignment was made, in the month of October, 1877, Allbright, a partner of Jones, who was one of the parties to this mortgage, objected to accepting further drafts, and told Flint that they did not wish to continue the business, that it was an unsatisfactory way of doing business, but they continued to do it on the promise of Flint that he would have them secured. In October, 1878, that is six months before this assignment was made, another conversation took place between Flint and Alfred S. Snow, and there again the evidence is that Snow said to Flint, when agreeing to continue the acceptance of his drafts, we trust to you to keep us secured; we will not go on at present, but under your promise to keep us secured we will accept these drafts of yours, and they went on and accepted drafts to something like the amount of $18,000, on the promise that he would keep them secured, and the very name of this vessel that was assigned afterwards was mentioned as one of the means of security. They swore most positively that if it had not been for that engagement they would have changed the business and refused to accept the drafts, but in consequence of that promise, not that he would give them a bill of sale on the vessel or a mortgage when they ceased to have faith in him or went into insolvency, but that he was to keep them secured. They go further and say that they expected it had been done before it was done. I therefore think that this is not a case in point. It is not a case the same as those referred to in the cases read by the learned Chief Justice. I take a different view of the evidence altogether from that taken by my learned brethren. The evidence is very particular and all the parties swore that they had no idea that Flint was insolvent or in embarrassed circumstances. Reading the whole of the evidence carefully, it appears just to amount to this, \"we will continue to advance to you and you will make us secure,\" and he promised to do so. If he failed to do that in proper time it was no fault of Snow or of Jones & Co.\nThere is another very important point connected with this which has not been very much touched upon by the learned Chief Justice. With all due deference I must differ from the construction of the Merchants' Shipping Act given by my two learned brethern. I have come to the conclusion, that if the transfer were given by an insolvent, the Insolvent Act of course touches the property, and if it were not for the provision of the Merchants' Shipping Act they might go behind the mortgage, and ascertain whether it was given contrary to the Insolvent Act or not, but I maintain that enquiry is prohibited by the Imperial statute. We are told, and it is admitted, that in England an insolvent court could not go behind a mortgage; but we are told in so many words, that in Canada, in contravention of the Imperial Act, that can be done which could not be done in England. We know that the Merchants' Shipping Act applies to all British possessions, and when it is provided that an Insolvent Act shall not effect mortgages, surely if an English Insolvent Act cannot, a Colonial Insolvent Act cannot override the provisions of the Imperial Shipping Act. Were it not for the Insolvent Act there would be no question in this case. And this, be it borne in mind, is not a question of fraud, there is no allegation of it, it is an unjust preference, and unjust because the statute makes it so. It is not fraudulent, but if it were proved to be fraudulent there might still be a difficulty under the Merchants' Shipping Act. Now what is the Merchants' Shipping Act, and what does it provide? The 43r section says:\nSubject to any rights and powers appearing by the register book to be vested in another party, the registered owner of any ship or share therein shall have power absolutely to dispose in manner hereinafter mentioned, &c.\nSuch ship or share. That is in the case of the transfer of a ship. Section 66 says:\nA registered ship, or any share therein may be made a security for a loan or other valuable consideration, and the instrument creating such security hereinafter termed a mortgage, shall be in the form marked \"1\" in the schedule hereto or as near thereto as circumstances permit; and on the production of such instrument, the registrar of the port at which the ship is registered shall record the same in the register books.\nNow when we know that the Act is universal throughout all British territories, how can we say that that is to be contravened by a colonial law?\nI said before that if it was a fraudulent transaction that was set up here, the case might possibly be different; but it is not so; it is a mere provision of the Insolvent Act passed by the Dominion of Canada, and that, it is said, overrides the provision of the English Act. But we are told that the provision in question only applies to England. How do we find that it only applies to England? It applies as generally as any other provision of it; it goes everywhere that that Act has operation, as part of it. How can it be said then that the Dominion Parliament is authorized to override an Imperial statute? The reason that Parliament had for passing that Act in England, we may surmise, but it is not necessary that we should; but I may mention that ships go all over the world, and a man owning a ship registered in England makes a mortgage on it and has his certificate from his port of entry that there are no incumbrances on that ship; he wants advances, and he is told \"yes, I will give you advances, but you must keep me secure.\" Amongst other articles by which he might be secured is a certain ship and her name is mentioned, and the party advances him two thousand pounds in a foreign port, but he says, \"oh you did that in contemplation of insolvency,\" because four or five months afterwards he became insolvent. Now, the statute was intended to prevent anything of that kind taking place, and it was intended that a party should go to the registry and take conveyances from that registry. It is all provided for in the Act, and it seems to me perfectly plain and palpable that the intention of the British Parliament was that the registry or transfer of a ship or bill of sale was not to be affected by anything outside between parties, and unless fraud itself should vitiate the contract. Under these circumstances, for the reasons given in the judgment of Justice Wetherbee of Halifax, in which I concur, I am of opinion on that point that the appeal should be allowed. But there is another section of ch. 63 of the Imperial Act of 28 and 29 Vic., sec. 2, which reads as follows:\u2014\nAny colonial law which is or shall be repugnant to the provisions of any Act of Parliament extending to the colonies, to which such law may relate, shall, to the extent of such repugnancy, but not otherwise, be and remain absolutely void and inoperative.\nHere is the provision of the Act.\nIt must be repugnant or else it cannot override it, and here is a provision in the Imperial statute which says that any such colonial law shall have no effect whatever.\nOne answer was given to this in the argument at Halifax, and that was in reference to a provision in the Act that the Merchants' Shipping Act might be amended by a Colonial Act specially approved of by the Queen in Council, and it was argued on the part of the respondent that inasmuch as this Insolvent Act of Canada was passed and received the Queen's assent by the Governor General, that that satisfies that clause in the Act, but I maintain that it cannot affect it, The statute itself makes particular provision how it is to be done, that is by an Order of the Queen in Council; but that has not been done. The assent of the Governor General to a bill passed by the Dominion Parliament is very different from an Order of the Queen in Council; giving the royal consent to it is not sufficient for what is required by that clause of the Act.\nUnder the whole of the circumstances I think the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree with the learned Chief Justice that this appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the mortgage in question was clearly given in contemplation of insolvency. On the second point raised in the case, as to the effect of the provisions of the Merchants' Shipping Act, I have strong doubts. There seems to me to be a great deal of force in the reasons just given by my brother Henry on that part of the case, and it the judgment in the case were to depend on the conclusion I arrive at, I would certainly have taken more time to consider that important question.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Sandford H.

C. P. (L.C.)\u2014Assignee represents only Assignor.\nIn the absence of a statutory title to sue as representing creditors, such as is conferred by bankruptcy and insolvency statutes, an assignee in trust for creditors can only enforce the same rights as the person making the assignment to him could have enforced; therefore the defendant could not. by a plea in his own name, ask to have a conveyance, made by the debtor to the plaintiff prior to the assignment under which defendant claimed, rescinded or set a side as fraudulent against creditors.\nThe nullity of a deed should not be pronounced without putting all the parties to it en cause en declaration de lugement commun,\nSemble\u2014The plaintiff, being a second purchaser in good faith and for value, acquired a valid title to the property in question which he could set up even against an action brought directly by the creditors.\n.APPEALL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]).\nThe action in this case was commenced by the appellant (plaintiff), by a writ of seizure in revendication of certain machinery. The appellant claimed to be the proprietor of the machinery in question, in virtue of a deed of sale thereof executed by a certain firm of J. G. Gebhardt & Co. to the Canada Paper Co. before Beaufield, notary public, on the 27th day of April. 1880 and of another deed executed by the Canada Paper Co. to appellant on the 12th day of May, 1881, before Marler, notary. Concurrently with the sale from Gebhardt & Co. to the Canada Paper Co. the latter executed a lease of the object of sale to the former and Gebhardt & Co. remained in possession of the goods. After the date of this sale Gebhardt & Co. continued their business and used the machinery in question for about a year, when they became financially embarrassed, and made a voluntary assignment of all their estate and effects to respondent, Alexander Moffatt, before a notary; and in virtue of that deed Moffatt took possession of Gebhardt & Co.'s place of business and its contents\u2014and among other property, the machinery now in question. Moffatt had advertised the estate, including this machinery, for sale, when he was stopped by the present action. The action was directed against the firm of Gebhardt & Co., as being legal possessors of the effects claimed, and also against respondent, as being in physical possession thereof, and detaining them against appellant s will. Gebhardt & Co. did not plead but Moffatt appeared and pleaded the assignment of the said effects to him, as above set forth: that the deed from Gebhardt & Jo. to the Canada Paper Co. was fraudulent and simulated; that Gebhardt & Co. were at the time insolvent; and concluded that said deed should be declared null and that he (Moffatt) be maintained in his possession.\nThe appellant, by his answer to the plea of Moffatt alleged that Moffatt had no right to defend his possession of the goods seized in this cause, by setting up pretended matters personal to the creditors of G. J. Gebhardt & Co.\nThat Moffatt was not and did not allege himself to be a creditor of said firm or to have suffered damage by reason of the pretended fraud, which he alleged. That if the deed or transfer in trust, alleged by Moffatt, conveyed to him any rights whatever, which was denied, the same did not convey to him the right to take possession of property not belonging to the defendant, nor to represent the rights of the creditors generally, nor to defend any action such as the present.\nThat if Moffatt held any legal position under the said deed, such position was that of defendants George J. Gebhardt & Co., and not that of the' creditors of the firm.\nThat all of the creditors of the said firm of G. J. Gebhardt & Co. did not consent to the said deed of assignment, nor did even a majority of them nor did any of said creditors authorize Moffatt to plead as he had done.\nThat Moffatt was pleading droits d'autrui, and his plea was void.\nThat said Moffatt alleged nothing personal to himself, nor to G. J. Gebhardt & Co., to justify his retention of the goods seized.\nThe plaintiff in addition fyled a general answer.\nThe Superior Court dismissed Moffatt's plea and maintained Burland's action. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), that court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, on the ground that the assignee under a voluntary deed of assignment by a debtor for the benefit of his creditors can, as such assignee, sue and be sued in reference to the estaee and property assigned to him.\nArchibald for appellant, and Strachan Bethune, Q. C. and J. Doutre, Q. C, for respondent.\nThe points relied on by counsel and authorities cited are fully noticed in the judgment of Taschereau, J. hereinafter given, and in the judgments of the court below ([2]). RITCHIE, C. J., concurred with Taschereau, J.\nSTRONG, J.:\nThis is an action of revendication to recover certain plant and machinery,. brought against the assignee for the benefit of the creditors of the original vendors, under whom the plainti\u00edf claims The defendant impeachss the original contract of sale entered into between the insolvents, the assignors of the defendants, and the persons from whom the appellant purchased, as being fraudulent against creditors.\nThe objections to the judgment, very ably urged in argument by Mr. Archibald which seem to me to be conclusive in favor of the appeal are: first, that the assignee, the present respondent, has no locus standi for the purpose of maintaining such a defense, as it could not have been successfully pleaded by the assignors themselves. The debtor who makes a deed which is fraudulent against creditors cannot institute an action to set. it aside, and his assignee can stand in no better position than his author. This is the view taken by Mr. Justice Monk and I think he is entirely right. In English law, as administered in England and the Province of Ontario the law to this effect is well understood and settled as is apparent from the cases of Robinson v. McDonell ([3]) in England and that of McMaster v. Clare ([4]), in Ontario. And in the United States though the decisions are not uniform the law is generally settled the same way\u2014at least, I find it so stated in a recent and American treatise on the law relating to conveyances in fraud of creditors ([5]) where the authorities will be found collected. In the Province of Quebec the reasoning upon which these decisions proceed is a fortiori applicable\u2014since the maxim \"nemo potest plus transferre quam ipse habet,\" is of course also the rule of that law and the principle upon which the exceptional American cases profess to be founded, namely, that the assignee is the representative of the creditors, is, in Quebec, excluded by the well known rule of the ancient French law that no one can sue by uprocureur \" except the King. Therefore in the absence of a statutory title to sue as representing creditors, such as is conferred by bankruptcy and insolvency statutes, an assignee in trust for creditors can only enforce the same rights of action as the parties making the assigment to him could have enforced.\nA second ground for allowing this appeal is that the appellant was a purchaser in good faith and for value. There is no evidence to show that he had any intimation of fraud in the first sale by Gebhart & Co. to the Canada Paper Company, so that he stands in a different and more advantageous position than the original purchasers ([6]). Therefore, if this action had been instituted by the creditors directly, instead of by the assignee, it must have faired.\nOn these grounds, which I only state shortly and in outline. I am of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed. The reasons I assign for my judgment will be fully treated in the judgment which has been prepared by my brother Taschereau and I refer to that for a more amplified statement of the arguments and reasons upon which, I think, the appeal should be decided.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with Taschereau, J. HENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe defendant in this action claims under a convev-anee from Gebhart & Co. they having made to him an assignment of their property in general terms for the benefit of their creditors. The plaintiff claims under a conveyance from another party about a year previous, who purchased the property in question from Gebhart & Co. for a valuable consideration. He had a prior title from Gebhart & Co. to that of the assignee. He says: I have the title I have paid a valuable consideration for the property and I am entitled to hold it. It remained in the possession of Gebhardt & Co. under the lease by which they were to pay rent to the original purchasers and they were at the time in the position of tenants of the property purchased from Gebhardt & Co He was therefore in possession of the property by his tenants from whom he had a right to receive rent and that being so, and the defendant being in possession the action is brought to recover possession of it. The assignee claims under an assignment from Gebhart & Co. of all their property. The question then arises: What did he take under that ? He took only such property as Gebhart & Co. had the right to sell. Gebhart & Co., having the year previously sold this property, had no right or title to it. But he says: You made that assignment to the other company fraudulently, in fraud of your creditors. But the question is: What right had he to say so? He did not take possession under the Insolvent Act which enables the assignee to go back and enduire into the transactions of the insolvent for some time previous to his becoming insolvent; and which, if he finds creditors have been improperly preferred, or that assignments made previously have been in contemplation of bankruptcy, provides that he shall have the right of enquiry into the circumstances \u2022 and no such power is given to an assignee apart from the Act. The assignee merely took the title that Gebhart & Co. had, and, having taken that he has no right to enquire into the dealings of Gebhart & Co. by which they transferred the property previously. The property was theirs at the time and they cannot say: We assigned it fraudulently, and he as their assignee is not permitted to say so. Under these circumstances, I think the case, independently of any questions which might otherwise arise, is clearly in favor of the plaintiff in the action. I think therefore that the judgment of the court below is erroneous. There was a good deal of law cited by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in the Province of Quebec, but it does not touch the point. The assignee had conveyed to him the property that Gebhart & Co had, but that is not the question here. The position here is that he did not receive any itle to this property in question, because Gebhart & Co., at the time they made the assignment, had no title to give him. Therefore the law cited, that an assignee of property may bring an action to recover it, is not applicable. I, think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed and that the judgment should be to affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the appellant.\nTASCHEBEAU, J. C.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a judgment dismissing an nction in revendication by which Burland, the appellant, claims certain machinery, which he contends the .respondent Moffatt, detains illegally. Burland, in his declaration, alleges that he bought this machinery by deed of the 12th of May 1881 from the Canada Paper Po who had themselves bought it from Gebhart & Co. by deed of the 27th of April, 1880.\nMoffatt answered this action by a plea alleging that lie detains the said machinery under a voluntary assignment, of the 13th June, 1881, by the said Gebhart & Co., of the whole of their estate, to him, Moffatt, for the benefit of their creditors; and. that when Gebhart & Co sold it to the Canada Paper Co. they were insolvent or embarrassed, the said sale having been collusively concerted in order to give to the said company a fraudu-lent and illegal preference in fraud of the other creditors of the said Gebhart & Co. The conclusions of this plea are that the said sale of Gebhart & Co. to the Canada Paper Co., and the sale by the Canada Paper Co. to the plaintiff, be declared to have been, and to be simulated, fraudulent, inoperative, null and void; that the said deeds be rescinded and set aside and the action in revendication of the said plaintiff dismissed. To this plea Burland replied that Moffatt had no legal status to oppose such objections to this action; that Moffatt was not a creditor and had no interest; that he could not plead defences that belonged only to the creditors; and that he had no authority to represent the creditors by pleading in his own name.\nThe Superior Court in Montreal (Rainville J.,) dismissed Moffatt's plea and maintained Burland's action on these grounds, as follows:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant quo le d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas droit de plaider \u00e0 cette cause en la qualit\u00e9 par lui invoqu\u00e9e parce quo personne d'apr\u00e8s l'article 19 du Code do Proc\u00e9dure Civile no peut plaider au nom d'autrui.\nConsid\u00e9rant en outre qu'en supposant quo Ia vente faite par lea dits George J. Gebhart et Cie. serait simul\u00e9e et frauduleuse\u00bb cette simulation ou cette fraude ne pouvait r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir centre lo d\u00e9mandeur qui a acquis les dits meubles de bonne foi pour valable consideration.\nConsid\u00e9rant que d'ar\u00e8s los articles 1025 et 1027 du Code Civil du Bas Canada, l'ali\u00e9nation d'une chose certaine et determin\u00e9e rend l'acqu\u00e9reur propri\u00e9taire par le soul consentement des parties sans tradition, et ce aussi bien a l'\u00e9gard des tiers qu'a l'\u00e9gard des parties contractantes, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence le d\u00e9mandeur eat propri\u00e9taire des effets saisis revendiqu\u00e9s.\nI am of opinion that this judgment was right, and should not have been reversed by the Court of Appeal as it has been. Clearly, Moffatt, by his plea, professes to represent and act in lieu of the creditors of Gebhart & Co and of them only. It is not for Gebhardt & Co. and as their representative that he asks the resiliaiion of these deeds. In that quality he could not have done so for the simple reason that Gebhart & Co. could not themselves have done it. And as to himself he is not a creditor does not claim to be one, and has personally no interest whatever in the case. He is certainly not procurator in rem suam. By the said plea he became virtually a plaintiff, in his own name, in an action Pauliana, or en declaration de similation. Now, if he had instituted a direct action of the same nature would he have done so in his own individual name, or in his quality of assignee. I can answer without hesitation, that he never would have thought of sueing otherwise than in his quality of assignee. Then, on what ground can he contend that here he in his own individual name has the right ht to demand for Grebhart's creditors the resiliation of the said deeds? The only answer he has given to this is that he had to do it because he is sued in his own individual name. But surely that could not hinder him from filing an intervention in his quality of assignee, or from bringing a direct action in this quality. That nut ne peut plaider par procureur is, and has always been, the law. In Nesbitt v. Turgeon ([7]), the Court of Queen's Bench (as far back as 1845, Sir James Stuart C.J., Bowen, Panet and Bedard, JJ.), held that even in the case where the debtor had expressly agreed that the action against him should be brought in the name of the attorney or agent, it could not be done. There are apparent though no real exceptions to this rule but none applicable here, and the respondent has failed to produce a single authority to establish that with us, the assignee, or trustee, for the benefit of creditors has in his own and individual name the actions of the creditors. And this alone would dispose of his demand en r\u00e9siliation. Could he however, be considered an assignee or trustee, he would not have has more success. In the absence of a bankrupt law, the assignee represents the assignor, but not the creditors. Mr. Justice Monk has clearly demonstrated this proposition in his dissenting opinion m the present cause, and the respondent has cited no authority to the contrary outside of the writers under the Ordinance of Commerce of 1613 or the French Code of Procedure or the Code of Commerce all of which are not law here.\nIn our own courts I cannot find a single case in which, the point being taken, it has been held, that an assignee under such circumstances can act for and in the name of the creditors. In all the cases cited by the respondent and which I have been able to refer to, the assignee was suing for the assignor, as his locum tenens and claiming the assignor's right. In not one of them, can I see that the assignee was exercising the personal actions of the creditors, that is the actions given to them alone, and denied to the assignor. Withall v. Young ([8]) and Bruce v. Anderson ([9]) would seem to be exceptions to this, but a reference to these cases shows that the point there was not at all raised by the parties or decided by the court In Starkie v. Henderson ([10]), it was the assignor's action that the plaintiff had taken, and on the peculiar state of facts, the court held that there was a privity of contract between himself and the defendant, and that so he had rightly brought the action in his name. Of course in exercising the assignor's action, and claiming the assignor's rights and debts, the assignee does it in the interest of the creditors as well as of his assignor but that is quite different. It is then as any concessionaire may do, the actions pertaining to the assignor, the actions that before the assignment, or without It, the assignor would himself have had which he then brings whilst here the assignee claims rights pertaining to the creditors alone, and to which his assignor could never have had any claim.\nIn Prevost v. Drolet ([11]) in the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Loranger, delivering the judgment of the court, held that an assignee, under the assignment to him by an insolvent for the general benefit of his creditors, not made under the Insolvent Act, has no quality to sue in his own name for anything connected with such assignment. That was going further than was necessary to do here. By the report of the case one would certainly think that the court there were unanimous in that holding. It may be, however, as has been said at the bar, that the three other judges composing the court simply concurred in the result of the judgment on the plea to the merits without entering into the question discussed by Judge Loranger But to make them hold quite the reverse as contended here by the respondent, simply because the demurrer attacking the plaintiff's rights of action had been dismissed by the judgment of the first court, and because the said judge in appeal did not reverse that judgment seems to me going far, as the appeal was by the plaintiff, who had obtained gain de cause on the demurrer, and who consequently did not complain of the judgment which had dismissed it. However this is immaterial, the case having no application h\u00e9re, as the plaintiff there also claimed, purely and solely as locum tenens of the assignor a debt due to the assignor. The cases of Ferries v. Thomson and Amour & Main ([12]), and mills v. Philbin ([13]), cited by the respondent, do not seem to me to have any bearing the present case, whilst two reported cases are decidedly adverse to him. In Chevalt v. de Chantal ([14]), it was distinctly held that the assignee cannot judicially represent the creditors of the assignor. And in Whitney v BLdeaux ([15]) Mr. Justice Badgley also held that the assignees of an insolvent cannot ester en justice for the creditors.\nThe respondent has cited some unreported cases from Montreal of 1845 or 1846. 1 have not been able to refer to them, but they were probably under the then existing bankruptcy law, 7 Vic , ch. 10 (1843), and from what has been said of them, they were, I believe, all actions belonging to the assignor that had been so brought by the assignee.\nI may here remark, this assignment was not made for the benefit of Gebhart & Co's. creditors generally, but only for the benefit of nine specified creditors, parties to the said deed, the said nine creditors to be paid their claims on the proceeds of the sale of Gebhardt & Co's, estate, goods and chattels, the surplus, if any, to be raid over to the said Gebhart & Co. Burland, the appellant, was himself one of these nine creditors, and it has been urged upon us that this was fatal to his present action, But I really cannot see how this alone could confer upon the respondent the right to ester en justice as locum tenens of the creditors. Bur-land, moreover, signed the deed without prejudice to any privilege or security he had; and when Gebhart & Co. assigned their goods and chattels, without any description or enumeration whatsoever, and without any schedule annexed to the deed or any mention whatsoever of the machinery in question here, Burland was it seems to me, perfectly justified in not seeing in the deed an assignment of what were then his goods and effects. They ceded their goods, not Burland's\nAnother serious objection taken against the respondent is, that none of the parties to the sale by Gebhardt & Co. to the Canada Paper Co. of which the revocation is asked are en cause. See Lacroix v Moreau ([16]). Neither the paper company nor Gebhardt are parties to this issue, and neither of them have had an Opportunity to contest this demand in revocation. iMoffatt here as I have already remarked does not represent Gebhardt & Co., and does not pretend to do so.\nL'action en rescision, (says B\u00e9darrrde). ([17]) doit \u00eatre poursuivie directement contre les auteurs du dol., alors m\u00eame que la chose qui en est l'objet serait pass\u00e9e en d'autres mains.\nThe reasons this author there gives for this opinion apply to all revocatory actions, and to the actions instituted by the creditors not parties to the deed ([18]).\nAnd it is on the party who demands the revocation of any deed under such circumstances that lies the duty to see the entire fulfilment of all the conditions necessary for the success of his demand. If Moffatt had formed his demand in resiliation by an action he would have had to direct it against Gebhart & Co., as well as against the Canada Paper Co. and against Burland Now, when he demanded this resiliation, as here, by an incidental procedure, why did he not bring en cause Gebhardt & Co and the Canada Paper Co. en d\u00e9claration de jugement commun. By holding fast to the old and well established rule that, in any proceeding and demand, all the parties interested in its results should be called in, courts of justice will prevent a multiplicity of contestions and contradictory judgments. For it is evident that, here, for instance, a judgment between the appellant and the respondent could not be opposed to the Canada Paper Co. and would not be res judicata as to them. And this would be so perhaps even as regards Gebhart & Co. Though some cases have gone so far as to say that it is not always necessary that all the parties should be called in (on what authority does not appear). I am not aware of any case in which a deed has been annulled in the absence of all and every one of the parties thereto. The court may, perhaps, sometimes, if in the course of the proceedings it is of opinion that certain other parties have an interest in the case, upon proper application, order them to be summoned ([19]), But it would not do so after a final hearing on the merits. If it then appears that though the objection has been taken, ab initio, the party demanding the resiliation has claimed the right and persisted in going on with the case on the issue joined with the adversary he has chosen, his demand must be dismissed; he has failed voluntarily to put the court in a position to grant it, and his adversary has then an acquired right to its dismissal Were the court to order then the mise en cause of any other party, it would necessarily follow that the pleadings, enqu\u00eate, and all the proceedings, would have to be begun over again, a result which it is obvious would be an injustice to the party entitled to a judgment.\nMoffatt's contention that in an action in revendication\u2014\"Si la chose n'apparlient pas au possesseur vous devez faire assigner son bailleur\"\u2014is irrefutably answered on the part of the appellant, by the fact that he has done so and that Gebhart & Co Moffatt's bailleurs are co-defendants in this suit That the appellant should have summoned the creditors I cannot see. Is the plaintiff, in a petitory action, obliged to put en cause the mortgagees ? Then, if Moffatt had no right to question the titles upon which the action is based, his doing so cannot have put the appellant under the obligation to call in any other party who might have had that right. Burland's action is to revendi--'cate the possession and ownership of this machinery, and is surely well brought against both the actual detainer and the pretended owners of it (for the assignment would not deprive Gebhart & Co. of the ownership of it.) Then, how can Moffatt be admitted to contend that the appellant should have called in the creditors when he rests and leaves his whole case on the ground that he himself here is acting for them and represents them, and that it is entirely and solely for and in their name that he asks the resiliation of the plaintiffs title. If he represents the creditors they have not to be called on. If he does not represent them he is out of court.\nThe rule that the defendant in an action in revendication, upon his declaring that he does not hold for himself, has a right, upon saying for whom he holds, to be put hors de cause, does not apply, I believe, where the said defendant joins issue and engages in a contestation with the plaintiff. This contestation, it is evident, has to be brought to judgment between the parties to it and them alone and the defendant then who has taken upon himself to resist the plaintiff's demand, cannot be admitted to complain that the real owner is not en cause,\nAnother important question raised by the appellant, and also decided in his favor by the Superior Court, is that he was a second purchaser in good faith of the machinery in question, and that whatever fraud may have been committed between Gebhardt and The Canada Paper Co. cannot affect his rights to the said machinery, and his purchase of it from the Paper Co. The great majority of writers on this point (1) are of opinion that the action Pauliana does not lie against a subsequent purchaser in good faith, though Laurent (2), it would seem, is of a contrary opinion. However, it is unnecessary for us to consider and determine that question here as on the first ground alone the appellant is entitled to succeed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Archibald & McCormick.\nSolicitors for respondent: Dunlop & Lyman.\n[1] 4 Dorion's Rep. 590.\n[2] 4 Dorion's Rep 590 et seq.\n[3] 2 B. & Ald 136.\n[4] 7 Gr, 550.\n[5] Wait on Fraudulent Conveyances, at p. 179.\n[6] See D\u00e9molombee Contrats et obligations, t. 2 p. 196 No. 200, et seq.; Capmas, Revocation des Actes.

In 1873, the plaintiff became entitled under this by-law, and in 1876 the Synod (the successors oft he Church Society) repealed all previous by-laws respecting the fund, and made a different appropriation of it.\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the court below, Fournier and Henry, JJ., dissenting,) that under the terms of the trust there was no contract between the plaintiff and defendants; the trustees had power, from time to time, to pass by-laws regulating the fund in question and making a different appropriation of it, for the support and maintainance of the clergy of the Diocese, and the plaintiff must be assumed to have accepted his stipend with that knowledge and on that condition,\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of Proudfoot, J.[2] The facts of the case are fully given in the report of the case 29 Gr. 348, and in the judgments of the court below, reported in 9 Ont. App. Rep. 411.\nDalton McCarthy, Q.C., Harding with him, for appellant; S.H. Blake, Q.C. for respondents.\nThe points relied on by counsel and cases cited are fully noticed in the reports of the case in the courts below and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nI think the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be sustained and the appeal dismissed. I cannot see that the plaintiff has made out any valid and binding contract or vested right whereby he became entitled to receive an annuity of $200 out of the funds in question, and that no power existed in the Synod whereby a change in its management of the fund could be made which would affect him, on the contrary I think the synod had, by the express provisions concerning the management of the fund, the power of determining from time to time by by\u2011law, in what manner the trust fund should be dealt with, provided always it was for the support and maintenance of the clergy of the diocese.\nThe learned judge of first instance, says: \u201cThe plaintiff had the right to assume when placed on the fund that he would remain there while the conditions on which the grant was made continued to exist.\u201d On the other hand, may it not with much more force be said, that in as much as the trust was for the support and maintenance of the clergy, in such a manner as shall from time to time be declared by any by-law or by-laws to be from time to time passed for that purpose, the plaintiff had no right to assume that the disposition of the fund would not be from time to time altered as the exigencies of the diocese, and the maintenance and support of the clergy then might, in the judgment of the synod, require.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nIn stating the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived that this appeal must fail, I shall be as concise as possible. I need not trace the title to the trust fund in question from the clergymen who originally commuted their charges on the clergy reserves, with the Government of Canada, to the Church Society of the Diocese of Huron, and from the latter society to the Synod of Huron, the present defendant, all of these mutations are sufficiently set out and explained in the pleadings and in the judgments delivered in the courts below. It is sufficient for the present purpose to say that upon the 2nd March, 1869, the defendants held this fund subject to the claims upon it of the original commuting clergymen upon trusts which may be stated as follows, viz.: \u201cFor the support and maintenance of the clergy of the Diocese of Huron in such manner as should from time to time be declared by any by-law or by-laws of the synod to be from time to time passed for that purpose.\u201d The principal, and as it seems to me the only substantial question which we are called upon to decide is that involved in the construction of this trust. If the by-law of the 2nd of March, 1869, under which the plaintiff in effect claims title to an irrevocable annuity for his life or during active service as a clergyman of the Diocese of Huron is in excess of the powers conferred on the synod as trustees of the fund, it is of course to that extent void, though before determining it to be void we must endeavor so to construe its terms as to read it consistently with the trust and to make it intra vires of the trustees. What, then, was meant by the founders of this charity, for such in law it is, when they declared that it should be applied to the purposes designated in such manner as should be declared \u201cfrom time to time\u201d by by-laws to be \u201cfrom time to time\u201d passed? It is plain that this must depend entirely on the meaning to be attributed to the words \u201cfrom time to time,\u201d an expression, it will be observed, twice repeated. Did the settlors, by that expression, intend to confer on the members the power to create absolute vested interests in the fund or in its income, or must it be taken to mean that such dispositions as the synod should make, should be by by-laws at all times subject to repeal or alteration? No one can doubt that the terms of this declaration of trust would not warrant the permanent alienation of the capital of the fund, for such a disposition of it would clearly be a breach of trust since the trustees would be thereby incapacitated from dealing with it from time to time by by-laws to be passed from time to time. Then the income of the fund is to be held on precisely the same trust as the principal for the words are, \u201cshall have and hold the said commutation money and all interests and proceeds thereof upon trust,\u201d as before stated. Therefore, a permanent alienation of the income would be as objectionable as a similar alienation of the corpus. Next, if a permanent alienation is inadmissible, upon what principle can it be said that an alienation of revenue for a fixed limited time is authorized? None that I can see. Such a disposition of the income would disable the trustees from performing the duties of their trust, which is from time to time as they in their discretion shall think fit (for such is the construction we must attribute to this provision), to make by-laws regulating the administration of the income of the fund\u2014which they could not do if their hands were tied by irrevocable disposition of the proceeds binding on them for a fixed and limited time however short.\nI, therefore, come to the conclusion that the terms of this trust made it incumbent on the trustees to reserve to themselves such power as should enable them to be free to act at all times, and did not warrant any disposition of the income which should not be subject to be recalled or altered by any by-laws which the synod might think fit to pass. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider the terms and proper construction of the by-law of 2nd March, 1869, under which the plaintiff makes title. That by-law must either be in conformity with the trust, as I construe it, in which case the plaintiff has no right to object to its alteration or repeal, or if it is to be construed as attempting to give the plaintiff a vested and irrevocable interest it is ultra vires of the trustees and void. If the terms of the trust had been sufficiently wide to have authorized the trustees to confer a permanent and limited interest in the revenue, it would of course have been essential to the disposition of the case to have considered the proper construction of the by-law, and to have ascertained from it what interest the synod intended to give to clergymen of the class to which the plaintiff belongs, but that alternative in the view I take, does not arise. I think it right, however, to state that if we were restricted to a consideration of the terms of this by-law of March, 1869, I should be unable to determine that it amounted to a grant of an annuity to the plaintiff either for life or for his term of office or during active service. In this aspect of the case Weir v. Mathieson[3] might have been found to have some application. But I prefer to rest my judgment on the broader ground first indicated, and, therefore, I no not feel called upon to say anything decisive as to the construction of the by-law. The argument of analogy derived from the law relating to powers of appointment and the case of Hele v. Bond[4], which was pressed upon us by the counsel for the appellant has, in my opinion, no application here. In the case of a power, an exercise of which is made subject by the instrument of its creation to a power of revocation, the law, no doubt, is settled that the donee cannot revoke an appointment unless he expressly reserves to himself a power to do so. Thus the donee of a power so subject to revocation can exercise an option. But in executing a trust the terms prescribed by the settlor must be strictly followed, and if a trust fund is directed to be applied exclusively in such a manner and by such instruments as are from time to time subject to revocation by the trustees, it is a clear breach of trust on the part of the trustees to attempt to execute the trust in any other manner than that so prescribed, and such attempted execution is void. To put it still more concisely, in the case of the power it is optional with the donee to provide for a revocation or not as he may elect. In the case of a trust it is obligatory upon him to execute it according to the very terms the settlor has directed.\nAs regards the canon or by-law (it matters not which it is) of June, 1876, I am unable to see any valid objection to that enactment. The plaintiff himself had given notice of a proposal to amend the by-law of 1875, and the amendment proposed by Mr. Logan, which the synod ultimately adopted, was strictly an amendment to the canon or by-law introduced by the plaintiff. Further, the consequence of an omission to give notice was not according to the constitution, that the regulation should be void, but merely that the business should not be entitled to precedence according to the order indicated. Moreover, I am of opinion that these provisions of the constitution are entirely directory, and that it was competent to the synod to dispense with their observance without at all events making by-laws or canons passed without a strict observance of their requirements subject to be avoided and disregarded as nullities in a judicial proceeding. Upon this head I refer to what has been said by Mr. Justice Patterson, with whose judgment upon this point I entirely concur. The appeal should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am sorry to differ from the judgment of the majority of this court, but I interpret the trusts as Mr. Justice Proudfoot has, and for the reasons given in his judgment, I am in favor of allowing the appeal.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI also feel bound to sustain the decision of the Vice-Chancellor in this case, and I entirely endorse all the reasons which he gives for his judgment. The fund in this case applicable to the clergymen of the diocese, who were not originally to receive the commutation, was an accumulating one. It was provided to be received after the death of the different incumbents on the commutation fund; and provision was made, that the funds, arising from the death of the different incumbents, should be appropriated by the trustees, for the support and maintenance of the clergy from time to time, as, by the by-laws of the Church Society, should be provided. This is the agreement referred to:\u2014\nIndentureday ofA.B. 1855,\nbetween the Church Society of the diocese of Toronto of the one part and\nof the other part. Wheraes A.M. is a clerk in holy orders, and is incumbent of and as such is now and has been in receipt of \u00a3121 13s. 4d., from the Clergy Reserved Fund, and whereas the said A.M., under and by virtue of a statute lately passed by the provincial parliament, is entitled with the consent of the Bishop of the said diocese to receive from the Government of Canada a certain sum of money in commutation of his said salary of \u00a3121 13s. 4d., and has consented and agreed to pay the said sum so to be received from the government as such commutation to the said Church Society in consideration of the payment by the said Church Society to the said A.M. of the said sum of \u00a3121 13s. 4d. per annum in manner hereinafter mentioned, and in further consideration of the several covenants hereinafter mentioned respecting the said commutation money. Now this Indenture witnesseth that for the consideration aforesaid and in consideration of the said commutation money to be paid by A.M. to the said Church Society, the said Church Society covenants and agrees with the said A.M., his executors and administrators\u00bb that the said Church Society shall and will well and faithfully pay to the said A.M. the annual sum of \u00a3121 13s. 4d. by even and equal payments on the first days of the months of January and July in each and every year, so long as the said A.M. continues to do duty in holy orders as aforesaid in the said diocese, and in the event of his being disabled from doing such duty by sickness or bodily or mental infirmity, so long as such sickness or infirmity shall continue; and when and as soon as such annual payment to the said A.M. shall cease the said Church Society shall have and hold the said commutation money and all interest and proceeds thereon upon such trusts for the support and maintenance of the clergy of the said church within the said diocese, or such other diocese as the diocese shall hereafter be divided into; and in such manner as shall from time to time be declared by any by-law or by-laws of the said Church Society, to be from time to time passed for that purpose, so long as the said trust shall continue to be administered by the said society; and in the event of the synod of the said diocese being legally invested with corporated powers so as to be enabled to carry out the trusts aforesaid, shall and will transfer and assign the said commutation money and any securities in which the same may be invested and all interest and proceeds then unappropriated arising therefrom to the said synod by whatever corporate name called, upon the same trusts and interests and purposes as the same shall and may be held and taken by the said Church Society by virtue of these presents. In witness whereof the said Church Society affixed corporate seal, &c.\nWe have to construe that agreement before we go any further, and my construction of it is this\u2014the funds were not provided at the time, they were to be the result of the death of the different incumbents, and the coming in of the funds; and that agreement gave the trustees power to appropriate them from time to time as new cases should arise; but not to re-appro- priate the same money. Having once made the approtion of came sums as they came in, they had the right, from time to time, only to make appropriations of the further funds as they accumulated.\nIf we look at the nature of the circumstances in which the clergy stood, the provisions of the different by-laws, and the object of the donors, we shall find that this was intended as a permanent provision for the clergy. We find as a condition of the grants, that the stipends that the clergymen received from the different parishes should be given up. There were certain other considerations connected with the grant, and although it is not stated in plain terms, I think the proper construction of the agreement is that when these clergymen came within the rules laid down, the society had no right to change the appropriation made in their favor, and mix them up and change them from time to time.\nIt is true that the words used \u201cfrom to time\u201d bear two different constructions, and which of these are we to adopt?\nI am free to say that, looking at the nature of the whole surrounding circumstances, I can put but one construction upon them. It is true that if a person gives away what is his own, he has a right to impose such conditions as he pleases. But here is a fund that is placed under the control of the society as trustees of the donors; a fund not intended for the casual support of the clergy, but for their continuous support and maintenance. How could that be carried out if the society were to take to itself the power of withdrawing that aid in any one year, or for a term of years. If they could change it from year to year, if they could modify it, they could take it away altogether; and how, then, could they be said to be carrying out the undertaking to provide support and maintenance. It is to be noted that the fund was not for the maintenance of the clergy generally, but of each clergyman who was put upon that superannuation list.\nWhat are the terms? It is provided that no other clergy shall be placed upon the list until other funds arise. A certain number are provided for, and it is provided that no further names are to be added. How, then, could there be that general supervision and control in these very words, which, if carried out, would deprive the church society of the power of revision.\nNow, what does this mean? For how long a period is it intended? When a clergymen is superannuated, is it not the intention that the allowance should be made to him for life. Surely it was not intended to superannuate him for a year, when he is induced to give up his living on the understanding that he is to be superannuated. The agreement is not carried out by the superannuation for a year, or for any term less than the period of his natural life.\nWe are told in the judgments of some of the courts below that there was no contract. It is not necessary that a contract should exist. The question is what is the construction of the document by which the trust is created. It is not necessary, in order to carry out the object of the trust, that a contract should be entered into. The question is what is the construction of the document which creates the trust? If a contract existed at all, it would be between the settlor and those who were benefited by the trust; the Church Society were merely instruments, and, therefore, not in a position to enter into any contract at all.\nNow, with regard to the by-law, I differ from those who sustain it.\nThe constitution under the law and under the statute requires that by-laws shall be made for the government of the society. The society made by-laws, which became as binding as if enacted by the legislature. Under these by-laws the business to come before the meeting was provided to be only of two characters, first, that submitted by the bishop, and, second, that submitted by the committee. The plaintiff here gave notice, according to regulation, that he would submit an amendment to the by-law. That was brought forward regularly and properly, within the rules of the corporation. Every member submitted and was bound to submit to the by-laws. They were bound by them. If, then, there was a rule governing the meeting, every one was bound by that rule. And if the whole synod contracted with each individual member that there must be a certain rule of proceeding, that contract must be observed, or else what is done cannot have a legal binding effect.\nNow, this motion to amend the by-law having been brought before the meeting, another member moved what purported to be an amendment to that motion. It was really nothing of the kind. It was another substantial motion to amend the original by-law. No notice had been given of such a motion; and I take it that a notice was as absolutely necessary, as it was in the case of the resolution moved by the plaintiff; and, if a notice is duly given of a motion to amend a by-law, that notice does not entitle another person to move a resolution to amend the by-law in a directly opposite direction. I think with the Vice-Chancellor who heard this case, that the by-law passed in 1876 was ultra vires and had no binding effect.\nBut we are told that the plaintiff took his stipend for two years under the by-law, altered as it was from the original one, and that therefore he is estopped from seeking to set aside the by\u2011law that he complains of. I do not think his taking the stipend in that way can have that effect in law. He has brought this suit, not for himself alone, but in order to get a fair construction of the trust for himself and all the other clergy interested; and if what he did could be considered at all, it was merely a submission, for the time being, to a superior force over which he had no control. It is true he received a salary for two years under the changed by\u2011law, but when that was at an end, his salary was taken away altogether. Surely his agreement to take his usual salary under the changed by-law could not be held to debar him from claiming any salary at all. He may say, \u201cSo long as I get the $200 a year I will not complain of the particular mode of appropriation,\u201d but the very moment it is taken away altogether, he has the right to complain, and I do not think he is prevented from doing so by anything he did.\nI think the appeal ought to be allowed, and the judgment of the Vice-Chancellor restored.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nIt is not without some difficulty that I have arrived at a conclusion on this appeal. My first impression was in favor of the appellant\u2019s contention, but for the reasons given by the Chief Justice and my brother Strong, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed. The by-laws were not accompanied with the formalities required by the constitution, but it is a question of form, and I would not differ from the court below on such a point. It is a question of hardship, no doubt, for the appellant in this case, but if the law is as stated, he is supposed to have known the law, knowing it he must have known it was in the power of the trustees to alter or repeal the by-law. The appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellant: Harding & Harding.\nSolicitors for Respondents; Cronyn & Betts.\n[1] 9 Ont.

By the terms of the mortgage, the debt due to the plaintiffs was to be paid in three years, in twelve equal instalments at specified times, and if any instalment should be unpaid for fifteen days after becoming due, the whole amount then due the plaintiffs would become immediately payable, and they could take possession of and sell the said mortgaged goods. It was further agreed between the defendant D. and the plaintiffs, that to save the business credit of D. the said mortgage was not to be filed and was to be kept secret, and it was not filed until the 12th December, 1881. On the 13th of December, 1881, D. made an assignment of all his property, real and personal, to the defendant F., in trust for the benefit of his (D.'s) creditors, and such trust deed was executed by D., F. and one creditor of D., and subsequently by a number of other creditors. F. had no notice of the mortgage to the plaintiffs. F. took possession of the goods in the store on Granville street, and refused to deliver them to the plaintiffs, who demanded them on 14th December, default having been made in the payments under the mortgage, and the plaintiffs brought this suit for the recovery of the goods and an account. Previous to the suit being commenced the defendant F. delivered to the plaintiffs a small portion of the goods in the store, which, as he alleged, were all that remained from the stock on the premises in May, 1880.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court below, Strong J. dissenting, that the legal title to the property vested in the defendant F. must prevail, the plaintiffs' title being merely equitable, and the equities between the parties being equal.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming the judgment of the judge in equity dismissing the plaintiffs' bill. The facts of the case are fully set out in the judgment of the court and in the report of the case in the Court below.\nSedgwick Q.C. for appellants.\nThere was no evidence of fraud in the transaction between Davidson and plaintiffs. There was a good bill of sale registered in good time, and therefore it gives the appellants a good title to the property in question[2]. Ex parte Popplewell In re Storey.[3]. As to subsequently acquired property the following cases were cited: Holyrod v. Marshall[4]; Brown v. Bateman[5]; Clements v. Matthews[6]; Lazarus v. Andrade[7]; Flower v. Cornish[8].\nGraham Q.C. followed for the appellants.\nThe defendant Forsyth, being an assignee without value, cannot set up the fraud of Davidson.\nBrownell v. Curtis[9]; Browning v. Hart[10]; Leach v. Kelsey[11].\nThere is no difference between this case and the case of a previous agreement to give a bill of sale which was afterwards carried out. This would be supported in England.\nHenry Q.C. for respondents.\nThe agreement is not sufficiently definite to be susceptible of specific performance in equity.\nHarris v. Commercial Bank of Canada[12]; Wilson v. Kerr[13]; Jones on Chattel Mortgages[14]; Reeve v. Whitmore[15]; Tapfield v. Hillman[16]; Belding v. Read[17].\nBut my principal point is that this indenture of 8th May, 1880, was and is fraudulent and void against creditors, inasmuch as it was made secretly and was so held for nineteen months, or from 8th May, 1880, to 13th December, 1881, under a verbal agreement, made before or at the time of its execution by Davidson, with the appellants to that effect; which agreement was made for the express and admitted purpose of enabling Davidson to carry on business\u2014in other words, to obtain credit.\nWe have here established, by the evidence in the case, the following elements or badges of fraud:\u2014\n1. Possession after default, which was inconsistent with the terms of the mortgage.\n2. Possession, under a verbal agreement inconsistent with the mortgage, in the nature of a secret trust;\n3. Possession with the jus disponendi, exercised under the verbal agreement while the mortgage was held secretly; such possession being inconsistent with the mortgage.\nThe mortgage provided that Davidson \"should, until default, have the right to retain possession of the goods and sell the same in the ordinary course of business.\" Davidson made default on 1st May, 1881, if not before.\nThe mortgage does not provide for any accounting for the proceeds of such sales; it in effect permitted Davidson to appropriate such proceeds as he pleased. The mortgagees did not exercise, nor had they the power to exercise, any control over Davidson in the disposal of the monies so derived.\nIt is contented that such a possession, coupled with the unrestrained jus diponendi, invalidates the mortgage as against creditors, or the representatives of creditors such as an assignee in trust for the benefit of creditors, in possession.\nNo case can be found in the English books where a bill of sale or mortgage, in which the power to dispose for the benefit of the grantor or mortgagor is conferred, has been upheld. Bamford v. Baron[18], is the only apparent exception, and the instrument in that case was an assignment for the benefit of creditors, by the terms of which the debtor was permitted to carry on the trade for a certain period, and account to the trustee for all the profits of the trade from the date of the assignment. There the jus disponendi was for the benefit of creditors and not for the benefit of the assignee, while in Paget v. Perchard[19]; MacDona v. Swiney[20]; Wordall v. Smith[21]; Worseley v. DeMattos[22], where possession and the right of disposal was retained and exercised by the vendor or mortgagor for their own benefit, the instruments were held void and the, transactions fraudalent. See Bump on Fraudulent Conveyances[23], where the argument on this branch of the case is clearly put.\nMy learned friends urged \"that Forsyth was a mere volunteer, and as Davidson could not set up fraud as a defence neither could he.\"\nIt will be remembered that this is not a suit in equity instituted by the trustee of creditors to set aside the deed, were it so there might be some foundation for the contention that only judgment creditors could avail themselves of the equities. Be that sound, or no, it does not affect this suit. Here mortgagees bring suit in equity on an instrument tainted with fraud, and ask that it may be made effective to pass property to them. They invoke equitable principles to aid them in giving effect to the mortgage; and they are met in the inception by the principles: \"He who seeks equity must do equity;\" and again. \"He who comes into a court of equity must come with clean hands.\" Equity will never permit eqnitable principles to be made instruments of fraud. But it is not so clear that a trustee of creditors may not avail himself of such fraud in an equity suit to set aside a deed fraudulent as against creditors. Under the Bankruptcy laws he clearly could; and, as respects an insolvent assigning for the benefit of creditors where no such laws exist, it is contended the same rule applies. He (the trustee) occupies a double character. 1st. As representing the insolvent party to the deed. 2nd. As standing in the place of, and entitled to exercise all the rights of, creditors. Qu\u00e2 the representatives of the bankrupt the assignee has no power to set aside the deed; but, qua the representatives of the creditors, he has that power. Martin v. Pewtress[24]; Anderson v. Maltby[25]; Doe d. Grimsby v. Ball[26].\nBe this as it may, the trustee here is in possession under an assignment valid and effectual to pass the property but for the fraudulent deed; and in such a case, independently of 13 Eliz., he, representing bona fide creditors, can successfully resist the enforcement of the fraudulent transfer. Ackraman v. Corbett[27]; Tarleton v. Liddell[28]; Goodricke v. Taylor[29]; Cutten v. Sanger[30].\nSedgwick Q.C. in reply.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014By an indenture made the eighth day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty, between George Davidson, of Halifax, in the county of Halifax, merchant, of the first part; and Eliza McAllister of the same place, widow, Charles Grant Barnstead, of the same place, gentleman, and William Ackhurst, of the same place, merchant, of the second part, after reciting indebtedness of first party to the second party, the party of the first part agreed to convey and did thereby transfer and convey unto the said parties of the second part, all the stock in trade, chattels and effects then being in the store of the said party of the first part on Granville street, in the city of Halifax, to have and to hold the same to their own use and behoof; and he further agreed to convey to the said parties of the second part, all stock which, during the continuance of the said indebtedness, he might purchase for the purpose of substituting in place of stock then owned by him in connection with his business.\nCertain goods were subsequently purchased by Davidson and placed in the store on Granville street, but the same never were, in accordance with the terms of the mortgage, conveyed to the parties of the second part, nor was there any appropriation of the said goods ever made, or any possession thereof given to the said parties, but the same remained in the said store subject to the disposal of said Davidson.\nOn the 13th December, 1881, the said goods, then being in the possession and under the sole control of the said Davidson, he did by deed in trust for his creditors, dated 13th December, 1881, between George Davidson, of the first part, and George E. Forsyth, of second part, and the creditors of the said George Davidson, who should sign and seal the same within 60 days from the date thereof, of the third part; after reciting that he, the said George Davidson, was then unable to pay all his just debts, and had agreed to assign and convey all his estate, both real and personal, unto the said George E. Forsyth in trust for the benefit of all his creditors in manner thereafter provided, in consideration of the premises, and of one dollar paid him by the said George E. Forsyth, the receipt whereof was acknowledged:\nDid grant, bargain, sell, assign, convey, transfer and set over unto the said George E. Forsyth, his heirs and assigns, all the said George Davidson's lands, tenements and hereditaments, goods, chattels, merchandise, stock in trade, debts and sum and sums of money, due, owing or belonging unto the said George Davidson, and all securities, had, taken or obtained for the same and all his right, title and interest, in and to the same, to have, and to hold the same unto the said George E. Forsyth, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, upon the special trusts nevertheless that said George E. Forsyth shall forthwith take possession and seisin of the premises hereby conveyed and within such convenient time as to him the said George E. Forsyth shall seem meet by public or private sale for the best price that can be procured, shall convert all and singular the premises into money and as soon as possible collect all and singular the debts and sum and sums of money aforesaid, and after deducting the cost and charges of the trusts before mentioned, including the costs of these presents and including a commission of five per cent. on the net proceeds of said estate for the remuneration of said Forsyth, shall pay and apply the money arising therefrom in manner following, that is to say; in the first place shall pay and discharge in equal portions the respective debts due from the said Geo. Davidson to Arthur Fordham, John McNab and Isaac H. Mathers, all of Halifax, aforesaid, and secondly, after the payment in full of the debts last above mentioned, shall out of the residue pay and discharge in equal portions the respective debts of all creditors aforesaid, who shall sign and seal these presents within the said period of sixty days, and in the third place, after the full satisfaction and discharge of the debts last above mentioned, shall pay over the surplus (if any) to the said George Davidson, his executors, administrators and assigns.\nIn witness whereof the parties to the said presents have hereunto their hands and seals set and affixed the day and year first before written.\nGeorge Davidson. [L.S.]\nGeorge E. Forsyth. [L.S.]\nArthur Fordham. [L.S.]\nA creditor of said George Davidson.\nAnd, subsequently, some twenty other creditors of said Davidson, who, it is admitted, have filed claims against the estate of the said Davidson. Under this deed possession of the goods in question was delivered to the defendant Forsyth who went into possession, not having had any notice of the deed of the 8th of May, 1880, no registration of the same having taken place, by arrangement between the parties thereto, till the 12th day of December, 1881, the said Davidson carrying on his business in the usual manner as if no mortgage existed, by selling and disposing of his goods and obtaining on credit other goods, including the goods in question. After the defendant had entered into possession of these goods under the deed of the 13th of December, 1881, the plaintiffs claimed them as their property under the mortgage of the 8th of May, 1880, and commenced an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to replevy the same, in which suit, for some reason not stated, they failed, and they then, on the 2nd of February, 1882, commenced this action.\nWhile the arrangement not to register this deed, and keeping the same secret, thereby enabling the said Davidson to obtain credit as the ostensible owner of the stock he was dealing with in the ordinary course of business, and with the stipulation that he should convey all goods subsequently purchased on the strength of such credit to the plaintiffs, was a transaction, to say the least of it, of a most questionable character, it is not, and cannot be, I think, under the evidence, disputed, that the deed of the 13th of December was a bon\u00e2 fide transaction on the part of Forsyth, Fordham and the other creditors of Davidson, without notice of the existence of the mortgage or any notice whatever of any equitable claim on the part of the plaintiffs thereunder.\nThe question now raised is not between plaintiffs and Davidson, but between plaintiffs and Forsyth, as trustee, and Fordham and the other creditors of Davidson, and is in fact a simple question as to which shall have priority, the creditors under the mortgage or the creditors under the assignment to Forsyth. By the mere agreement of the deed of the 8th of May, 1880, to convey all stock Davidson might purchase, no property or title in any such goods passed to the plaintiffs. But by the deed of the 13th of December, 1881, the title and property in these goods, then in the possession of Davidson, vested absolutely in Forsyth, and Fordham, a creditor, being a party to the deed, the relation of trustee and cestui que trust was established between Forsyth and Fordham and the other creditors of Davidson whereby Fordham and the other creditors obtained a beneficial interest under it. The operation of the deed being to transfer the property, and to convey the legal title to Forsyth, and vest the beneficial interest in the creditors, for so soon as Fordham signed the deed, which he did at the same time as Davidson and Forsyth, there was a consideration, Forsyth ceased to be a mere mandatory of Davidson, but an onerous trust was imposed on him, creating a duty to the creditors which he could not cast off. This relation being established, it is, as Lord Campbell says in Harland v. Binks[31] \"consideration for the deed, and it is no longer voluntary.\" Therefore, the plaintiff, having only an equitable title, and the defendant a legal title without notice, the legal title must prevail. I think this case is governed in principle by the cases of Joseph v. Lyons[32], where Brett, M.R. says:\nIt was argued for the plaintiff that the bill of sale gave him the legal property in the after-acquired goods whenever they should come into the possession of Manning on the premises. For the defendant it was argued that the bill of sale only gave the plaintiff an equitable property in the goods. It was ingeniously argued for the plaintiff that the bill of sale was equivalent at law to a contract on the part of Manning that when any goods should come on to his premises for his business they should become the legal property of the plaintiff, and the case was likened to a contract of purchase and sale of unspecific goods, where the property does not pass at the moment of the contract, but when the goods are appropriated. Let us see what the law is. For a long series of years, where a bill of sale has assumed to assign future property to come upon the premises of the grantor, it has been held by the common law courts that that assignment does not pass the legal property in the goods, even when they have come on to the premises. The courts of equity have always held that, in those circumstances, when the goods have come upon the premises, the interest of the assignee under the bill of sale is not a legal, but only an equitable, interest. Therefore the case is decided by authority. The interpretation in equity was that the document was considered as equivalent to a contract that, when the goods should be acquired, then there should be an equitable property in them. It was equivalent to a contract. They said that it was to be supposed that the parties intended that there should be some security, and that the court should say that it was an equitable contract that, when the goods should come into possession, there should be an equitable property in them. It seems to me that the language of Jessel M. R., in Collyer v. Isaacs, is exceedingly plain, and that, according to ordinary interpretation, it means what I have stated. He says, \"The creditor had a mortgage security on existing chattels, and the benefit of what was, in form, an assignment of non-existing chattels which might be afterwards brought on to the premises. That assignment, in fact, constituted only a contract to give him the after-acquired chattels. A man cannot in equity, any more than at law,\" he does not say \"make a contract to,\" but, \"assign what has no existence. Any man can contract to assign property which is to come into existence in the future, and, when it has come into existence, equity, treating as done that which ought to be done, fastens upon that property, and the contract to assign thus becomes a complete assignment.\" The contract is the governing thing there, and the clear meaning is that the contract becomes a complete assignment in equity and not in law.\nIt follows, therefore, that the interest of the plaintiff in these goods, even after they had come into the possession of Manning, was only an equitable interest. The legal interest, i.e., the legal property, was in Manning. Therefore Manning, having the legal property, takes that property which at common law is his, and pledges it for an advance of money. The right of the pledgee in England as to goods which are the legal property of the pledger is not an equitable, but a legal right. It is a legal right, to be enforced by legal remedies. Therefore the title of the defendant is a legal right, that of the plaintiff is only an equitable interest. In those circumstances the plaintiff could not maintain against the defendant the legal remedy of trover and detinue.\nLindley L. J.\u2014I am also of the same opinion. The plaintiff must establish either, first, that the legal title was in himself, or, secondly, that he had an equitable title in the goods, and that the defendant had notice of it when he acquired the goods. As to the first point, I confess that I cannot see how it has been made out consistently with the authorities. The clause at the end of the deed shows that the plaintiff knew that he had not got a legal title. The operation of the deed was to transfer the legal property in the existing stock-in-trade, but an equitable title in that to be acquired afterwards. The plaintiff has an equitable title, and he can only deprive the defendant of his title by showing that the defendant had prior notice of the equitable title. The doctrine of constructive notice has not been carried so far as was suggested. It appears to me that our conclusion must be that the appeal must be allowed, and that judgment must be entered for the defendant with costs.\nAnd in Hallas v. Robinson[33] Brett M. R. says:\nIn this case the defendant takes a bill of sale which, to my mind, is sufficiently specific, and gives him a right to take possession of after acquired property which should be brought upon the premises of the grantor That, as has been decided, only gave the defendant an equitable title in the goods after they were brought on to the premises. It gave him a right to take possession on failure of the condition of the bill of sale, and if nothing else had happened, and he had taken possession rightly, he would have had a legal title in those goods. But something did happen, and in the meantime, whilst he had only that equitable title, and after property had been brought on to the premises, the same grantor gave a bill of sale to the plaintiff on property then upon the premises. I think the contention on that point was right, and that that bill of sale gave the plaintiff at that time a legal title in those goods subject to an equity. That legal title could not be ousted by reason of the defendant taking possession after it had vested in the plaintiff. Therefore, the defendant is in the same position as a person who has bought goods from a man who has already sold the goods to some one else, in which case the person on whom the fraud has been committed must suffer.\nBaggally L J.:\nI am of the same opinion. I think that the case is governed by Joseph v. Lyons, for though that is undoubtedly the converse of the case before us, still, for the purpose of decision as to the interests of the parties, the circumstances are the same. So far as by the bill of sale of 1875 the grantor purported to grant chattels which might be brought upon the premises, the bill of sale was null and void at law. But there was an equitable right that when the goods should be brought on to the premises the grantee should have an equitable interest in them, which, by taking possession of the goods, could be ripened into a legal interest if there was no intervention. But there was an intervention, because in 1882 property then in the actual possession of the grantor, and acquired between the dates of the first and of the second bill of sale, was granted to the plaintiff. Therefore that passed the legal title in the property to him. When that bill of sale was executed each party had an equitable interest in the goods, but the plaintiff had acquired a legal interest, and his title must prevail over that of the defendant. Thus far the case is entirely governed by Joseph v. Lyons. But there is the additional circumstance that when the plaintiff sought to take possession of the property he found that the defendant was in possession under an assignment which passed the equitable interest. By taking that possession; which would have been a perfectly good possession to give a legal interest, he could not deprive a person who had a legal interest of the benefit of that interest. It is not an answer to inquire whether the defendant had notice of the plaintiff's rights. The plaintiff and defendant may be regarded as two innocent persons, each of whom had advanced money, but one only of whom had a good title as against the other, and, therefore, the better title must prevail. The only distinction between this case and Joseph v. Lyons does not establish any real distinction in the way in which this case should be decided.\nThe plaintiffs had at most only an equitable interest, the legal title and property was in Davidson, which he transfers to Forsyth in trust, who had no notice of any such equitable interest, whereby the property became absolutely vested in Forsyth for the benefit of the creditors of Davidson. Forsyth enters into possession, and in pursuance of the trust, sells the goods on 30th December, 1881, receives the consideration money, hands the property over to the purchaser, and ceases to have any further control over, or any interest in the same.\nI think the plaintiffs must fail, because Forsyth had a legal title to the property which gave him a superior right to any equitable interest the plaintiff may have had, and the equities being equal the legal title must prevail.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I assume, for the purpose of the present decision, that a bill of sale, such as that which is in question here, is within chap. 84, 4th series of the revised statutes of Nova Scotia, and requires filing with the register of deeds according to the provisions of that statute in order that its priority may be conserved; it has been so considered by the court below, and in argument here counsel on both sides have assumed that upon the proper construction of the statute in question, a bill of sale by way of mortgage of after-acquired chattels is within the terms of the Act referred to. I will in the first place dispose very shortly of two points which were made in argument, neither of which seems to me to be entitled to any weight. The first is that by the agreement not to register the bill of sale, the appellants disentitled themselves to any relief in equity, and, therefore, when on the 12th December, 1881, they did register, they did not thereupon become entitled to such rights and priorities as the statute would, from that time, have conferred upon them in case they had never entered into an agreement not to file the mortgage. It is sufficient to say that this objection, which consists in imputing to the appellants what is called a fraud on the statute, is shown by two analogous cases in England to have no foundation. Ramsden v. Lupton[34]; Smale v. Burr[35]. These cases completely answer this argument against the validity of the bill of sale, for they show that an express agreement to evade the English Act by executing renewals of the bill of sale, at such short intervals as to substitute a new security for the preceding one before the statutory term for registration had expired, was no objection to the validity of the security, and that the mortgagee's rights were in no Way effected by it. The mortgagees here in like manner are therefore entitled to claim the right secured to them by the statute, that their bill of sale shall take effect and have priority from the time of the filing thereof. (Chap. 84 Rev. Stat. 4th series section 1).\nThe other point was that the words of description used in the deed were too vague and uncertain to entitle the mortgagees to an equitable lien upon the portion of the stock in trade which was acquired or purchased by the mortgagor subsequently to the execution of the instrument. The portions of the mortgage deed material to this question are as follows:\nAnd for the purpose of securing the said indebtedness the said party of the first part agrees to convey and does hereby assign, transfer and convey unto the said parties of the second part, all the stock-in-trade, chattels and effects, now being in the store of the said party of the first part, on Granville street, in the city of Halifax, to have and to hold the same to their own use and behoof; and he further agrees to convey to the said parties of the second part, all stock which during the continuance of the said indebtedness he may purchase for the purpose of substituting in place of stock now owned by him in connection with his business.\nThe bill of sale also contained the following covenant by the mortgagor:\nThe said party of the first part further covenants that he will at all times hereafter, upon request, give to the said parties of the second part, all such transfers or conveyances as they may reasonably require for the purpose of conveying to them all such stock-in-trade as he at the time of such request may possess, be owner of or have any interest in, in order more effectually to secure the payment of any balance being part of said indebtedness which at any time hereafter may or shall be due as aforesaid.\nThat there is any uncertainty in this I am unable to see; surely it was a matter susceptible of being rendered certain by proof that stock acquired by Davidson subsequently to the execution of the bill of sale was purchased \"for the purpose of being substituted for stock then owned by him in connection with his business,\" however difficult, in certain far-fetched hypothetical cases, when the stock had not actually been brought on the premises, used by him for his business and added to his other stock, such proof might be. That however, would be an objection, not to the deed itself as void for uncertainty, but to the proof by which it was sought to identify the goods. It would, I think, be unwarranted by either legal considerations or by common sense to say that this claim must therefore be held void for the reasons suggested. Then the very fact that the goods claimed here have been substituted for other stock by being added to and incorporated with the general stock-in-trade with which the grantor was carrying on his business brings them within the terms of the deed and constitutes sufficient proof that they were purchased for that purpose. Res ipsa loquitur. There might be some difficulty, as a matter of evidence, if the goods had never been added to the old stock or brought to the mortgagee's place of business, but that is a case which does not occur here, and one with which we have nothing to do. It appears to me, therefore, that in this respect the bill of sale was sufficiently certain and definite, and that the goods claimed are shown by the way in which they have been dealt with to come within the most strict and literal construction which can be placed on the language in which this claim is expressed. I entirely agree with what Mr. Justice Weatherbee has said on this head, and I refrain from dwelling longer on it, as I adopt his observations.\nThen the deed being thus free from these two preliminary objections to it, that it was void on grounds of public policy, in consequence of the agreement not to register, and that the portion of it relating to after-acquired goods was void for uncertainty, we have next to enquire what effect was given to it by the registration which took place on the 12th December, 1881. The statute says (section 1) that upon registration the deed shall \"take effect\" against the several classes of persons mentioned in the same clause, amongst others, against \"assignees for the general benefit of the \"grantor's creditors.\" I do not understand these words \"shall take effect\" as conferring upon the deed by reason of its being registered or filed any greater or more extended operation than it would at common law, and before the statute was passed, have had immediately upon its execution. Registration is only a process or solemnity in addition to the ordinary common law execution by sealing and delivering required to make the instrument effectual against the third persons named. But when the deed is once thus perfected its legal construction, and its operation both at law and in equity, must be exactly the same as they would have been irrespective of the statute.\nThis brings us to the consideration of the nature of the appellants' title to the goods now claimed being those acquired by the grantor subsequently to the execution of the bill of sale. The title asserted by the plaintiffs is, of course, a purely equitable one. If they had set up a legal title their bill would have been demurrable, as in such case their remedy would have been at law by an action of trover or detinue; and it is equally clear upon the evidence that in this they were perfectly right. In order to enforce a legal title some additional act on the part of the grantor, such as a further assignment, or at least a delivery of possession, of the after-acquired goods, would have been requisite, and no such novus actus is proved. The law on this subject is so fully and thoroughly considered and explained in the well-known case of Holroyd v. Marshall[36], particularly in the opinion of Lord Westbury, delivered in that case, that no further reference to authorities on this point is called for. If, therefore, the suit had been instituted against the grantor before any assignment to the respondent was made, the relief prayed would have been granted as a matter of course. Then the appellants must be entitled to the same relief as against the respondent Forsyth, unless he can how that he is a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, who having obtained a legal title, is entitled to priority over the appellants. This defence is so very imperfectly pleaded by the answer that it may well be doubted whether, according to the strict rules of equity pleading, respondent Forsyth is entitled to avail himself of it. But without dealing with the case on so narrow a ground as a point of pleading, and giving the respondent Forsyth the same benefit of this defence as if it had been pleaded in the most formal and technical manner, it seems very clear on the evidence that he does not bring himself within the conditions essential to constitute him a purchaser for value without notice, so as to entitle himself to protection against the plaintiff's demand. The onus of proving this defence is, of course, as in all cases when it is pleaded, in the first instance on the defendant. He must show that he was a purchaser for valuable consideration. It then lies on the plaintiff, if he can, to neutralize this defence by showing that at or before the time the defendant became such purchaser he had notice of the plaintiffs' equity. Now, what is the evidence to show that the defendant was a purchaser for valuable consideration? We have in the first place the deed of assignment, by which Davidson assigned to the respondent Forsyth, and which is dated and was executed on the evening of the 13th of December, 1881. What Mr. Forsyth says in his evidence as to the date of the execution of the deed, and the circumstances which led to it, is as follows:\nThe transfer was made to me on the evening of the 13th December, 1881; at that time I had no knowledge of the existence of the bill of sale under which the plaintiffs claim; on the following Monday I took possession of everything in the store. I got possession from George Davidson.\nAnd in his cross-examination he says:\nGeorge Davidson met me on the street the evening of the 13th December, 1881; he asked me if I would act as his trustee; I did not then know what he wanted; I do not remember his telling me anything about the bill of sale before the deed was signed; no creditor asked me to accept the trust; I did not employ Mr. Meagher in the matter; his own solicitor drew up the deed of trust; he asked me to go to Mr Meagher's office with him and sign the deed of trust; when he first spoke to me I supposed he wanted to transfer some properly to his wife; the deed of trust was read over before we signed it.\nTurning to the deed itself we find that it is a general assignment of all the assignor's. (Davidson's) estate real and personal, lands, goods, chattels, merchandise, stock-in-trade and debts due to him, and the trust declared of the proceeds when sold are, first to pay the expenses of executing the trust, then to retain a commission of 5 per cent. on the net proceeds of the estate as the remuneration of the trustee, next to pay in full three preferred creditors named in the deed, and lastly to distribute the residue equally amongst such of the assignor's creditors as should sign and seal the deed within sixty days, with an ultimate trust as to any surplus in favor of the assignor himself. It is not alleged or pretended, nor is it recited in the deed, that Forsyth was himself a creditor. It is not shown when the creditors, or when any one of the creditors, had notice of the deed, nor when they assented to or became parties to it. All that appears in the evidence is an admission noted on the face of the depositions as follows:\u2014\"It is admitted that the following parties have filed claims against the estate of George Davidson & Co.,\" and then follows a list of names with the amount of the debt set opposite each; but there is nothing to show when the claims were filed.\nWhat, then, was the effect of this deed before any creditor acceded to it?\nNothing can be better established by authority than the proposition that a trust deed of this kind, whereby a debtor conveys to a trustee for the benefit of creditors, does not constitute the trustee a purchaser until some creditor has had notice of the deed, and has either by some positive act or declaration, or by silent acquiescence, acceded to it. Until it is shown that a creditor has such notice the deed is considered by a Court of Equity a mere deed of management revocable by the debtor at will, and the assignee is held to be a trustee for the assignor only. There is scarcely any doctrine in the whole law of trusts in support of which such a long list of authorities can be cited as this. From the case of Wallwyn v. Coutts[37], Garrard v. Lord Lauderdale[38] down to Smith v. Hunt[39] and Steel v. Murphy[40]; decisions are to be found affirming this principle. It makes no difference that the creditors are named in the deed or in a schedule to it; until they or some one of them has notice of the deed, it is revocable, and the assignee held to be a there trustee for the assignor. So soon, however, as the fact of the execution of the deed has been communicated to a creditor who, though he may not execute it, does not repudiate it\u2014a binding, irrevocable trust is created, which constitutes the trustee a purchaser for value. Harland v. Burton[41]; Acton v. Woodgale[42]. If the trustee is himself a creditor, the deed is binding and irrevocable, and the trustee a purchaser for value, from the time of its execution. Siggers v. Evans[43]. All the cases are collected, and the conclusions to be drawn from them to the effect just laid down, in the notes to the case of Ellison v. Ellison in White and Tudor's leading cases[44].\nApplying the law thus established to the facts in evidence already referred to, without more, it would follow that the respondent Forsyth fails to establish his defence that he is entitled to priority in respect of his legal title over the equitable title to the appellants, for, as I have before said, there is nothing to show when creditors first had communication of the deed, and the claims filed, the reference to which is the only allusion to the assent of creditors to be found in the depositions may not have been presented until after the suit was instituted, and it was incumbent on the defendant to prove this defence strictly. But the evidence authorises us to put the case much more strongly than this against the respondent. In his cross-examination, part of which has already been extracted, Mr. Forsyth proceeds to say:\nThe next morning (referring to the morning after the execution of the deed) Mr. Ackhurst and Mr. Barnstead (two of the appellants) came to the store and claimed title to the goods under the bill of sale. I took advice of counsel in the matter, and intimated to them afterwards that they had no right under their bill of sale to the goods acquired subsequent to its date.\nIt will be remembered that the deed was executed on the night of the 13th of December, 1881, and thus it appeals that the next morning the respondent Forsyth, at a time when, so far as we have evidence, no creditor had become privy to the deed, and consequently whilst it was still revocable and the assignee a mere trustee for the debtor, had clear and distinct notice of the appellant's title, and proceeded to take legal advice upon it. The consequence must be that when creditors afterwards became parties to the deed and thus constituted Mr. Forsyth from that time a trustee for them, and a person who thus became entitled to the rights of a purchaser for value, that defence was rendered unavailing to him by the notice he had previously received, since, beyond all doubt or question, the notice so given to the trustee affected creditors subsequently coming in and taking the benefit of the assignment to as great an extent as it would have done if Forsyth had had notice when he first accepted the trust and executed the deed. It seems to me therefore an extremely clear case for giving the appellants the relief prayed, just as such relief was given in Holroyd v. Marshall, for the reason that in that case the defendant execution creditor was held to take subject to the equitable title of the assignee of after-acquired property, because he did not stand in the position of a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice.\nIt is out of the question to say that the statute before referred to (the Bill of Sale Act) has any bearing on the question of law just considered, or with its application here. All that the statute does is to require the filing of the bill of sale in order to make it a perfect instrument. When the deed is filed it is left to its ordinary legal and equitable operation, which is the same as it would have been before the statute was passed. The requirements of the statute which had been complied with are therefore wholly collateral to this question. It never could have been intended, by requiring registration, to make a deed irrevocable which, before the statute, was a mere revocable deed of management, thus affecting the rights of an assignee in a matter with which the Act was not intended to interfere. But there is even a more conclusive answer to any argument of this kind for, unless I have misstated the law, the effect of the decisions I have referred to is to show that the respondent Forsyth did not become an assignee for the benefit of creditors, but remained a mere assignee or trustee for the benefit of the settlor himself until the assignment was, by being actually communicated to a creditor, converted into a deed of trust for creditors, and therefore on the evidence he was not in a position to plead that defence until a time subsequently to that at which he had notice of the appellants' title.\nThere remains still another point which may be noticed, though I do not think it would afford a ground for upholding the title of the appellants. The first section of the statute enacts that the bill of sale shall only \"have priority\" and, take effect, \"from the time of the filing thereof.\"\nThere is nothing in the Act making registration notice, and I cannot read the words just quoted as intended to giving any preference or other priority to a registered bill of sale than before the statute it would have had without registration, and that it is plain, as I have already stated, would only have been an equitable priority so far as it created a charge on chattels to be subsequently ascertained. I am of opinion, therefore, that no argument from which the plaintiff can derive any benefit can be founded upon the use of these words.\nIt can be no objection to the relief prayed that it is in respect of chattels, contracts of sale relating to which are not ordinarily the subject of equitable jurisdiction by way of specific performance. This objection is fully answered by Lord Westbury in the case of Holroyd v. Marshall, a case like the present, being distinguishable on the ground of trust, for when a fiduciary relationship is once established a court of equity will interpose to enforce the trust whatever may be the nature of the property. In the notes to Cuddee v. Rutter in White and Tudor's Leading Cases[45], the law is thus stated:\nAlthough courts of equity, as we have seen, will not ordinarily decree specific performance of contracts to purchase chattels if damages at law will be an adequate compensation, nevertheless, if a trust is created, the circumstance that the subject matter to which the trust is attached is a formal chattel will not prevent the court from enforcing the due execution of that trust, not only against the trustees themselves, but against all persons who obtain possession of the property affected by the trust, provided they had notice of the trust. See also Pooley v. Budd[46].\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with, costs, and a decree for an account, as prayed, with costs be entered in the court below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of dismissing the appeal for the reasons given by the learned judge in equity.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am strongly of the opinion that had there been but one point in the case I should have come to the conclusion that the arrangement between Davidson and McAllister, by which the creditors were not to be informed of the bill of sale which was executed, and when McAllister became a party to that, by which he was benefitted by the continuance to Davidson of supplies of goods by other parties, he apparently having a large stock and large business going on, and having taken this secret bill of sale which the statute of Nova Scotia was intended to prevent, rendered the agreement on the point of McAllister by which Davidson was to be enabled to impose upon the world outside and obtain credit for the benefit of McAlister, who, through Davidson obtaining stocks of goods from the parties, which were to inure to Davidson under this bill of sale, was, I consider, a fraud, and an attempt made by McAllister to obtain a benefit through Davidson obtaining further supplies of goods for his store for his benefit, and that he, being a party to that, cannot take advantage of that which was intended as a cover and a cloak to enable Davidson to obtain further credit. My judgment is not necessarily founded on that position, but if it were, I think I should have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that McAllister ought not to profit by the bill of sale made under the agreement in question, by which the other party, by false pretences, was enabled to obtain further credit from parties outside. I think the law in regard to it has been properly laid down by his Lordship the Chief Justice, supported and sustained by the case to which he has referred, viz: Hallas v. Robertson(1) which is exactly in point with this case. In that case Brett M.R. says (2): That confirms the judgment in Joseph v. Lyons (3), and enunciates a legal position applicable to this case. According to that doctrine McAllister had but an equitable title; not having obtained a legal title under that bill of sale the legal title was transferred legally by Davidson to Forsyth, and he is therefore entitled, I think, to the judgment of this court.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014For the same reasons I am in favor of dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Sedgwick, Stewart & O'Brien.\nSolicitors for respondents: Weeks, Pearson & Forbes.\n[1] 5 Russ. & Geld. 151.\n[2] Rev.

S. O. ch. 70.\nApplication was made to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada in Chambers, on behalf of a person arrested on a warrant issued on a conviction by a magistrate, for a writ of habeas corpus, and for a certiorari to bring up the proceedings before the magistrate, the application being based on the lack of evidence to warrant the conviction. The application was dismissed. On appeal to the full court,\nHeld, Henry J. dissenting, that the conviction having been regular, and made by a court in the unquestionable exercise of its authority and acting within its jurisdiction, the only objection being that the magistrate erred on the facts and that the evidence did not justify the conclusion at which he arrived as to the guilt of the prisoner, the Supreme Court could not go behind the conviction and inquire into the merits of the case by the use of a writ of habeas corpus, and thus constitute itself a court of appeal from the magistrate's decision.\nThe only appellate power conferred on the court in criminal cases is by the 49th section of the Supreme & Exchequer Court Act, and it could not have been the intention of the legislature, while limiting appeals in criminal cases of the highest importance, to impose on the court the duty of revisal in matters of fact of all the summary convictions before police or other magistrates throughout the Dominion. Section 34 of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1876 does not in any case authorize the issue of a writ of certiorari to accompany a writ of habeas corpus granted by a judge of the Supreme Court in Chambers; and as the proceedings before the court on habeas corpus arising out of a criminal charge are only by way of appeal from the decision of such judge in chambers, the said section does not authorize the court to issue a writ of certiorari in such proceedings; to do so would be to assume appellate jurisdiction over the inferior court.\nSemble, per Ritchie C.J., that ch. 70 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario relating to habeas corpus does not apply to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAppeal from an order in chambers of Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J. dismissing an application for a writ of habeas corpus and a writ of certiorari in the matter of M\u00e9lina Trepanier, arrested on a warrant issued on a conviction by a police magistrate.\nThe prisoner was charged with vagrancy, tried summarily and convicted by the police magistrate of the city of Ottawa, and was sentenced to the Mercer Reformatory for fifteen months.\nThe jurisdiction of the police magistrate and the conviction and warrant of commitment were not objected to, but the prisoner's counsel contended that the magistrate had erred on the facts, and that, under the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada had power to issue a writ of certiorari in order to bring up the proceedings anterior to the warrant, to ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to convict, and if not, that he, the prisoner, was entitled to be discharged.\nMosgrove for prisoner cited and relied on 32 and 38 Vic. ch. 28 sec. 1; 29 and 30 Vic. ch. 45, sec. 5; 38 Vic. ch. 11 sec. 51; 39 Vic. ch. 26 sec. 34; 29 and 30 Vic ch. 25 sec. 66, and in re Mosier[1].\nLees Q.C. for the respondent cited Regina v. Russell[2]; 32 and 33 Vic. ch. 32, sec. 28, Ex parte Yarbrough[3]. R. S. O. ch. 70.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The jurisdiction of the magistrate being unquestionable over the subject-matter of complaint and the person of the prisoner, and there being no ground for alleging that the magistrate acted irregularly or beyond his jurisdiction, and the conviction and warrant being admitted to be regular, the only objection being that the magistrate erred on the facts and that the evidence did not justify the conclusion as to the guilt of the prisoner arrived at by the magistrate, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that we cannot go behind the conviction and inquire into the merits of the case by the use of the writ of habeas corpus.\nThe commitment having been made by a court of competent jurisdiction in the exercise of its unquestionable authority, this court, assuming the conclusion arrived at to have been erroneous, has no authority to review the proceedings, or, in other words, to re-try the case. It cannot be disputed that we have no power to quash the conviction. If the conviction shows a want of jurisdiction, or if it was shown that the magistrate had no jurisdiction, it would be a nullity, and we would discharge the prisoner, because, in such a case, he could not be held by process of any legal tribunal; but with a valid conviction standing against him, and a regular warrant issued thereon, upon what principle can he be discharged?\nIf there is a principle clear beyond all doubt, it is that when a party is in execution under the judgment of a competent court in which the legislature has entrusted the jurisdiction on the merits to a magistrate, whatever his decision on the merits may be, it cannot be reversed on habeas corpus. I will cite a series of decisions establishing this beyond all question.\nIn The Queen v. The Overseers of Wallsall[4] Cockburn C. J. says:\u2014\nIt is true that there is inherent in the jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench authority to bring before it by writ of certiorari, save where the writ is taken away by statutory enactment or charter, the proceedings of any court of inferior jurisdiction, with a view to quash such proceedings. But this applies only where there is some defect of jurisdiction or informality or defect apparent on the face of the proceedings. The court cannot\u2014and this must be carefully borne in mind\u2014give itself appellate jurisdiction through the writ of certiorari, where it otherwise possesses none.\nIn Dime's Case[5] Patteson J. says:\nIf we entertain the question whether there was such a valid injunction, we directly review the judicial decision of the Vice Chancellor. We can no more do this than the court in the case of the Sheriff of Middlesex could review the decision of the House of Commons.\nThe returns show that the Vice-Chancellor heard and determined this, and, as it is a matter within his jurisdiction, his determination is final. The affidavits cannot be received.\nIn Carus Wilson's Case[6] Lord Denman C.J. says:\nWithout inquiring whether any affidavit is receivable at all in the case of any prisoner under sentence, we may decide the question before us by considering the principle of the exception that runs through the whole law of habeas corpus, whether under common law or statute, namely, that our form of writ does not apply where a party is in execution under the judgment of a competent court. If, indeed, it were proposed to show that the prisoner had never been before such court at all, or that no such sentence had been in fact given, there might be a difficulty in saying that a traverse to that effect could not be allowed. But when it appears that the party has been before a court of competent jurisdiction, which court has committed him for a contempt, or any other cause, I think it is no longer open to this court to enter at all into the subject-matter. If we are to do so, we should constitute ourselves a court of error from such other court, and should be constantly examining whether the circumstances, the existence of which was proved, warranted the opinion which such court had formed. In Brittain v. Kinnaird[7] the marginal note is:\nIn an action against a magistrate, a conviction by him, if no defect appear on the face of it, is conclusive evidence of the facts contained in it.\nAnd Dallas C. J. says in the same case:\nThe general principle applicable to cases of this description is perfectly clear; it is established by all the ancient and recognized by all the modern decisions; and the principle is, that a conviction by a magistrate who has jurisdiction over the subject-matter is, if no defects appear on the face of it, conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it.\nParke J. says:\nAll the cases from Hardress downward concur in one uniform principle, that where a magistrate has jurisdiction a conviction by him is conclusive evidence of the facts stated in that conviction.\nBurrough J.:\nSince I have been in Westminster Hall it has never been doubted that where a magistrate has jurisdiction a conviction, having no defects on the face of it, is conclusive evidence of the facts which it alleges.\nAnd Richardson J. says:\nUpon the general principle, therefore, that where the magistrate has jurisdiction his conviction is conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it, I think the rule must be discharged.\nIn The Queen v. Bolton[8] Lord Denman C.J. says:\nThe first of these is a point of much importance because of very general application; but the principle upon which it turns is very simple; the difficulty is always found in applying it. The case to be supposed is one like the present in which the legislature has trusted the original, it may be (as here) the final, jurisdiction on the merits to the magistrates below; in which this court has no jurisdiction as to the merits either originally or on appeal. All that we then can do, when their decision is complained of, is to see that the case was one within their jurisdiction, and that their proceedings on the face of them are regular and according to law. Even if their decision should upon the merits be unwise or unjust, on these grounds we cannot reverse it.\nWhere the charge laid before the magistrate, as stated in the information, does not amount in law to the offence over which the statute gives him jurisdiction, his finding the party guilty by his conviction in the very terms of the statute would not avail to give him jurisdiction; the conviction would be bad on the face of the proceedings, all being returned before us. Or if, the charge being really insufficient, he had mis-stated it in drawing up the proceedings, so that they would appear to be regular, it would be clearly competent to the defendant to show to us by affidavits what the real charge was, and that appearing to have been insufficient we should quash the conviction. In both these cases a charge has been presented to the magistrate over which he had no jurisdiction; he had no right to entertain the question or commence an inquiry into the merits, and his proceeding to a conclusion will not give him jurisdiction. But if, as in this latter case, we cannot get at the want of jurisdiction but by affidavits, of necessity we must receive them. It will be observed, however, that here we receive them, not to show that the magistrate has come to a wrong conclusion, but that he never ought to have begun the inquiry. In this sense, therefore, and for this purpose, it is true that affidavits are receivable.\nBut where a charge has been well laid before a magistrate, on its face bringing itself within his jurisdiction, he is bound to commence the inquiry; in so doing he undoubtedly acts within his jurisdiction; but in the course of the inquiry, evidence being offered for and against the charge, the proper, or it may be irresistible, conclusion to be drawn may be that the offence has not been committed, and so that the case, in one sense, was not within his jurisdiction. Now to receive affidavits for the purpose of showing this is clearly in effect to show that the magistrate's decision was wrong if he affirms the charge, and not to show that he acted without jurisdiction; for they would admit that, in every stage of the inquiry up to the conclusion, he could not but have proceeded, and that if he had come to a different conclusion his judgment of acquittal would have been a binding judgment and barred another proceeding for the offence. Upon principle, therefore, affidavits cannot be received under such circumstances. The question of jurisdiction does not depend upon the truth or falsehood of the charge, but upon its nature; it is determinable on the commencement, not at the conclusion, of the inquiry; and affidavits, to be receivable, must be directed at what appears at the former stage, and not to the facts disclosed in the progress of the inquiry.\nWe will cite only two authorities in support of this reasoning. The former, that of Brittain v. Kinnaird[9], and the admirable judgment of Richardson J., at p. 422, are too well known to make it necessary to state them at length.\nThe second case is a recent decision in the Common Pleas of Cave v. Mountain[10], which we cite only for the rule, which seems to us very clearly and satisfactorily laid down by the Lord Chief Justice: \"There can be no doubt but that if a magistrate commit a party \"charged before him in a case where he has no jurisdiction, he is \"liable to an action of trespass. But if the charge be of an offence \"over which, if the offence charged be true in fact, the magistrate \"has jurisdiction, the magistrate's jurisdiction cannot be made to \"depend upon the truth or falsehood of the facts, or upon the evidence \"being sufficient or insufficient to establish the corpus delicti \"brought under investigation.\"\nThese cases were both of them actions of trespass against the magistrate convicting; but they are authorities not on that account the less in point on the present occasion.\nAnd this was a proceeding on certiorari, a fortiori on habeas corpus.\nPer Coleridge J. in Dime's case[11]:\nWhere the judgment complained of is in an inferior court, the case is different. We have before us the judgment in which the vice is alleged to be; and we have power to quash it; but we have not, in the present case, the injunction before us.\nErle J. says:\u2014\nI agree that the proposed affidavits cannot be received. The return shows a committal by a court of competent jurisdiction acting within its jurisdiction.\nI may observe that an inferior court, such as the Court of Quarter Sessions, is a court over which this court has a controlling power, and whose proceedings are brought here by writ of certiorari in order that we may exercise that controlling power. In that respect such a court differs from the Court of Chancery; and in that respect cases before us, which relate to the inferior courts, are distinguishable from this.\nIn Thompson v. Ingham[12] Patteson J. says:\nThe law on this subject, so far as regards the analogous case of magistrate's convictions, was fully discussed in Regina v. Bolton,[13] and it was there held, that where the charge is such as, if true, is within the magistrate's jurisdiction, the finding of the facts afterwards by the magistrate is conclusive; but, where the charge is not such as, if true, would be within the magistrate's jurisdiction, no finding of facts can alter it.\nIn Brenan's case[14], a case of habeas corpus, Lord Denman C. J. says: We are bound to assume, prim\u00e2 facie, that the unreversed sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction is correct; otherwise we should, in effect, be constituting ourselves a court of appeal without power to reverse the judgment.\nIn ex parte Partington[15] Lord Denman C. J. says:\nThere still remains the question whether the commissioner has rightly decided that the prisoner's case was not within the act; but this was a question which he had jurisdiction to inquire into and decide; he has done so, and we are not authorized to review his decision. We by no means intimate a doubt of the propriety of that decision; we simply express no opinion upon it. It may be that there may be no court competent to review it; or it may be that by the Chief Judge or the Lord Chancellor the merits of the decision may be reviewed. It is clear only that we have not that power.\nIn ex parte Newton[16] the marginal note is:\nThis court has no power to grant a habeas corpus to bring up a prisoner who has been convicted at the central criminal court, on the ground that the offence charged was committed at a place out of the jurisdiction of that court. The proper course is to apply to the Attorney General for his fiat for the allowance of a writ of error coram nobis, the granting or withholding of which is matter for his discretion.\nIn re Bailey[17] shows that it may be shown by affidavit that the magistrate had no jurisdiction, but not that the finding of a magistrate within his jurisdiction was wrong.\nIn Regina v. Russell[18] Cockburn L. J. says:\nOn this state of facts, and without expressing as yet any opinion as to whether the evidence warranted the court in coming to the decision at which they arrived, there arises this question, whether it is open to the court to inquire whether the Court of Quarter Sessions were warranted in coming to the conclusion at which they arrived. I am of opinion that it is not so open to us. The rule is well established in cases of summary convictions. As to everything which relates to jurisdiction this court will interfere to regulate and set right inferior tribunals, but when once we find that there is jurisdiction this court will not take upon themselves to say whether the decision actually arrived at is that which this court would have come to. It may be that something may happen in the course of a case which is inconsistent with what has been called natural, but what I prefer to call rational, justice\u2014such as the refusal to hear a party\u2014 and then this court will interfere; but unless something of this sort appears we should not enter into the merits of the case.\nBut it is said the Ontario Act gives this court power to review, by way of appeal on the merits, the determination of magistrates on summary conviction in criminal cases under Dominion Acts, and this power it is said the court gets by virtue of the section authorizing the issue of a certiorari to bring up the proceedings. I do not think, as at present advised, that the Ontario statute applies in any way to this court. With reference to the jurisdiction thereby conferred, it relates to imprisonments not for crimes, and is based on 56 Geo. 3 cap. 100, and, as its recital shows, was passed for the same reason, namely, that as 31 Car. 2 cap. 2 relates only to criminal charges, the 56 Geo. 3 cap. 100 extends the right to issue writs of habeas corpus to cases of imprisonment not for crimes, and the Ontario statute has the like object in view, namely, like 56 Geo. 3, to extend the remedy to imprisonments other than for criminal or supposed criminal matters. Therefore, as the jurisdiction of the judges of this court is confined to inquiring into the commitment in any criminal case under the Dominion statutes, the Ontario Act is inapplicable and unnecessary, because the judges of Ontario have the power in criminal cases independent of it. But assuming the jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus under it to apply, as at present advised I am by no means prepared to say that any such jurisdiction necessarily carried with it the power to issue a certiorari, no such power being given by the Supreme Court Act.\nThe only authority to issue the writ of certiorari is by section 34 of the Amendment Act, which provides that:\nA writ of certiorari may, by order of the Supreme Court or a judge thereof, issue out of the said court to bring up any papers or other proceedings had or taken before any court, judge or justice of the peace, and which may be considered necessary with a view to any inquiry, appeal or other proceeding had, or to be had, before the Supreme Court.\nThus, while no authority is given to the court to issue the writ of habeas corpus, and an appeal is only given in case of refusal of writ or remand by a judge, so no authority is given to issue the writ of certiorari to bring up the proceedings but such as may be considered necessary with a view to proceedings had, or to be had, before the court.\nBut assuming the Act and section relating to certiorari to apply, how can it be said to give an appeal to this court? We are to have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any act of the Parliament of Canada; so soon as we have issued the writ and inquired into the cause of the conviction, and the proceedings show that the prisoner is held on a regular warrant, issued on a regular conviction by a court of competent judicial authority having jurisdiction over the offence alleged against the prisoner and over the person of the prisoner, and no want of jurisdiction is shown or alleged, we have discharged our duty, and we are bound to refuse the writ, or remand the prisoner if the writ has been issued.\nAssuming that we may issue a writ of certiorari under the authority of the Ontario statute, which I am by no means, as at present advised, prepared to admit, we are not bound to do so, but it is a matter discretionary with the judge, as where he has reasonable grounds for thinking the magistrate or court has acted without jurisdiction; or, by way of illustration, where there has been no conviction, as where a magistrate has committed a party for trial and it is alleged there is no evidence of a criminal offence sufficient to warrant the committing or detaining the prisoner, in such a case, there being no conviction, the judge would look at the depositions, and under the 29th section bail or otherwise deal with the prisoner, a jurisdiction not conferred by the original Act. So also in cases of extradition, over which this court has now no jurisdiction, but had at the time of the passing of the Act, there being likewise no conviction, the judge, in his discretion, might deem it desirable to see the evidence on which the magistrate held the prisoner for extradition.\nThis court has no inherent or statutory jurisdiction over the summary proceedings of inferior courts of either civil or criminal jurisdiction. To the Court of Queen's Bench, under powers of the common law, belongs the right to regulate and set right inferior tribunals, and to quash or confirm their proceedings.\nThe certiorari is the medium through which the Court of Queen's Bench exercises its jurisdiction over the summary proceedings of inferior courts, and always was unless expressly taken away; no writ of error lies upon a conviction, so that a certiorari is the only mode of bringing it into the Queen's Bench in order to revise it. See the remarks of Cockburn C. J. in The Queen v. Overseers of Walsall above quoted.\nBut still it is urged that there is an inference to be drawn from the power to bring up the depositions and evidence, and therefore there must necessarily be a power to review by way of appeal; but is it not too clear to be doubted that an appeal cannot be so given. An appeal, like a conviction, is the creature of statute law, and never lies unless where it is given by express terms. Queen v. Recorder of Ipswich[19]; Queen v. Justices of Warwickshire[20]; Queen v. Justices of Worcestershire[21]; Queen v. Inhabitants of Sandon[22]; Attorney General v. Sillem[23].\nBut apart from this the only appellate power conferred on the court in criminal cases is by virtue of the 49th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, which provides that:\u2014\nAny person convicted of treason, felony or misdemeanor, before any court of Oyer and Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or before the Court of Queen's Bench in the Province of Quebec, on its Crown side, or before any other superior court of criminal jurisdiction whose conviction has been affirmed by any court of last resort, or, in the Province of Quebec, by the court of Queen's Bench on its appeal side, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the affirmation of such conviction; provided that no such appeal shall be allowed where the court affirming the conviction is unanimous, nor unless notice of appeal has been served on the Attorney General for the proper province within fifteen days after such affirmance or refusal.\nHaving so carefully limited the appeal in criminal cases of the highest importance, can any one suppose that the Parliament ever intended (if it would be done by such a far-fetched inference) to impose on this court the duty of revisal in matters of fact of all the summary convictions before police or other magistrates throughout this Dominion, that is to say, that it was the intention of Parliament in creating this court, a court of last appeal for the determination of questions of the highest importance, to transfer to it by way of appeal the jurisdiction of the police and other magistrates of the Dominion in criminal matters in cases tried summarily before such officers?\nAs Judge Story in the Supreme Court of the United States[24] says:\nIf, then, this court cannot directly revise a judgment of the Circuit Court in a criminal case, what reason is there to suppose, that Congress intended to vest it with the authority to do it indirectly?\nAnd as was said in ex parte Kearney[25]: If every party had a right to bring before this court every case in which judgment had passed against him for a crime of misdemeanor or felony, the course of justice might be materially delayed and obstructed, and in some cases totally frustrated. If, then, this court cannot directly revise a judgment of the Circuit Court in a criminal case, what reason is there to suppose that it was intended to vest it with the authority to do it indirectly?\nCan it be supposed the Dominion Parliament could have intended that this appellate court, established for the whole Dominion, with its limited and guarded appeal in both civil and criminal cases, should, indirectly, in addition, be clothed with authority, and bound, to revise the proceedings under any conviction of police or other magistrates having jurisdiction over the person and subject-matter adjudicated on, and the unseemly spectacle of this, the highest tribunal of the Dominion, turned practically into a police court, to retry the case of every vagrant or keeper of a disreputable house, who may be dissatisfied with the judgment of the police magistrate, for they are those who have sought the interposition of this court, and who, of all others, should be dealt with summarily and promptly, and in the interest of decency and morality, and with whom no tribunal in the country is more competent to deal than the police authorities? The police magistrate summarily disposes of the vagrant, and other simple offenders; if the present contention is maintained all any of these gentry, if convicted, would have to do, would be to apply to a judge of this court, and have, as of right, his case reheard, and on being remanded, have then, as of right, an appeal to this court if in session, and no matter what the business may be before the court, a right to a re-hearing at an early date, or if the court is not in session, a right to require the court to be called together to hear his appeal; for if he has a right to come here, and the appeal exists as is claimed, the Supreme Court Act provides that appeals in habeas corpus shall be heard at an early date, whether in or out of the prescribed sessions of this court. There is something so unreasonable, I may say utterly absurd in this, that I can hardly deal seriously with the case.\nThe United States Congress has described affirmatively the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and that affirmative description has always been held to imply a negative of the exercise of such appellate power as is not comprehended within it.\nSTRONG J.*\u2014I have had occasion, upon applications in chambers for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari, to consider the question raised by this appeal, and the conclusion to which I have invariably come is the same as that which the Chief Justice has stated in the judgment just delivered. The considerations which have led me to that conclusion are as follows:\nA very slight consideration of the statutory enactments, under which alone this court has any jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus, will be sufficient to demonstrate that there exists upon the return to a writ of habeas corpus, no jurisdiction except to consider merely whether a sufficient ground is shewn for detaining the prisoner or not. Throughout it must be borne in mind that the whole jurisdiction of this court is statutory, and that its powers as originally conferred by the first Act were direct, and not by reference to the powers possessed by other courts in England or in the provinces. The Supreme Court has no common law jurisdiction. It has not, as many of the provincial courts have, as, for instance, the High Court of Justice in Ontario has, and as the former Courts of Common Law in Ontario had, the same jurisdiction as the Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster. In Upper Canada, by the statute of 31 Geo. III., the jurisdiction exercised by the Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster was conferred upon the Court of King's Bench in that province, and is now exercised by courts which have succeeded to the jurisdiction of the King's Bench. Such courts, therefore, possess by virtue of this referential legislation that extensive common law jurisdiction which enabled the Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster to protect the liberty of the subject by writ of habeas corpus, and also by certiorari, to superintend the administration of the law by inferior courts. The first provision in regard to this court, in relation to the writ of habeas corpus, is in section 51 of the Supreme Court Act of 1875, as now amended, which enacts:\nThat any judge of the Supreme Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nNow, the very name and tenor of the writ of habeas corpus indicates what, and what only, can be done under it. The writ is called the writ of habeas corpus cum caus\u00e2; that is to say, its tenor is to direct the officer to produce before the judge or court the body of the prisoner, together with the cause which he has for detaining him. Therefore, the only consideration which, on the return to the writ of habeas corpus, can be entered upon by the court or judge is the sufficiency of the commitment. If the officer returns to the writ a good commitment, whether it is in pursuance of a sentence of a common law court, that is a sentence following a conviction by a jury, or whether it is a commitment following a summary adjudication by a magistrate under a statutory jurisdiction, in either case that is conclusive. In the original Supreme Court Act\u2014the statute I am now considering\u2014no provision whatever was contained as to the writ of certiorari, and therefore there is no pretence for saying that, accompanying the writ of habeas corpus, either a judge in chambers or the court could issue a writ of certiorari to bring up something behind the warrant, namely, the conviction. But I have no doubt that, under this section 51, if a prisoner was brought before the court on a writ of habeas corpus, and the return to the writ showed he was in custody, not under any conviction by a court or magistrate, but under a commitment for trial, then the judge might, if the materials for the purpose could be got before the judge, consider and determine whether it would or would not be proper to take bail. I do not conceive that it is impossible for the depositions to be produced for that purpose without a writ of certiorari. They may be produced by consent of the Crown, or possibly the original depositions may be produced by authority of the committing magistrate. Be that as it may, if, on a return to a writ of habeas corpus, it appears that the prisoner is committed for trial on a criminal charge under a Dominion statute, I have no doubt that, under this first enactment relating to habeas corpus under section 51, the prisoner could be either bailed or remanded; but if the prisoner was in custody after conviction, the conviction could no more, in the case of a summary conviction by a magistrate, be brought before the judge, than could the record of conviction after a trial by a jury. If the commitment was upon a conviction, and the warrant of commitment was regular upon its face, that was conclusive as a return to the writ of habeas corpus.\nThe next statute we find dealing with this question is the Supreme Court and Exchequer Court Amendment Act of 1876; and under the 29th section of that Act extended powers were given. There was a reason why these extended powers should be given. If I am wrong in what I have just said as to the power under the first Act, in case of a commitment for trial, in regard to the power to bail, this section gives express power in that respect. I take it that this section was enacted, ex abundanti cautel\u00e2, more exactly to define the powers of a judge under the writ of habeas corpus. We find no mention whatever of the writ of certiorari; and, as I have shown, by the writ of habeas corpus alone it is impossible that the judge can get the record before him. There is, however, in section 34 of the same Act of 1876, provision as to the writ of certiorari. This section is as follows:\nA writ of certiorari may, by order of the Supreme Court or a judge thereof, issue out of the said court, to bring up any papers or other proceedings had or taken before any court, judge or justice of the peace, and which may be considered necessary with a view to any inquiry, appeal or other proceeding had, or to be had, before the Supreme Court.\nNow, the first observation to be made on this enactment is, that the certiorari authorized by it is only for the purpose of bringing up proceedings and papers required before the Supreme Court, and not before a single judge. This had escaped my attention until it was pointed out by my brother Taschereau, and indeed, on one occasion I ordered the writ to issue in what I considered to be a proper case, the representative of the Crown, who appeared before me, not objecting. In that case, the commitment itself showed a clear want of jurisdiction, and I issued the certiorari to bring up the conviction, so that I might be able to remand the prisoner if it appeared to be good. I now see I was wrong in doing so, and that the writ of certiorari provided for by section 34 is not meant to accompany a writ of habeas corpus returnable before a single judge, but was intended to be returnable before the Supreme Court alone. Therefore, a writ of certiorari returnable before a judge in chambers is not warranted by the statute at all. This being so, how is it possible that the record of the conviction can be regularly brought before the judge at all? The officer who has the prisoner in custody has not the record. He cannot return the record. He can only return the warrant of commitment, and it that appears to be good, it must be conclusive so far as the writ of habeas corpus is concerned. It is said that under the concluding portion of section 29, inferentially, this court, or a judge of this court, possesses the same power as to the writ of habeas corpus as a judge in the province of Ontario possesses, I entirely agree to that. But that provision only applies to the jurisdiction in the writ of habeas corpus and not to the writ of certorari. I think that the object of the statute of the late province of Canada, which gave power to a judge in chambers in Ontario to issue a writ of certiorari, was to enable the judge to issue that writ together with the writ of habeas corpus, which enabled him, in the case of a commitment for trial or for extradition, to have the depositions brought before him, or in the case of a summary commitment by a magistrate, to have the commitment brought before him, and, if the conviction was erroneous, to release the prisoner as being in illegal custody not, however, to quash the conviction. The courts in Ontario having, however, the general jurisdiction to quash convictions returned under writs of certiorari issued by judges at chambers, have exercised the power, and rightly enough, because they had power to do so without expressly defining where the express statutory power ended and the common law jurisdiction conferred by the 31st Geo. III began. I take it to be quite clear that wherever a conviction by a magistrate is produced, if it appears on its face to be good, it is an estoppel until it is quashed; and no statute gives a judge of this court in chambers the power to quash a conviction. Such power belonged to the Court of Queen's Bench in England, and to such courts here as exercise the powers and jurisdiction formerly belonging to that court, but to such courts only. In Ontario, in many cases, a single judge, sitting as a court in banc and exercising the powers of the court in banc, has issued a writ of habeas corpus, accompanied by a writ of certiorari, and having undoubted power to do so, has quashed convictions. In such cases it is no excess of jurisdiction in the court to look at the depositions regularly before it and see if there is any evidence of the offence charged\u2014not re-hearing the case, as on appeal, for, no matter how strong the evidence may be for the prisoner, no matter what the preponderance of evidence may be against the prosecution, if there is any evidence whatever, the court will refuse to inter, fere with the conviction. In doing all that the courts undoubtedly exercise a well established and regular jurisdiction.\nBut if a judge in chambers undertakes to go behind the conviction and to consider the merits at large by way of appeal, I should say there was no jurisdiction to do so.\nUpon these grounds I have come to the conclusion that all a judge of this court sitting in chambers can do on the return to a writ of habeas corpus, is, if a proper commitment is returned, to remand the prisoner; or, if the prisoner appears to be only committed for trial, and if the depositions can be got before him in either of the ways before mentioned, to order the prisoner to be bailed; but that is the limit of the jurisdiction under a writ of habeas corpus issued upon the authority of these statutes. I cannot help saying, in conclusion, that the anomaly pointed out already by the Chief Justice must strike anybody at once, for if such a jurisdiction as that now invoked was possessed by the judges of this court, we might in the exercise of it be called upon to review the decisions of police magistrates, recorders and justices of the peace sitting throughout the Dominion in all those unimportant cases which they can summarily dispose of, when, if a case should arise in the courts of the highest importance, a state prosecution for treason or sedition, and a point of law should be raised in the highest courts of the provinces, and these courts should come to a decision adverse to the prisoner, though the case were one of the greatest public interest, if that decision should happen to be a unanimous one, we should not have the jurisdiction to review or in any way interfere with it. I cannot believe the legislature ever intended to do anything so anomalous and inconsistent as that, to confer a trifling jurisdiction in regard to prisoners to whom it is reasonable to suppose justice can be done by the provincial courts, and withhold it in the cases to which I refer.\nI agree with the Chief Justice that the case should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I have come to the same conclusion. I have had the advantage of reading over the notes of judgment of the learned Chief Justice, and I certainly agree with him.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am sorry it is my fortune, or misfortune, to differ in toto c\u00e6lo with my learned brethren on this most important question, and I shall proceed to state, as briefly as the importance of the case will permit, my views in regard to it. The matter has been considered by me for the last two or three years, having been called upon repeatedly to put in operation the Statute of Canada passed in 1866, previous to Confederation. Having inquired into it, but very willing, as well as my learned colleagues to\u2014I will not say, shirk the duty, but to leave the performance of my duty under it in the hands of the judges of the Superior Courts in Ontario to deal with\u2014I inquired, however, whether it was a duty on the judges of this court, and, if it were so, I felt it my duty to perform it. I do not consider myself infallible in these cases, nor do I consider the case so clear of doubt on every side as to say I could not reason it patiently, or that I could fail to give it the consideration which a case of such importance demands. I have not come to a conclusion by a process of hop, skip and jump. I have given judgments in cases such as this before, and I did so deliberately; and I may say, with all due deference to my learned colleagues who have expressed an opposite opinion, that I have heard nothing to vary my mind in the slightest degree as to the correctness of the judgments I have given, and I shall proceed to say how. The learned Chief Justice read a very elaborate opinion, principally to prove that in England an appeal would not lie in a case of this kind, and the only course would be by a writ of certiorari to remove the conviction, in order to have it quashed I am not saying anything at present as to the power of this court to quash the conviction, but I intend to show that this court has that power under the statutes which I consider govern the matter. How do we possess the jurisdiction? I must turn to the statutes that were in operation when we received our appointment, and, although I might consider it derogatory to my position as a judge of this high court to sit in review of the decision of a stipendiary magistrate, I do not claim to myself the right to judge of that question. I was appointed under statutes of the Dominion, and paid for doing my duty under the statutes and the law, and, although it might be perhaps a little derogatory to the position we hold as judges of this, the highest court, to sit in consideration of the liberty of the subject of a very mean caste and poor character, still it is the pride of every Englishman that the law is open to the poor and wretched and to the unfortunate and to the vile just the same as it is to the richest man in the country; and it is the duty of the judges\u2014the duty is imposed upon them\u2014to administer justice to the poor and to the unfortunate and to the criminal just as much as to the most honest man of highest respectability in the community. That, I consider, to be the duty of an English judge. That has been always held by them to be their duty, and I consider I am following no mean example when I do likewise. Now, have we the power? I admit that in England, and in the United States, no such power exists as this. I am perfectly free to admit it. I am free to admit, that it is objectionable that this power should be exercised by the members of this court, or that the judges should be called upon to perform this duty; but, at the same time, I consider that I am not the judge of that, and that the legislature is the only judge, and that, being appointed under the legislature, I had to take my duties as the legislature provided them, and not say that it is derogatory to my position to enter into an investigation of this case or of that other.\nWe are told that this involves an appeal. I do not know that it necessarily does so. In the administration of this matter, and after the proceedings are brought up from a conviction upon the evidence\u2014I would not undertake to set aside the judgment of the magistrate before whom the witnesses were examined, or say he drew a wrong conclusion from such evidence, nor do I think it necessary, to do justice, that I should have that power; but, if a man is imprisoned and tried for one offence, and convicted for another, or is convicted of that offence without the slightest particle of evidence, I would consider I was doing a service to the country by giving him his liberty, and showing to the police magistrate that there was a control, and that he was bound by the law to convict a party according to the allegations, and the proofs against him. We are told there is no appeal. Formerly there was an appeal always from the decision of the stipendiary magistrate to the Quarter Sessions, and the statute does not provide for an appeal from the Court of Sessions by issuing a writ of habeas corpus, but it does from the stipendiary magistrate. Then, that appeal being abolished, a statute was passed that is the subject of consideration now, and, in lieu of an appeal to the Quarter Sessions, the Legislature of Canada passed the statute, 29 and 30 Vic. ch. 45 section 1, in these terms:\n1. When any person shall be confined or restrained of his or her liberty (except persons imprisoned for debt, or by process in any civil suit, or by the judgment, conviction or decree of any Court of Record, Court of Oyer and Terminer or General Gaol Delivery, or Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace, or Recorder's Court, not being a court wherein the recorder shall sit alone without a jury) within Upper Canada, it shall and may be lawful for any of the judges of either of the Superior Courts of Law or Equity in Upper Canada, and they are hereby required upon complaint made to them by or on behalf of the person so confined or restrained, if it shall appear by affidavit or affirmation (in cases where by law an affirmation is allowed) that there is a probable and reasonable ground for such complaint, to award in vacation time a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum under the seal of the court wherein the application shall be made, directed to the person or persons in whose custody or power the party so confined or restrained shall be, returnable immediately before the person so awarding the same, or before any judge in chambers for the time being.\nThese are the exceptions. That, then, excludes the writ of habeas corpus, in certain cases, and very properly, because before a court of record the parties are tried by a jury, and, in an appeal to this court, the parties are convicted not only by a jury but by five or six judges. The law says there shall be no appeal in a case of that kind, but it is very different from a conviction by a stipendiary magistrate sitting alone in his office; and, therefore, the same legislature which said there should be no appeal by means of a habeas corpus from the judgment of six judges and the verdict of a jury, said in effect that there may be still an appeal in that way from the decision of a stipendiary magistrate. Section 5 provides;\n5. In all cases, in which a writ of habeas corpus shall be issued under the authority of this Act or of the said Act of the thirty-first year of the reign of King Charles the Second, or otherwise, it shall and may be lawful for the judge or court ordering the issue of such writ, or for the judge before whom such writ shall be returnable, either in term time or vacation, to direct the issuing of a writ of certiorari out of the court from which such writ of habeas corpus shall have issued, directed to the person or persons by whom or by whose authority any such person shall be confined or restrained of his or her liberty, or other person having the custody or control thereof, requiring him to certify and return to any judge in chambers, or to the court, as by the said writ shall be provided, all and singular the evidence, depositions, convictions, and all proceedings had or taken, touching or concerning such confinement or restraint of liberty, to the end that the same may be viewed and considered by such judge or court, and to the end that the sufficiency thereof to warrant such confinement or restraint may be determined by such judge or court.\nThe word \"shall\" makes it imperative. If the matter comes before the judge by a writ of habeas corpus, and he deems it right, this enjoins him to issue it. What are the documents to be ordered? The return of the evidence, the examinations. We all know what is the difference between evidence and examinations. If it was not intended that the evidence on a conviction was to be returned and dealt with, why do we find it mentioned here? If it was merely for bailing a party, or looking at the conviction to see if it is good or bad on the face of it, what would a judge want with the evidence, and how can we say that evidence is sought to be got for any other purpose? But the legislature says what it shall be got for\u2014\"to the end that the same may be viewed and considered by the judge\"\u2014that is, the evidence and conviction, \"and to the end,\" &c., &c. Now, we are told that this court cannot have an appeal indirectly, that is, inferentially. Whether this provision includes an appeal cannot admit of a doubt. It is an appeal, not indirectly or inferentially, but directly made to us. The law provides for it. It provides for the trying of the case, and for the appeal by ordering the evidence to be returned with the conviction. The preamble clearly shows the intention of the legislature so to extend the remedy of habeas corpus:\nWhereas the writ of habeas corpus hath been found by experience to be an expeditious and effectual method of restoring any person to his liberty, who hath been unjustly deprived thereof; and whereas extending the remedy of such writ, and enforcing obedience thereunto, and preventing delays in the execution thereof, will be advantageous to the public; an Act for the better securing the liberty of the subject, and for prevention of imprisonment beyond the seas, only extend to cases of commitment or detainer for criminal or supposed criminal matter; therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and Assembly of Can ada, enacts as follows:\nI have but little to consider in regard to the policy of the enactment, but, in view of the absolute power of a police magistrate to try, without the consent of the accused before him, not only misdemeanors but felonies without any appeal, it may have been properly considered that some review of his finding was desirable. That was not originally provided for this court, but, when the appeal was taken away, it was provided that the judge of a court in Upper Canada should review the finding of the stipendiary magistrate. Then, intentionally or unintentionally, that authority is thrown upon us. We are empowered to the same extent as the judges of the Superior Courts in Ontario, and the same obligation is thrown upon us to exercise that power as is thrown upon them. Under these circumstances let us look at the law. This is the law and this is how it stood. Judges in the Ontario courts fully considered this matter after this statute, and adopted it in the light I am now expressing, and I would like to hear some person, reason out the effect of the statute, and show that the judges in Ontario and I are wrong. I have not heard yet what the evidence would be required for if not to be acted upon by the judge; and if, when it is returned, he is to say, I won't look at it, is that what the legislature meant? I cannot come to such a conclusion. But we are told that the certiorari is only to return papers to this court. What does the Ontario statute provide? It provides for the return before the court or any judge in chambers. That power is transferred to us. The statute says\u2014section 51, 38 Vic.\u2014\nAny judge of the Supreme Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces, to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of commitment, in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any case of demand for extradition, and if the judge shall refuse the writ or remand the prisoner, an appeal shall lie to the court.\nThe party whose case is before us was convicted under an Act of Parliament of Canada. We are called upon to issue a writ to enquire into the cause of the commitment, and then the statute I have read enjoins the judges of the courts in Ontario to issue the writ of certiorari\u2014either the judge who issues the habeas or the judge before whom the party is brought subsequently, to get up all these papers. This section before mentioned then puts us in the same position as the judges in Ontario, and can we say we will assume one portion of the duty and not another? If it is derogatory to us to hear these cases, we may consider it derogatory to hear any case. We may consider it derogatory to hear an appeal in a case that involves unpleasantness just as much as any one of these cases that have been referred to. Still, it is our duty. Judges in England do not feel it derogatory to have to enquire into any case that arises. They search the case to the bottom and sift the evidence\u2014some of it most disgusting\u2014but they think it their duty to do so. We are told the writ of certiorari does not lie, but this section in question gives us the right to order it. There is express power given. That refers to the general power to issue a writ of certiorari. It may apply to civil proceedings. It applies to everything and to any matter which is before this court, and when the parties can show good and reasonable cause for bringing up certain papers in the custody of parties, and required for the inspection of this court, the judge is authorized to issue a certiorari to bring them up. But how do we get clear of this portion of the statute of Canada? For, we must bear in mind, that statute was passed by Canada only the year before Confederation, in 1866, and, when this Act was passed in 1875, that Act had been nine years in operation in the Province of Ontario; and certainly when we are told we have the same jurisdiction as the judges in Ontario, I think we have the right to issue a writ of certiorari, because the judges in Ontario are authorized to issue it\u2014not only authorized, but required. But, we are told, we have no power to quash the conviction. In the first place, I do not consider it is necessary that we should have that power. We could order the discharge of the party, if wrongfully confined, leaving it to him to get the conviction quashed or not. The party is clear of the operation of the conviction by getting his liberty, and it is a matter of mere moonshine, I take it, whether the conviction is quashed or not. It has no practical value for or against the prisoner. But I go further and maintain that, under the general powers in regard to the habeas corpus and the issue of a writ of certiorari to bring up the proceedings, we have the same power as the judges in Ontario, and they have power to quash the conviction I think, therefore, we have the power to do so. I do not wish to take up more time than necessary, but, it being significantly suggested that points decided in my judgments before referred to were hardly worth considering, I have defended my position, and in as moderate terms, I think, as the circumstances required. I consider that the evidence that is given of what has been done in England, the practice in England and the practice in the United States, and what would be the practice here but for these statutes, need no quotations to establish. It is well known that without statutory power we could not exercise the appellate jurisdiction by means of a habeas corpus, and, if that appellate jurisdiction were not given to us, I would be in perfect harmony with my colleagues in regard to this matter. We are told this would add largely to the amount of duties of this court. I have not ascertained that it would. So far, in the experience of nine or ten years, it has not added very much to its duties Perhaps I have had as much as my colleagues altogether, and I have not felt it affect my dignity or my time very materially. I say the reasons given here for us to refuse to discharge this duty would be very good if addressed to the legislature. They would be cogent, they would have an application, and, I would consider, ought to have very great weight. Still, I do not know that these reasons were ever offered to the legislature, for this reason: that these acts were passed in reference to the judges of the courts of Ontario, and then the other statute was passed when this court was appointed and the jurisdiction transferred. Possibly, if this matter had been before the legislature, or the Dominion Parliament for the first time, and the question had been mooted, this disagreeable duty would not have been thrown upon us.\nEntertaining these views, I am of the opinion that it is the duty of the judges of this court to issue a writ of certiorari. I think it is the duty to go behind the conviction and see whether the party is legally convicted I consider the party is legally convicted if, on the whole view of the evidence fairly applicable to the case and the charge brought against the prisoner, the stipendiary magistrate gives his decision; but, if a case arises where the law is totally misapprehended, or the party is tried for one offence and no evidence given, and he is convicted of that offence upon evidence that does not touch it, I think the law would not be administered, and it would be the duty of a judge of this court to discharge the prisoner. In one respect, I am not sorry that the majority of this court should be against me. It will relieve me and my colleagues of a great deal of perhaps unpleasant duty. I have felt bound to perform it hitherto, and I shall not regret the decision of the court by which I will hereafter not be bound to perform it.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice. I may add that I had always a strong doubt as to the constitutionality of the clause in the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act which gives us concurrent jurisdiction with the judges of the Province of Ontario. The point has not been argued, and I only wish to express my present doubt.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for appellant: Mosgrove & Wylde.\n[1] 4 Ont. P. R. 64.\n[2] 5 Can. L. J. N.

Co.\u2014Agreement with municipality\u2014Construction of tramway\u2014Traction engine\u2014Agreement to withdraw and discontinue use\u2014Right to use steam engine under.\nAn agreement was entered into under the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Ontario between the municipality of York and the Toronto Gravel Road and Concrete Company, under which the latter were to have a right to construct a tramway from their gravel pits to the city of Toronto. One of the clauses of the agreement was as follows: \u201cSo soon as this agreement shall have been ratified by the said corporation, the said company shall forth with withdraw their said traction engine from the public high ways of the said county, and shall discontinue the use and employment of the said traction engine and of any other traction engine upon or along such public highways.\u201d\nUnder this clause the company claimed the right to put steam engines upon the road over such public highway.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the use of steam engines was an infraction of the said clause.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, refusing to set aside the judgment of the chancellor in favor of the respondents.\nThis was an action against the appellants to restrain them from using steam engines upon a tramway con- structed by virtue of an agreement between them and the respondents, the municipality of he county of York. The concluding clause of the agreement, under which the respondents claim that the use of steam engines is prohibited, is set out in the above head note. Judgment was given for the municipality on the hearing before the chancellor, and such judgment was sustained by the Court of Appeal. The company appealed from the last mentioned judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q.C. for appellants.\nThe point raised on this appeal is whether the defendants have the right to use steam as a motive power on their road.\nThe first statute to be looked at is the R.S.O. ch. 186 from 31 Vic. ch. 34 \u201cto regulate use of traction engines on highways.\u201d 36 Vic. ch. 114 (O.) incorporated the respondents\u2019 company and 37 Vic. ch. 90 gives them the right to operate their tramway by steam power. It is under this statute, and the agreement of the 10th August, 1874, made with the respondents, that the whole case depends.\nThe Ontario statute 37 Vic. ch. 90 gives the appellants the right to operate their tramway by steam power wherever located, and it was to such a tramway (that is, one that could be operated by steam) that permission to locate upon the highway in question was given to the appellants by the respondents under the agreement of the 10th August, 1874.\nThere is no implied obligation in this agreement not to use steam. The respondents contend that the implication arises strongly under the agreement that we were to use horses as the motive power. We contend that the onus is upon them to show we have waived our statutory right to use steam power.\nThe corporation thought, as they say, they were get- ting rid of steam in every form. The appellants say the agreement was to prevent the use only of the traction engine. It is a casus omissus. Whose business was it to put it in the agreement? It was the respondents\u2019 for they were seeking to deprive us of a right given us by said statute.\nBut the respondents could not, by any agreement or by-law, curtail or reduce our chartered rights, and the statute 37 Vic. ch. 90 having regulated the method of use (ex. gr. the speed) in case steam was used, it was out of the power of the respondents to prohibit the use of steam as a condition attached to the use of the highway question.\nCalder & Hebble Nav. Co. v. Pilling[1]; Queen v. Governors of Darlington School[2]; questioned in Dean v. Bennett[3].\nEven if the respondents had the power to attach the condition that steam could not be used they have not done so, and the right of the appellants to use steam as a motive power upon the tramway under the act remains unimpaired by any terms or conditions contained in the agreement of the 10th of August, 1874.\nOsier Q.C. follows:\nThe condition of the parties at the time necessitated an agreement. The traction engines were destroying the business of the toll roads of the county of York. We had a charter giving us a right to use a tramway with steam power. We had to get the consent of the municipality to construct, and there is nothing authorizing the interference with the operation of the road after construction. The method of construction is one thing, the mode of operation another. There are cases in which a railway may run along a highway with the consent of the municipality, but the municipality cannot give assent and make it a condition that the trains shall be run by horses. With reference to street railways there is power to regulate not only the construction but the operation. There is no similar provision here.\nSection 1 gives the power to construct the tramway in accordance with the act of Parliament, and this includes the right to use steam. Then the municipality, by the 84th section of the Joint Stock Road Act, had the right to charge tolls only on horses and other animals, and the section as to tolls means only to provide for tolls allowed by law.\nNo case was made out for the rescission or reformation of the agreement in question, and in any event the respondents are estopped by their laches from claiming any such relief. Campbell v. Edwards[4].\nCassels Q.C. for respondent:\nIt is obvious from the agreement that what the parties contemplated was the use of a tramway or street railway.\nThe letter of the president, Mr. Lamond Smith, written to Mr. Morse on the 4th June, 1874, and by him enclosed to the county, and the petition presented to the county, and the further letter of Mr. Lamond Smith of the 10th July. 1874, written to the chairman of the committee on the roads and bridges of the county of York, ask the right from the county to make a tramway or street railway.\nWhat was in the minds of the Toronto Road Co., and what was asked from the county, was the right to construct a tramway or street railway, and the term \u201ctramway\u201d used in the agreement is plainly synonymous with the term \u201cstreet railway.\u201d The reference in the agreement approving the use of the tramway by horses, carriages and teams of parties using the Kingston road also shows that what was contemplated was a street railway. Smith v. Hughes[5].\nKerr Q.C. follows:\nThe moving cause for the negotiations was the removal of a nuisance caused by the steam and noise of the traction engine. A tramway is constructed and used in the manner contemplated by the parties until the bill was filed. The rail was a tramrail, the motive power was horses.\nThis is not the case of parties in the trade dealing with one another, and having reference to a particular kind of traction engine. In any event, in order to support the appellants\u2019 contention it is necessary to go into the evidence, in order to ascertain and prove what kind of traction engine was contemplated by the parties when the agreement in question was entered into, and it is submitted on the part of the present respondents, that if the case is viewed in this light that the evidence greatly preponderates in favor of the contention of the county.\nThe effect of granting the demand of the defendants would be make this road practically a branch of the Grand Trunk Railway.\nRobinson Q.C. in reply.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the term \u201ctraction engine,\u201d referred to in the agreement, contemplated a steam engine for locomotion upon common roads, and should receive that construction as being the common and ordinary understanding of the term, not only in common parlance, but by lexicographers, (the last edition of the Imperial Dictionary thus defines it \u201ca steam locomotive engine for dragging heavy loads on common roads,\u201d) as distinguished from a carriage supporting and driven by a steam engine and used to draw railway carriages, but also because the parties were making provision against the use of such an engine and others of a similar character, and there is nothing in the agreement to show that locomotives were in the contemplation of either party, but the inference from the provisions of the agreement is to the contrary. This construction is no narrowing of the terms of the agreement, but is only giving to the language used its fair and legitimate meaning in reference to the matter then under discussion, namely, the removal of the traction engine then in use and the use thereafter of engines of a similar character. If so, had the company ever obtained the leave or consent of the council to use steam locomotives, and was this consent necessary?\nThe question of using steam, apart from the traction engine then in use, was not, in my opinion, a matter in the contemplation of either party. The municipality wished to get rid of the nuisance occasioned by a traction engine running on the road, and the company was desirous of getting authority to lay down, in lieu thereof, a tramway for the purposes of an ordinary street railway to be propelled by horse power, and there is nothing in the agreement to show that the municipality consented to the use of steam on such tramway, but the irresistible inference is to the contrary. The company, no doubt, wanted to get rid of the use of steam on the public road, and the agreement was doubtless entered into with that view by substituting an ordinary street railway in lieu thereof. It can hardly be supposed that it could have been contemplated by either party that the agreement got rid of the steam one day\u2014for which the company obtained the great advantage of laying down a tramway\u2014and they could, the next day, place a similar steam locomotive, though of a different nature, on the road, and that, too, without any provision for tolls or restriction of any kind. Instead of this, I think all the agreement, fairly construed, was intended to confer on the company was the right to lay the tramway and use it as an ordinary street railway, thereby, by necessary implication, excluding the use of steam. And I entirely agree with the learned Chief Justice, that the language of the deed points to the use of horse power alone.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. The agreement was entered into between the parties, after the appellants had been running their traction engine for some years, in consequence of the people who usually used the highway becoming excited in consequence of numerous accidents and making application to have its running discontinued by the corporation.\nThe law of construction is well settled that all written contracts should be construed according to the intention of the parties to be gathered from the instrument, together with the surrounding circumstances if the words of the instrument are susceptible of more than one meaning.\nHere the permission was given to use the traction engine for a tram-railroad. A tram-railroad is not generally understood to be a road worked by steam engines. Horses are to be used. That is referred to in the letter written by Mr. J.L. Smith. The permission therefore was but a license to substitute on a tram-railroad a traction engine for horses.\nAlthough strictly speaking a traction engine may be stationary, yet it is generally understood to be a locomotive engine, Etymologically, it means an engine capable of drawing on a tram\u2011railroad. Then they say \u201cwe are not to use a traction engine, but we want to use our engine not on a tram-railroad but on an ordinary railroad.\u201d I have yet to learn that a locomotive in use on an ordinary railway is not a traction engine.\nThese parties had not authority to lay down an ordinary railway, but what is essentially different, a tram-railway. Everybody knows that a tram-railway is one almost always worked by horses.\nThe following is the authority:\u2014\nThe company shall be at liberty forthwith to lay down and construct a tram-way, in accordance with the last mentioned act of the Parliament of Ontario, for the carriage of freight and passengers upon and along the Kingston road, from the gravel beds or pits of the said company in the townships of York and Scarboro\u2019 to the city of Toronto.\nConstruing that agreement it does not appear that the parties intended an ordinary tram\u2011railroad to be operated by horses.\nThen the agreement concludes thus:\u2014\nSo soon as this agreement shall have been ratified by the said corporation, the said company shall forthwith withdraw their said traction engine from the public highways of the said county and shall discontinue the use and employment of the said traction engine and of any other traction engines upon or along such public highways.\nNow, if the appellants intended when entering into that agreement to use not a locomotive ordinary traction engine, but an ordinary locomotive railway engine it was I think an inception of fraud.\nI have come to the conclusion that it was not the intention of either of these parties when this agreement was entered into that the appellants should have the right to use a steam engine on an ordinary railway, as they now claim, and that the words \u201cany other traction engine\u201d must be construed to include any kind of locomotive engine. I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTaschereau J.\u2014Concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The point involved in this case appears to me to be free from doubt upon the true construction of the agreement of August, 1874, in the light of the surrounding circumstances. By an Act of the Legislature of the province of Ontario 36 Vic. ch. 114, the defendants were incorporated as a company for the purpose, among other things, of excavating, hauling and selling gravel and sand for building and other purposes, and for making and selling a composition called cement, and for these purposes they were empowered to acquire and hold lands, &c. In the pursuit of their business they acquired lands in the township of Scarborough from which they excavated gravel, which they hauled in trucks drawn by a traction engine along the Kingston road, a public highway belonging to the defendants, to the city of Toronto for sale, &c. This traction engine they used under the authority of another act of the Legislature of Ontario 31 Vic. ch. 34, by which it was enacted that it should be lawful for any person to employ traction engines for the conveyance of freight and passengers over any public highway in the province, subject to certain provisions therein, and among such provisions that no traction engine so to be employed should exceed in weight twenty tons, and that the speed of any traction engine should at no time exceed the rate of six miles per hour, and in cities, towns and incorporated villages the rate of three miles per hour, and that the width of the driving wheels of all such engines should be at least twelve inches and the wheels of the trucks or waggons should be four inches in width for the first two tons capacity, load and weight of truck included, and an additional half inch for each further ton. The use of those traction engines and trucks by the defendants upon the public highway belonging to the plaintiffs being authorized by act of parliament could not be abated as a nuisance, but the use of them on the Kingston road, a public thoroughfare in the immediate vicinity of the city of Toronto, did nevertheless, in fact, prove to be an intolerable nuisance to the public having occasion to travel on the highways; a nuisance not merely arising from these properties of the engine, which gave it the appellation of a traction engine as distinguished from other engines, but from the use of steam as the propelling power.\nThe defendants also themselves appear to have found that the use of the traction engine and trucks upon the highway was not sufficiently convenient for the advantageous carrying on of the business for which they were incorporated and in which they were engaged, for they applied to the Ontario Legislature for an act to amend their act of incorporation which was passed upon the 24th March, 1874. By this Act 37 Vic. ch. 90, the defendants were empowered to construct a double or single tramway or way of wood, or of iron, or wood and iron and other materials, from their gravel beds in the township of Scarborough in the county of York through the township of York to some point within the city of Toronto; and to take and hold all lands necessary for the purpose, with full power to carry and transport on and over their said roadway in cars, carriages and other vehicles gravel and other property and passengers at such reasonable rates as the directors of the company for the time being should impose, and it was enacted that the said road might be worked by horse or other power; but if by steam that the rate of travelling should not exceed ten miles per hour. They were by this act also empowered to construct a wire tramway from and to the points aforesaid for the purpose of carrying and transporting gravel and other freight and to acquire take and hold all lands necessary for the use, objects and conveniences connected in any way therewith or aiding the traffic thereof; and to operate the same by stationary steam engines; and by the act it was further provided that the councils of the municipalities through or in which the said tramways or roads might be constructed might by by-law or otherwise permit the company to construct the same or some or any part thereof in, along, over, and upon, the highways and streets, upon such terms and conditions as might be agreed upon between them. Now by this act the defendants had power given to them either to construct a wire tramway on their own property to be acquired for the purpose, to be operated by stationary engines or to construct an ordinary tramway in like manner on their own property to be operated by locomotive steam power or by horse power, or, to make use of the public highways either for the purpose of a wire tramway or of a tramway to be operated by locomotive steam power or by horse power, but the public highways could be used for any of the above purposes only with the consent of the municipalities whose highways were proposed to be affected, first obtained, and upon such terms and conditions as might be agreed upon between such municipalities and the defendants. The defendants, probably from motives of economy, seem to have preferred, if they could obtain permission, to construct their tramway upon the Kingston road which was the property of the defendants to acquiring land of their own for the purpose. In order to obtain the assent of the municipality to whom that road belonged it was obviously necessary that the defendants should explain to the council of that municipality, the county of York, what species of tramway they proposed constructing, namely, whether a wire tramway, or an ordinary tramway, and if the latter whether to be operated by locomotive steam power or by horse power In view of the objection which had been raised by the public to the use of the traction engine which was propelled by steam, the use of which as the propelling power was the chief cause of objection to the traction engine, it was naturally to be expected that the council of the municipality would withhold their consent to the construction of the tramway on the highway if locomotive steam engines should be the propelling power intended to be used. In the month of July, 1874, the defendants applied to the council of the county of York for permission to lay their tramway on the highway, and after divers negotiations with property owners along the road and the members of the county council, a draft agreement dated the 24th of July, 1874, was adopted in council and was reduced to a completed agreement dated the 10th of August, 1874, and was signed by the warden and clerk of the council of the county of York, with the common seal of the county attached, and by the vice-president and the managing director of the defendants\u2019 company, whereby the defendants obtained permission to construct their tramway on the terms and conditions therein mentioned. This instrument after reciting that the defendants are the owners of a traction engine which, under the authority of an act of the Parliament of Ontario, had been employed for the conveyance of freight over the public highways of the county of York, and that by a certain other act of the Parliament of Ontario the defendants were authorized upon certain terms and conditions to construct tramways for the conveyance of freight and passengers upon and along the public highways of the said county of York, and that one of such terms and conditions was that before constructing said tramway upon or along such public highways the consent of the said corporation should be first had and obtained; and that the defendants had applied to the said corporation for leave to lay down and construct a tramway upon and along the Kingston road, being one of the public highways of the said county from their gravel beds or pits in the township of Scarborough through the township of York to the city of Toronto, and that the said corporation had agreed upon the terms and conditions thereinafter mentioned to give their consent to such application, it was thereby agreed: 1st. That the defendants should be at liberty to lay down and construct a tramway in accordance with the last mentioned act of the parliament for Ontario for the carriage of freight and passengers upon and along the Kingston road, from the defendants\u2019 gravel pits aforesaid to the city of Toronto; 2nd. Among other things that the said tramway should be constructed so as to interfere as little as possible with the ordinary traffic of the said highway; 4th. That tolls to be collected should not exceed the same as for ordinary conveyances, viz., not more than 7 cents for cars drawn by one horse and 10 cents for cars drawn by two horses; 5th. That the said company should, if required, run not less than two passenger cars daily each way (or in lieu thereof an omnibus or sleigh) from the Don Bridge to Norway at such hours as might be found most convenient for the company and the public so long as the said tramway is in use; 6th. In case of horses, carriages, teams, or other vehicles or animals meeting or being overtaken by the horses, waggons, carriages, or other vehicles of the said company travelling upon the said tramway, the said company should have the first and immediate rights of way over and upon the said tramway; and 7th. So soon as this agreement shall have been ratified by the said corporation, the said company shall forthwith withdraw their said traction engine from the public highways of the said county, and shall discontinue the use and employment of the said traction engine and of any other traction engine upon or along such public highways. Now, from this agreement, it is apparent that the with- drawing of the traction engies not only from the Kingston road, but also from all highways in the county of York, was made one of the conditions upon which permission to lay a tramway at all was granted, and although no express provision is inserted to the effect that steam shall not be used as a motive power, the reason for that is apparent, namely, that the provisions numbered 4, 5 and 6, making special provision for the use of horse power, which provisions are quite inconsistent with the use of steam which was also the chief objectionable feature in the traction engine, show unmistakeably that what the parties to the agreement were intending to provide for, was the construction of a tramway to be operated with horse power; and that the permission which the defendants intended to be understood as asking for, and which the plaintiffs intended to grant, was permission to construct such a tramway. There cannot, I think, be a doubt that the defendants well knew that the council of the municipality understood the defendants to be applying for permission to lay a tramway to be operated by horses as the motive power, and that the defendants intended to be so understood, and that such was the extent of the permission which the council of the county intended to grant. It is inconceivable that a municipality which insisted upon the withdrawal of traction engines from all highways of the county mainly because of their being operated by steam, as a condition of granting permission to the defendants to construct the tramway, would have ever given their consent if steam power was to be used on the tramway. Upon the agreement being perfected the defendants constructed their tramway suitable only for the use of horse power, and so maintained and used it for about five years, when they proceeded to construct a railway for the purpose of and with the intention of giving up horse power and using steam as the motive power.\nThe learned counsel, Mr. Robinson, in his argument before us, and also, as appears by the judgment of Hagarty C.J., in his argument before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, submitted that the true state of the case was that at the time of the agreement being made and entered into both the plaintiffs and the defendants thought only of horses as the motive power, but he contended that steam not being expressly excluded, the statutory right, as he called it, of the defendants now to construct their tramway so as to use, and to use, steam power thereon, was not interfered with; but if neither party thought of steam as the motive power to be used, but both did think of horse power, and only of horse power, and made express provision pointing to the use of horse power, and not pointing to the use of any other power, these provisions, coupled with the well known objection the public had to the use of the traction engines, because of their being propelled by steam, as clearly indicate an intention to exclude steam power as if it had been in express terms excluded. And as to the argument that the statutory right, as it was called, of the defendants to use steam was not interfered with by the agreement, the answer is that the defendents have no statutory right to use steam power on a tramway constructed on a highway nor to have a tramway at all on a highway without the consent of the municipality owning the highway for that purpose first obtained, which permission when called in question the defendants must show. Here the defendants show only permission to lay a tramway on the Kingston road which permission makes provision plainly pointing to its being worked by horse power and has no provision applicable to steam being used as the motive power, the defendants therefore, in my judgment completely fail to show a permission co-exten- sive with the right which they assert of using steam power, and it is in my judgment quite unnecessary to rest upon the argument so much insisted upon on the one side that the term traction engine being used as describing the only engine expressed to be excluded, authorized the defendants to use any other description of engine, and on the other side that every locomotive steam engine is a traction engine and that therefore every species of steam engine is expressly excluded. The appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs and the perpetual injunction and the decree granted by the Court of Chancery maintained with costs in all the courts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: C. & H.D.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nInterpleader issue\u2014Insolvent Co.\u2014Chattel mortgage by\u2014Preference over other creditors\u2014Intention to prefer\u2014R.S.O. ch. 118.\nA company being indebted to L. & B. in a large amount, and believing that their charter did not allow a mortgage on their property to secure an overdue debt, made an agreement to give such mortgage for an advance of a larger sum, agreeing to return the amount of the debt to the mortgagees. At the time of this transaction the company believed that by getting time from this creditor they would be able to carry on their business and avoid failure. This hope was not realized, however, as the company were subsequently compelled to stop payment, and the above respondents, who were also creditors, obtained judgments and issued executions against the goods secured by the mortgage, and on an interpleader issue brought to try the title to such goods, the chancellor hearing the cause gave judgment for the execution creditors, and the Court of Appeal sustained that judgment by a division of the court. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the chancellor, that inasmuch as the company bon\u00e2 fide believed that by giving this mortgage and getting an extension of time for payment of plaintiffs\u2019 debt, they would be able to carry on their business, the mortgage was not a preference of this debt over those of other creditors, and not a fraudulent preference under R.S.O. ch. 118.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], refusing, by a divided court, to set aside a judgment of the chancellor in favor of the respondents.\nThis was an interpleader issue to try the title to certain goods seized under execution issued on judgments obtained by the respective respondents against the Hamilton Knitting Company. The company being indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of $4,750, and believing that their charter would not allow them to give a mortgage on their property to secure an overdue debt, entered into an arrangement with the plaintiffs whereby the latter were to advance $5,000, to be secured by a chattel mortgage on the stock and machinery of the company constituting all their available assets, and the company were to return the amount of the debt ($4,750) to the plaintiffs. This arrangement was duly carried out, the mortgage was given as agreed, and the surplus of the $5,000, after returning the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 debt, went into the business of the company. According to the evidence given on the hearing it appeared that the company believed that by giving this mortgage, and being relieved from the present payment of plaintiffs\u2019 debt, they would be able to carry on their business and avoid failure; it also appeared that the plaintiffs, previous to the mortel\n7 O.R. 154. gage, had been urging the payment of, or security for, their debt.\nThe company failed, however, and the respondents, being creditors, obtained judgments on their respective debts on which executions were issued, and the goods secured by the above\u2011mentioned mortgage were seized under such executions. The plaintiffs then instituted these proceedings to try the title to such goods.\nThe learned chancellor who heard the cause held that the mortgage was in contravention of the statute relating to fraudulent preferences; that the pressure brought upon the company was too slight to warrant the giving of the mortgage, and gave judgment for the defendants.\nThe plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeal being equally divided the judgment of the chancellor was sustained.\nThe plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nCrerar for appellants contended that the chattel mortgage was valid and cited, inter alia: Johnson v. Fesemeyer[2]; Newton v. The Ontario Bank[3]; Fidgeon v. Sharpe[4]; McCrae v. White[5]; Slater v. Oliver[6]; VanCasteel v. Booker[7]; Mogg v Baker[8]; Ex parte Hall[9].\nMartin Q.C., and Furlong for respondent Hancock, and A.D. Cameron for respondent Fairgrieve, contended that the transaction by which appellants took security upon all the available assets of their debtors and prevented them from getting credit elsewhere was a sham, and could not, upon the evidence of the case, be upheld. The learned counsel cited in support of the judgment appealed from the following cases: Smith v. Cannan[10]; Ex parte Hawker. In re Keely[11]; In re Wood[12]; Parkes v. St. George[13]; Reese Silver Mining Co. v. Atwell[14].\nCrerar in reply cited The Credit Company v. Pott[15].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I can see no evidence of pressure in this case, nor, taking the whole evidence together, can I discover sufficient to lead my mind to the conclusion that the mortgage was given with either the intent to defraud or delay the creditors of the company, or with intent to give one or more of the creditors a preference over the other creditors, or over any one or more of such creditors.\nThe company was, no doubt, in very straightened circumstances, and when the plaintiffs insisted on a settlement of their claim the position of the company appears to have been fairly discussed between the president and the manager, and the president seems very fairly to have expressed his determination, in the event of the manager arriving at the conclusion that with an extension of time from the plaintiffs the company could not pull through, as he expressed it, then to recommend an assignment for the general benefit of all the creditors, but if, on the contrary, the manager, as the practical business man of the company, should be of opinion that on obtaining such an extension as Parkes considered necessary, the business could be run and the company extricated from its difficulties, he, Parkes, would recommend giving the required security. The manager appears to have required that the dates of payment in the mortgage should be settled to his satisfaction, and if so, the business could be carried on and the company saved. A discussion appears to have taken place between the plaintiffs and Parkes as to the terms of payment to be inserted in the mortgage, as to which the parties appear to have been at variance: finally, the terms on which the manager thought the company could be carried on were agreed to, and Parkes recommended the giving of the security.\nI think the evidence shows that if such an arrangement would not enable them to carry the company through the mortgage would not have been given, and an assignment would have been recommended by the president in lieu thereof. The terms having been satisfactorily arranged, a by-law of the company was passed authorizing the giving of the mortgage for $5,000, which was unanimously confirmed by all the stockholders of the company, such sum ($5,000) being an amount sufficient to pay off the indebtedness to the plaintiffs, and a further sum of $156.13, which the company employed in the purchase of wool. The company resumed business and continued until the 25th of June, when the respondent Hancock issued a writ against them on which he obtained judgment, but it is worthy of remark that no portion of this judgment debt had been created at the time when the mortgage in question was given. And as to the respondent Hallam, the lawyer says:\nWhen he knew I had given the mortgage to Long & Bisby, after that I had showed him the books and statements, and gave him an order on Lockhart, he was perfectly well satisfied to let the matter stand and give me all the time needed on the balance of this account.\nI cannot think this was a device or scheme to prefer the plaintiffs, nor can I think the president and manager believed the company to be hopelessly insolvent; had they so thought, the evidence leads my mind to the conclusion that the mortgage would not have been given, but a general assignment in lieu thereof; and after the mortgage was given the plaintiffs and the company had dealings to the extent of about $2,140.\n\u201cIt was expected, at the time the mortgage was given, that exertions would be made to get the preferred stock taken.\u201d\nWhile I think there was no pressure in this case, I cannot agree with the chancellor that the transaction was a scheme by the company to give a preference to the plaintiffs over the other creditors, but was an agreement entered into whereby the company hoped to be enabled to continue its business and meet its engagements, and not with the intent of defeating or delaying its creditors, or to prefer the plaintiffs over Hancock, who was not a creditor at the time it was given, or over others who were at that time creditors.\nI do not think the evidence justifies me in saying that the whole proceeding was a sham; in other words, a gross fraud entered into by the plaintiffs, the president and manager of the company and the entire body of shareholders, to confer a preference on the plaintiffs and defraud all the other creditors of the company and to prevent an equal distribution of the assets of the company. Before coming to such a conclusion, I think the evidence should be much stronger than it is in this case.\nI do not think it is necessary at all to apply the doctrine of pressure to this case. The plaintiffs, no doubt, wanted to secure their debt from a company in, no doubt, very straightened circumstances, and which, had the plaintiffs pressed their claim for immediate payment, would have necessitated the winding-up of the company, but which would be avoided, in the opinion of the president, manager and shareholders, by obtaining a postponement of the time of payment of the debt and thus enable the company to work on and extricate itself from its embarassments, and also to enable it, by the issue of preferential stock, to provide working capital. I think the fair result of the evidence is that the assignment was not a fraud, nor intended to be a fraud, on the creditors but was considered an arrangement whereby the company could \u201cbe saved and all the creditors ultimately paid, and it was entered into with this intent.\nIt is nothing to say, after the subsequent events, that the company was hopelessly insolvent, and quite as little to say, before the happening of these events, that the manager, the president and the whole body of shareholders combined fraudulently to benefit the plaintiff and wrong the other creditors of the company; that the president\u2019s consultation with the manager as to the ability of the company to go on if an extension of time was granted, and the statement of the manager that from his knowledge of the position of the company by obtaining the terms he stipulated for he could get through, were false and made with a fraudulent intent; that the discussion as to the terms and the refusal to give the mortgage unless those terms were acceded to, was all a sham; that the president did not believe the statement of the manager but bargained himself with the plaintiffs to give them a fraudulent preference, and that the whole body of shareholders unanimously joined with the president and manager, approved of their doings and so united in committing a gross fraud on their innocent creditors. And for what? What were the manager, president and shareholders to gain by benefitting the plaintiffs and defrauding the other creditors? Before attributing such conduct to any one we should expect to find a motive but I can discover none in this case unless it be that to which I am disposed to attribute the conduct of the parties\u2014a desire to perpetuate the company, to \u201cpull her through\u201d as it is expressed, and so pay everybody. That with an extension of time from the principal creditor this might be done, but without such extension an attempt to carry it on would be hopeless, all parties own. They acted in good faith and I cannot say that it has been made out, beyond all reasonable doubt, that a fraud upon the creditors and upon the act has been made out. Suspicion will not do; fraud must be proved, not presumed.\nFOURNIES and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I have come to the same conclusion. The defence set up that the chattel mortgage was given to effect a preference to these creditors over others is not sustained by the evidence.\nThat is the only defence, and I do not think that, under the evidence, this court or any other court should interfere.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an interpleader issue in which the question is whether a chattel mortgage executed on the 5th day of May, 1883, by a certain corporation, called the Hamilton Knitting Company, to the appellants, is or not void or against the creditors of the company within the provisions of the revised statutes of Ontario ch. 118 sec. 2. To be void under that statute it must have been executed by the company when in insolvent circumstances or on the eve of insolvency, and with intent to give to the appellants a preference over the other creditors of the company.\nThat the appellants who were the largest creditors of the company, and whose claim was for a long time overdue, had become, immediately preceding the execution of the mortgage, very urgent for payment of their demand, and were pressing for such payment with threats of instant legal proceedings unless they should be paid or secured, there can, I think, be no doubt upon the evidence, but it is contended that the doctrine of pressure has no application in a case arising under the provisions of the statute in question. In support of this contention we have been referred to the language of the Lords Justices in appeal in ex parte Hall[16], and in ex parte Griffith[17], and to the language of Mr. Justice Patterson in the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the case of Brayley v. Ellis[18]. In the two former cases the questions arose under the 92nd section of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1869, which declared that every conveyance or transfer of property or charge thereon, and every payment made by any person unable to pay his debts from his own moneys as they become due, in favor of any creditor, or of any person in trust for any creditor, with a view of giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors, if the person making such conveyance, &c., &c., become bankrupt within three months after the date of making the same, shall be deemed fraudulent and void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\nIn ex parte Hall the circumstances of the case as described in the judgment of Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, were as follows[19]:\u2014\nThe bankrupt was pressed by the appellant on the 14th February to give him security which he had promised, but he did not give it. On the 17th February Chamberlin (the debtor\u2019s brother-in-law) went to see the appellant, and told him that the bankrupt was about to stop payment. Thereupon the appellant went to Leicester to see if he could not get some security from the bankrupt. There he was again told by the bankrupt that he was about to stop. He endeavored to obtain some security from him, but he failed, though he says he told the bankrupt that he should bring an action against him instantly if he did not perform his promise of the 17th January. Then the appellant went back to Leeds, and after he had gone away the bankrupt delivered the two bills to Brown, requesting him to hand them over to the appellant.\nThen with reference to this state of facts the learned master of the rolls proceeds:\nCan that delivery of the bills to Brown be said to have been made in consequence of bon\u00e2 fide pressure on the part of the appellants? It is plain that it was the voluntary act of the bankrupt. It appears to me that it would be absurd to call it pressure. A man says to (his creditor, \u201cI am about to become bankrupt,\u201d or \u201cI shall stop payment in a week.\u201d The creditor says, \u201cPay me my debt or I will sue you for it.\u201d Can that be called bon\u00e2 fide pressure by the creditor? When you consider the matter it seems to me that it would be absurd so to call it, and that is exactly what occurred in the present case.\nIn ex parte Griffith the circumstances, as also described in the judgment of the same learned judge, were these. Wilkinson was indebted to his traveller, Griffith, in a large sum of money[20]:\u2014\nHe is going to stop payment, and writes a letter to Griffith, who was then on a journey, telling him in effect as plainly as possible, \u201cI can\u2019t go on, come up to London immediately; \u201cI can\u2019t meet my bills, and I cannot pay even the ordinary weekly wages, therefore you must at once come to London.\u201d Well, in compliance with that letter Griffith comes to London and he finds that Wilkinson\u2019s affairs are in a hopeless state. A discussion appears to have taken place between Griffith and Wilkinson, in which Griffith says: \u201cCan\u2019t you give me a preference,\u201d (that is what it comes to), and he asks him to assign those debts over to him as security for the amount owing to him. There is no pretence as far as I can find for saying that there was anything more than a request by Griffith for a preference. It is said that Wilkinson refused to comply with the request; I suppose he said: \u201cIn the present state of my affairs I can\u2019t pay you.\u201d But just on the eve of signing his petition, the very day before, he does assign those debts to Griffith. For what purpose? Clearly to give him a preference. I say, sitting as a jury, that the learned registrar was quite right in coming to the conclusion that the mind of Wilkinson was influenced, not by the demand of Griffith for a preference, but by his desire to accede to the demand and to give him a preference. That is within the very words of sec. 92. If the assignment was made with a different view, it would not be within the statute. If it was made with a view to prefer the creditor, and also with some additional view, it may be that it is not within the statute. But the additional motive may have been so trifling that it ought not to be taken into account. Lord Justice Lindley in that case says:\nWilkinson\u2019s letter of the 29th of June, 1881, which brought Griffith up to town, throws a flood of light upon the transaction. Taking that letter into consideration and not being led away on a false scent by an enquiry whether there was bon\u00e2 fide pressure at that time, taking that letter as part of the transaction and bearing in mind its relation to that which took place afterwards, I am driven irresistibly to the conclusion that the security was given by Wilkinson with a view to prefer Griffith.\nAnd Lord Justice Bowen:\nThere is no question, in my mind, that this particular assignment was made with a view of giving this creditor a preference. But that, as the master of the rolls has said, may not be enough, and I go further and I say that the assignment was made with the view of preferring this creditor, and to give the coup de grace to it, I say, sitting as a juryman, that it was made with the sole view of giving this creditor a preference over every other creditor.\nNow if these learned judges had been of the opinion that the doctrine of pressure had no application whatever in a case arising under the 92nd section of the Bankruptcy Act of 1869 it is inconceivable that they should have taken so much pains to point out that it would be absurd to call pressure that which was relied upon as pressure, and that the transactions which were impeached were the voluntary acts of the bankrupts. If they had been of opinion that the doctrine of pressure was wholly inapplicable in view of the provisions of the statute, they would, I have no doubt, have expressed that opinion in equally unequivocal language as that used by Mr. Justice Paterson in Brayley v. Ellis in relation to this same ch. 118 of the statutes of Ontario now under consideration, and which he has repeated in his judgment in the present case. It is upon the authority of the above cases of ex parte Hall and ex parte Griffith, and of certain passages in the judgments of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in Davidson v. Ross[21], and of the observations of Mr. Justice Patterson in Brayley v. Ellis, that the contention, that the question of pressure is wholly unimportant in a case arising under ch. 118 of the statutes of Ontario, is rested. This conclusion is not, in my opinion, a fair deduction from what is said in ex parte Hall or in ex parte Griffith, and as to the passages in Davidson v. Ross which are relied upon they did not meet with favor in this court in McCrae v. White[22] where it was also pointed out that those passages were not necessary for the determination of the res decisa in Davidson v. Ross and were, therefore, merely obiter dicta. The question of the existence or non-existence of pressure applied by a creditor upon his debtor to enforce payment of, or security for, his debt is one which, in my opinion, is still an important item to be taken into consideration in cases arising under ch. 113 of the Ontario statutes, and I confess I am unable to see how it can be said to be irrelevant or inappropriate unless, upon an enquiry as to the proper inference as to a party\u2019s intent in executing a conveyance, we are to exclude wholly from consideration the circumstances surrounding its execution. The statute does not say that all conveyances, &c., &c., executed by a person in insolvent circumstances or on the eve of insolvency, even though executed to procure the cessation of legal proceedings to recover a just debt, and to avert the injurious and probably ruinous consequences attending a judicial sale under an execution in the suit shall be void as against the creditors of the debtor; but that all conveyances, &c., executed by a debtor in insolvent circumstances, &c., and with intent to defeat or delay creditors, or to give one creditor a preference over the other creditors of the debtor, shall be void.\nPressure is therefore an all important item for the proper determination of the question whether the con- veyance which is impeached was executed with one of the intents named in the statute as having the effect of invalidating it, or with an intent not prohibited by the statute and which is, therefore, unobjectionable. Now that there was bon\u00e2 fide pressure applied by the appellants, the creditors in this case, there can, I think, be no doubt, and the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence as to the intent of the mortgagors in executing the mortgage, in my opinion, is that it was executed under the influence of the pressure and with the view, by obtaining time for payment by instalments of the amount secured by the mortgage, to enable the company to recover from the depression in which its affairs then were and eventually to become successful in its business, and not with the intent of giving to the appellants a preference over the creditors of the company.\nWhether the expectation of the manager of the company was over sanguine or not it appears to have been honestly entertained by him, and I see no reason to doubt that the president and directors of the company, in executing the chattel mortgage, acted honestly upon the faith of the manager\u2019s assurances that with time given as provided in the mortgage, and the arrangements he had made, he would carry the company successfully through its difficulties. It is unnecessary for me to go through the evidence which has been ably reviewed by Mr. Justice Burton with whose view of it I concur. The sole ground for the suspicion which has been cast upon the transaction appears to have arisen from the form in which the mortgage has been drawn, namely, in consideration of a loan of $5,000 then made instead of being stated to be partly in consideration of a past debt and partly of a small further advance then made. But there can I think be no doubt upon the evidence that this form was honestly adopted under an impression, wholly erroneous in my opinion, that the company had no power to execute a chattel mortgage to secure a past debt.\nEvery trading corporation has the same power that an individual trader has to mortgage his property to secure an overdue debt unless this power be expressly restrained and prohibited by the act incorporating the company, and there is no prohibitory clause of that nature in the act incorporating this company. The erroneous opinion entertained upon this point having been the cause of the adoption of the form which the mortgage has assumed, namely, as security for a loan of $5,000 out of which the old debt of almost $4,700 was paid, it would be unjust to impute to the execution of the mortgage, and as evidenced by its form, an intent fraudulent within this chapter 118, when that form can, upon the evidence, be attributed to a wholly different and honest intent.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the appellants, the plaintiffs in the interpleader issue, with costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Crerar, Muir & Crerar.\nSolicitor for respondent Hancock: E.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAccident policy\u2014Condition\u2014Voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger\u2014Practice\u2014Extending time for appealing.\nThe plaintiff (appellant) brought an action to recover upon a policy of insurance effected by the respondents upon the life of her deceased husband, J.N., who met his death during the currency of the policy from being run over by a train of cars upon one of the lines of the Northern Railway through the company\u2019s yard at Toronto. In answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim the respondents amongst other defences, by their fourth plea, invoked a condition to which the policy sued on was subject, to wit:\u2014\u201dNo claim shall be made under this policy when the death or injury may have happened in consequence of unnecessary danger, hazard or perilous adventure.\u201d The uncontradicted evidence was that the deceased was killed by a train coming against the vehicle in which he was driving alone on a dark night in what was called a network of railway tracks in the company\u2019s station yard at Toronto, at a place where there was no road way for carriages.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the undisputed facts established by the plaintiff showed \u201cthat the deceased came to his death in consequence of voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger,\u201d and that therefore respondents were entitled to a non-suit.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas[2].\nThis action was brought in the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario for the recovery of moneys alleged to be due to the plaintiff by the defendants by virtue of an accident insurance policy issued to John Neill, the husband of the plaintiff.\nThe pleadings and the evidence so far as material are set out in the report of the case in the court below[3] and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne hereinafter given.\nThe action came on for trial on the 9th June, 1880, before the Hon. Mr. Justice Armour, and a jury at Toronto.\nThe learned judge in his charge submitted three questions to the jury:\u20141st. Did Mr. Neill voluntarily expose himself to unnecessary danger, hazard, or perilous adventure at the time he was killed; was he killed by reason of exposing himself to unnecessary danger hazard, or perilous adventure? 2nd. Was he killed while engaged in or in consequence of any unlawful act? 3rd. Did he use due diligence for his personal safety and protection at the time he was killed? His lordship directed the jury, if they found any of these issues against the plaintiff, to find a verdict for the defendants ; but if they found all these issues in favor of the plaintiff to find a verdict for her. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed. Leave was reserved to the defendants to move for a non-suit if the court should be of opinion on the evidence, that there was nothing to submit to the jury.\nOn 28th August, 1880, a rule nisi was obtained by defendants calling on plaintiff to show cause why a non-suit should not be entered, pursuant to leave reserved, and on 26th November, 1880, the rule was made absolute.\nFrom this judgment of the Common Pleas Division the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the Court of Appeal being equally divided the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was affirmed.\nLash, Q.C., for appellant:\nThe policy being a contract to pay a certain sum of money in the event of death from injuries effected through external, violent and accidental means, which injuries shall have occasioned death within ninety days from the happening thereof, and the plaintiff having proved the date and cause of death, that it was the result of an accident which left on the body external signs of the injury, nothing further was required of the plaintiff to entitle her to succeed, and the burden of proving that the conditions of the policy had not been complied with was upon the defendants. Cluff v. The Mutual Benefit Insurance Co.[4]; Dublin & Wicklow Railway Co. v. Slattery[5]. The plaintiff having made out a prim\u00e2 facie case, which, if there had been no other evidence offered would have entitled her to a verdict, the case was properly submitted to the jury to say whether the defendants had established any violation of the conditions of the policy, and the jury having found all the issues of the plaintiff, the court was wrong in view of the evidence and the finding of the jury thereon in directing a non-suit: Wharton on Negligence[6]; May on Insurance[7]; Administrators of Stone v. U. S. Casualty Co.[8]\nAs to the first question submitted by his lordship to the jury at the trial, no evidence was given by the defendants to support the plea that the assured voluntarily exposed himself to unnecessary danger, hazard or perilous adventure. The position was not whether the place where the accident occurred was a dangerous place, but whether the assured was voluntarily there. So long as there was in the opinion of the judge any evidence that the assured was there voluntarily, it was the province of the jury to decide upon it. And the jury having expressly found this issue in favor of the plaintiff, and it being a question of intention, their verdict was conclusive and should not have been disturbed: Blyth v. Bennett[9].\nThe word \u201cvoluntary\u201d in the condition of the policy means a \u201cdoing by design,\u201d and the defendants should have proved that the assured designedly exposed himself to danger, that he must have known of the danger and with such knowledge exposed himself to it, and there was no evidence whatever to support such a defence: Wharton\u2019s Law Lexicon[10].\nAs to the defence that the assured was engaged in an unlawful act at the time of the accident, viz., driving along the track of the Northern Railway, such an act has not been covered by the defence pleaded and has not been provided against by any statute or otherwise made unlawful under the conditions of the policy herein: Fawcett v. York and North Midland R. W. Co.[11]\nFurther, an unlawful act within the proper meaning of the conditions of the policy herein pleaded by the defendants would refer to some criminal act of assured, and none such was established in evidence.\nIt was established in evidence that he had the right to go there, as he did, on business, and that he was in the habit, as were other people, of going there on business, with the permission of the company, and that he was not violating the rules of the company, and the jury by their verdict so found.\nAs to the third question, whether the assured used due diligence for his protection and safety in accordance with the conditions of the policy, even if due diligence had not been used, the plaintiff\u2019s claim would not not have been defeated, as the policy attaches no penalty to the breach of this requirement, whereas to breaches of other requirements in the same condition, penalties are attached. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. In any case the burden of proof is on the defendants, and no evidence was adduced to establish want of due diligence.\nThe policy being an accident policy the question of negligence or contributory negligence does not arise apart from the conditions, and the defendants have failed to establish the breach of any of the conditions of the said policy. May on Insurance[12]; See also Bliss on Life Insurance[13], and cases there cited. Robinson, Q.C., and McCarthy, Q.C., for respondents.\nThere was no dispute as to the facts as proved at the trial. The word \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in the conditions of the policy relied on by appellant, must be constructed as meaning \u201cby design,\u201d that is to say, the deceased, in order to become within the terms of the conditions, must have known the danger and have designedly run the risk of it. If the appellant is right in this contention, the only case covered by the conditions is the case of an exposure to unnecessary danger permitted or brought about by insured for the express purpose of, and with no ulterior object than, trying the chances of escape or death. The respondents, however, submit that such a strained and unnatural construction cannot be put upon the condition or upon the word \u201cvoluntary.\u201d It is used as opposed to \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d i.e., without guidance by or control from the will. Given the position of exposure to unnecessary danger, the question is, as the respondents submit, was the taking of such position an act of volation or (to put it negatively) an act, the doing of which could have been avoided by the exercise of volition. The evidence in this case shows clearly the position of exposure, and that the taking of such position was an act of volition on the part of the deceased, and the evidence being uncontradicted the non-suit entered was right. Mair v. Railway Passengers\u2019 Assurance Co.[14]; Shilling v. Accidental Death Ins. Co.[15]; Schneider v. Provident Life Ins. Co.[16]; Providence Life Ins., &c., Co. of Chicago v. Martin[17].\nWith regard to the second defence, that the insured met his death while violating the rules of a corporation or company, it was given in evidence that the act of the deceased was in contravention of a rule of the Northern Railway binding upon all persons being upon the premises of the company; no evidence in contradiction of this was adduced, and the respondents submit the learned judge should properly have withheld the case from the jury.\nThe third defence was established by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence in support of her case, which showed that the action of the deceased in which he was engaged when he met his death was an unlawful act\u2014being a misdemeanor under \u201cThe Consolidated Railway Act, 1879,\u201d sec. 27, sub-sec. 4, and a violation of sec. 16, sub-sec 5 of the same Act, and therefore on both grounds contra leges.\nThere being no contradiction as to the facts, the question was one for the judge and not for the jury, Dublin, &c. R. W. Co. v. Slattery[18].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. On the undisputed facts as between the railway company and the deceased, the accident was not caused by the negligence of the railway company, the act of the plaintiff himself being the sole cause of the accident. There is nothing whatever disclosed by the evidence to justify or excuse the deceased being in the position he was on the track of the railway when struck by the shunting car. I think there was nothing to leave to the jury in this case, the undisputed facts established by the plaintiff show that the deceased came to his death in consequence of voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger, hazard or perilous adventure by driving into a railway shunting yard, through, over and among the numerous railway tracks, in all some twenty, if not more, and at a place where there was no provision for the passage of a carriage, and in so ex- posing himself he acted contrary to the rules of the Northern Railway. There being no contradiction or, dispute then as to the facts there was nothing to leave to the jury. These uncontradicted facts on which the plaintiff rested her case clearly, and beyond all doubt, established that the deceased unnecessarily and improperly drove his horse and carriage after dark where he had no right to go, and where no man could drive with propriety or safety, or without exposing himself to almost inevitable accident, and that such most unwarrantable voluntary exposure and want of reasonable caution was the sole cause of the accident. The evidence of the plaintiff in attempting to establish her case having shown that the deceased by his voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger caused the damage, her case entirely fails, and as was said by Denman J. in Davey v. The London & S. W. R. Co.[19], the undisputed facts of this case show that this accident was unquestionably due to the plaintiffs own folly and recklessness, and nothing else, and it is therefore, in my opinion, a clear case for a non\u2011suit.\nThe latest case that I am aware of on the question is Davey v. The London & South-Western Railway Company.\nSTRONG J.:\u2014The fourth plea sets out the condition to which the policy is subject, one of the provisions of which is, that no claim shall be made under it when the death or injury may have happened in consequence of voluntary exposure to necessary danger\u2014at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, a non-suit was moved for, on the ground that it appeared that \u201cthe deceased met his death by voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger, hazard or perilous adventure,\u201d and upon other grounds the learned judge overruled the objection, but reserved leave to the defendants to move to enter a non-suit. It appears to me that there was no room to doubt that the place which the deceased was killed, was a dangerous place for anyone to be driving in a vehicle as the deceased was, that there was really no question to leave to a jury upon that head, as there could be no reasonable doubt about the facts or the proper conclusion from the facts, and that the case is brought within the principle of Ryder v. Wombwell[20], and is a much stronger instance for the application of the doctrine of that decision than the facts there actually in question presented. I understand Ryder v. Wombwell to have been decided, that when the plaintiff\u2019s case is such, that but one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, and that conclusion is adverse to the plaintiff the judge may non-suit. Then of the two remaining facts making up this issue on the 3rd plea the burden of which was on the plaintiff, there was not even a scintilla of evidence. It being once admitted that the locality at which the accident occurred was a dangerous one, and that being there was an exposure to danger, it was not shewn that the plaintiff was there otherwise than of his own will, and he must therefore be taken to have been there voluntarily, as every act of man must be presumed to be voluntary until the contrary is proved. Again it was also for the plaintiff to have proved that the presence of the deceased at this dangerous spot, was caused by some reasonable necessity if she relied in the fact that the deceased had exposed himself to this danger for some necessary purpose\u2014but of this also there is an entire failure of proof\u2014I am therefore entirely of accord with the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, and Mr. Justice Cameron in the reasons which they give for the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which I think ought to be affirmed and this appeal dismissed. FOURNIER J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I consider this case so very plain that it requires but few words to express my view. The insured in this case undertook not to violate the rules of the company, and he unnecessarily exposed himself to danger. It was not shown that there was any necessity for his being on this network of tracks, and although it is alleged that he might have been under the influence of liquor, no person, I think, can read the evidence without coming to the conclusion that the unfortunate man was not right in his mind. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action brought by the plaintiff, as the widow of one John Neill, deceased, upon an accident policy executed by the defendants in favor of the deceased in his life time, who came to his death by having been run over by a train of the Northern Railway Company while the deceased was driving with a horse and buggy across a network of tracks laid in the yard of the Northern Railway at Toronto, at a place where there was no horse road or footpath, and where the rules of the company forbid any person not in the service of the company to be, and where, consequently, the deceased had no right whatever to be, much less to be driving with a horse and buggy. At the trial the case was submitted to the jury who rendered a verdict for the plaintiff; leave, however, was reserved to the defendants to move to enter a new suit. The Common Pleas division of the Supreme Court of Justice for Ontario granted after argument a rule absolute for entering a non-suit. Upon appeal from this rule the Court of Appeal at Toronto was equally divided. The sole question upon this appeal now before is, should the non-suit have been granted, and I am clearly of opinion that it should. By the policy sued upon in this case the defendants promised and agreed to pay the sum of $5,000 in gold to the plaintiff, who, at the time of the time of the making of the policy was the wife of the said John Neill, or to the legal personal representative of the said John Neill, within ninety days after sufficient proof that the said John Neill should, at any time during the continuance of the policy, have sustained bodily injury effected through external means within the intent and meaning of the contract and the conditions thereunto annexed, and such injuries alone shall have occasioned death within ninety days from the happening thereof. The policy then stated, among other conditions upon and subject to which it was issued, the following which are all that for the purposes of this appeal there seems to be any occasion to refer to, namely: provided always that no claim shall be made under this policy when the death or injury may have happened in consequence of voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger, hazard or perilous adventure, or in consequence of violating the rules of any company or corporation. In an action upon a policy of this nature prior to the Common Law Procedure Act the declaration would have been open to objection upon special demurrer if the declaration did not contain an express affirmation of the happening of each and every thing necessary to happen within the terms and conditions of the policy to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and a negation of the happening of anything, the happening of which, by the terms and conditions of the policy, disentitled the plaintiff to recover. The burthen of proving everything, the happening of which Vas made a condition precedent to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, and the absence of the occurence of anything, the occurrence of which disentitled the plaintiff to recover, lay upon the plaintiff. For the purpose of dispensing with the necessity of this prolix form of pleading, with- out any variation in the substance, the Common Law Procedure Act enacted that a plaintiff or defendant in, any action may aver performance of conditions precedent generally, but that the opposite party should not deny such performance generally, but should specify in his pleading the condition or conditions precedent, the performance of which he intends to contend. The effect of this enactment was that a defendant, instead of denying generally the happening of the several conditions entitling the plaintiff to recover, is confined to the denial of the happening of some particular condition or conditions, the occurrence of which is necessary to entitle the plaintiff to recover, each and every of the conditions, which before the Act were necessary to have been alleged in the declaration, being still since the passing of the Act regarded as contained in the declaration under the averment of general performance of conditions authorized by the Act; so that a plea relying upon a condition broken as disentitling a plaintiff to recover, is in substance still a plea in denial, equally as before the passing of the Act, and the burthen of proving everything necessary to establish the liability of the defendants within the precise conditions to which the policy is made subject, lies upon the plaintiff equally as it did before the passing of the Act. Accordingly the plaintiff in the present action in accordance with the form of pleading in use since the passing of the C. L. P. Act declares upon the policy, and the promise therein contained in the words of the policy, and avers that while the policy continued in force and while the plaintiff was the wife of the said John Neill, \u201che, the said John Neill, sustained bodily injuries effected through external, violent and accidental means within the intent and meaning of the said contract, and the conditions thereunto annexed, and such injuries alone occasioned death within ninety days from the happening thereof, to wit, instantaneously, and all conditions were fulfilled and all things happened, and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action for the breach hereafter alleged, and nothing happened or was done to prevent her from maintaining the same; yet the plaintiff has not been paid the sum of $5,000, and the same is wholly due and unpaid.\u201d\nTo this declaration the defendants plead several pleas in which they specify the particular conditions subject to which the policy was issued, which they deny the fulfilment of so as to entitle the plaintiff to recover; to two of which pleas only, namely, the 4th and 5th, is it, in my opinion, at all necessary to refer. In the fourth plea after setting out the several conditions, subject to which the policy was issued, including those above stated, they say that the death of the said John Neill happened in consequence of his having, in violation of the said condition, voluntarily exposed himself to unnecessary danger and hazard, in placing himself in the way of a locomotive engine, on one of the railway tracks of the Northern Railway Company of Canada.\nAnd in their 5th plea they allege that the death of the said John Neill, who was not then an employee of the Northern Railway Company of Canada, happened in consequence of his having in further violation of the condition set forth in the last plea violated one of the rules of the Northern Railway Company of Canada, under which all persons not being in the employ of the said company were forbidden to walk or drive on any of the tracks of the said company. Now, upon these pleas it cannot, I think, admit of a doubt that to entitle the plaintiff to recover it was necessary for her to establish that the death of John Neill happened under such circumstances as within the true intent and meaning of the conditions, subject to which the policy was issued, entitled her to recover, that is to say, that it happened not only from external violence, but from violence inflicted otherwise than in consequence of voluntary exposure by the deceased to unnecessary danger, hazard, or perilous adventure, and otherwise than in consequence of his having, in violation of one of the rules of the company, been driving at the time of the accident on the railway tracks of the company at a place where he had no right to be; and if in showing, as it was necessary for her to show, the circumstances attending the occurrence of the accident which caused the death, the uncontradicted evidence showed it to have happened in violation of either of the conditions, the breach of which the defendants relied upon, the case should have been withdrawn from the jury and the plaintiff non-suited. It is unnecessary to enter into the evidence further than to say that the deceased was killed by a locomotive engine and train when he was driving his horse and buggy across a network of railway tracks in the yard of the Northern Railway Company, where trains are being constantly shunted backwards and forwards where the deceased was, in violation of the rules of the company, and where he had no right to be, and whither he went in disregard of an express warning given to him by a person on foot, who saw the danger into which he was going, and who told him that if he persisted in going on he would be killed as he, in fact, was within a couple of minutes after receiving the warning.\nA suggestion that was made that notwithstanding this evidence and the absence of any evidence to qualify it in the slightest degree, it was, nevertheless, a question open for the jury to say that they were not satisfied that the deceased was there voluntarily, and that in truth he might have been there quite involuntarily, savors of too much subtilty, as it appears to me, to be seriously entertained.\nIt has, however, been contended that the judgment of the House of Lords, in Slattery v. The Dublin and Wicklow Railway Co.,[21] is an express authority to the effect that upon the defendants was cast the burthen of proving that the deceased was voluntarily in the place where he was killed, and that as there was not sufficient in the evidence to show that he was not there involuntarily it was open for the jury to say whether, in their opinion, he was there voluntarily or unvoluntarily, and that therefore the case could not have been withdrawn from them; and that, although their finding him to have been there involuntarily may be against the weight of evidence, that raises a point not open on the question of non-suit. This contention involves in my judgment a misconception of the judgment of the learned law lords who constituted the majority in the case of Slattery v. The Dublin and Wicklow Railway Company, and a misapplication of that judgment. In that case the question was whether in view of the circumstances appearing in evidence pointing to negligence on the part of the defendants leading to the collision by which the plaintiff\u2019s husband lost his life, and the facts also appearing tending to show contributory negligence upon the part of the deceased, the case should or not have been withdrawn from the jury. The learned law lords who constituted the majority which held that, under the circumstances appearing in evidence, the case could not have been withdrawn from the jury, did not dispute the correctness of the rule as stated by Lords Hatherby, Coleridge and Blackburn, who were of opinion that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury. Lord Hatherley, concurring with Chief Baron Palles of the Irish judiciary, states the rule thus: When there is proved as part of the plaintiff\u2019s case, or proved in the defendant\u2019s case and admitted by the plaintiff, an act of the plaintiff which, per se, amounts to negligence, and when it appears that such act caused, or directly contributed to, the injury, the defendant is entitled to have the case withdrawn from the jury.\nAgain he says:\nIf contributory negligence be proved by the plaintiffs witnesses while establishing negligence against the defendants, I do not think there is anything left for the jury to decide.\nHe then proceeds to show how in his opinion the evidence showed contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.\nLord Coleridge in his opinion says:\nThere has been a difference in the form in which the defence arising from the negligence of the plaintiff has been usually pleaded in actions of this sort in Ireland and England; but the difference in form makes no difference in principle, the onus on the plaintiff is the same in both countries, and the plaintiff may fail in Ireland as well as here to prove his cause of action by proving his own negligence, as well as by not proving that of the defendant. It is therefore, I think, the duty of the judge to withdraw the case from the jury, if by the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence at the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case, or by the unanswered and undisputed evidence on both sides at the end of the whole case, it is proved, either that there was no negligence of the defendant which caused the injury, or that there was negligence of the plaintiff which did.\nLord Blackburn states the rule thus:\nWhere there is no dispute between the parties as to the truth of any particular fact, or the accuracy of any particular witness, there is no need to ask the opinion of the jury. If there is some further inference of fact which may be drawn from the undisputed facts, it is still for the jurymen to say whether they will draw that inference; it is for the judge to say whether they can draw it.\nThe point in which the learned law lords differed was not in the terms or effect of the rule, but in the view which they took of the evidence, which, in the view of the majority, was sufficiently contradictory and conflicting as to lead to the conclusion that it could not have been withdrawn from the jury. Lord Chancellor Cairns, in his judgment, makes this appear very clearly[22]. He says: The appellants contend that even assuming that there was negligence on their part in not whistling, still that, on the facts which were not in controversy the judge should have ordered the verdict to be entered for them, because the deceased either did see or might have seen the advancing train, and it was therefore his carelessness, and not that of the appellant\u2019s, which caused the accident. I should by no means wish to say that a case in which such a course should be taken might not arise, and indeed had the facts in the present case been only slightly different from what they are, I should have been disposed to accede to the appellant\u2019s argument. If a railway train, which ought to whistle when passing through a station, were to pass through without whistling, and a man were, in broad daylight and without anything either in the structure of the line or otherwise to obstruct his view, to cross in front of the advancing train and to be killed, I should think the judge ought to tell the jury that it was the folly and recklessness of the man, and not the carelessness of the company, which caused his death. This would be an example of what was spoken of in this House in the case of Jackson v. The Metropolitan Ry Co., an incuria but not an incuria dans locum injuriae. The jury could not be allowed to connect the carelessness in not whistling, with the accident to the man who rushed with his eyes open to his own destruction.\nHe then proceeds to show that, in his opinion, the facts were materially different in the case then before their lordships, and that there was such conflict in the evidence that the case could not be withdrawn from the jury, who, and not the judge, should say whether the absence of whistling on the part of the train or the want of reasonable care on the part of the deceased was the causa causans of the accident.\nLord Selborne is no less clear. At p. 1187 he says:\nIt seems to me impossible to deny that the evidence of persons who, standing in a position where whistling must have been audible, say they heard none, was proper to be left to a jury on the issue whether there was whistling or not, however strong the affirmative evidence might be by which it was not. If the deceased had been a mere trespasser on some part of the line where there was no crossing, it would have been entirely his own fault that he was in the way of danger, and as the defendant would have been under no obligation to give any special warning of the approach of their trains to persons whose presence on their line they had no just cause to anticipate, the omission to give such notice by whistling under these circumstances would not have been negligence on their part.\nLord Gordon is equally explicit. At p. 1217 he says:\nWhere there is no evidence to go to the jury it is proper for the judge to direct a non-suit. That is the course which this House considered ought to have been followed in the recent case of Metropolitan Ry. Co, v. Jackson[23]. But in my view this case is very different from the case of Jackson. I think there was evidence in this case upon both the points raised, and that the judge did right in leaving the case to the jury.\nNow in the case before us there was no dispute as to the facts. The undisputed evidence showed that the deceased drove himself across the tracks of the Northern Railway, where a person with a horse and buggy had no right whatever to be, into a place of manifest danger from locomotives shunting backwards and forwards, and where the risk was so imminent that death ensued almost instantaneously after a person who was there on foot warned him that it would occur if he should persist in proceeding further. It seems to me to be trifling with common sense to say that upon this evidence there was anything which left it open to a jury to say that the deceased was not voluntarily in this place, or that this was not exposure to unnecessary danger within the terms of the condition to which the policy was subject.\nIn a recent case decided in the Court of Appeals in England, Wakelin v. The London & S.W. Ry. Co., wherein the points in issue were precisely those in issue in Slattery v. The Dublin &Wicklow Ry. Co., it was held that in actions of this nature a plaintiff cannot recover at all, but must be non-suited unless some evidence be given by the plaintiff of the circumstances attending the occurrence of the accident which causes death, for in the absence of such evidence non conslet but that the negligence of the deceased was the causa causant of the accident. This case seems to me to throw doubt upon much that was said by Lord Penzance in Slattery v. The Dublin & Wicklow Ry. Co., which was not, however, essential to the determination of that case.\nWakelin v. The London and South-Western Railway Co.[24]:\nThis case raised an important question as to the evidence in actions of negligence. The action was under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, by a widow to recover damages for the death of her husband, alleged to have been caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence. It appeared that the man was found dead on a level crossing of the defendants, and it was admitted that he had been run over by a down train at night, but there was no evidence of how the accident occurred. The defendants\u2019 watchman at the crossing was withdrawn at 8 p.m., and at the spot in question on a clear night the light of an engine could be seen for nearly half a mile on each side, but there was no evidence of the state of the weather on the particular night. The down train did not whistle or slacken speed on passing the crossing. On these facts, proved at the trial, Mr. Justice Manisty refused to withdraw the case from the jury, and they found a verdict for the plaintiff for \u00a3800. His Lordship left the parties to move for judgment. A Divisional Court, consisting of Mr. Justice Grove, Mr. Baron Huddleston, and Mr. Justice Hawkins, found that there was no evidence to go to the jury, and that there was evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. Judgment was, therefore, entered for the defendants. The plaintiff appealed. The main question was whether, in such an action as the one in question, it is for the plaintiff to negative contributory negligence (which, in the circumstances of the case, it was impossible for her to do,) or whether it is for the defendants to prove such negligence affirmatively. The case was argued yesterday, when their Lordships reserved judgment.\nMr. Jelf Q.C., Mr. T.C. Jarvis and Mr. Harmsworth, were for the plaintiff; Mr. Murphy Q.C., and Mr. Arbuthnot, for the defendants.\nTheir Lordships dismissed the appeal.\nThe Master of the Rolls said that the first question was as to what was the cause of action. According to English law, the cause of action in such a case was not that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant, for if the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence there was no cause of action. The cause of action was that, as between the plaintiff and defendant, the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant, without any contributory negligence of the plaintiff. It was for the plaintiff to give prim\u00e2 facie evidence of his cause of action, and if he omitted to give evidence of any material part of it he must be nonsuited. He must, therefore, negative contributory negligence on his part. But in the present case the plaintiff was unable to give any evidence of the circumstances of the accident, and therefore there was nothing from which any one could say whether there was or was not contributory negligence of the deceased. Upon that ground alone the non-suit must be upheld. In his view there was evidence for the jury of negligence by the defendants, but the plaintiff, having failed to give any evidence of the circumstances of the accident, had failed to give evidence of a necessary part of her prim\u00e2 facie case, and therefore his Lordship was sorry to say that the relatives of the deceased had no remedy.\nLord Justice Bowen said that even if the law were not (though he did not say it was not) completely expressed by the Master of the Rolls, still the plaintiff must fail owing to the absence of evidence.\nLord Justice Fry said he would not express an opinion whether it was for the plaintiff to prove that the defendants\u2019 negligence was the sole cause of the accident, for there was no evidence that it was.\nIn the case before us I entertain no doubt that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Watson, Thorne & Smellie.\nSolicitors for respondents: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\n[1] 7 Ont.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENS BENCH FOR MANITOBA.\nAgent\u2014Sale by\u2014Duty of, under instructions to sell lands\u2014Vendor and purchaser\u2014Contract not binding under Statute of Frauds\u2014Commission\u2014Mis-trial.\nMcK. et at, the appellants, real estate brokers at Winnipeg, received verbal instructions from the respondents to sell certain lands of theirs at a certain price and terms of payment. McK. et al. sold the land at the price named, receiving from the purchasers the sum of $5,0U0 as a deposit on account of the purchase money, and giving therefor a receipt. Prior to the expiration of the delay within which the balance of the purchase money was to be paid, the purchasers refused to complete their purchase for want of title in the respondents to a certain portion of the land, and contended that from the absence of writing signed by them they could not be compelled to do so. The appellants then brought an action for commission upon the entire purchase money. The respondents set up the defence that the appellants promised to sell the said lands and to complete such sale by preparing the necessary agreement in writing to make a binding contract with the purchasers.\nThe case came on for trial before a jury who followed the charge of the Chief Justice, and found a verdict in favor of the appellants for the full amount of their claim, thereby giving them 2\u00bd per cent, upon the entire purchase money of both parcels of land. The jury were not asked by the judge to pronounce upon the nature of the terms upon which appellants were employed, upon the question whether the sale went off through the neglect of the appellants to take a writing binding the purchasers, or whether it went off by reason of the vendors not being able to complete the title, or because they were unwilling to do so. In review before the full court a judgment was rendered directing that the verdict should be reduced to $125, being commission at the rate of 2\u00bd per cent, on the $5,000 actually paid, or in the alternative, that there should be a new trial.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Strong J. dissenting, that there been a mis-trial, and therefore the order for a new trial should be affirmed, appellants to have the alternative of reducing his verdict to the $125.\nPer Henry J.\u2014It was the duty of the appellants to take from the the purchasers a binding agreement under the statute, and having neglected to do so, they were not entitled to any compensation.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, making absolute a rule to reduce the verdict of $1,365 obtained by the appellants to the sum of $125, or, in the alternative, that there should be a new trial without costs.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows:\n1. About the first day of January, 1882, the appellants, who were real estate agents or brokers in the city of Winnipeg, received verbal instructions from the respondents to sell part of the south half of lot 12, in the parish of Kildonan, containing 145 acres, at $275 an acre, the whole price amounting to $39,875: on the terms of $5,000 cash, $12,000 on a mortgage then existing on the property, and the balance cash in twenty days from date of sale.\nOn the 13th day of said month of January, the appellants sold the land at the said price, receiving from, the purchasers the sum of $5 000 as a deposit on account of the purchase money, and giving therefor a receipt.\nOn the day the appellants sold the said land and received the said $5,000 from the purchasers, Henry F. Champion, one of the respondents, called at the office of the appellants, who informed him of the sale, and the said Champion then demanded and received from the appellants the $5,000, and then gave to the appellants a receipt therefor.\nOn the 14th day of said month of January, the appellants received instructions from the respondents to sell 10 acres, being another part of said south half of lot 12, parish of Kildonan, east of Main street, in the city of Winnipeg, at the price of $1,500 per acre.\nOn the 15th day of January, the appellants as such agents of the respondents, sold the said 10 acres to one F. W. Barrett (acting for the syndicate who had purchased the 145 acres), who agreed to purchase at the price at which the appellants had been authorized to sell, but the formal agreement was closed by said Barrett with Henry F. Champion, one of the respondents, to whom Barrett paid $1,500 on account of the purchase money of $15,000, and Champion gave to said Barrett a receipt for the amount so paid.\nPrior to the expiration of the twenty days, within which the balance of the purchase money on the 145 acre parcel was to be paid, the purchasers discovered that the patent for 75 or 80 acres thereof (being what is known as the outer two miles thereof) had not been issued, and the respondents were without title to such portion; and on account of this want of title in the respondents the purchasers refused to complete their purchase.\nThe appellants having brought their action for commission upon the entire purchase, the respondents pleaded inter alia as follows:\n3rd. And the defendants, by way of set-off and counter-claim to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, say:\u2014That (in consideration that the defendants would employ the plaintiffs as their agents, to sell certain lands and premises, being all and singular the lands and premises in respect of which the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for commission and services is made, and to properly complete such sale as they might make, by preparing and having executed a sufficient agreement or memorandum to satisfy the statutes in that behalf, for reward to the plaintiffs), the plaintiffs promised the defendants to sell the said lands, and to complete such sale by preparing the necessary agreement in writing to make a binding contract with such person or persons as should become purchasers of said lands, and the defendants employed the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs accepted the said employment and on the terms aforesaid; that the plaintiffs pretended to sell the said lands, but so negligently and carelessly and unskilfully conducted the transaction necessary to effect the same that no binding or proper agreement was drawn up or prepared in form sufficient to bind the proposing purchasers, as it was the duty of the plaintiffs to have done, and the said proposing purchasers afterwards repudiated the said purchase, and refused to carry out the same and to pay the purchase money for the said lands, whereby the defendants have suffered great loss and damage, owing to said sale having fallen through,; and owing to their being unable to effect a sale of the said lands, owing to the existence of the said abortive sale, and owing to their having incurred great expense in defending suits at law in respect of said sale, by reason of the plaintiffs\u2019 negligent, careless and unskilful conduct in their employment as defendants\u2019 agent. And the defendants claim ten thousand dollars.\nThe appellants having joined issue upon the 1st and 2nd pleas by their replication to defendant\u2019s third plea, said they did not promise to complete such sale by preparing the necessary agreement in writing as alleged, arid that they did not accept said employment on the terms alleged.\nAfter issue joined upon the appellants replications to the defendant\u2019s third plea, the issues were tried by a jury. The questions submitted to the jury by the learned Chief Justice, who tried the case, and answers thereto are as follows:\u2014\n1st. Did the plaintiffs make a sale for the two parcels of land, viz., the 145 acre parcel or the 10, both or either of them? A. Yes, both.\n2nd. Did the plaintiffs undertake the sale of the property under any special agreement? A. Generally\n3rd Did Montgomery, Davis, Horseman and Thompson actually agree to buy, and pay their $5,000 on account? A. Yes.\n4th. Did Champion receive this money from Mackenzie & Lee, and did he so receive it as the money paid by Montgomery and others to Mackenzie & Lee? A. Yes.\n5th. Is the price\u20142\u00bd per cent.\u2014the ordinary price charged by real estate agents? A. Yes.\n6th. Have the defendants yet in their possession the $3,500 or the $5,000 of the very money raised by the plaintiff\u2019s efforts? A. $5,000.\nHis Lordship\u2014Now, if any of you wish me to put any other questions to them, I will try to do it\nMr. Howell\u2014I will ask you to put this question: \u201c Under all the circumstances was it the duty of Mackenzie to bind the defendants as well as the purchaser?\u201d\nHis Lordship\u2014I answer that is a matter of law, and for me to deci le, and I have decided it.\nMr. Howell objects to his Lordship\u2019s charge where it \u201cWas stated that the vendor can make time the essence of the contract by letter or notice.\nMr. MacMahon Q.O. for appellants relied on the following authorities as to appellants\u2019 right to recover their commission under the circumstances, viz:\u2014Prickett v. Badger ([1]); Mansell v. Clements ([2]); Rimmer v. Knowles ([3]); Green v. Lucas ([4]); Fisher v. Drewett ([5]); Bailey v. Chadwick ([6]); Wilkinson v. Alston ([7]); Harris v. Pethick ([8]); Doty v. Millar ([9]); Wharton\u2019s Agency ([10]).\nMr. D. McCarthy Q.O. for respondents cited Story on Agency ([11]); Bain v. Fothergill ([12]); and contended that the question submitted to the jury and answers thereto, do not justify a verdict for the appellants, and that the learned Chief Justice should have complied with the request of defendants\u2019 (respondents\u2019) counsel to leave the question to the jury \u201c under all the circumstances was it the duty of Mackenzie to bind the purchasers as well as the defendants?\u201d This was a question of fact to be determined from all the evidence given as to what were plaintiffs\u2019 instructions and what they undertook to do in the transactions between defendants in this suit and the purchasers.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Manitoba. The action was brought for commission on a sale of lands, or rather an attempted sale, which went off. A deposit of five thousand dollars had been made, and the plaintiff brought his action to recover the whole commission, as if the sale had been completed. I have gone over the evidence carefully and I think certain questions of fact raised by the pleadings, which ought to have been submitted to the jury, were not so submitted by the judge.\nI think the jury should have been asked to find what the contract was between the plaintiff and the defendant; that is, what defendants were employed to do, and then what they did do; whether plaintiff was to make a valid and binding sale of the property? If so, did plaintiff fulfil the contract and make such a sale; if he did he would be entitled to his commission, otherwise not.\nIf a sale was made, was the same not completed by reason of want of title in or default of defendants? If such was the case, the plaintiff would be entitled to his commission. Or, in other words, was plaintiff merely to find a purchaser willing to purchase; if so, did he fulfil his contract, and was the purchaser ready and willing to complete his purchase, and did the sale fall through because defendant could not or would not complete the sale by reason of want of title or otherwise, and so the non-completion of the sale was the fault of the principal, and not that of the agent? If so, plaintiff would be entitled to his commission, because he substantially performed what he undertook to do. And whether the plaintiff should have bound the purchaser by a writing or not, did the sale go off by reason of the purchaser not being so bound or by reason of the defendant\u2019s refusal or inability to complete it?\nAll these matters should have been submitted to the jury with proper directions. The question, therefore, in this case turned rather on questions of fact than of law, and I am of opinion that the court below in granting a new trial did right, and that the judgment should be affirmed.\nI observe that a condition was annexed to the judgment that a new trial was granted unless the plaintiff was willing to reduce the verdict, which was for the full commission on the whole amount of the purchase 3 money, to the amount of the commission on the deposit of five thousand dollars. This is not objected to by the defendant, who seems to be willing that the matter should stand in that way If the plaintiff is willing to reduce this verdict in that way it can stand; otherwise I think a new trial should be ordered. The appeal dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I have no doubt whatever as to the disposition of this appeal, except such as arises from finding myself differing, not only from the court below, but from the majority of this court. I think the appeal should be allowed.\nThe plaintiffs were real estate brokers at Winnipeg, not lawyers or professional conveyancers, but persons whose business it was to find purchasers for owners of land desiring to sell during a season of great speculation in such property. They were instructed generally, as the jury found, by the defendants to sell certain lands of theirs at a certain price and upon certain terms of payment. No special agreement was come to, either as to their own remuneration, or as to the special terms of the bargain or agreement they were to make with a purchaser. This fact the jury also found. Further, no instructions were given to the plaintiffs as to the nature of the defendant\u2019s title. Upon this state of facts I am of opinion that the proper inference, whether as matter of fact or matter of law was that the only duty undertaken by the plaintiffs, was to find a purchaser for the price and on the terms to which they were limited by their instructions, and that it was not incumbent on them to do more than to bring the parties together, which they did and thereby earned their commission and are entitled to receive the amount which the jury found, namely, two and a half per cent, on the price\u2014amounting to $1,365, the sum for which the verdict was entered. Strictly speaking 3 the nature and scope of the plaintiffs\u2019 authority was as a conclusion of fact a proper matter for the consideration of the jury; but the rule being that a new trial will not be granted in order merely to leave to the jury a question which, upon the evidence, they can only answer in one way, the omission of the learned Chief Justice to leave this question precisely to the jury is not a ground for a new trial. In saying that the question could only be answered by the jury in favor of the plaintiffs, by finding that the authority of the plain tiffs was merely to act as brokers to find purchasers and bring them and the vendors together, and that it was no part of their undertaking or duty to prepare a contract and procure it to be signed, and that any conclusion to the contrary would be so manifestly contrary to evidence that the court would have granted a new trial on that ground alone, I rest upon what appears to me, the irresistible conclusion, that it could not have been the duty of these unprofessional agents to prepare a document which required professional skill and for the preparation of which they had never received the proper and indispensable instructions as to the state of the title. In other words, I proceed upon the same reasoning, not as leading to a conclusion of law, but to an inference of fact, which led Vice Chancellor Hall, who was also dealing with the question as one of fact, to the same conclusion in the case of Hamers v. Sharp ([13]).\nThen as regards the receipt of the deposit or part payment by the plaintiffs which was handed over by them to one of the defendants\u2014that I consider makes no difference, if the foregoing conclusion is the proper one. The plaintiffs had not authority, in my opinion, to accept this money, but having received it, and given an acknowledgment or voucher for it, their act in so doing, although not originally authorized, was ratified by the defendant Champion s adoption of it by receiving and appropriating the money. As regards the receipt, to which considerable importance has been attached as indicating that the plaintiffs recognized it to be their duty to procure a signed agreement, I am of opinion that it was entirely immaterial. It was manifest upon the evidence that the plaintiffs had no authority to enter into an agreement, and if, having no authority, they had innocently and without fraud even assumed to sign a contract, that could not have prejudiced the defendants, and being a mere nullity as regards them, could not have disentitled the plaintiffs to receive their commission. But I maintain that the receipt, the signing of which is relied on as such strong evidence against the plaintiffs, is entirely ineffectual as a contract for another reason than that of want of authority. It does not constitute a binding contract either at law or at equity in consequence of the uncertainty of its terms. This is perceptible at a glance. No Court of Equity could decree specific performance on the basis of any contract contained in this receipt. According to this document the price was to be $39,875, of which $12,000 was to be secured by mortgage and the balance paid in cash in 20 days from the date of the receipt. As to the terms of the mortgage with respect to the length of time for which the deferred payment of $12,000 was to be continued on the security of the property, whether for six months or 20 years, or for a reasonable time the receipt is silent. No court could of course supply such terms without making a contract for the parties. The conclusion, therefore, is that the receipt was only intended to operate according to its form and tenor as a voucher for the money paid and not as a contract or agreement binding on the plaintiffs\u2019 principals. Then the receipt of the money, though originally unauthorized, was an act adopted and ratified, and this adoption and ratification included the incidental act of giving the voucher for it.\nI conclude therefore that the plaintiffs did all they were bound to do and earned their commission by finding the purchasers and that they did nothing and omitted nothing which amounted to misfeasance or non-feasance disentitling them to the commission which they thus earned.\nThe judgment on the motion for a new trial should therefore in my opinion be reversed and the rule nisi discharged.\nFOURNIER J. concurred with Sir W. J Ritchie C J.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of opinion that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover at all. They commence their action under the common counts, for money payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs for the work, journeys and attendances of the plaintiff, by him done, performed and bestowed, as agent for the sale of lands of and for the defendants, and otherwise for the defendants at their request, and for commissions due from the defendants to the plaintiffs in respect thereof. The other common counts follow, but there is no evidence given except under this portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 demand, It is in evidence that Mackenzie did not make a sale, that is, he did not make a legal sale. He made an arrangement to sell for a certain amount, but took no accountable document to complete the sale. I take it that in law he was bound to make a sale, and that he was entitled to charge only for a complete sale. I think, therefore, that he has failed in making out a case.\nThen there is a counter claim, set up by the defendants for damages occasioned by the failure of the sale, owing to the plaintiffs not taking a written agreement. If we desired to enter into that we should, I think, require to send back the case to a jury in order to ascertain what the defendants are entitled to under the counter claim, and (if the plaintiffs were entitled to recover anything on their claim for commission) to see on which side the balance would lie. That, however, does not come before us, in consequence of the court below not having considered the question. They seem to have considered only the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and they have allowed them the commission on the sum which they received in part payment of the consideration money on the sale of this land. At the trial the jury, under the direct n of the Chief Justice, gave a verdict for the amount of the commission on the whole amount. The court said to the plaintiffs, \u201cNo, you are not entitled to that; but if you consent to reduce it to a commission of per cent, on the amount received, we will allow the verdict to stand to that extent\u201d The plaintiffs refused, and appealed to this court.\nThe plaintiff Mackenzie, it is to be observed, does not state that he was employed to enter into negotiations for a sale; but he charges that he was entitled to get remuneration for a sale. If he did not complete that sale, he is not entitled to get remuneration for anything. In his evidence we find the following;\u2014\nQ. Did they give you any instructions about the sale? A. Yes, they told me to sell it for $200 an acre, with outer two miles west of Main street, and four miles back.\nQ. What were you authorized to sell at? A. At first I was authorized to sell at $200 an acre.\nQ. Do you remember when it was given to you for sale in the first place? A. About the beginning of January.\nQ. Was there any change made in your instructions? A. Not until after I had got a purchaser for it for $200, by a man named Fanning; I went over to them and told them the man was there waiting to take the property, but I did not close with him until it was verified. It was not concluded; they would not take the $200. Now to complete that sale, it was his duty to take a binding contract from the party to whom he sold; otherwise he does not perform his agreement.\nThe Statute of Frauds requires that the sale shall be in writing to bind the parties; but it is not necessary that the instructions of an agent should be in writing, therefore the plaintiff had verbal authority to bind his principal, and if he had taken a written agreement from the purchaser the sale would be completed. In default of this, I do not think he is entitled under his contract to recover any compensation whatever. I think the question is one of law and not of fact, and therefore I think the verdict should be set aside, and judgment given for the defendants.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that there should be a new trial for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Mac Mahon and Durbar.\nSolicitors for respondents: Archibald, Howell and Vivian.\n[1] 1 C.

Crawford and Lockhart remitted to the respondent, at Montreal, the balance due to the Sweeny\u2019s to Mr. Rose's credit, notifying him thereof by letter of that date.\nThis amount was also carried into the books of Morland, Watson & Co., to the credit of Mr. Rose under date of April 14th, 1871.\nAgainst this amount Mr. Rose drew on the 4th April $4,000, which amount on that day he expended on four shares of stock of the Montreal Rolling -Mills Company, of the value of $1,000 per share, as appears by the account of James Rose (in trust) in the books of that company.\nOn the 11th April 1871 Mr. Rose obtained from the Montreal Rolling Mills Company a certificate numbered 1008, by which, under the hands of its president and secretary, it was certified that on that day James Rose, in trust, was the holder of three shares in its capital stock whereof the full value of $1000 per share had been paid.\nThis certificate was subsequently sent to the present appellant by Mr. Rose, and he paid her the amounts of the dividends declared previous to the 1st January, 1880.\nOn the 3rd June, 1876 Mr. Rose in trust, transferred to the defendant W. J. Buchanan in trust 250 shares, each of $100 fully paid up, in the capital stock of the Montreal Rolling Mills Company\u2014(the value of the shares having been before that time changed from $1,000 to $100 per share. This stock was given apparently as collateral security for advances made at the time or to be made thereafter by the respondent, on the notes of one. James Howley indorsed by Mr. Rose to Mr. Rose personally.\nThere was another transfer of shares in the Montreal Rolling Mills Company's stock made on the 13th March, 1879, making in all 810 shares paid up in full transferred to Mr. Buchanan in trust for the respondent.\nFrom the establishment of the Rolling Mills Company, up to March, 1873, Mr. Rose had twenty-five shares of $1,000 each fully paid up, which, in the last mentioned month were changed as already mentioned into two hundred and fifty shares of $100 each fully paid up and he never sold or transferred any of the said shares until he transferred them as already mentioned on the 3rd of June 1878, to Mr. Buchanan in trust for the respondent\u2014the said 250 shares being the only fully paid up shares he possessed at the time of the said transfer.\nThe appellant was unaware of the transfer to Mr. Buchanan until the beginning of the year 1880.\nOn the 27th January, 1881, protests were served on the respondent and the Montreal Rolling Mills Company, and in May of that year the action in the court below was instituted.\nThe conclusions of the declaration which set out the facts hereinbefore recited, prayed that the appellant might be declared the owner and proprietor of thirty shares of the said stock of the Montreal Rolling Mills Company. That W. J. Buchanan and the respondent be ordered to transfer the same to the said appellant and the Montreal Rolling Mills Co. to accept such transfer and make such entries and in default defendants be adjudged, &c., to pay to appellants the sum of $3900 value of said shares with costs.\nTo this action the respondent pleaded alone, setting up:\u2014 1. That Rose being indebted. to it in a sum exceeding $30,000 transferred to the bank as security therefor, 250 shares of the capital stock of the Montreal Rolling Mills Company of the par value of $25,000, which shares are now legally held for the said bank as collateral security for such debt which still remains wholly unpaid.\nThat the defendants now pleading are ignorant whether, and consequently deny that the shares referred to in the plaintiffs' declaration formed part of the said two hundred and fifty shares as to all of which no trust whatever was disclosed to the said bank, the said James Rose dealing with the same as his own property.\"\nThen followed a denial of plaintiffs' allegations not specially admitted.\nTo this plea the plaintiff answered generally.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the plaintiff's action on the ground that Rose could always dispose of those shares as he has done for there was no cestui que trust disclosed and no acceptance of any trust, the oral testimony of Rose himself being inadmissible to prove acceptance.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.\nW. H Kerr Q C. for appellants.\nRobertson Q.C. and Laflamme Q.C. for respondents.\nThe points relied on by counsel are fully reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J.\u2014It cannot be disputed I think that a sum of money belonging to the plaintiff came to the hands of James Rose that he on the 11th of April 1871, invested such money in shares in the stock of the Montreal Rolling Mills Company in and for the benefit of, and in trust for, the said plaintiff, and the same was entered in the books of the said company in the name of the said \"James Rose in trust,\" and the certificate issued by the said company certified that \"James Rose in trust \" was \" the holder \" of the said shares, which certificate Rose handed to plaintiff as showing her stock in the said company for whom plaintiff swears he bought it. That Rose paid plaintiff the dividends on this stock up to or near the 6th of January, 1880, and his answer to the question: \" By whom were the dividends received?\" Was: I It was received by me from the bank\" Q\u2014\"You received it from the bank of Montreal?\" A.\u2014\" Yes.\" Q \u2014\" That is you received the dividends on the whole stock?\" A.\u2014\" Yes on the whole stock.\" Q.\u2014\" You transferred this stock to the bank of Montreal?\" .A.\u2014\"Yes.\" Buchanan endorsed the dividend cheques over to Rose and Rose says:\u2014\"They were paid to me up to that time and I paid them to her as I got them.\"\nOn the 3rd of June, 1876, Rose transferred the stock to W. J Buchanan \"in trust\u201d at the company\u2019s office. The transfer was signed \"James Hose in trust \" and on the 13th of March, 1879, in same manner other shares as security for the benefit of the Bank of Montreal for a private indebtedness of Rose to the bank, as collateral security for advances made by the bank to him. Though standing in the books of the Rolling Mills Company \" in trust and though the transfer was signed by \"James Rose in trust\u201d and transferred by that transfer to Buchanan in trust, no enquiries appear to have been made as to who was interested in the stock or on what trust it was held, or whether Rose owned the stock or had a right to transfer it for an indebtedness of his own. Mr. Buchanan is asked, Q.\u2014 \"Did he give you to understand that this stock was \"stock belonging to himself, or did he deal with it as s some one else's? Was there any question of its belonging to any one else, or of any one else having any \" interest in it?\" And he answers: \u201cHe offered this \"stock to us as security.\" The question was not put to him, \"Do you own this stock?\" The learned Chief Justice of the court below seems to assume that it was not proved that Rose was ever requested to invest plaintiff\u2019s money in Montreal Rolling Mills stock, nor that she ever accepted or ratified the pretended trust; but to my mind the evidence is clear on both these points. She had the money in Rose's hands lo invest for her he does do so in this stock in his own name in trust for her he transmits her the certificate of ownership of the stock, showing it is held in trust by him and she receives through him from time to time the half yearly dividends. I cannot conceive stronger evidence of the acceptance, adoption and ratification of Rose's acts on her behalf than this conduct of plaintiff. The plaintiff adopted and enjoyed the benefit of the investment. If there ever was a case where the maxim, Omnis ratihabitio ratro trahitur et mandato priori case. paratur, is applicable, I think this is that case.\nThere can be no doubt the transfer of this stock by Rose for securing his private indebtedness was a flagrant breach of trust, and the simple question is which of two innocent parties must bear the loss caused by the gross fraud of Rose.\nThere can be no doubt that the bank had full actual notice of the existence of a trust of some description, a trust for some one not disclosed. They could not obtain a transfer at the company's office without seeing there, if they chose to look, that the stock was registered in the name of Rose in trust but without that, the very transfer on which they took the stock showed that Rose was dealing with trust property and transferring property he held in trust and which the assignee well knew for Mr. Buchanan himself thus expresses it:\u2014 \"He transferred the stock to me in trust. There was a transfer of two hundred and fifty shares of 1ontreal Rolling Mills stock; the transfer was signed by James Rose in trust and he transfers it by that transfer to me in trust.\"\nI am quite prepared to adopt the language of the court in Shaw v. Spencer ([1]), \" that where one known to be a trustee is found pledging that which is known to be trust property to secure a debt of his own the act is one prima facie unauthorized and unlawful and it is the duty of him who takes such security to ascertain whether the trustee has the right to give it.\" It would and should then hardly be disputed, as was suggested in this same case, if the words had been in trust for Emily Sweeney, the duty of enquiry would be cast on the creditor, but the effect of the words i in trust \" as there suggested is the same. They must mean in trust for some one whose name is not disclosed and there is no greater reason for assuming that a trustee is authorized to pledge for his own debt the property of an unnamed cestui que trust than the property of one whose name is known.\nAs pledging trust property is prima facie unlawful where is the hardship of imposing on the person taking the security the duty of inquiry and the burden of ascertaining the actual position of the property instead of remaining in ignorance without even, as Mr. Buchanan says, putting the question to him: \" Do you own the stock?'' The assignee having the notice that this stock was held by Rose in trust, when he sought to deal with it for his own private benefit, in my opinion the duty of inquiring as to the nature, character and limitations of the trust was imposed on the person taking it as security for such an indebtedness.\nWhen there is actual notice that a trust exists and the use to be made of the trust property is prima tacie a misappropriation, to refrain from asking any question of Rose as Buchanan says, or making any inquiry what ever. is to my mind not only a want of ordinary prudence but gross negligence.\nI cannot understand how in any system of jurisprudence a creditor can receive from a trustee by way of pledge for securing a private debt due by the trustee trust property knowing the same to be property held in trust and hold such property against the cestui que trust the beneficial owner thereof by force of a transaction on its face so dishonest and fraudulent.\nBuchanan does not pretend he did not know it was held in trust. After answering as before, he is then asked\u2014\nIs it a very common thing for stock to be standing in that way in trust? A. It is very often clone it is frequently so with bank stocks.\u2014Q. And there is never any inquiry as to who the party is, when it is put in that way? A No \u2022 it is done without hesitation. An advance is made without hesitation on stock when it is put in that way and no questions are asked.\nIn the case of Mangles v Dixon ([2]) it was held that the assignee of any security, (that is, when the assignee has only an equitable right, as an assignee 01 a bond,) stands in the same position as the assignor as to the equities arising upon it. How different the idea of Mr. Buchanan from that of Lord St. Leonard\u2019s who in that suit at p. 733 as to right of parties when they have actual notice of equities, as when parties have notice that property is held in trust, says:\nThey are bound by the notice which they have: for equity will not permit a man to shut his eyes to a fact of which he has been informed and therefore if he has notice he is bound by the knowledge he has thus acquired.\nIf the bank, knowing in this case, as they must have done, that Rose was borrowing money for his own private use on a pledge of property belonging to another, which he held in. trust, and that he was thus dealing with it for his own benefit and as his own property chose to advance money on such property under such circumstances and ask no question, they cannot, in my opinion, be said to have taken it in good faith, and cannot be in a better position in reference to it than Rose himself, and as he had no beneficial interest in the property they can claim none, but must be held to have taken the property charged with the trust and so are bound to account for it to the plaintiff as the cestui que trust entitled to the beneficiary interest therein\nI do not think Rose in this case could claim under any law to be entitled to pledge for advances for his own personal benefit property held in trust for and belonging to another, any more than Barrow in the case of the City Bank vs. Barrow ([3]), to which my brother Taschereau has called my attention could pledge the property in his hands belonging to another, and that, consequently, the bankers in this case, as the bankers in that cannot set up any title to the stock as derived from him against the real owners.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG J. \u2014For the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench and also for some additional reasons, I am of opinion that the judgments of the courts below ought to be affirmed Before proceeding to consider the various points of law which have been raised in argument, it may be well to remark that the decision in this case must depend entirely upon the law of the Province of Quebec, as embodied in the Civil Code, and that the English law of trusts, and analogies derived from that law, are entirely inapplicable, and cannot be resorted to for the purpose of determining the rights of the parties. Further, it is to be borne in mind that (excepting per haps the law relating to substitutions) there is nothing in the legal system established by the Quebec Code in any way resembling the doctrine of a double owner ship in the case of trusts which prevail in the English courts, by which property held in trust is regarded as the legal property of one owner,\u2014the trustee \u2014and the beneficial property of another owner the cestui one trust.\nBy the law of the Province of Quebec as well as by the ancient and modern law of France on which it is founded, no distinction is made between the legal and the beneficial ownership, and the rights of a person who has ceded or caused to be ceded his property to a mandatary, by a transfer absolute in form are in no sense rights in rem, but mere personal rights, entitling the party making the cession to a personal remedy against the mandatary for any breach by the latter of his obligations, and to nothing more. I am, of course referring to a case in which the property is transferred to the mandatary, and not to the case of a deposit, when the property remains in the depositor and the possession only is parted with.\nHaving made this preliminary observation as to a general principle of law, which must be kept constantly in view in considering this case, and as to which I shall have to say more, and refer to some authorities hereafter, I now propose to inquire what were the legal rights of the appellant as against Rose; first, in respect of the money deposited with him by Messrs. Crawford & Lockhart, and next in respect of the shares now in question, in which, as Rose now alleges, he invested the money.\nAs regards the money remitted by Messrs. Crawford & Lockhart to Rose, the proof appears to be sufficient to establish that Rose was a depositary of it. The entry in the books of Morland, Watson & Co., the firm in which Rose was a partner, appears to me to constitute a commencement of proof sufficient to let in oral proof according to art. 1233 C.C. (P.Q.), which seems to restrict the definition of a commencement of \"proof according to the ancient law, in a less degree than art. 1347 of the French Code, which requires that a writing, to constitute a commencement of proof should emanate from the party against whom it is sought to be used, or from one of his \" auteurs \" the latter a condition not required by the terms of art. 1233 of the Quebec Code, and, as it appears from the authorities, not required by the ancient law of France ([4]). This entry shows that the moneys remitted by Messrs Crawford & Lock hart reached Rose's hands, and were by him deposited with the firm of Morland, Watson & Co. of which he was a member, and would have been sufficient according to Bonnier under the stricter French law. This entry is a writing emanating from the firm of Morland, Watson & Co. of which Rose was a member; there is nothing to show and no reason can be suggested, why a writing emanating from others, jointly with the party sought to be charged with it should not be a sufficient commencement of proof then this writing does emanate from Rose in conjunction with his partners\u2014at least it was an entry made by one who represented the firm, the clerk or book-keeper, in whose handwriting it is, and who was a person representing the several members of the firm, including Rose, which is sufficient. Bonnier ([5]) says:\nD'abord aux termes de l'article No. 1347 l'auteur de l'\u00e9crit doit \u00eatre le defendeur, ou celui qu'il represente. Il est le m\u00eame en sons inverse, de celui qui le r\u00e9presente: ainsi, les \u00e9crits du mandataire peuvent \u00eatre oppos\u00e9s au mandant. I am, therefore, of opinion that this entry on the books is a sufficient commencement of proof to let in oral evidence of the deposit of this money with Rose as a depository for the appellant. Indeed, I should not have thought the matter called for even so much consideration, if it had not been so strenuously argued by the respondent that it was insufficient for that purpose.\nThis contract of deposit, however, only involved a personal obligation on the part of Rose to pay over the money when called upon, and there having been, up to the date of the purchase of the shares, no mandate to invest, this was nothing more than an ordinary debt, and did not involve any obligation to transfer the shares, the equitable doctrine of following moneys held upon deposit, as trust funds, into a wrongful investment, having no place as far as I have been able to ascertain, in French law.\nIt is said, however, that there was a mandate to invest, and it therefore becomes a question whether any such agency is proved. I fail to find in the record any proof of such a mandate anterior to the purchase of the shares\nIt is clear law that a mandate may be either express or tacit, but whether express or tacit, as in the case of every contract, the assent of both parties, of the principal as well as of the agent must be established by legal proof.\nAs regards direct proof, mere verbal evidence is of course inadmissible under the French law of evidence, to establish the mandate. A tacit mandate, may however be established by the acts and conduct of the parties, and from such acts and conduct the assent of the mandator as well as of the mandatary may be inferred. There is however nothing in the evidence warranting the inference that the appellant assented in any way to an investment of her money in these shares, prior to the date at which they were acquired; or the contrary, it appears they were bought by Rose without her knowledge or assent.\nThe question arises however, whether there was not such a tacit ratification by the appellant, of the purchase of the shares by Rose, as was equivalent, in law, to a prior authority The general principle of law that the ratification of the acts of one who assumes to act as agent, is to be deemed equivalent to a prior authority, is expressly provided for by the Quebec Code, and the article 1720, (identical with 1998 of the French Code) in which this principle of law is embodied, also expressly delares that such ratification may be either express or tacit Then the acceptance of the benefit of the act of the assumed agent, by the person for whose benefit he has ostensibly acted, with knowledge of all the circumstances, is considered as implying adoption, and amounts to tacit ratification (see Troplong Mandat Nos. 610 and 611.) This principle, by which subsequent adoption or ratification is considered equivalent to prior authority, is however, like all legal fictions, subject to the qualification that the rights of third parties, intervening before the ratification are not to be affected ex post facto.\nTurning then to the evidence. I proceed to enquire if there is place for the application of this principle to the facts of the present case.\nWas there then such an assent by the appellant to Rose's investment of her money in Montreal Rolling Mills shares as amounted to a tacit ratification sufficient under article 1720 to make Rose her agent by relation in the acquisition of the shares s As before stated any acts of recognition or assent on the part of the appellant to have this effect must have been prior in point of time to the transfer by Rose to Mr. Buchanan.\nThe proof on this head consists entirely of statements contained in the deposition of Rose. It is to be remembered that the two transfers to Mr. Buchanan were completed respectively on the 3rd June, 1876, and the 14th March, 1879. In order then to give the appellant a title in priority to the bank it must he shown that there was an adoption by her of the investment, at a date anterior to the last transfer to the respondents. Any silent acquiescence by Miss Sweeney in what is stated in Rose's letter is therefore manifestly too late for this purpose, as that letter is of the 6th June 1880 a date long subsequent to the last transfer to the respondents.\nThe statements material to this question contained in Rose's deposition are as follows:\u2014\nQ. Have you any doubts as to whom the stock referred to in the certificate, plaintiff's exhibit number 1, belongs?\n(The defendant's counsel objects to this as involving a question of law. Objection reserved by the court.)\nA. The certificate was handed to Miss Sweeney, the plaintiff in this case.\nQ. And for whom did you buy it?\nA. For her.\nQ. Did you ever pay anything to her coming from this stock?\n(The defendant's counsel again repeats his first objection above set forth, and the objection is again reserved by the court.)\nA. Yes I paid her the dividends up to the time the bank stopped me from drawing them.\nQ. When was that?\nA. I paid her dividends up to or near the date of this letter plaintiff's exhibit \"A. 9,\" namely the sixth of January, 1880, and J expected the dividends to be paid again, shortly after that time, as usual. They were paid to me up to that time and I paid them to her. I expected to receive them as usual soon after, but they were stopped. It was the first time they were stopped. The dividends fell due on the first of February following the date of that letter and I thought they would be paid then as they had been before. They were always paid to me previously and I had paid them over to Miss Sweeney as I got them.\nQ. The dividends of the Montreal Rolling Mills Company are payable in August and in February of each year, are they not? A. Yes.\nQ. And you received them up to what date?\nA. Up to the date of that letter exhibit ll A, 0.\"\nQ. That is January, eighteen hundred and eighty (1880)?\nA. The dividend previous to the date of that letter exhibit \"A 9 \"was received and paid over to Miss Sweeney and the other ladies entitled to it.\nQ. By whom was the dividend received?\nA. It was received by me from the bank.\nQ. You received it from the Bank of Montreal?\nA. Yes.\nBy the judge\u2014That is, you received the dividends on the whole of the stock?\nA. Yes on the whole of the stock.\nFrom this it appears that at some unascertained time, whether before or after the dates of the transfers to the bank is left uncertain the certificate for the shares was handed to Miss Sweeney, and that the proceeds of dividends accruing Up to January, 1880, were received by Rose, and by him paid over to the appellant. This is the only evidence which tends to prove ratification to be found in the case. The onus of proving a mandate by ratification or otherwise was, of course, upon the plaintiff in the action, but can it be said that either of these facts, taken separately or together, establish that Miss Sweeney, with the knowledge that her money had been invested in Rolling Mills shares, accepted the certificate and took the profits of the shares prior to the transfers to the respondents. Time was material, and it was incumbent on the plaintiff to establish the date but the handing over of the certificate, for all that appears, may have been after the last transfer to the respondents, for no date is assigned to it by Rose, and in a case like the present, when the anxiety of Rose to throw the loss occasioned by his fraud and misconduct on the bank rather than on the appellant is manifest, I think we ought jealously to scrutinize his evidence, and that we are not entitled to supply defects in the proof by making presumptions and drawing inferences to establish material facts which the plaintiff ought to have proved directly. Again, the mere fact that Rose received the dividends and handed the proceeds to the appellant proves nothing towards making out a case of ratification, unless it is also shown that Miss Sweeney was informed by him, or in some way knew that the money was in fact the proceeds of an investment in these shares, but of this most material fact there is not a word of proof to be found in Rose's deposition or elsewhere in the record. It is quite consistent with Rose's statements, that whilst he handed the money to Miss Sweeney, he also told her that the money was the produce of other investments, or that it was interest on money remaining in his hands or in those of his firm or that it was the profit of some investment not specified, in any of which cases there would have been no ratification of his act in investing in these particular shares, for it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove that she knew of the purchase of these particular shares and assented to it prior to the transfer to the respondents. In this I think the appellant has failed and consequently it is not proved that Rose held the shares as her agent when the respondent acquired them.\nI, therefore, come to the same conclusion as the Court of Queen's Bench, that the appellant failed to prove her case, of which the establishment of a mandate was the indispensable foundation, and that there-fore, she must fail in her action\nThere are, however, in my opinion other reasons for holding that this appeal cannot succeed reasons which are consistent with the hypothesis that the evidence is sufficient to establish the agency and that the conclusion before stated on that head is erroneous\nThen assuming, that either by reason of some prior authority, proof of which has been overlooked, or by reason of ratification prior to the transfer to the respondents, it matters not which, a mandate is sufficiently established, I proceed to inquire what would have been, in law, the consequence and effect of such proof as regards Rose's powers of disposition upon the shares in question.\nMourlon, who, though an institutional writer, is regarded as a sound authority on French law, states, with clearness and conciseness, the legal consequences of a purchase by an agent of tangible, corporeal property, property susceptible of being transferred by tradition. He says ([6]) if corporeal property, such as a house, is purchased by an agent in the name of his principal, the agent is a mere \"portevoix,\" and the property passes at once to the principal; but if the agent purchases in his own name, the law operating on the contract of sale transfers the property to the agent in the first instance, who becomes bound by a legal obligation to transfer it at once to his principal, which latter obligation the law also by force of art. O.N. I11 (C.C.P.Q. art. 583) implements by transferring the property to the principal, who thus acquires the property by force of these two mutations.\nThe law thus applicable to the case of a corporeal, movable or immovable cannot be applicable to the property in these shares now in question, for the legislature has expressly enacted that the property in them shall be passed in one way, and in one way only, namely, by a transfer on the books of the company.\nThis brings the enquiry to the question: What are the legal powers of disposition of an agent or mandatary to whom property is either transferred by the mandator or principal, or who, with the knowledge and assent of the principal, obtains from a third party a, transfer of property such as this for the benefit and behoof of the principal.\nIn the French law such an agent is designated a mandataire pr\u00eate-nom and according to the highest authorities he is entitled to exercise unlimited powers of disposition over the property so vested in him, and third persons acquiring rights in or title to the property from him, are not considered to be in bad faith, or in any way affected by knowledge or notice that the agent is dealing with the property in contravention of the agreement between him and his principal, the sole remedy of a principal in such a case being a personal action against the mandatary who is considered, as regards third persons to have been invested with unlimited powers of disposition, as much so as if he was himself the veritable and absolute proprietor. As showing that such is a correct definition of the powers of the person known in French law as mandataire pr\u00eate-nom, I refer to Laurent, ([7]), who says:\u2014\nOn appelle \"pr\u00eate-nom,\" en mati\u00e8re de mandat, celui qui, en apparence, a les droits du propri\u00e9taire sur une chose, tandis qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 ii n'est que mandataire.\nThe author then gives, as an illustration, the case of a transfer of property transferred by the owner to one who, as agreed by a contre Iettre or secret convention is to hold it as a mandatary for the benefit of the party making the transfer. From this, however, it is not to be inferred that this particular species of agency is confined to the case of a transfer by the principal himself and does not include the case of a transfer by a third person to a mandatary for the beneficial use of the principal, for such a distinction would, of course, be purely arbitrary, and moreover is shown by the arr\u00e9t of the Court of Cessation, hereafter to be cited to have no existence. Laurent, in the passage referred to, next proceeds to consider what are the powers of disposition which such a pr\u00eate-nom mandataire has over the property with w there which he is invested, and he shows that these rights are those of an absolute proprietor. Thus he says:\u2014\nDone, a l'\u00e9gard des tiers, le mandat est cens\u00e9 ne pas exister: partant, celui qui, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, n'est qu'un mandataire aura los droits quo lui donne son titre apparent. Si c'est une cession, ii sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, et ii pourra valable mont faire tous actes de disposition, quand m\u00eame par ces actes ii d\u00e9passerait les bornes du mandat qu'il a recu sous forme de cession.\nNext he considers the case of the third party having notice that the person with whom he deals is only a mandataire, and, after citing a decision of the Court of Cassation, proceeds as follows:\nCela implique qui celui qui constitue un mandat sous forme do pr\u00eate-nom a l'intention que los rapports entre le pr\u00eate-nom et los tiers soient r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par l'acte apparent, et qu'il n'y ait do mandat qu'entre lui et le pr\u00eate-nom: do sorte quo le mandat, memo connu des tiers, soit cens\u00e9 ne pas exister \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Mais, comme le cessionnaire apparent est, en realit\u00e9, mandataire, nait la question do savoir en quelle qualit\u00e9 los tiers entendent traiter avec lui, alors qu'ils savent que lo pr\u00e9tenuu cessionnaire n'est qu' un mandataire? Est-ce l'acte apparent qui pr\u00e9vaudra, quoique los tiers sachent que ce n'est qu'un acte apparent? On suppose que le cessionnaire a trait\u00e9 en cette qualit\u00e9 et que les t\u00eders oat accept\u00e9 cette qualit\u00e9 apparente. Dans ce cas, il faut dire, avec Ia cour do cassation, quo l'acte apparent r\u00e9gie les rapports du pr\u00eate-nom avec les tiers, malgr\u00e9 la connaissance, qu'ils ont de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des choses\nHaving thus shown that knowledge of the fact that the mandate does not affect the third party who may purchase from the \" pr\u00eate nom,\" Laurent next proceeds to consider a question, which is also the vital question in the present case and his decision of which applies a fortiori here, namely, whether the knowledge of a third party acquiring title from the mandatary, not merely of the existence of the mandate but also of its terms and that the act of the mandatary in ceding his apparent rights is in contravention of the convention existing between him and his principal binds the purchaser. He says on this head.\nIl y a cependant un motif de douter: si le pr\u00eate-nom fait ce qu'il n'avait pas le droit do faire comme mandataire, l'acte sera-t-il valable? Ne peut on pas dire quo les tiers sont de mauvaise foi? Dans la doctrine consacr\u00e9e par la cour do cassation on \u00e9carte la question do bonne foi. Il y a en effet, une difference entre la contre lettre de l'article 1321 et le mandat donn\u00e9 sous forme do pr\u00eate-nom. La contre-lettre a pour objet de tromper les tiers elle \u00e9veille du moins l'id\u00e9e et le soup\u00e7on do fraude: tandis quo celui qui donne un mandat \u00e0 un pr\u00eate-nom no veut pas tromper, il consent \u00e0 ce quo le mandataire agisse \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, non comme mandataire, mais comme cessionnaire: c'est lui qui pourra \u00eatre tromp\u00e9 si le mandataire d\u00e9pass\u00e9e les bornes do son mandat: il accepte d'avance cotte cons\u00e9quence de l'acte apparent qu'il passe, il renonce \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir contre los tiers du mandat quo ceuxci ignorent ou sont cens\u00e9s ignorer. Il suit de l\u00e0 qu'il n'y a pas, dans l'esp\u0141ce, mauvaise foi do la part des tiers, ils font ce que le mandant los autorise \u00e0 faire.\nI have given this somewhat long extract from Laurent as it shows the law very clearly and is very apposite to the questions which are presented for our decision in this appeal.\nThe arr\u00ebt of the Court of Cassation, already referred to, and upon which Laurent founds his text, is reported in Dalloz, 1864, Vol. 1, p. 282 (the case of Richaud C. L\u00e9curieux) and it fully bears out his conclusions. The court says in effect that the mandat pr\u00eate-nom is a contract sai generis not governed by the general principles of the law applicable to the contract of mandate, and that the question of the good or bad faith of those dealing with the mandatary cannot arise. It is further of importance, as showing that the principle applies as well to the case of a cession made to the mandatary by a third party for the benefit of the principal as to that when the cession is by the principal himself, directly to the pr\u00eatenom for in that case the fact was, the property and the rights in question had been ceded to the pr\u00e9tenom by a third person.\nIn this arr\u00eat the court says:\u2014\nAttendu, en droit, quo le mandat proprement dit no doit point \u00eatre confondu avec le mandat sui generis, connu sous la d\u00e9nomination do pr\u00eate-nom: Attendu quo lorsque le mandat a constitu\u00e9 son pr\u00eate-nom ma\u00eetre absolu do la chose \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, ii importe peu que le tiers avec qui ce dernier a trait\u00e9 en son nom personnel ait eu connaissance de la qualit\u00e9 do pr\u00eate-nom: quo cette circonstance ne saurait exercer aucune influence sur les droits et obligations qui naissent du contrat: quo cot acte s'\u00e9tant accompli hors d\u00ba la pr\u00e8senee du mandant, qui a voulu y demeurer \u00e9trangor, celui-ci no peut pas plus son pr\u00e9valoir qu'il ne pourrait \u00e9tre invoqu\u00e9 contre lui\nThese authorities might be largely added to, but I will only refer further to Troplong, Mandat ([8]) which is in entire accord with the law before stated from Laurent and the Court of Cassation.\nIt cannot be objected that these authorities are not applicable in the Province of Quebec, for the law of agency as embodied in the Quebec Civil Code agrees in every respect material to the present question with that of the French Code. And it is to be observed that the doctrine of the Court of Cassation is not founded on any particular article or text of the Code, but on a pre sumption of law (prcesumptio juris et de jure) as to the intention of a principal who transfers or authorizes a transfer of property to his agent or mandatary to be held by the latter ostensibly as absolute owner, but in reality for the beneficial use of the principal, and the reasons which have induced the French courts and jurists to make such a presumption are equally applicable in the Province of Quebec.\nThen applying the before stated principles of law to the facts in proof in the Present case and, assuming for the present purpose that the fact of agency by ratification is sufficiently established, we find that the relations between appellant and Rose were exactly such as according to the authorities cited constituted the latter a mandataire pr\u00e9tenom, according to the definition before given.\nThe absolute property in these shares was vested in him though for the benefit of his principal; for, if the appellant was entitled, even as between herself and Rose to claim any interest in the shares, it could only he on the ground that she had recognized and adopted his acts in taking the transfer in his own name, and as such ratification was in all respects equivalent to a prior authority, we are by a sort of legal fiction to regard Rose as having acquired the shares originally as the mandatary of the appellant with her authority and assent, thus exactly fulfilling the conditions pointed out by Laurent and the Court of Cassation as requisite to constitute the peculiar species of the contract of mandate now in question.\nNext arises the enquiry, were the powers of disposition incidental to an agency of this nature legally exercised?\nIt is to be observed that both the Court of Cassation and the text writers above mentioned lay it down that a degree of knowledge which, in an ordinary case, would constitute a purchaser in bad faith, would have no effect upon the validity of the acquisition by a person to whom a pr\u00e9te-nom mandataire might sell or pledge the property entrusted to him, and that even though such a purchaser or pledgee should have notice not merely of the fact, that the person from whom he was buying or taking security was an agent holding the property for the benefit of another, hut also of the additional fact that the disposition of the property proposed to be made would actually contravene the convention between the agent and his principal, such notice would still not invalidate a transfer made to the third party having such knowledge. This goes far beyond anything which is requisite in the present case, for at the most the words i in trust,\" entered in. the share register and added to Rose's name in the transfer to Mr. Buchanan (if indeed they had any signification at all), would only have signified that Rose, having the absolute property in the shares, held that absolute property as the mandatary for some undisclosed principal, in which case, as already shown, the law clearly justified Mr. Buchanan in assuming, as he did that Rose had the power to do what he actually did, namely, to pledge the shares for advances to be made or already made to him by the bank.\nThat this is the very utmost effect which can he attributed to this appearance of these words i in trust \" in the share register and transfer is apparent when we consider the general principle of the law that good faith is always to be presumed, and that it lies on those who allege bad faith to prove it. Whilst I say this, I by no means concede that it would in law have made any difference if Rose had disclosed to Mr. Buchanan facts which there is no pretence for saying he did communicate viz. the entire history of these shares and of the purchase of them by Rose with the funds of the appellant, just as fully in every respect as Rose states those alleged facts in his deposition, for it appears to me that the question of good or bad faith is entirely immaterial in dealing with an agent, such as Rose undoubtedly was. It is out of the question to say in face of the law, which says that bad faith must be proved and not presumed that even if bad faith or notice of all the facts had been material there was any obligation on Mr. Buchanan to make enquiry as the declaration charges there was. To say there was such a duty cast upon the respondents would be to apply the doctrine of constructive notice, which prevails in English courts of equity, and which being entirely founded on presumption is expressly excluded in French law by the principle already mentioned that no presumption of bad faith shall be made. Whilst I have made these observations on the evidence, as showing that nothing was done by the bank or the manager knowingly to prejudice the i rights of Miss Sweeney, I must repeat that, in my judgment, it would have made no legal difference if Mr. Buchanan had received the fullest information as to Miss Sweeney's connection with the shares in question.\nI have carefully refrained from making any observations on the English law applicable to the case, either for the purpose of drawing analogies or pointing out distinctions. I have endeavoured to consider the case on what I consider to be the principles of the French law prevailing in the Province of Quebec, by which alone it falls to be decided. I may, however, be permitted to add that I should doubt whether even upon the highly artificial principles as to constructive notice which prevails in courts administering English equity there would have been sufficient in the words \"in trust,' (for it is the appearance of these words in the share register and in the transfers, which alone can be referred to as establishing notice,) to have put Mr. Buchanan on enquiry. The argument doubtless would be that Mr. Buchanan was put upon enquiry by seeing these words added to Rose's name as indicating that he was acting in the quality of a trustee or agent. But in the first place 1 should doubt if the words i in trust \" are not too general and vague for any such purpose, and in the next place it would have appeared to me to be out of the question to suppose that an enquiry from Rose, who was dealing with the shares as his own would have led to any communication of the appellants rights, and an enquiry of the officers of the Rolling Mills Company would certainly have been fruitless as all they could have said would have been that they added the words \"in trust\" because Rose instructed them to do so: and consequently there would have been no ground for applying the doctrine of constructive notice which proceeds on the inference that know ledge would have been obtained if enquiry had been made. I need not however speculate on what the result of the evidence would have been in an English Equity Court for it is sufficient to say that this ease is to he decided by the law of Quebec, and that adjudged by that law the result is that, first; no presumption of any notice or knowledge not actually found to have been brought home by the respondent\u2019s s manager can be imputed to them; and secondly, that even if Rose had stated to Mr. Buchanan every fact and circumstance contained in his deposition in this cause, Mr. Buchanan would have been in law fully justified in accepting the transfer and the notice would not have impaired or in any way affected the title of the bank to hold the shares as security for the advances for which they were pledged.\nThat the view of the law, before stated, is that acted on in practice in dealing with shares in the Province of Quebec is proved on the part of the respondent and not contradicted. Mr. Buchanan, in his deposition, states that it is not unusual to find these words \"in trust \" added in the certificate, but that such addition is not considered as incapacitating the holder from disposing of the shares freely as his own property, and that it is not the usage to make any inquir\u00edas into the nature of the title in such cases.\nThat a trust maybe created in the shares of this company, which it would be imperative on the courts of the Province of Quebec to enforce, according to the principles prevailing in English courts of equity, I do not for a moment question. In the case, which may be supposed, of shares being put into trust by a settlement made between parties domiciled in England and which, according to the intention of the parties, is to be construed and executed according to the law of that country, there can be no doubt that on the ordinary principles of private international law the rights of the parties would be considered by the Quebec courts as governed by the rules relating to trusts which prevail in English law, provided, of course, that proper proof of that law was adduced. But in the present case all the parties to the contract being domiciled in Quebec, which was also the locus of the contract, and where it was to be carried into execution I maintain that their rights under it must be ruled exclusively by the law of Quebec.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014La poursuite de l'appelante, Demanderesse en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a pour but le recouvrement de trois actions dans le fonds de Ia \" Montreal Rolling Mills Company,\" originairement de mille dollars chacune, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement convertie plus tard enactionsde cent piastres chacune,\u2014d\u00e9tenues pour elle en fid\u00e9icommis, {in trust) par James Rose l'un des d\u00e9fendeurs qui les a ill\u00e9galement transport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Banque de Montr\u00e9al, intim\u00e9e comme suret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale d'une dette qui lui \u00e9tait personnelle.\nL'Appelante allegue que lors de ce transport par be dit James Rose (in trust) fid\u00e9icommis ii \u00e9tait \u00e0 Ia connaissance des d\u00e9fendeurs et de chacun d'eux que les dites actions n'\u00e9taient point Ia propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dit James Rose, mais celle d'autres personnes et qu'il \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence du devoir des d\u00e9fendeuss de s'en4uCrir de ce fait avant d'en consentir on accepter un transport.\nL'Intim\u00e9e seule a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande, all\u00e9guant que les dites actions lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9ss conjointe ment avec au-del\u00e0 de deux cents autres pour la garantie d'une cr\u00e9ance qu'elle avait contre le dit James Rose pour un montant exc\u00e9dant trente mille dollars; all\u00e9 guant en outre qu'aucun fid\u00e9icommis ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 et que le dit James Rose disposait de ces actions comme de sa chose propre.\nD'apr\u00e8s la preuve \u00e9crite et testimoniale il est \u00e9tabli que la famille Sweeny dont l'appelante est un des membres, fit le 18 mars 1871, remise \u00e0 James Rose par l'interm\u00e9diaire de MM. Crawford et Lockhart de Belfast en Irlande d'une somme de \u00a32040.11.1. On ne trouve dans la lettre d'envoi de cette somme aucune instruction particuli\u00e8re sur Ia mani\u00e8re de la placer on employer,\u2014mais elle contient les passages suivants faisant voir qu'une partie de ces fonds appartenait \u00e0 l'appelante et quills restaient sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nBELFAST,\n18th March, 1871.\nDear Sir,\nWe have at length brought the sale of the Sweeny property to a close and now enclose balance sheet between the Sweeny family and ourselves, and have this day remitted to the Montreal Bank as directed by your friends to your credit 22040.11.1. We also send you, as you wish, a statement shewing the portions of the purchase money to which each party was entitled with their contributions to the costs of the sale and also to the sums which had to be repaid Mr. Esson for 171\/2 years accumulations of rent and interest.\nIt would be very desirable if the Certificates which will become necessary on Miss Sweeny attaining age to prove her heirship, were now procured while there are so many parties who could give information which it might be difficult to obtain in 15 or 16 years hence.\nCette somme fut re\u00e7ue par Rose vers le 31 du m\u00eame mois et par lui d\u00e9pos\u00e9e entre les mains de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Morland, Watson et Cie., dont ii faisait partie. Ce fait est constat\u00e9 par l'entr\u00e9e suivante que l'on trouve dans les livres de cette soci\u00e9te, \" 1871, March. James Rose ex Deposit Crawford & L., 20 March, \u00a32040.11.1\"\u2014\u00e9gale a $9,930.71.

Crawford et Lockhart, comme cela est prouv\u00e9 par la production de leur correspondence.\nLe 14 avril m\u00eame ann\u00e9e Rose tira sur ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t une somme de $4,000 qu'il employa le m\u00e9me jour \u00e0 acheter quatre actions en fid\u00e9icommis (in trust) de la \" Montreal Rolling Mills Company\" de la valeur de $1,000, chacune. Ce fait est prouv\u00e9 par les livres de cette compagnie.\nLe 11 avril il se fit remettre par la dite compagnie un certificat No. 1 008 sous le seing du pr\u00e9sident et secr\u00e9taire, constatant que lui le dit James Rose \u00e9tait le d\u00e9tenteur en fid\u00e9icommis (in trust) de trois actions dans le capital de la dite compagnie, dont le plein montant de mille dollars par part avait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9. Ce certificat fut transmis par Rose \u00e0 l'appelante \u00e0 laquelle ii a aussi fait parvenir les dividendes de ces actions jusqu'au ler janvier 1884.\nLe 3 janvier 1876, Rose toujours avec la qualit\u00e9 de fid\u00e9icommissaire transporta \u00e0 l'un des d\u00e9fendeurs W. J. Buchanan agissant (in trust) comme fid\u00e9icommissaire pour l'intim\u00e9e, deux cent cinquante actions, du montant de $100 chaque pay\u00e9, dans le fonds social de la compagnie. Quoique l'appelante n'en ait pas fait un grief dans sa d\u00e9claration, ce transport parait dapr\u00e8s la preuve avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale d'escompte fait dans le m\u00eame moment et \u00e0 \u00eatre fait par apres sur les billets de James Hawley, endoss\u00e9 par Rose. Ce fait forme un des consid\u00e9rants du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 comme suit:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que le dit transport na \u00e9t\u00e9 fait que pour garantir des avances a \u00eatre faites au dit James Rose, et non pour garantir des dettes alors existantes.\nLe 13 mars 1879, un autre transport d'actions dans la m\u00eame compagnie fut fait de la m\u00e9me mani\u00e8re, ce qui faisait en tout 310 actions pay\u00e9es en plein, transport\u00e9es \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e par Rose.\nDepuis l'\u00e9tablissement de 1st \"Montreal Rolling Mills Company \" James Rose a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'un des actionnaires jusqu'\u00e0 la date des transports ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s, et y a toujours eu ces actions inscrites en fid\u00e9icommis (in trust).\nL'appelante confiante dans le certificat qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis, recevant r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ses dividendes, croyait ses fonds en parfaite s\u00fbret\u00e9 lorsqu'elle apprit au commencement de Janvier 1880, que ses actions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9es \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle elle en fit plus tard la demande par un prot\u00eat qui fut suivi de l'action en cette cause.\nL'appelante a retrace la disposition de ces fonds d'une mani\u00e8re certaine depuis le moment de leur envoi jus-qu'\u00e0 celui de leur emploi en actions dont les certificats lui furent remis presqu'aussit\u00f4t et dont elle est toujours demeur\u00e9e en possesion. Malgr\u00e9 cela la Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee a renvoy\u00e9 sa demande, se fondant principalement sur les consid\u00e9rants suivants:\u2014\n10. Consid\u00e9rant que par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t do la dite somme de trois mulle piastres fait entre les mains du dit James Rose, ce dernier est devenu propri\u00e9taire de la dite somme en autant quo ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t est irr\u00e9gulier\n20. Consid\u00e9rant que la preuve du d\u00e9p\u00f4t en mati\u00e8re civile no pout se faire vis-\u00e0-vis de tiers que par \u00e9crit.\n30. Consid\u00e9rant que le fait, quo le dit James Rose, a appos\u00e9 son nom comme souscripteur des dites parts n'a pas eu l'effet vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers de rendre la demanderesse propri\u00e9taire des dites parts, que s'il en \u00e9tait autrement On no saurait \u00e0 qui attribuer Ia propri\u00e9t\u00e9 do ces parts dans los cas o\u00f9 elles serauit r\u00e9clames par plusieurs d\u00e9posants quo le dit James Rose ne pouvait pas vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers soustraire ses biens \u00e0 l'action do ces cr\u00e9anciers par le soul fait d'ajouter \u00e0 son nom le mot in trust, et tant' que le fid\u00e9icommis (trust) nest pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'une personne nomm\u00e9e, los tiers ont droit d'agir avec Ia d\u00e9positairo dans telles circonstances comme si ces choses \u00e9taient siennes.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Bane de la Reine, et c'est Ce dernier jugement confirmant le premier qui est actuellement soumis \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de cette cour.\nLe premier consid\u00e9rant du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est fond\u00e9 sur une proposition \u00e9videmment inadmissible, savoir, que Rose est devenu propri\u00e9taire de la somme de trois mille piastres en autant que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait est irr\u00e9gulier L'omission de quelques-unes des conditions l\u00e9gales dun d\u00e9p\u00f4t peut bien changer Ia nature des obligations du d\u00e9positaire, mais elle n'a certainement pas l'effet de le rendre propri\u00e9taire de la chose d\u00e9pos\u00e9e Le contrat peut alors suivant les circonstances se transformer en un mandat obligeant le d\u00e9positaire \u00e0 remettre ou \u00e0 rendre compte de la somme re\u00e7ue. Ce consid\u00e9rant est en outre contraire \u00e0 la preuve qui constate que du moment que Rose a touch\u00e9 cette somme loin de s'en consid\u00e9rer le propri\u00e9 taire il en a fait au contaire une entr\u00e9e dans les livres de compte constatant que la somme qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis par MM. Crawford et Lockhart provenait de la succession Sweeny. La lettre d'envoi ne lui conf\u00e9 rait ni droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ni de jouissance dans cette somme. L'entr\u00e9e qu'il en a faite prouve bien qu'il l'a compris ainsi. De plus l'employant presqu'aussit\u00f4t \u00e0 l'acquisition, comme ii a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 dit, d'actions souscrites ii est vrai par lui-m\u00eame, mais en fid\u00e9icommis (in trust), ne conservait-il pas encore \u00e0 cette somme, le caract\u00e8re d'un d\u00e9p\u00f4t on du moins d'une somme d'argent \u00e0 raison de laquelle il reconnaissait n'avoir aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et dont il ne pouvait disposer qu'au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'autres personnes.\nSon mandat \u00e0 cet \u00e9gaird n'est pas bien formel mais la lettre d'envoi en contient assez pour faire comprendre que ces fonds ne lui \u00e9taient transmis que pour \u00eatre plac\u00e9s au profit des h\u00e9ritiers. Il n'y a certainement pas d'autre conclusion \u00e0 tirer de cette lettre, surtout par rapport \u00e0 l'appelante. En effet, si ces deniers n'avaient pas Ct\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s pour \u00eatre plac\u00e9s, pourquoi MM. Crawford et Lockhart auraient-ils pris la pr\u00e9caution de recommander \u00e0 Rose de se procurer de suite les preuves de l'\u00e9tat civil de Mlle Sweeny. Non seulement ces deniers \u00e9taient sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais ils devaient \u00eatre places pour elle Il est bien vrai comme le dit l'hon. Juge Rainville que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait est irr\u00e9gulier par\u00e9e que l'obligation de garder les deniers et de les restituer en nature n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e \u00e0 Rose. Mais quelle peut \u00eatre ha cons\u00e9quence de cette omission, serait-ce de rendre Rose propri\u00e9taire. Il est certain que non d'apr\u00e8s ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus haut. Et d'ailleurs le but que se proposait \u00e9videmment l'appelante n'\u00e9tait pas de confier la garde de ses deniers, mais bien de les faire placer ainsi que je l'\u00e1i d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit. Pour bien appr\u00e9cier ha convention des parties, ii ne faut pas perdre de vue le but qu'elles avaient. En faisant application aux faits de cette cause de l'autorit\u00e9 suivante de Duranton on est forc\u00e9 de conclure que ce n\u2019est pas un d\u00e9pot qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, mais un mandat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 Rose. Au vol. 18, n\u00b0 12 apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9fini le d\u00e9p\u00f4tt ii dit;\u2014\nEt puisque le but principal du contrat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t est la garde de la chose remise \u00e0 ce titre, il n'y aurait pas de d\u00e9p\u00f4t, mais quelque autre contrat dans le cas o\u00f9 les parties se seraient principalement propos\u00e9, par leur convention et la remise d'un objet, quelque autre but que la simple garde quand bien m\u00eame elle se trouverait secondairement comprise dans les obligations do celui \u00e0 qui la chose serait confi\u00e9e, ainsi que cela a lieu souvent dans le cas d'un mandat et dans d'autres cas encore \u2022 ce serait un mandat avec une autre esp\u00e8ce de contrat selon les circonstances du fait; car dit le jurisconsulte Ulpien dans la loi ([9]), c'est toujours au but principal que se sont propos\u00e9 les parties entart\u00e2tes, qu'il faut s'attacher: unius cujusque contractus initium spectcwdum, est; l'auteur continue en citant plusieurs cas de cette transformation d'un d\u00e9p\u00f4t imparfait en un autre contrat qui n'attribue aucunement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose remise \u00e0 celui qui l'a re\u00e7ue.\nSuivant cette autorit\u00e9, ii faut conclure que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t irr\u00e9gulier dans le cas actuel s'est transform\u00e9 en un\ncontrat de mandat, et ce qui serait encore plus conforme aux faits, c'est qu'il n'y a eu des l'origine qu'un contrat de mandat et non pas un contrat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t, et que Rose \u00e9tait un mandataire et non un d\u00e9positaire et que tout ce qu'il a fait pour l'appelante l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 en la premi\u00e8re qualit\u00e9. Dans le cas m\u00eame o\u00f9 Rose ne serait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant eu un mandat r\u00e9gulier, ii est impossible de ne pas le consid\u00e9rer au moins comme le negotiorum gestor de l'appelante. S'il n'a pas eu des l'origine instruction sp\u00e9ciale de faire des deniers qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis, l'emploi qu'il en a fait, ii est du moins constant qu'il les a re\u00e7us, quills appartiennent \u00e0 l'appelante; qu'il en a fait le placement pour elle, quoique pas nomm\u00e9ment; qu'aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s l'achat des actions ii en a transmis le certificat \u00e0 l'appelante et qu'il lui a fait remise des dividendes. Son ing\u00e9rence, en supposant qu'elle ne fut pas autoris\u00e9e, le place dans la position au moins d'un negotiorum gestor responsable de ses actes envers l'appelante. Mais par la ratification de ses actes l'ing\u00e9rence de Rose est devenue sujette \u00e0 toutes les obligations d'un mandataire r\u00e9gulier envers son mandant. Cette ratification est prouv\u00e9e bien positivement par l'acceptation par l'appelante du certificat que Rose lui avait transmis pour constater l'achat des actions et par la r\u00e9ception des dividendes pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Ces faits constituent certainement une ratification formelle de l'emploi des deniers qui a fait na\u00eetre entre l'appelante et Rose les m\u00eames obligations que s'il y avait eu un contrat de mandat r\u00e9gulier des l'origine. En cons\u00e9quence de ce qui proc\u00e8de, je reconnais qu'il n'y a pas eu de d\u00e9p\u00f4t r\u00e9gulier,\u2014mais que la lettre de MM. Crawford et Lockhart est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir la preuve d'un mandat de g\u00e9rer pour l'appelante, et que dans tous les cas l'ing\u00e9rence de Rose, son emploi des deniers, la transmission du certificat des actions\u2014la r\u00e9ception par l'appelante du certificat et des dividendes out \u00e9tabli entre eux les obligations de mandant et de mandataire.\nOn a fait objection \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de Ia preuve testimoniale sur le principe que ni le contrat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t ni le contrat de mandat ne peuvent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 par t\u00e9moins. Ce principe est certain, mais ne s'applique pas \u00e0 la gestion d'affaires. La preuve testimoniale \u00e9tait done admissible pour prouver tons les faits d\u2019ing\u00e9rence do Rose. En outre, lorsqu'il y a un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, la preuve testimoniale peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue pour compl\u00e9ter la preuve du contrat du mandat Dans los deux cours cette preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ill\u00e9gale et c'est principalement pour ce consid\u00e9rant que la Cour du Bane de la Reine a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Je regrette d'avoir \u00e0 dire que je ne puis accepter cette Conclusion. Non seulement je crois qu'il y a un ccommencement de preuve par \u00e9crit suffisant, mais je trouve qu'il y a une preuve compl\u00e8te du fait que los actions en question n'appartiennent ni a Rose ni \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Celle-ci en les acceptant et Rose en les remettant (in trust) en fid\u00e9icommis ont tous deux admis que ces actions n'appartenaient ni \u00e0 l'un ni \u00e0 l'autre. Cette d\u00e9claration formelle faite par \u00e9crit doit avoir son effet, et si elle n'indique pas l'appelante comme propri\u00e9taire, elle ne laisse plus an moins \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que la question d'identit\u00e9 do la personne du propri\u00e9taire Ce fait mat\u00e9riel do liidentit\u00e9 pouvait sans doute \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 par t\u00e9moin, apr\u00e8s l'admission des deux parties qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas. los propri\u00e9taires. Il ne restait done qu'\u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre l'incertitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard par l'insertion des mots in trust. Cette incertitude est-elle, comme l'a dit l'hon. Juge do la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, une raison suffisante pour faire attribuer \u00e0 Rose la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ces actions? La r\u00e9ponse est dans l'\u00e9crit m\u00eame, o\u00f9 Rose dit qu'il no les d\u00e9tient pas pour lui. Sil s agissait d'un meuble ordinaire r\u00e9clame par diff\u00e9rentes parties, regarderait-on comme suffisante pour en priver le v\u00e9ri table pro\u00fcri\u00e9tarre et l'attribuer \u00e0 ceux qui le r\u00e9pudie raient, la raison qu'on ne peut distinguer auquel des r\u00e9clamants ils appartient. On essaierait sans doute avant cela d'en chercher par la preuve testimoniale, le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire. Cette d\u00e9claration in truss qui suit les actions depuis leur premi\u00e8re origine jusqu'aux transports fait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, constitue un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit suffisant non seulement contre Rose mais aussi contre l'intim\u00e9e qui a fait la m\u00eame d\u00e9claration par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son agent Buchanan; ainsi ii \u00e9mane des deux parties, et il n'y a pas lieu de discuter la question de savoir si n'\u00e9manant que de Rose ii pouvait aussi servir contre la banque. Les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans le factum de l'appelante \u00e9tablissent clairement cette proposition d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e dans le vol 5 p. 88, No. 7 de Lacombi\u00e8re, des Obligations.\nUn \u00e9crit est cens\u00e9 \u00e9man\u00e9 de la personne \u00e0 laquelle on l'oppose, lorsqu'il \u00e9mane de son auteur ou de son mandataire.\nAu surplus cette objection ne pouvait \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, m\u00eame s'il n'y en avait contre elle, comme contre Rose, le m\u00eame commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, pour la raison que l'appelante n\u00e9tait pas partie aux transactions entre Rose et l'intim\u00e9e, et qu'il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de se procurer une preuve \u00e9crite d'un acte qui se faisait en fraude de ses droits. L'art. 1233, par. 5, 0.0, est positif sur ce point. La preuve testimoniale pouvait donc \u00eatre admise:\u2014\n10 Parce que les faits du negotiorum gestor qui par la ratification se transforment en mandat, peuvent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s par t\u00e9moins.\n20. Parce que l'appelante n'\u00e9tant pas partie aux transactions faites \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment il ne lui \u00e9tait pas tenue de se procurer une preuve \u00e9crite.\n30. Parce qu'il y a dans l'insertion des mots in trust un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit \u00e9manant de Rose et de l'intim\u00e9e, suffisant pour faire admettre la preuve testimoniale.\nLes actions dont ii s'agit sont sans doute d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 387, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme meuble, mais elles ne sont pas dans tous les cas sujettes \u00e0 l'effet de l'art. 2268 d\u00e9clarant que la possession d'un meuble corporel, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire fait pr\u00e9sumer le juste titre. Quoique l'article ne semble viser que les meubles corporels je ne contesterai pas la proposition avanc\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e que les actions aux porteurs doivent, pour leur transmission, en certains cas, \u00eatre assimil\u00e9s, \u00e0 la transmission des meubles corporels. Mais les auteurs, quelques-uns m\u00eames de ceux cit\u00e8s par de savant conseil de la Banque intim\u00e9e, reconnaissent qu'il y a des exceptions aux quelles ce mode de transmission ne peut s'appliquer. Marcad\u00e9 ([10]) en fait ainsi la distinction dans le n\u00b0 12.\nC'est seulement aux moubles individuels que s'applique la prescription instantan\u00e9e do notre art. 2289. Les universalit\u00e9s ou quote-part d'universalit\u00e9s, aussi bien mobili\u00e8res qu'immobili\u00e8res, n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises qu'\u00e0 la prescription trentenaire, et l'expos\u00e9 des motifs d\u00e9clare explicitement que cette r\u00e8gle est maintenue.\nMais notre disposition no s'applique m\u00eame pas \u00e0 tous les meubles individuels; ello s'applique seulement a ceux qui s'acqui\u00e8rent par transmission purement manuelle et pour l'ali\u00e9nation desquels un \u00e9crit n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nApr\u00e8s avoir fait voir que l'art. 2279 s'aplique aux actions au porteur, et aux billets de banque, ii conclut ainsi qu'il suit:\nIl faut donc dire que l'article s'applique aux meubles mat\u00e9riels et \u00e0 ceux qui sont repr\u00e9sentons par un signe mat\u00e9riel au moyen duquel on obtient la valeur: on un mot, \u00e0 tous les biens meubles qui se transmettent do la main \u00e0 la main.\nPour le transport des actions dont ii s'agit ii y avait des formalit\u00e9s \u00e0 remplir. Ces actions ne sont pas au porteur; elles ne peuvent \u00eatre transport\u00e9es que par un \u00e9crit fait dans les livres de la compagnie et sign\u00e9 par les parties. Elles ne sont donc pas susceptibles d'\u00eatre transmises de la main \u00e0 la main. L'intim\u00e9 ne peut en cons\u00e9quence opposer l'art. 2268. M\u00eame d'apr\u00e8s cet article l'appelante aurait droit de prouver sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et de prouver les vices de la possession et les vices du litre de la banque. C'est ce qu'elle a amplement fait en prouvant sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des actions, et l'acceptation du transport par 1 intim\u00e9e en face de la d\u00e9claration qu'elle achetait ou prenait en gage la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'autrui. Cette transaction si on Ia consid\u00e8re comme vente, est encore nulle d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 1487, comme \u00e9tant la vente de la chose d'autrui.\nLe conseil de l'intim\u00e9e a fait une tr\u00e8s savante dissertation pour \u00e9tablir la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du transport de ces actions fait \u00e0 la banque comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale. C'est-\u00aa-dire que m\u00eame si elles appartenaient \u00e0 l'appelante, Rose pouvait valablement les mettre en gage. Cette proposition exigerait un examen s\u00e9rieux et approfondi pour \u00eatre combattue. Mais heureusement que ce travail est tout fait et que la question est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la plus haute autorit\u00e9 judiciaire de l'empire, celle de la camb\u00e9e des Lords si\u00e9geant comme cour d'appel. Ce haut tribunal n'est pas ii est vrai notre cour de dernier ressort comme le Conseil Priv\u00e9, mais dans la d\u00e9cision que j'invoque City Bank v. Barrow ([11]), ii s'agissait de d\u00e9cider d'apr\u00e8s le code civil, B.C. Ainsi la discussion si compl\u00e8te qu'on v trouve et Ia d\u00e9cision rendue dans cette cause de la doivent avoir sur ce r>oint toute la force d'une autorit\u00e9. Le cas \u00e9tait beaucoup plus favorable que le cas actuel, car celui qui avait mis les articles en gage avait le pouvoir de les vendre tandis que Rose n'avait ni le pouvoir de vendre ni celui de mettre en gage. Comme ii serait trop long de faire une analyse de ce rapport. Je ne donnerai qu'un extrait du pr\u00e9ambule du rapport et un court extrait des motifs de lord Selborne:\nWhen there is a power, by law, to sell, a purchaser may obtain from the vendor, even as against the true owner, a good title, but that cannot extend, by implication, to a pledge Held, that under the circunstances of the case Bonnell could not under any law. English or Canadian, claim to be a factor or agent of Barrow, entitled to pledge Barrow's goods, and that, consequently, the bankers could not set up any title to the goods, as derived from him, against the real owner.\nA la page 669, lord Selborne dit:\nIf there are two things, in fact and in law, which it is easy to dis tinguish from each other, I should have said that those two things were, sale and pledge Not only in the nature of the case are there these differences, but there is no system of jurisprudence which does not recognize them. In this very Canadian Code there is a whole chanter on the subject of sale. It begins by thus defining a sale \" Sale is a contract by which one party gives a thing to the other for a price in money which the latter obliges himself to pay.\" And there is another chapter on the subject of pledge which begins: \" Pledge is a contract by which a thing is placed in the hands of a creditor, or, being already in his possession, is retained by him with the owner's consent, in security for his debts.\" bach of those subjects is pursued in details, in a series of clauses carefully and throughout distinguished from each other. Not only is it so in this Canadian Code, but it is generally so in others, certainly in the French Code and in the text writers upon the French law which deal with these two things very much in the way in which they are dealt with in Canada. Therefore, to say that when there is power given by law to sell, when a purchaser has by law a good title under circumstances particularly defined, that power extends by implication to a pledge, and the pledge will have a good title also, is an assumption for which neither reason nor authority has been, nor I think can be, alleged.\"\nSi, comme on le voit d'apr\u00e8s cette autorit\u00e9, celui qui l\u00e9galement le pouvoir de vendre n'a pas celui de mettre en gage, \u00e0 plus forte raison celui qui, comme Rose n'avait aucun autre pouvoir que celui d'un man dataire, ne pouvait-il mettre en gage la chose de son mandant.\nEn r\u00e9sume je suis d'avis que les actions en question sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante et que l'intim\u00e9e les ayant ill\u00e9galement acquises, elle est tenue d'en con sentir une r\u00e9trocession tel que demand\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens. HENRY J. I think it is clear from the evidence that Rose had in his possession, and it is unimportant in this case how he came by it, certain money belonging to the appellant and that he invested it in the stock of the Montreal Rolling Mills Company in his own name, but i in trust,\" and that for two or three years he collected dividends and paid them over to the appellant Miss Sweeny. Whether he was instructed by her to invest the money is immaterial, because, after it was invested, she ratified the act, and became virtually the principal, and not only entitled to be considered as such, but liable to all the incidents attending that position; and if the company had failed, it is clear she would have become a contributory for unpaid stock, and obliged to contribute to the payment of what is due to creditors under such circumstances Rose held that stock as her trustee.\nThe hank claims it was transferred to them absolutely by Rose, but in order to sustain that defence it would be necessary for them to prove that he was not only a trustee to hold, but also that he had authority to sell.\nThere is no pretence that he had authority from the plaintiff to convey or sell that stock. But even if he had the power of dealing with or selling it at all, that would not authorize him to transfer it to another party in payment of a debt which he owed. She, therefore, is entitled, to all intents and purposes, to claim the value.\nBut we are told it was held by him \"in trust \" and that the cestui que trust for whom he held was not named. That, I think, is immaterial, the stock was shown to have been held by him i in trust \" for somebody and the bank knew that fact and they, under such circumstances, must be held to have known that they were taking from him, in payment of his debt, what belonged to another. I consider it amounted to a fraudulent transaction for the bank to take the stock from Rose, knowing that he did not own it. I would consider such conduct discreditable on the part of any moneyed institution. Independently of that, they have shown no right to hold the stock by the transfer from him. If the principal can show that he was entitled to the property he can always take advantage of the illegal act of transfer of property by his agent, and if Rose took the stock improperly in his own name without any qualification, having used the money of the appellant to purchase it, she would be entitled to come into court and make him transfer it to her. I think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the appellant declared entitled to rank for the amount she claims.\nTASCHEBEAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The remittance of the money by Sweeny's agent to Rose did not, as held by the Superior Court, create a contract of depot irregulier ([12]). If Rose's act in investing this money in these shares had not been ratified by Sweeny, he would have been, supposing there was no proof of a mandate, a negotiorum gestor, acting under a quasi contract. In that case, no commencement of proof in writing would have been necessary. Article 1233 C C.\nIt is evident, however, that this money was sent to him to be invested for and in Sweeny's name. This seems to me an irresistible inference of fact in the case. Demolombe ([13]). For what else was this money sent? Then, there was subsequently a complete ratification by Sweeny of this investment, first, by her accepting the certificate of these shares in lieu of her money, and, secondly, by her receiving, during over eight years, the dividends. thereon. Rose was then a mandatary, and a commencement of proof in writing was, perhaps, necessary to prove the mandate, though both the mandator and the mandatary admit it. Did the plaintiff adduce such a commencement of proof? She has produced and holds the only certificate in writing issued for these shares: this certificate expressly says that these shares were held by Rose for a third person, as mandatary or agent, m nomme procuratures; for the words \"in trust\" can mean nothing else. Can she not, then, prove by oral evidence that this third person for whom Rose got these shares, is herself? There are moreover Crawford's letter to Rose, transmitting him these moneys for the plaintiff, the entries in the books of Rose's firm, and the words \"in trust\u201d added to Rose's name in the register of the Montreal Rolling Mills, which all prove that these shares did not belong to Rose personally; Rose's evidence was then perfectly legal. It was argued for the bank that Rose being Sweeny's mandatary his evidence was objectionable on that ground. But it must be remarked that when he gave his evidence he had long before ceased to be such mandatary.\nThe bank's contention, that a writing sufficient to create a commencement of proof in favor of the plaintiff should have emanated from them and from them alone, is unfounded. It never was possible for the plaintiff to get a writing from the bank in the matter and the law in such a case does not require one: Article 1233 C.C. Laurent ([14]); Bedarride, Dol and Fraude ([15]).\nThen it is not necessary that such a writing should emanate from the adverse party. Pothier, it is true was of a contrary opinion, but the courts in France, in cases before the Code Napoleon, were all against him on this point. Bonnier ([16]); Table Gen. Dev. V. Preuve commencement de ([17]); Marcad\u00e9 under article 1347 ; Dalloz. Vo. Obligations ([18]); Bedarride ([19]); Sebire and Carteret Ency. Be Droit ([20]).\nThe fact that our Code leaves out the qualification of a commencement of proof given by the Code Napoleon demonstrates, it seems to me, that the codifiers must have been of opinion that the last one was new law but that they deemed it better to adhere to the old law.\nMoreover, even if we were to hold that the commencement of proof in writing required is the same for us as the one required by the Code Napoleon, the bank's contention on this point could not prevail because their very title to these shares and the only one on which they can rely to retain them is signed by Rose i in trust,\" that is to say, \" for a third party.\" This constitutes, according to all the authorities, a writing emanating from them. Laurent ([21]); Dalloz V. Obligations ([22]).\nAs to the appellant's contention that the bank may be here taken as the ayant cause of-Rose and that a writing by Rose is, on that ground, a writing by the bank, I would have some doubts, though it is not unsupported by authority. Demolombe, ([23]); Marcad\u00e9 ([24]); Laurent, ([25]); Bedarride ([26]).\nBut there is another aspect of this part of the case. What were the real relations between the bank and Rose? No other, it seems to me than that of a mandator and mandatary as regards the dividends, and pledgor and pledgee as regards the capital. Rose authorized the bank to receive the dividends on these shares for him and transferred to them the capital as a pledge or security. The bank consequently never became the owner of these shares. This appears by their own plea. Now, according tu all the authorities under the Code Napoleon, in fact under the very terms of Art. 1347 thereof, the writing necessary to constitute a commencement of proof may emanate from the person represented by the party against whom the proof is brought. Here the bank is the mandatary and pledgee of Rose, and not only represents him, but they are, in law, as to this, one person. The admissions in writing by Rose that this money belonged to a third person are then sufficient commencement of proof against the bank and in fact are to be held admissions by the bank itself. Dalloz Vo. Obligations ([27]); Aubry et Ran, ([28]); Nimes 1st February, 1870, Dalloz Rec. Per. 1872, 1st part, ([29]); Rolland de Villargue ([30]). I repeat, however, that I do not think it was necessary in this case for the plaintiff to produce any writing by or from the bank.\nThe respondent has referred us to the authorities on pr\u00e9te-noms. But there was no pr\u00e9te-non here. Sweeny nenver authorized Rose to sell these shares either in his name or in her name; and Rose did not buy these shares or transfer them to the bank, in his own name but only as agent. He did not disclose the name of his principal, but he informed the bank, by signing \" in trust \" that it was as agent or mandatary and for a third party, that he was acting. They were put on their guard and were bound to ascertain who the third party was and what was the extent of Rose's powers as such mandatary. Not having done so, they have only themselves to blame if they suffer from having dealt with an unauthorized agent ([31]). Article 1703 C. C. specially enacts that for all acts of alienation and hypothecation the mandate must be express. There was no such mandate here from Sweeny to Rose The original mandate was to invest her moneys. Having done so, his powers as to the capital had lapsed. He was functus officio, art 1755 C. C, and he had no right thereafter to dispose of or deal in any way with this investment without a new authorization or mandate.\nThe law as to factors and brokers, relied upon by the respondent, has no application to this case. Rose was not a factor or broker, neither was he a trader dealing in such securities. It is precisely because the rule is nemo plus juris in alium transferre potest quam ipse habet that the factor's Acts and article 1735 et seq. of our Code were necessary, in the interests of commerce, to legalize sales made by factors and brokers in certain cases. See Per Lord Blackburn, in City Bank v. Barrow ([32]); Clarke v. Lomar ([33]); Johnston v. Lomar ([34]). If Rose had taken these shares in his own name or had transferred them to the bank as owner, even then the plaintiff's contention would probably prevail. The sale of a thing which does not belong to the seller is null says Art. 1487 Co. That such, as a general rule, is the law in regard to the pledge of a third person's property is unquestionable. Before the code, though the sale of another person's property was not null, it was not doubted that a pledge of anything of which the pledgor was not the owner conferred no right as against the owner to the pledg\u00e9e. Cassills and Crawford ([35]). If a debtor, says Pothier Nantissement ([36]), gives as a pledge what does not belong to him, the owner may revendicate it, though the pledgee is not paid. I refer also to Troplong du Nantissement ([37]) and Masse ([38]); Moor v. Lambert ([39]). The authorities of Troplong Nantissement ([40]) and other commentators who are of opinion that now in France, in virtue of art, 2279 of the Code Napoleon, the sale or pledge of a thing belonging to a third party is valid when the vendee or pledgee could reasonably and without any doubt believe that the vendor or pledgor was really the owner, cannot apply here. In the first place our corresponding art 2268 different in this from the French Code applies expressly to corporeal movables only secondly, it applies only to purchasers in good faith: Troplong, Prescription ([41]) and authorities cited in the Belgian edition. And thirdly, under our article, possession of a movable is not ( per se) a title, but only a presumption of title. The owner of a moveable is, within three years from the loss of his possession, always admitted to reclaim it by proving the defects of the possession of any one who detains it. The article and the codifiers expressly say so. Supplementary Report ([42])\nUpon these last three grounds also must fall the contention raised by the bank at the argument that the appellant cannot recover the said shares without reimbursing the advances they made upon them. There are, however, two additional, and to my mind decisive, reasons which militate against the bank on this point. The first one is that there is no plea on the record raising the issue the second is that the bank's plea is not that they made advances on these shares but only and as against them this is conclusive that these shares were transferred to them as collateral security for advances previously made.\nThe case of the City Bank v. Barrow ([43]) is it seems to me in point even if the bank here could be considered as having acquired these shares in good faith. It was there held that the Art 1498 0 0 and the words, \"nor in commercial matters generally,'' in Art. 2268, cannot be interpreted as legalizing, in the general sense contended for by the respondents here, the pledge of a thing belonging to a third party, even in commercial matters It was also there held that these articles do not apply to the contract of pledge. Upon this last point it must be remarked here that though by the Act 42-43 Vic. chap. 18 (Q.) the said articles now undoubtedly apply to the contract of pledge, yet the bank in the present case cannot take advantage of that statute, because they got these shares from Rose before its sanction.\nThe case of Fawcett and Thompson (1), cited by the respondent, has no application; there the purchase had been made in good faith in the usual course of trade.\nAppeal allowed with costs (2).\nSolicitors for appellants : Keer, Carter & Goldstein.\nSolicitor for respondents : Robertson, Ritchie &c Fleet.\n[1] 100 Mass.

(PLAINTIFFS PAR REPRISE D'INSTANCE)\nRespondent.\n1884: Mar 11; 1885: Jan 12\nPRESENT Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nMaliciousprosecution\u2014Action for libel\u2014Slander--Prescription\u2014Arts. 2262 and 2267 C. U. \u2014 Proceedings instututed to remove plaintiff from position of commissioner of Expropriations\u2014Cross appeal \u2014Application to hear although principal appeal not field.\nOn the 14th April, 1868, S. and two others, B. and M., were named joint commissioners to name the amount which should be accorded, for expropriation of property required for widening one of the streets in the city of Montreal.\nOn the 7th August, 1868, the appellants, in consequence of an award made by S. in reference to said property, passed a resolution charging him with fraud and partiality, and an application was made on their behalf to the Superior Court to have him removed from the office of commissioner.\non the 17th September, 1870, the conclusions of the petition were granted on the ground that the commissioners had committed an error of judgment in the execution of their duty as commissioners, and had proceeded on a wrong principle in estimating the amount payable for the expropriation. The charges of fraud and partiality were held unfounded.\nOn the 20th of September, 1873, the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) re-instated the said S. and B. in their position as commissioners.\nOn the 4th November, 1876, this judgment was confirmed by the Privy Council.\nIn May. 1871, S. brought an action against the defendants for damages which he alleged he had suffered in consequence of his having been unjustly removed by the appellants from the position of commissioner. The respondents, widow and daughters of the late S., became plaintiffs par reprise distance.\nThe appellants pleaded that the action was barred under Arts. 2262 and 2267 C. C. (P.Q.)\nThe Superior Court dismissed the action on the 31st May, 1880 but the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) reversed the judgment and allowed $3,000 damages to the respondents.\nHeld. on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Fournier J. dissenting, that the action was not an action merely for the libel contained in the resolution of the 7th August 1868 but for a malicious prosecution in following up that resolution by proceedings instituted in the courts, maliciously and without any just cause, and prescription did not begin to run until the termination of such proceedings. The action, therefore, and judgment for damages should be sustained, no objection having been raised that the action was prematurely brought.\nPer Strong, J.\u2014Following the practice adopted in the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, where they either increase or lessen the amount of damages according to their appreciation of the facts, the damages in this case should be increased to, $10.000.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court which had dismissed the plaintiffs action, and awarding $3,000 damages to the present respondents ([1]).\nFrom this judgment the appellants appealed and the respondents filed a cross appeal claiming a larger amount.\nThe facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the head note and judgments hereinafter given.\nRoy Q. C, and Doutre Q.C. for appellants, contended:\n1st. That the plaintiff's action was barred by the pre-scription of one year.\n2nd. That the expressions use in the resolution and in the petition above mentioned were not in themselves libelous and actionable\n3rd. That no malice could be attributed to the city whilst there existed a probable and reasonable cause for their proceedings in August, 1868.\n4th. That it had not been shown that the original plaintiff was entitled to damages at the hands of the city, and that, in reality, it was not proved that he suffered any.\nOn the question of prescription the learned counsel cited and relied on Arts. 2262 2267 C.

Brown prepared for the Privy Council\nThe appellant's counsel on the cross appeal contended that under the state of things fully argued, both as to the law and the facts on the principal appeal. the amount of damages awarded by the Court of Queen's Bench to the present appellants on cross appeal was inadequate. That under the general circumstances of the case, and the evidence of special damage, more should have been allowed them than was done.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The action in this case is not an action for libel but the complaint is that the defendants caused a resolution to be passed, whereby they instructed the attorney of the corporation to apply by summary petition to the Superior Court to stay the proceedings of the defendant and his co-commsssioners appointed in the matter of expropriation for the widening of St. Joseph street in front of the property of the Honorable Charles Wilson, and to remove and replace the said two commissioners. who, in their opinion, forfeited their obligations as such commissioners; that the resolution was calumnious libellous and injurious to the fair name and reputation of the plaintiff, and that they did file and present to Mr. Justice Berthelot, on the 10th August, 1868, a petition reciting the resolution, and averring certain proceedings, intentionally, maliciously omitting to mention certain subsequent proceedings of defendant and his co-commissioners, and alleging other matters inconsistent with the proper discharge of the duty by the co-commissioners, and that they had not fulfilled the duties in a faithful, diligent and impartial manner and prayed that the proceedings of the commissioners should be stayed and defendant and J Brown should be removed from the office of commissioners as having violated and forfeited their obligations. The declaration then alleged that \"the said resolution and the said petition were false, malicious and libelous, and that the allegations therein contained are false, and were made only with a view to injure the character and good name of the plaintiff, and to conceal the negligence of the defendants throughout the said herein above-recited proceedings before the said commissioners.\"\nAnd after alleging specifically the falsity of certain statements it alleges;\u2014That all the allegations in the said petition referring to the proceeding of the sixth day of August, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, were and are injurious, insulting, libelous and calumnious.\nAnd after specifying on their falsities the declaration averred:\n\"And it is absolutely false that the plaintif has been at any period of time, or was under pecuniary obligations to the said Charles Wilson, as falsely alleged in the said petition, and it is false that the plaintiff did not fulfill his duties of commissioner in a faithful and Impartial manner and without fear or favor.\n\"That the said defendants never had any probable or reasonable cause for adopting the said resolution, or for filing the said calumnious, wicked and malicious petition against the plaintiff in this cause, and that they never had any trust-worthy or positive information\u2019s of any kind to justify them in so doing.\n\" That the said defendants did not prove any of the accusations in the said petition or resolution contained, and that they even did not bring a single witness to substantiate the same and did not and could not make them good, such accusations being utterly false and calumnious as aforesaid. \"That by a judgment rendered on the said petition, by the honorable Judge Berthelot, on the seventeenth day of September last, past (1870), the said accusations and charges so brought by the defendants against the plaintiffs were in fact declared false without foundation or probable cause, and were rejected in fact as such by the said judge.\n\"That the plaintiff is an honest and respectable citizen and has always enjoyed a high character of respectability and the confidence of his fellow citizens; that in his capacity of civil engineer and architect he has often been and is yet entrusted with the management of many important affairs; that he has often been invested with the office of trust honor and profit, both in his capacity of engineer and that of architect aforesaid.\n\"That the said false and calumnious accusations and charges were of a nature to injure, and did in fact gravely injure the high character, good fame and reputation of the plaintiff, and put in danger the confidence hitherto reposed in the plaintiff by the public and his friends, and have also greatly hurt the feelings of the plaintiff, and during more than two years kept him in suspense and anguish, under the said accusations and charges pending the said petition; that, moreover, the said plaintiff has lost a great deal of time and expended large sums of money in defending himself against the said accusations and charges, and has suffered damage to the amount of twenty thousand dollars for all the causes and reasons aforesaid which sum he has right to claim and deserves to have from the defendants.\n\"Wherefore the said plaintiff prays that the said defendants may be adjudged and condemned to pay to the plaintiff the sum of twenty thousand dollars currency as damages for the reasons above-mentioned with interest and costs, distraits to the undersigned.\"\nThis then is not an action of libel but it is an action for falsely, maliciously and without any reasonable or probable cause instituting certain proceedings against plaintiff calculated to injure the plaintiff, and which accusations and charges the defendants failed to prove or even to bring a single witness to substantiate and which by the judgment of Mr. Justice Berthelot on 17th Septembre, 1870 were declared false and without foundation or probable cause, and were rejected in fact as such by the said judge and subsequently by the Court of Appeal, and finally by the Privy Council.\nJudge Berthelot, on 17th September, 1870, held that plaintiff and Brown had committed an error of judgment in adopting a wrong principle as to the damages; but held that there was no proof of fraud or partiality or want of diligence and fidelity, and dismissed the commissioners for want of diligence. The Court of Appeal 20th February, 1878, negative fraud and reversed the judgment as to dismissing the commissioners. On the 11th November the Privy Council confirmed the judgement of the Court of Appeal, holding there was no proof of fraud &c and that the principle adopted by the two commissioners was not erroneous, and therefore the inference of want of diligence failed.\nThe complaint is simply that the defendants maliciously and without any reasonable or probable cause instituted legal proceedings with a view to the dismissal of the plaintiff and his co-commissioners\u2019 from the office of commissioners on false charges of partiality, corruption and improper conduct in the discharge of their duties as such commissioners, by means of which improper proceedings and false charges the plaintiff was damnified.\nUntil the termination of the legal proceedings how could it be established whether the complaints of the defendants were well or ill-founded, whether the allegations could be proved or not ? The defendants had the right to go on and prove them if they could.\nThe court of first instance treated this case as an action for libel, and held it prescribed after one year from the day when the knowledge of the alleged libel came to the plaintiff tinder arts. 2262 and 2267 of the Civil Code.\nThe Court of Appeal considered that as the matter was still in course of litigation the arts. 2262 and 2267 did not apply, and the action was not prescribed. The matter complained of continuing up to the rendering of the judgment, 17th March, 1870, and, the courts having found that there was no proof of the frauds and misconduct alleged, necessarily found that the proceedings were without reasonable or probable cause, and therefore properly inferred malice, but which until the termination of the suit remained an open question.\nNo objection has been taken that the present action has been prematurely brought, and as to prescription as regards the charges of fraud they were not disposed of and terminated till the decision of the Court of Appeal of 20th of September, 1873, their appeal to the Privy Council, decided in November, 1876, being only on the ground of the assessment having been made on a wrong principle.\nI think the judgment of the court below should be affirmed and the present appeal dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Springle, now represented in this case by the respondent, his widow, and the tutrix of his minor children, was a statutory officer, appointed under a statute of the Province of Quebec providing for an expropriation of lands in the city of Montreal for the purpose of widening streets, and he was charged with a judicial duty as a valuator of the lands so required to be expropriated. Whilst in the exercise of this duty he was accused of corruption and venality in office, in an application made to a judge of the Superior Court who had, by the statute, power to remove him. Upon investigation, and after hearing evidence and argument, it appeared that the only ground for this charge put forward by the ' present appellant, was, that there was a general feeling on the part of the public that the award was for too large an amount. The judge before whom the complaint was heard, the late Mr. Justice Berthelot, on the 17th of September, 1870, decided this charge of venality in favor of Springle., holding that the evidence disclosed no ground for the accusation of the city council. This concluded the proceedings so far as it was sought to remove Springle on the ground of corruption and venality. Mr. Justice Berthelot, however, on another ground, did pronounce judgment of amotion; his decision on this other ground was appealed against by Springle, but no appeal was taken by the present appellants from the learned judge's decision, dismissing the charge on the ground of corruption. On the hearing of the appeal it was allowed by the Court of Queen's Bench and from that decision the city appealed to the Privy Council, without, however, including in their appeal the charge of corruption originally made, but confining it to the same grounds as those which were dealt with in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe present action was instituted by Springle on the 4th of May, 1871. I am of opinion that this was in sufficient time, and that no prescription operated tu bar the action. No action could have been maintained until after the judgment of Mr. Justice Berthelot dismissing the application to remove so far as it was based on charges of corruption. In saying this I do not consider that I am acting merely on a technical rule of English law but on one which for conclusive reasons, must be of universel application. These reasons are well stated in a recent case ([49]) in the House of Lords by Lord Selborne L.C. as follows:\nAn action for a malicious prosecution cannot be maintained until the result of the prosecution has shown there was no ground for it. And it is manifestly a matter of high public policy that it should be so; otherwise, the most solemn proceedings of all our courts of justice civil and criminal, when they have come to a final determination settling the rights and liabilities of the parties, might be made themselves the subject of an independent controversy, and their propriety might be challenged by actions of this kind.\nThe gross nature of these charges, the fact that not the least evidence was advanced in support of them, and the conclusion of the proceedings in Springle's favor, are sufficient to warrant a presumption of malice, and the action being in the nature of an action for malicious prosecution I am of opinion that it was sufficiently proved; and nothing being shown on behalf of the appellants to rebut the inference of malice, and to show that there was any probable cause for the charge made the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The Court of Appeal were, therefore, quite right in allowing the appeal, and their judgment must be affirmed with costs\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Les Intim\u00e9s par reprise d'instance repr\u00e9sentent James Key Springle qui avait poursuivi la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al en dommages pour l'adoption do proc\u00e9d\u00e9s dens le conseil do la dite cite et dams la cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district do Montr\u00e9al pour le faire destituer comme commissaire en expropriation, pour cause de fraude et de partialit\u00e9 dans l'exercice des fonctions de sa charge.\nLa d\u00e9claration apr\u00e8s avoir all\u00e9gu\u00e9 la nomination du dit Springle comme commissaire conjointement avec Thomas Storrow Brown, pour d\u00e9terminer la compensation \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 l'honorable Charles Wilson pour certains terrains requis pour l'\u00e9largissement de la rue St. Joseph, expose les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s qui eurent lieu devant les dits commissaires pour en arriver \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision. C'est sur ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s que le conseil de ville se fonda pour adopter \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution suivante:\nThat their attention had been called to the extraordinary award recently declared by two of the Commissioners, (meaning the Plaintiff in this cause and the said Thomas S. Brown) appointed in the matter of expropriation for the widening of St. Joseph Street- in front of the property of the Honorable Charles Wilson and that the exorbitant amount, awarded by the majority of the commissioners in that case, was such as to require in their opinion that steps should be adopted immediately to stay the proceedings in the interest of the public, and they therefore instructed the attorney of the Corporation to apply by summary petition to the Superior Court, or to a judge thereof, to stay the proceedings and to remove and replace the two Commissioners whose award is complained of and who, in their opinion, forfeited their obligations as such commissioners\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette r\u00e9solution, des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s furent pris le 10 ao\u00fbt 1868 devant l'honorable juge Berthelot au moyen dune p\u00e9tition contenant la r\u00e9solution ci-dessus et d'autres graves accusations pour demander la destitution du dit Springle comme commissaire. Apr\u00e8s quelques autres all\u00e9gations expliquant la conduite des dits commissaires la d\u00e9claration continue comme suit:\nThat the said resolution and the said petition were false, malicious, and libelous, and that the allegations therein contained are false and were made only with a view to injure the character and good names of the Plaintiff and to conceal the negligence of the Defendants, throughout the said herein above recited proceedings before the said commissioners.\nCette d\u00e9n\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des accusations port\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9solution et la p\u00e9tition est suivie d'une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation sp\u00e9ciale de chacune des accusations sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9solution et la p\u00e9tition, avec l'addition qu'elles sont injurieuses, outrageantes et calomnieuses.\nLa d\u00e9claration contient en outre la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation de l'existence de cause raisonnable ou probable pour l'adoption de la dite r\u00e9solution et la pr\u00e9sentation de la dite p\u00e9tition:\nThat the said defendants never had any probable or reasonable cause for adopting the said resolution, or for fyling the said calumnious. wicked and malicious petition against the Plaintiff in this cause, and that they never had any trustworthy or positive informations of any kind to justify them in so doing.\nIl est ensuite all\u00e8gue que, par le jugement rendu le 17 septembre 1870 par l'honorable juge Berthelot, toutes les accusations port\u00e9es contre les dits commissaires furent d\u00e9clar\u00e9es fausses et sans aucune cause raisonnable on probable.\nJ'ai cru devoir citer quelques parties de la d\u00e9claration, afin de faire voir, d'apr\u00e8s la nature de ces all\u00e9gations, quel doit \u00eatre le v\u00e9ritable caract\u00e8re de l' action de l'Intim\u00e9. Est-elle, comme le dit l'honorable juge Caron dans ses notes dans la cour du Banc de la Reine: \"une demande par Springle pour 220,000 d\u00e9dommages s soufferts, en cons\u00e9quence de son injuste destituiion \"comme commissaire en expropriation \" ? Ou bien n'est-ce pas, comme le pr\u00e9tend l'Appelante, une action fond\u00e9e sur le libelle contenu dans la r\u00e9solution et la p\u00e9tition du conseil de ville, pour r\u00e9paration du dommage cause par les expressions injurieuses de ce libelle.\nIl est \u00e9vident que si les accusations contenues dans la r\u00e9solution \u00e9taient fausses, elles constituaient un libelle; et que si le conseil de ville n'eut donn\u00e9 aucune suite au projet de demander la destitution des commissaires, 1 offense commise par l'adoption de cette r\u00e9solution aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrite par le laps d'une ann\u00e9e, suivant l'art. 2262. Mais cette r\u00e9solution \u00e9tant n\u00e9cessaire pour autoriser la poursuite, doit, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la premi\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure dans cette action; les deux doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un seul et m\u00eame acte. Bien que la r\u00e9solution et la p\u00e9tition contiennent un libelle\u2014ce n'est pas la punition de ce libelle que Springle a demand\u00e9e par son action\u2014c'est la r\u00e9paration des dommages pour une poursuite malicieuse deman- dant sa destitution en invoquant le libelle comme base de cette demande, Ceci me para\u00eet clairement r\u00e9sulter des parties ci-dessus cit\u00e9es de la d\u00e9claration et surtout de la suivante :\nThat the said defendants never had any probable or reasonable cause for adopting the said resolution, or for fyling the said calumnious, wicked and malicious petition against the Plaintiff in this cause, and that they never had any trustworthy or positive informations of any kind to justify them in so doing.,\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je consid\u00e8re l'action en cette cause comme ayant pour but d'obtenir le montant des dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 Springle par la poursuite malicieuse en destitution intent\u00e9e par l'Appelante an moyen de sa p\u00e9tition \u00e0 cet effet.\nSi cette mani\u00e8re d'appr\u00e9cier la nature de l'action est correcte, ii s'en suit que la prescription \u00e0 opposer \u00e0 la 1r\u00e9sente action n'est pas celle de l'art. 2262, C. C, contre les injures verbales on \u00e9crites mais bien celle de l'art, 2261 C. C, limitant \u00e0 deux ans la prescription \"pour d dommages r\u00e9sultant de d\u00e9lits et quasi d\u00e9lits, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d autres dispositions applicables.\nPour d\u00e9cider la question de prescription ii faut d'abord \u00e9tablir \u00e0 quelle \u00e9poque remonte le droit d'action, car la prescription a d commencer avec la naissance de ce droit, \u00e0 moins que la loi n'ait fait une exception an cas actuel. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que pr\u00e9tend l'Intim\u00e9 en all\u00e9guant que la litispendence sur la p\u00e9tition demandant la destitution des commissaires a en l'effet d'interrompre la prescription. Dans ses notes sur cette cause, l'honorable juge Caron pose ainsi la question:\nQuand Springle devait-il poursuivre ?\nDu moment qu'il pouvait \u00e9tablir qu'ils avaient agi par malice. Il lui fallait donc attendre le r\u00e9sultat du proc\u00e8s engag\u00e9 sur leur requ\u00eate.\nC'est ce qu'il a fait et je crois qu'il a eu raison.\nAvant le jugement en dernier ressort sur cette requ\u00eate le demandeur Springle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 do prouver aucun dommage. Car ce jugement rendu le 17 septembre 1870, a r\u00e9ellement constat\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9futable que les accusations contenues dans la la requ\u00eate des Intim\u00e9s \u00e9taient calomnieuses puisque les requ\u00e9rants n'avaient pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 les prouver.\nLe droit des demandeurs d'obtenir des dommages a done \u00e9t\u00e9 en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 suspendu, jusqu'\u00e0 ce jugement qui a \u00e9tabli d'une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive que M. Springle n'avait pas forfait (forfeited) \u00e0 ses obligations comme commissaire \u00e9valuateur et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 Un employ\u00e9 fid\u00e9le des Intim\u00e9s.\nLa prescription annale de l'art 2262 de notre Code Civil ne pouvait donc courir que de ce jour-l\u00e0 contre Springle.\nCette proposition de l'honorable juge que le droit d'action en dommage, pour r\u00e9paration d'un d\u00e9lit, comme dans le cas actuel est suspendu jusqu'au jugement d\u00e9finitif et sur la poursuite malicieuse qui donne lieu \u00e0 l'action en dommage est-elle conforme au droit de la province de Qu\u00e9bec c Je ne le pense pas. Les autorit\u00e9s que l'honorable juge a cit\u00e9es \u00e0 l'appui de cette proposition sont tir\u00e9es d'auteurs qui traitent de cette action telle qu'elle est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par le code d'instruction criminelle francais qui n'a ici aucune application.\nEn France l'action civile en r\u00e9paration du dommage cause par un d\u00e9lit est unie \u00e0 l'action publique et se poursuit devant le tribunal lui-m\u00eame saisi de l'action publique. On ne trouve dans le code Napol\u00e9on aucune disposition concernant la prescription de cette action. Cette mati\u00e8re est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par le code d'instruction criminelle qui \u00e9tablit la prescription contre les crimes et d\u00e9lits et les actions civiles qui en r\u00e9sultent. Les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par l'honorable juge Caron sont fond\u00e9es sur les articles suivants du Code Criminel art 637:\nL'action publique et l'action civile, r\u00e9sultant d'un crime de nature \u00e0 entra\u00eener la peine de mort, ou des peines afflictives perp\u00e9tuelles ou de tout autre crime emportant une peine afflictive ou infamante, se prescriront apr\u00e8s dix ann\u00e9es r\u00e9volues, \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 le crime aura \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, si, dans cet intervalle, il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucun acte d'instruction ni de poursuite. S'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans cet intervalle des actes d'instruction ou de poursuite non suivi\\s du jugement, l'action publique et l'action civile ne se prescriront qu'apr\u00e8s dix ann\u00e9es r\u00e9volues, \u00e0 compter du dernier acte, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard m\u00eame des personnes qui no se, aient pas impliqu\u00e9es dans cet acte d'instruction ou de poursuite\nArt. 638:\nDans les deux cas exprim\u00e9s en l'article pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et suivant les distinctions d'\u00e9poque qui y sont \u00e9tablies, la dur\u00e9e de la prescription sera r\u00e9duite \u00e0 trois ann\u00e9es r\u00e9volues s'il s'il s'agit d'un d\u00e9lit de nature \u00e0 \u00eatre puni correctionnellement\nL'article 640 r\u00e9duit \u00e0 un an ces prescription en mati\u00e8re de contravention\nAinsi, d'apr\u00e8s le code d'instruction criminelle, le d\u00e9lai de la prescription est fix\u00e9 parles artilles 637. 638 et 640, \u00e0 dix ans trois ans ou un an suivant la nature du fait incrimin\u00e9.\nMais lorsqu'il s'agit d'un d\u00e9lit civil ou d'un quasi d\u00e9lit, (dit Laurent) ([50]) la prescription est do trente ans, d'apr\u00e8s le droit commun, auquel ii n'est pas d\u00e9rog\u00e9 pour les faits dommageables ([51]). Si le fait constitue un d\u00e9lit criminel, on suit les r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales qui r\u00e9gissent l'action civile.\nSourdat dit la m\u00ebme chose ([52]):\nOr nous avons vu que l'action civile qui na\u00eet des d\u00ealits incrimin\u00e9s parla loi p\u00e9nale, est sumise quant \u00e0 la prescription, \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales. Mass quand l'action na\u00eet d'un d\u00e9lit purement civil, elle n'est r\u00e9gie par aucune loi particuli\u00e8re, elle tombe sous l'application do l'article 2262\u2014et ne se prescrit, par cons\u00e9quent, que par trente ans, \u00e0 dater du jour o\u00f9 le fait dommageable s'est accompli. Tant que le dommage caus\u00e9 peut \u00eatre constat\u00e9, et qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 couvert de l'action en r\u00e9paration par ce laps de temps, celui qui l'a souffert peut en poursuivre l'indemnit\u00e9, quelque long qu'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 son silence.\nToutefois je dois dire que cette doctrine est contest\u00e9e et qu'il y a des d\u00e9cisions qui la r\u00e9pudie. Mais, pour les fins de cette cause ii n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire plus que de mentionner la contrari\u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinions et la diff\u00e9rence entre le droit fran\u00e7ais et le n\u00f4tre sur cette question. Cette question de prescription en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9lits et quasi d\u00e9lits se trouve ainsi r\u00e9gl\u00e9e en France, bien diff\u00e9remment de notre code. Lorsqu'il s'agit d'un fait incrimin\u00e9 c'est aux articles 637 633 et 640 du code d'instruction criminelle qu'il faut avoir recours; si au contraire c'est un fait dommageable mais non incrimin\u00e9, c'est alors le cas d'appliquer l'art. 2262.\nPeut-on sous le Code Civil do la province de Qu\u00e9bec faire application au cas actuel de l'une ou de l'autre de ces prescriptions du code fran\u00e7ais? Il est clair que non. Aucune disposition du code d'instruction criminelle de France ne peut avoir force de loi chez nous Quant \u00e0 la prescription de 30 ans on ne peut l'invoquer non plus parce que notre code a, sur ce sujet, une disposition formelle, qui n'existe pas en France. 11 y a \u00e0 ce sujet dans le Code Napol\u00e9on une lacune qui n'existe pas dans le n\u00f4tre. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9e par l'art. 2 261 d\u00e9coctant quo \" l'action se prescrit par deux ans dans les cas suivants; parag. 2. Pour dommages-r\u00e9sultant do d\u00e9lits et \"quasi d\u00e9lits, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'autres dispositions applicables.\" Il n'y a pas dans le Code Napol\u00e9on d'article correspondant \u00e0 celui-ci qui a introduit un droit nouveau. Cet article no faisant aucune distinction entre les d\u00e9lits incrimin\u00e9s et ceux qui no le sont pas doit recevoir son application dans tous les cas o\u00f9 il s'agit de dommages r\u00e9sultant de d\u00e9lits on quasi d\u00e9lits quelle que soit leur nature.\nL'action en dommage naissant du fait de poursuite malicieuse dont se plaint l'Intim\u00e9 est \u00e9videmment comprise dans cet article et soumise \u00e0 la prescription qu'il introduit, parce que les termes en sont g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et absolus et qu'il n'existe aucune prescription contre cette action.\nMais on a pr\u00e9tendu en cour inf\u00e9rieure que la prescription dans le cas actuel \u00e9tait suspendue pour deux raisons, la premi\u00e8re, parce que la poursuite qualifi\u00e9e de malicieuse n'\u00e9tant pas termin\u00e9e Ia prescription se trouvait suspendue; la deuxi\u00e8me, parce quo le fait dommageable constituait un d\u00e9lit successif.\nQuant au premier do ces motifs il est \u00e9videmment contraire au principe que Ia prescription commence \u00e0 courir du moment que l'action est n\u00e9e. Laurent dit \u00e0 ce sujet: ([53])\nLa prescription des actions personnelles commence du moment ou les actions naissent, parce que c'est \u00e0 raison do la dur\u00e9e de l'action que la loi la d\u00e9clare \u00e9teinte; donc, des qu'il y a action, ii y a lieu \u00e0 prescription, parce que la raison de la prescription existe. L'action c'est le droit exerc\u00e9 en justice et le cr\u00e9ancier peut agir en justice du moment que l\u2019obligation est form\u00e9e.\nAubry et Rau, Troplong, Marcad\u00e9 et tous les autres auteurs cit\u00e9s par l'appelante dans Ia liste suppl\u00e9ment taire d'autorit\u00e9s qu'elle a fournie soutiennent la m\u00eame doctrine, sur laquelle on peut dire qu'il n'y a pas de diff\u00e9rence d'opinion De droit commun le point de d\u00e9part de la prescription \u00e9tant la naissance du droit d'action, ii faut, pour en adopter un autre s'appuyer sur un texte de loi. C'est la disposition de l'art. 2232 C. C., qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te comme droit nouveau\nLa prescription court contre toutes personnes, \u00e0 moins qu'elles ne soient dans quelque exception \u00e9tablie par ce code, ou dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 absolue en droit ou en fait d'agir par elles-m\u00eames ou en se faisant repr\u00e9senter par d'autres.\nL'Appelante n'a ni all\u00e8gue ni d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait dans le cas d'une exception.\nL'Intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que pour prouver la malice qui animait l'Appelante dans ses proc\u00e9d\u00e9s, ii \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d'attendre le r\u00e9sultat du proc\u00e8s engage sur la requ\u00eate en destitution. Cet argument peut-il cr\u00e9er une exception au principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et est-il vrai que la malice me pouvait \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e qu'apr\u00e8s ce jugement ? S'il y a eu malice, elle a exist\u00e9 an moment de l'adoption de la r\u00e9solution du 27 juillet 1868 et de la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition, et n\u00e9cessairement avant le jugement du 7 septembre 1870 par lequel Springle, quoique exon\u00e9r\u00e9 des imputations calomnieuses, \u00e9tait cependant destitu\u00e9 de ses fonctions comme commissaire. Ce jugement ne retranchait ni n'ajourait \u00e0 la nature des faits imputes; il ne faisait que les constater. Cette constatation pou- vait \u00eatre tout aussi bien faite dans l'action en dommage si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s la signification de la requ\u00eate qui constituait le d\u00e9lit de poursuite malicieuse. Aucune circonstance ne pouvait modifier ces deux faits et ce sont les deux seuls qui forment la base de sa demande Il n'y avait done aucune impossibilit\u00e9 d'agir, ni en fait, ni en droit La preuve eut \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi facile \u00e0 faire dans un cas que dans l'autre. En cons\u00e9quence la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'attendre le r\u00e9sultat du premier proc\u00e9s me para\u00eet, avec raison, insuffisante pour faire admettre une exception que la loi n'a pas \u00e9tablie. Springle devait done prendre son action en dommage du moment que le d\u00e9lit dont ii se plaignait avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, car la prescription courait \u00e0 dater de ce moment.\nAvant le Code Civil, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ii a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que cette esp\u00e8ce d'action n'\u00e9tait pas suspendue par la litispendence de celle qui y avait donn\u00e9 origine m\u00eame en mati\u00e8re criminelle Il en \u00e9tait de m\u00eame aussi des poursuites en dommage pour arrestation et saisie-arr\u00eats malicieuses. Las deux poursuites \u00e9taient et sont encore ind\u00e9pendantes l'une de i'autre; elles peuvent se faire en memo temps, ou l'une apr\u00e9s l'autre indiff\u00e9remment\nCette doctrine de la suspension du droit d'action en pareil cas, me parait toute nouvelle et n'a pas, que je sache, \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9e par aucune d\u00e9cision\u2014tandis qu'au contraire, depuis un temps considerable, la jurisprudence des tribunaux a reconnu \u00e0 une partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e soit par une arrestation, soit par une saisie malicieuse ou m\u00eame par les cons\u00e9quences d'un d\u00e9lit ou quasi d\u00e9lit, le droit de porter son action en r\u00e9paration civile, sans attendre le r\u00e9sultat des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s qui out occasionn\u00e9 l'action en dommage Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans la cause de Lamothe et Chevalier et al., en appel, le 17 janvier 1854 par les honorables juges Rolland Panet et Aylwin, qui ont maintenu: \"1 Que dans l'esp\u00e8ce, les termes \u00e9nonciatifs d'un assaut grave sur le Demandeur ne comportait pas une accusation de f\u00e9lonie. 2\u00b0 Que dans le cas m\u00eame o\u00f9 cet assaut aurait Je caract\u00e8re de f\u00e9lonie, le Demandeur peut r\u00e9clamer des dommages sans avoir pr\u00e9alablement poursuivi au criminel, pour l'assaut dont ii se plaint.\"\nEn cour d'Appel l'honorable juge Rolland motiva son jugement dans les termes suivants:\nLa Cour Inf\u00e9rieure a maintenu que les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la demande de l'appelant constituaient une f\u00e9lonie, et qu'on ne pouvait se pourvoir en dommages en semblable cas, avant qu'au pr\u00e9alable cette f\u00e9lonie n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie criminellement. La Cour ici confirme cette d\u00e9cision tant en droit qu'en fait. Nous sommes d'avis que les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ne constituent pas une f\u00e9lonie, et que dans un cas de cette esp\u00e8ce, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'un proc\u00e8s criminel avant que l'appelant pet recouvrer des dommages pour les injures corporelles qu'il avait re\u00e7ues. Le jugement de la Cour Inf\u00e9rieure doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre renvers\u00e9.\nDans ses observations sur cette cause, l'honorable juge Aylwin fait au sujet de la suspension de Ia poursuite civile, la remarque suivante:\nQuant \u00e0 l'exception aux fins de suspendre l'action civile, elle n'existe pas sous la loi qui nous r\u00e9git.\nA l'\u00e9poque de cette d\u00e9cision comme aujourd'hui, la r\u00e8gle \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente en Angleterre; la poursuite criminelle doit pr\u00e9c\u00e9der le recours civil De m\u00eame dans les actions pour poursuite, saisies ou arrestations malicieuses, il est n\u00e9cessaire dans l'action en r\u00e9paration civile d'all\u00e9guer le r\u00e9sultat final de la proc\u00e9dure dont on se plaint. 11 nen a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 de m\u00eame ici, que je sache. Te ne trouve point de d\u00e9cision qui ait fait de cette all\u00e9gation une condition n\u00e9cessaire pour porter l'action en dommage. Je trouve des d\u00e9cisions remontant \u00e0 une \u00e9poque \u00e9loign\u00e9e qui ont maintenu le contraire. Dans les Stuarts Reports, ([54]) on volt que la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans le cas de saisie-arr\u00eat simple malicieuse comme suit That it is not necessary to set forth on the declaration, that the action in which the arrest was made has been terminated.\nDans le Robertson's Disgest on trouve qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 decide dans la cause de Dagenay vs Hunter ([55]),\nThat a plaintiff may, for an assault, proceed against the defendant by action and by indictment.\nDans le m\u00eame, aux mots malicious arrest, dans la cause de Boyle vs Arnold, ([56]) il\\ a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 '.\nThat, in an action, for a malicious arrest upon a capias ad respon dendum on the ground that the Defendant was about to leave the province, it is not necessary to allege in the declaration, that the action in which he was so arrested has been decided.\nLa cause de Pacaud vs Price, d\u00e9cid\u00e9e le 18 juin 1870, en appel est parfaitement analogue \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente. Le Demandeur Pacaud r\u00e9clamait des dommages r\u00e9sultant des \u00e9critures calomnieuses et diffamatoires que l'Intim\u00e9 Price et son fr\u00e8re avaient faites sur le caract\u00e8re, la r\u00e9putation et l'honneur de l'Appelant dans une cause devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pour le district d'Arthabaska, dans laquelle ils \u00e9taient Demandeurs contre Th\u00e9ophile Cot\u00e9, secr\u00e9taire tr\u00e9sorier de la municipalit\u00e9 du comt\u00e9 d'Arthabaska, la corporation du township de Chester-Ouest et l'Appelant,\u2014 D\u00e9fendeurs. Par cette action, les Price demandaient la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte de vente que le dit Th\u00e9ophile C\u00f4t\u00e9 avait consenti \u00e0 l'Appelant, le 3 avril 1860 du lot de terre n\u00b0 12, rang Craig-Sud, dans le township de Chester-Ouest.\nPacaud, l'Appelant, intente de suite contre l'Intim\u00e9 Price une action en dommage dans laquelle il d\u00e9clarait que toutes les accusations de fraude prof\u00e9r\u00e9es contre lui \u00e9taient mensong\u00e8res et obtint, le 26 novembre 1867, devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure une condamnation de $800 de dommages contre Price Le jugement fut renvers\u00e9 en cour de Revision. mais r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 par la cour d'Appel \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9. Pans cette cause l'Intim\u00e9 Price avait soulev\u00e9 par exception temporaire la question de la suspension de cette action pour attende le r\u00e9sultat de l'action dans laquelle il s'\u00e9tait rendu coupable des calomnies reproch\u00e9es. La cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait rejet\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention par le consid\u00e9rant suivant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que du moment que les dites injures et imputation de . fraude out \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le d\u00e9fendeur en la pr\u00e9sente cause et par le dit Richard Price par leur d\u00e9claration et leur factum\u2014le Demandeur en la pr\u00e9sente cause, sans \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 d'attendre qu'il y eut un jugement final sur l'action intent\u00e9e devant cette cour en ce district par le Defender en la pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e cause et le dit Richard Price, contre le Demandeur en la pr\u00e9sente cause, le dit Th\u00e9ophile Cot\u00e9, et la dite corporation du township de Chester-Ouest, et qu'ainsi l'exception plaid\u00e9e par le D\u00e9fendeur en la pr\u00e9sente cause intitul\u00e9 exception temporaire p\u00e9remptoire en droit, est mal fond\u00e9e.\nCe motif fut adopt\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine.\nL'analogie entre les deux causes est parfaite Les faits reproch\u00e9s et servant de base \u00e0 ces actions out \u00e9t\u00e9 dans les deux cas, commis dans des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s judiciaires, et sont absolument de m\u00e9me nature. La seule diff\u00e9rence qu'il y a et elle n'est gu\u00e8re en faveur de l'Intim\u00e9e c'est que dans cette cause, au lieu de prendre une action pour diffamation conforme \u00e0 la nature des accusations dont on se plaint, on a sans doute, pour \u00e9viter la difficult\u00e9 de la prescription annale, qualifi\u00e9 l'action en cette cause d'action en dommage r\u00e9sultant de poursuite malicieuse. La qualification donn\u00e9e n'y fait rien, c'est par la nature des faits all\u00e8gues que l'on doit juger du caract\u00e8re de l'action.\nAu fond ce n'est qu'une action pour libelle, et Springle n'avait pas d'autre sujet de reproche contre l'Appelante. On ne pouvait lui contester son droit de demander la destitution pour cause d\u2019 incomp\u00e9tence, par exemple, si la requ\u00eate n'e\u00fbt contenue que ce motif, est-ce que Springle aurait eu droit de se plaindre? Il est \u00e9vident que non; le seul grief qu'il ait, ce sont les imputations faites contre son caract\u00e8re. Elles constituent un libelle pour lequel ii aurait du poursuivre. Mais ayant laiss\u00e9 passer les d\u00e9lais de la prescription, il esp\u00e8re en \u00e9viter la cons\u00e9quence en pr\u00e9sentant son action sons un autre aspect. Si on la consid\u00e8re comme une action pour libelle, elle est prescrite par un an en vertu de l'art. 2262; si, au contraire, on la consid\u00e8re comme demandant Ia r\u00e9paration du dommage cause par une poursuite malicieuse, elle est alors prescrite par l'art 2261 Cette prescription, quoique n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e, est une de celle que le juge doit suppl\u00e9er en vertu de l'art. 2267. C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui a renvoy\u00e9 cette action.\nIl reste maintenant \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le deuxi\u00e8me moyen invoqu\u00e9 pour emp\u00eacher la prescription de courir, savoir, que les faits reproch\u00e9s constituent un d\u00e9lit successif. Il est reconnu qu'en cas de d\u00e9lit de cette nature la prescription ne commence \u00e0 courir que du moment que le d\u00e9lit a cess\u00e9. Mais qu'est-ce qu'un d\u00e9lit successif? Masson ([57]) le d\u00e9finit ainsi:\nOn appelle d\u00e9lits successifs ceux qui se renouvellent et se perp\u00e9tuent par une s\u00e9rie d'actes ou dans une s\u00e9rie d'instants. On les appellent ainsi par opposition aux autres d\u00e9lits qui s'accomplissent par un seul fait et qui se consomment dans un seul instant\nIl ajoute qu'il n'est pas toujours facile dans la pratique de savoir ce qu'il faut consid\u00e9rer comme d\u00e9lit successif. Il en donne pour exemple le fait de ne pas faire la d\u00e9claration exig\u00e9e par la loi pour la publication d'un journal. On a jug\u00e9 que l'infraction \u00e0 cette obligation constitue un d\u00e9lit successif, parce que l'infraction et se r\u00e9p\u00e8te tant que la d\u00e9claration exig\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produite. Sourdat ([58]) en donne comme exemple la d\u00e9tention arbitraire le d\u00e9lit dure aussi longtemps que subsiste la d\u00e9tention La Cour du Bane de la Reine a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, dans la cause de Grenier vs. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al ([59]), que des travaux qui font affluer l'eau sur le terrain d'un voisin constitue un d\u00e9lit successif\nIl est \u00e9vident qu'il n'y a aucune analogie entre ces faits reconnus comme constituant des d\u00e9lits successifs et celui de prendre une action qui s'accomplit \u00e0 l'instant de l'\u00e9manation de l'action. S'il y a d\u00e9lit, ii est alors complet et aucune proc\u00e9dure ni aucun fait post\u00e9rieur n'ajoute \u00e0 sa gravit\u00e9 on ne la diminue. On ne peut pas. dire que l'Appelante prenait une nouvelle action, on commettait un nouveau d\u00e9lit chaque fois qu'il \u00e9tait fait un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans son action. Si cet argument avait quelque force la cour du Bane de la Reine l'aurait admis dans la cause de Pacaud vs Price en d\u00e9clarant que le d\u00e9lit dont se plaignait l'Appelant ne pouvait \u00eatre consisid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme accompli qu'\u00e0 la fin du proc\u00e8s, et que le Demandeur n'avait aucun droit d'action lorsqu'il a intent\u00e9 la demande,\u2014mais elle a au contraire d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lit \u00e9tait complet et que l'exercice du droit d'action ne pouvait \u00eatre suspendu. La cons\u00e9quence de cette doctrine est que la prescription avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir du moment de la production du document incrimin\u00e9e Il est assez extraordinaire que l'on ne trouve pas une seule d\u00e9cision dans nos rapports qui soutienne la doctrine de la suspension du droit d'action. Mais on en trouve au contraire un nombre assez consid\u00e9rable, celles entre autres cit\u00e9es plus haut, qui la r\u00e9pudie. Ces d\u00e9cisions admettant que le 4roit d'action peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendamment du sort de la premi\u00e8re action, reconnaissent par l\u00e0 m\u00eame que le droit d'action est complet, et que partant il eat sujet \u00e0 la prescription.\nPour ces raisons je suis d'opinion que l'appel devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9\u2014 et le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieur r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9.\nHENRY J.\u2014This suit was commenced, in May 1871 by James Key Springle, the original plaintif herein, who died in January, 1877, and the suit has been con-tinned by the present respondents, Mary E. Hall, his widow, and Anna Augusta Springle, one of his daughters It is substantially an action for a false and malicious complaint made by the appellants through which the original plaintiff alleged he had. suffered and sustained serious and heavy damages and losses as complained of in his declaration. It was contended on the part of the appellants that it was but an action for libel and that the time limited by the Civil Code for bringing such an action had expired before the commencement of the action. The declaration, no doubt, charges the appellants with having published a libel against the plaintiff, but it also charges them for a malicious prosecution in the shape of a petition addressed to one of the judges of the Superior Court in the Province of Quebec in 1868 alleging, amongst other things, dereliction of duty and dishonest and improper conduct on the part of the said plaintiff and one Thomas S. Brown, whilst acting as two out of three of a permanent board of commissioners, duly appointed for the appraisement of damages to parties whose lands and premises might be from time to time appropriated for city purposes and for which services the said commissioners were provided to be paid; and praying that certain proceedings referred to in the petition might be stayed and the said commissioners removed from office and replaced\nAfter a general and specific denial of the charges contained in the petition, the plaintiff, in his declaration alleges :\nThat the said defendants never had any probable or reasonable cause for adopting the said resolution (meaning a resolution passed by the defendants on the subject referred to in the petition) or for filing the said calumnious, wicked and malicious petition against the plaintiff in this cause, and that they never had any trustworthy or positive information of any kind to justify them in so doing.\nI think the foregoing charges the defendants as for a malicious prosecution, and alleges the want of reasonable or probable cause. The matter of the petition came to a hearing before Mr. Justice Berthelot, and in September, 1870, he gave his judgment thereon, acquitting the two commissioners complained against of all the charges contained in the petition but removed them from office for, as he says, error of judgment only resulting from an erroneous impression of the law as to expropriation.\nFrom that decision the plaintif appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench and the latter court by its judgment in September, 1873 reversed the judgment of the Superior Court given by Mr. Justice Berthelot as before mentioned.\nFrom the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench the appellants took the case by appeal to the Privy Council, and by a judgment of the latter in November 1876, the appeal was dismissed and the judgment appealed from affirmed.\nThere is abundant evidence, therefore, to establish the allegations in the declaration, and to show that the original plaintiff sustained serious damage by the false charges made against him, which the respondents were unable and did not attempt in the slightest degree to prove.\nThe suit was brought within the prescribed time after the proceedings under the petition were terminated, and I have no doubt that the plaintiff had a good and available cause of action.\nHaving considered the amount of damages awarded, 1 am of opinion that the award of them is not only not excessive, but much less than, under the circumstances, 1 should have awarded.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the court below affirmed with costs\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Two points were urged by the learned counsel for the appellants in support of this appeal.\n1. That, assuming the action to lie, it was absolutely barred under the provisions of articles 2262 and 2267 of the civil code of the Province of Quebec the former of which enacts that actions for slander and libel are . prescribed by one year from the day that it came to the knowledge of the party aggrieved, and the latter, that no action can be maintained after the delay for prescription has expired; and\n2. That no action at all lies against the defendants, the now appellants, under the circumstances appearing in the case.\nIf the present action was one for libel merely, and was founded solely upon the matter which is contained in the resolution of the council of the corporation of the 27th July, 1868, assuming an action founded upon that resolution alone to have lain it must be admitted that it would have been barred by the above articles of the civil code; but this action is not one for libel merely nor is the resolution of the 27th July the sole foundation upon which it is framed. The action is for following up that resolution by a proceeding instituted in the courts, maliciously, as is alleged, and without any probable cause, wherein the defendants, by certain false and scandalous charges of venality and corruption made by them against the original plaintiff, maliciously and without any probable cause endeavored to have the said plaintiff removed from a certain office of profit, and employment of a quasi judicial nature in the pursuit of his profession the effect of so falsely and maliciously prosecuting which proceeding, naturally and in fact, was, to deprive the said original plaintiff almost wholly of the benefit of his profession by branding him as venal and corrupt and unworthy of all trust and confidence, and of being employed in the business of a valuator of real estate which he followed as a profession.\nThe declaration alleges the appointment, under the provisions of the statute 27 and 28 Vic. ch. 60 of the original plaintiff and one Thomas Storrow Brown and one Damase Masson, as commissioners to determine under the statute the price or compensation to be allowed to one Wilson for expropriation of certain property situate in the city of Montreal and required by the corporation for the widening of St. Joseph street, and that after having been duly sworn they proceeded to take the proceedings indicated by the statute for the purpose of valuing the piece of land in question; that the corporation, although applied to by the commissioners declined to produce any witnesses or evidence to contradict that adduced by Mr. Wilson until at length, after an adjournment for the express purpose of enabling the corporation to produce evidence, they produced two witnesses who in so\u2019 far as they gave any relevant evidence corroborated the evidence adduced on behalf of Mr. Wilson. The declaration then states the whole of the proceedings of the commissioners, and that the original plaintiff and Mr. Brown arrived at a preliminary appraisement, in which, however, the other commissioner did not concur and a meeting was called conformably with the provisions of the statute, of the parties interested, and a notification given to such parties that the commissioners would hear them to the end that after the said parties should be heard the commissioners should decide whether they should maintain or modify such preliminary appraisement. It then alleges the reception of such evidence as was offered by the parties interested and the modification of the preliminary appraisement, and a final report of the valuation of the piece of land to be expropriated at the sum of $13666. It then alleges that notwithstanding what is before stated, the council of the city passed the resolution of the 27th July, 1868, authorizing and directing proceedings to be instituted for the purpose of staying all proceedings of the said commissioners, and of having the said original plaintiff and Mr. Brown removed from being commissioners for valuation of the said piece of land as persons who had forfeited their obligations as such commissioners. it then sets out a petition presented to one of the judges of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec by the corporation of the city of Montreal wherein after divers charges of venality and corruption culminating in their having, in violation of their duty as commissioners, made what was charged to be an unjust, excessive and exorbitant valuation in favor of Mr. Wilson under the influence of bribery and corruption, the defendants prayed for an order of the said judge adjudging that the proceedings of the said commissioners should be stayed, and that the said original plaintiff in this action and Thomas S. Brown should be removed from the office of commissioners as having violated and forfeited their obligations. The declaration then proceeds to allege that the said petition and the allegations therein contained are false malicious and libelous and were made solely with the view to injure the character and good name of the original plaintiff; and the declaration charges that the several allegations in the petition, charging the said original plaintiff and Thomas S. Brown with partiality, venality and corruption, are false repeating such charges seriatim, and alleges that the defendants never had any reasonable or probable cause for adopting the said resolution or for filing the said calumnious wicked and malicious petition against the plaintiff in this cause, and that they never had any trustworthy or positive information of any kind to justify them in so doing; that the said defendants did not prove any of the accusations in the said petition or resolution contained, and that they did not even bring a single witness to substantiate the same and did not and could not make them good such accusations being utterly false and calumnious as aforesaid. That by a judgment rendered on the said petition by the honorable Judge Berthelot, on the 17th day of September, 1870, the said accusations and charges so brought by the defendants against the plaintiffs were in fact declared false without foundation or probable cause, and were rejected in fact as such by the said judge. That the said false and calumnious accusations and charges were of a nature to injure, and did in fact gravely injure, the high character, good fame and reputation of the plaintiff, and put in danger the confidence hitherto reposed in tie plaintiff by the public and his friends, and have also greatly hurt the feelings of the plaintiff and during more than two years kept him in suspense and anguish under the said accusations and charges pending the said petition; that, moreover, the said plaintiff has lost a great deal of time and expended large sums of money in defending himself against the said accusations and charges, and has suffered damage to the amount of twenty thousand dollars for all the causes and reasons aforesaid.\nIt is apparent that this declaration discloses what in English jurisprudence is known as an action for malicious prosecution, which consists in the prosecution by the defendant of legal proceedings of a civil or criminal nature against the plaintiff, maliciously and without probable cause, the essential ground of the action being that a prosecution authorized by law, if the grounds which justify its being instituted exist, was carried on without any probable cause, from the absence of which malice may be, and, as said in Johnstone v. Sutton in error ([60]), most commonly is, implied. The meaning of a malicious prosecution is that a party, from a malicious motive and without reasonable or probable cause, sets the law in motion against another; and as the want of probable cause for instituting the legal proceeding com-plained of is the essential foundation for the action, the termination of such proceeding in favor of the plaintiff must be alleged in the declaration.\nBarber v. Lesiter ([61]); Stewart v. Grotmett ([62]); Bas\u00e9b\u00e9 v. Matthews ([63]).\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the period when prescription of such an action will begin to run cannot be until such termination. In this case that period did not certainly arrive before, and it is alleged m the declaration to have arrived, upon the delivery of the judgment of Judge Berthelot in the Superior Court upon the 17th September, 1870, whereby the original plaintiff and Thomas S. Brown were acquitted of the calumnious charges which were made the foundation of the petition, and which in effect were pronounced to be false and without foundation or probable cause; and these gentlemen were adjudged by the court to have acted in the discharge of their duty as commissioners with diligence, integrity and impartiality, although they were removed from their office of commissioners for another cause which, upon appeal, was pronounced by the Court of Appeal to have been unfounded and insufficient and illegal, and this judgment of the Court of Appeal, upon an appeal therefrom by the present defendants to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, has been maintained. As the objection here urged to the maintenance of the present action is that it has been commenced too late, after being, as is contended, prescribed, not that it has been commenced prematurely, it is unnecessary to enquire whether the cause of action as stated in the declaration, was or not made complete by the judgment of the Superior Court, which, while acquitting the parties accused of the accusations prefer- red against them as unjust and unfounded, nevertheless removed them from their office of commissioners to adjudicate upon the special matter submitted to them but for a different cause which was, upon appeal, finally pronounced to have been insufficient, illegal and equally unfounded.\nIt is not pretended that an action will not lie under the French law, which prevails in the Province of Quebec, under the like circumstances as an action for malicious prosecution will lie by the law of England; indeed it is contended that the French law is more liberal that the English in giving redress to a party injured by calumnious accusations, inasmuch as it is contended that in virtue of an ordinance of Francis the First made in 1589, for either a plaintiff or defendant to allege any-thing in any pleading, false and calumnious of the opposite party, is actionable as a libel, and this wholly irrespective of the termination of the action or proceeding in which such calumnious matter is alleged, and even though it be alleged in assertion of a legal right which the party alleging it succeeds in establishing; the sole test of the calumnious matter being or not being actionable, consisting in its being, or not being, proved to be true; and in support of this contention divers passages from the works of Domat, Dumazeau, Dareau, Merlin and others, and a judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Province of Quebec in Pacaud v. Price ([64]) are cited.\nThe authority of this latter case is disputed by the learned counsel for the appellants, who contended that it was not well decided and that it should not be followed, but I do not think we are called upon in this case to determine whether it was well or ill decided, for even if the judgment of the Court of Revision in that case had prevailed, which held that the action in that case did not lie because, in the opinion of that court, although the defendant therein did not, in the action which had been brought by him, prove the calumnious matter alleged by him, he had probable cause for making the allegations complained of, still the present action would be maintainable, as it cannot be, and indeed, in this action, has not been, contended that the defendants had any probable cause for making the calumnious accusations, which they did make, for the purpose of having the original plaintiff and Mr. Brown removed from their office. Although they repeat m their plea to the present action the substance of the charges, they appear to have offered no evidence in support of them. Despairing it may he of being able to establish the truth of the charges in the face of the judgments of the Superior Court and of the Court of Appeals for the Province and of the Privy Council upon the matter of their petition, they rather rest their defense to the present action upon an allegation that they filed the petition, which contained the charges, in the exercise of what they call their legislative and judicial functions, and in the interest of public justice, having no interest whatever in the matter themselves and upon the advice of their counsel and without malice, and the evidence which they have adduced seems to have been confined wholly to the question of damages.\nWhat is meant by the contention that a legal prosecuting founded upon calumnious charges made without any probable cause for making them, is a thing done in the exercise of legislative and judicial functions, I find it difficult to understand. Neither can I appreciate the force of the contention that parties having no interest whatever in a matter brought by them before the courts for adjudication, but who intervene as prosecutors in the interest, as they say. of public justice, can have a right to demand that the courts wherein justice whether public or private, should be dispensed with an equal measure, should, in the interest of public justice, pronounce to be justifiable a prosecution against individuals based upon scandalous, false and calumnious charges made without any foundation in fact or any probable cause for believing them to be true. The defendants, if they could shelter themselves under the plea that what they did was done by them under the advice of their counsel have failed to offer any evidence of such advice. it may be assumed that counsel may have advised, and very probably did advise them, that the charges stated in the petition, if proved, would require the court to grant the prayer of the petition for the stay of all proceedings and the removal of the commissioners who were accused of partiality and corruption, but further than this we cannot go; nor can we read the plea of the defendants as alleging that counsel advised them that they would be justified in making the charges if they knew them to be false or had no reasonable or probable cause for believing them to be true. For the truth or falsity of such very grave accusations, and for their probable and reasonable cause for making them, the defendants must have known, or, at least, must be regarded as having known, that they themselves must be alone responsible.\nThere remains only to be considered the question of malice, and upon this point it is unnecessary to enquire whether the falsity of the charges in itself alone, or coupled with the absence of probable cause, is sufficient conclusively to establish malice. Malice may be, and frequently is, implied from the absence of probable cause, but there is not wanting in this case, I think other evidence from which it may be inferred. A plea of justification of the imputation of calumnious matter upon the ground of the truth of the calumnious matter may be taken into consideration on the question of malice. Wilson v. Robinson ([65]) Now, M the defendants in their plea all\u00e8ge:\nThat the said plaintiff and the said Thomas Storrow Brown refused to concur in the opinion of the said Damase Masson, or in his valuation, and that in consequence thereof the defendants, well knowing that the proposed award of the said plaintiffs and the said Thomas S. Brown was excessive, exorbitant and unjust, and would entail grievous loss upon the property owners to be assessed for its payment in the event of the said proposed award being homologated, protested against the said proposed award of nineteen thousand five hundred dollars; and although no part of said amount, if made payable could be exacted from the said defendants the whole being assessable upon the properties of the persons interested in the said improvements), nevertheless the defendants being by law constituted the civic guardians of the rights of the citizens of Montreal in all such matters felt constrained to and did institute and cause to be instituted, legal proceedings as by their attorney and counsel they were advised would be necessary and proper to prevent the said proposed award from taking effect and from being ratified or homologated by any legal tribunal.\nNow here it is to be observed that the defendants profess to justify their filing the petition for the removal of the commissioners upon the ground of charges of partiality and venality preferred against them as their motive for awarding to Mr. Wilson an amount which the defendants pronounce upon their own knowledge to be unjust, excessive and exorbitant. Yet, despairing, as it would seem, of establishing the truth of the allegation, they offer no evidence in support of it; moreover, it is not unworthy of observation, as pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondents, that the defendants here persist in stating the proposed award to be nine-teen thousand five hundred dollars, although it appears that this sum was a preliminary appraisement subject to review upon evidence being adduced by the parties interested and which was in fact reduced to thirteen thousand six hundred and sixty-six dollars before ever the petition was served and presented to the court and notwithstanding the finding of the court to which the petition was presented, that the accused commissioners were not guilty of the accusations upon which the petition was founded; nor upon the question of malice, do I think that we can overlook the fact that after the Superior Court had acquitted the accused commissioners of the charges of partiality and venality made against them, but had pronounced a judgment removing them from their office for another cause; and after the Court of Appeal had reversed that judgment of removal and had reinstated the commissioners the defendants persisted in their prosecution by appealing from that judgment to the Privy Council for the express purpose of endeavoring to have the judgment of removal reinstated, although the sole grounds upon which the statute authorized them to interfere had been adjudged against them, from which adjudication no appeal was ever taken.\nUnder all these circumstances I think that the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec, which is the only court that has adjudicated upon the merits of the case was justified in concluding that the proceeding against the accused commissioners was instituted maliciously. Upon the question of damages I do not think that a court of appeal should interfere with damages as awarded by a judgment under consideration in appeal, unless they appear to have been calculated upon a wrong principle or arrived at without regard to the considerations which ought to govern a tribunal in awarding damages\u2014neither of which imputations have been or can be suggested here. It is not sufficient that we, if sitting as judges of first instance, might have given, as some of the judges of the court below were disposed to give, much larger damages.\nOur judgment, in my opinion, should be to dismiss the appeal of the defendants with costs, and the cross appeal as to damages without costs, as the costs which have been incurred in the case do not appear to have been appreciably increased by the cross appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Rouer Roy.\nSolicitors for respondents: Barnard & Beauchamp.\n[1][1] 6 Legal News 155\n[2] P. 114.\n[3] 2,Vol. No. 330.\n[4] 2 Vol. p. 169, No. 853.\n[5] Vo.

Stats. Man. Ch. 49 sec. 5.\nThe Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba Ch. 49 sec. 5, enacts as follows ; All the instruments mentioned in this act, whether for 1 the sale, or mortgage of goods and chattels, shall contain such a full and sufficient description thereof that the same may be thereby readily and easily known and distinguished.\nHeld, Strong and Henry JJ. dissenting, that where goods, in a chat-tie mortgage, were described as \u201call and singular the goods, \u201cchattels, furniture, and household stuff hereinafter particularly \u201cmentioned and described, and particularly mentioned and \u201c described in the schedule hereto annexed marked A ; all of \u201c which goods and chattels are now situate lying and being &c.\u201d (particularly describing the premises), without stating that such goods were all the goods on the said premises, there was not a full and sufficient description within the meaning of the above enactment and the mortgage was void as against execution creditors.\nAPPEAL from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Manitoba, refusing to set aside a judgment of the Chief Justice in Chambers upon an interpleader issue.\nThe facts in the case are briefly as follows:\nOne Louisa Black was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $4,000 or thereabouts, and to secure the debt gave the plaintiffs a chattel mortgage on her stock-in-trade. In such mortgage the goods were described as \u201cAll and singular the goods, chattels, furniture and \u201chousehold stuff hereinafter particularly mentioned and \u201c described, and particularly mentioned and described in \u201cthe schedule hereunto annexed marked \u2018A,\u2019 all of \u201c which goods and chattels are now situate, lying and \u201cbeing on the premises situate in a building on the \u201ceast side of Main street, in the said city of Winnipeg, \u201con the Grace Church property, and now being occupied \u201cby the said Louisa Black as a millinery store and \u201cdwelling, which said building may be more particularly known as number two hundred and ninety-one \u201c (291) Main street, in the said city of Winnipeg\u201d\nThe defendants were also creditors of the said Louisa Black, and having obtained judgment on their respective debts issued executions under which the sheriff seized the goods on the said premises, No. 291 Main street. The plaintiffs claimed that the goods seized belonged to them under the said chattel mortgage, and the title to them was tried before the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Chambers, where judgment was given for the defendants, the Chief Justice holding the chattel mortgage void, both under the statute of Elizabeth and under ch. 49 of the Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench refused to set this judgment aside, and the plaintiffs then, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q. C. for appellants.\nLash Q. C. for respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014This is an interpleader issue. The plaintiffs claim the goods, &c, under a chattel mortgage made by Louisa Black, the execution debtor, to the plaintiffs, dated December 15th, 1882, and duly filed in the proper office. The defendants are subsequent execution creditors and claim the goods, & c, under their executions, and, among other things, contended that the mortgage was not executed in good faith and for the express purpose of securing the money due or accruing due to the plaintiffs, but for the purpose of protecting the goods against the creditors of the mortgagor or preventing the creditors of the mortgagor from obtaining payment of any claim against her, and that the goods are insufficiently described, and is therefore void as against the defendants. This issue has been directed to be tried upon the application of the sheriff of the eastern judicial district of Manitoba, The issue was tried before Chief Justice Wallbridge, and judgment was rendered by him for the defendants on 19th February, 1883. On 6th June, 1883, the plaintiffs obtained a rule nisi from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench to set aside the verdict and enter a verdict for the plaintiffs. In following Trinity Term the said court discharged the rule nisi and made the learned Chief Justice\u2019s order barring the plaintiffs\u2019 claim to the goods absolute with costs.\nThe plaintiffs now appeal from the said judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nThe learned Chief Justice who heard this matter in first instance, and the full court on motion to set aside the decision of the Chief Justice, concurred in the holding that the description of the goods, with the exception of a very few insignificant items, does not contain the sufficient and full description of the goods, that they may be easily and readily distinguished, and on that account is void. If it were necessary to distinguish the items which comply with that section they would be found few in number and insignificant in value, and therefore they held the chattel mortgage void.\nBy the 49 Con. Stats, Man. 1880, sec. 5: \u201cAll the instruments \u201cmentioned in this Act, whether for the sale or mortgage of goods \u201cand chattels, shall contain such sufficient and full description \u201cthereof that the same may be thereby readily and easily known \u201cand distinguished.\u201d\nIf from the description given, the articles cannot be readily and easily known and distinguished, it is clear the statute has not been complied with. I do not think the legislature intended to confine this description to the parties by whom it was prepared as between themselves alone, but the discription was to enable the property to be identified as against third parties, creditors or others claiming an interest in the property; this need not be such a description as that with the deed in hand without other enquiry the property could be identified, but there must, in my opinion, be such material on the face of the mortgage as would indicate how the property may be identified if proper inquiries are instituted, as for instance, \u201call the property now in a certain shop, & c.\u201d\nIs the property then in this case described with sufficient certainty to enable it to be distinguished and identified?\nIt may have been the intention to convey all the goods in the store, but the mortgage does not say so, nor is there any evidence to show the goods named in the schedule where the only goods of that description in the store or what were the exact goods in the store, The description is:\n[The learned Chief Justice then read the description of the goods ([1])].\nIf we take the largest items in the schedule I can discover nothing in the description to guide any one in knowing or distinguishing them. In schedule \u201cA\u201d are items especially noticeable amounting to $8,455.\nWhen we come to examine the evidence in the case the insufficiency of the description would seem to be made very apparent.\nDoritty, the agent for the claimants, who obtained the mortgage says:\u2014\nItem one (of chattel mortgage) 22 doz. Spanish net. means 22 doz. yards Spanish net; the price shows it is per doz. yards; the next item, 20 Spanish net, 40 $8; this means 20 yards Spanish net; I know by the price this means yards, and not dozen yards; it would require a knowledge of business to understand the quantities and qualities of the articles; item 3 is, 37 Spanish net, 65c. (in the column of price), means 37 yards of. Spanish net at 65c. per yard; the schedule is such as would be sufficient to a business, man having a knowledge of that description of goods; it would be difficult to a person not having that knowledge ; the mortgagor would know it and the mortgagees would know it; I think Mr. White would understand it; but one not understanding that line, it might be difficult for such a person to understand it; it was prepared by my going to the place and taking notes of the stock; I got some of the prices from Mrs. Black; the annexed list is in my writing; Mrs. Black assisted me as to prices, the prices in wholesale; I got that list without her concurrence, and the prices she gave me on my asking for them.\nAnd again on cross examination:\nDescription of chattel mortgage. \u201cI made the list from memory, I had taken in Mrs. Black\u2019s store from time to time; I did not measure any of the pieces in the store, and no one else did for the purposes of this schedule; the lengths I got from looking at the ends ; they generally run from 9 to 18 yards to the end; I counted the ends by my eye; I ran my eye over the lot in my mind; ribbons not all taken at one time; I may have counted in some twice or may have left out some pieces; the quantities are estimates not measurements and number of yards also and quantity may be more or less; I didn\u2019t think I was a great deal out in my estimate; the prices were put down when I was in the store: I put them down in the warehouse; the retail prices in figures and the cost in characters, and the reverse sometimes; I don\u2019t know how the ribbons were marked. The first item on page three, 22 Spanish net, means 22 yards, not 22 dozen yards.\u201d\nMr. White, referred to by this witness, is called, and he says:\u2014\nLooks at description of the goods in chattel mortgage; it does not contain such sufficient and fall description of the good that the same may be thereby readily known and distinguished. He looks at the mortgage\u2014first item, 2\u00f40 yards ribbon, 10c., $25; cannot tell what colour or quantity, or quality; the quality and width affect the price, colours does not; the price per yard would not show the width, quality or quantity, or colour; ribbons have their individual number, a number which indicates its width, and by its colour is plain; this is the general character of all the items on page one; only two lines in writing the articles, of which there are 30, must be ascertained by evidence outside the bill of sale; first item on page three, this might mean 22 yards or 22 dozen yards; there are some Spanish nets at the price of $2.75 per yard? and also $2.75 per dozen yards, owing to width and quality, 7 on page two; I know what tissue is; 1 could not pick out the tissue in the store from the description given; on page two, the last item, this might be yards, it is a matter of judgment from prices, the quantity would be too large for pieces; it is set down at 50, and may be yards or pieces, I should think yards from the nature of her business; the articles should be numbered this applies to all the articles described in the schedules excepting some on the last page; the last few items are not in my line, being show case, mirror, fixtures and carpet, shop fixtures and stands ; the schedule is generally wanting in information; that the description does not give such description by which they can be easily known, they could not be priced out in a store.\nCross-examined by Mr. Patterson.\u2014I understand the blank lines on the first page to indicate goods of the same character in the written words above them; this does not show what kind, quality or colour; and the first six lines on the second page, and four lines on the third page, under the word \u201c crimp,\u201d that means crimp crape. The item on third page (8 blank), under \u201cbraided dresses,\u201d I don\u2019t think that means \u201ceight black braided dresses\u201d for the reason that Mrs. Black\u2019s business would not enable her to keep those 8 and 2 (=10) on hand; also from my knowledge of her stock. I saw coloured braided dresses there; I think the schedule means them. The dresses are not braided, it is the trimmings. Three blank lines more underlines; I can tell whether coloured, black or white. I don\u2019t know the quantity in that store on fourth page, and on all the other places three blank lines generally they would indicate similar articles to the one named above. On page two, 85 plush and satin, I would, knowing the business, know it meant yards, but a stranger would not; the place where yards is written is of assistance to me in interpreting its meaning. On page three, item of cream silk, wht, snow flake and spt net, $300 too indefinite to distinguish them 120 yards gossamer silk if no other than I did tell it, but not of more than 120 yards, would put to eight or ten pieces; birds, ornaments\u2014twenty birds, $225\u2014that may mean birds from 20c. to 810 each; each stand bore its own box, is numbered, and each has its own number, $225.\nThis is all the evidence that bears on the description of the goods, and I cannot under this evidence say the judges in the court below were wrong in holding that there had not been a compliance with section 5, ch. 49 of the Consolidated Statutes, Manitoba. As between the parties, difficulty may not be likely to arise, but the statute is to protect creditors and subsequent purchasers from uncertainty in regard to identity. If so, how can it be said that the description in this schedule, if as to many of the articles a description it can be called, was sufficient and full, that the articles proposed to be conveyed could thereby be readily and easily distinguished. The statute is a wise one and should be so construed so as to make it effectual.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the evidence of pressure was amply sufficient to establish that the security impeached was not given by way of voluntary preference, such as the Con. Statutes of Manitoba, ch. sec. 96, avoids. That enactment is a transcript of that on the same subject contained in R. S. Ontario, ch. 118, sec. 2, and numerous cases have decided that a security of this kind obtained by a creditor as the result of pressure is not an illegal preference within the provision in question.\nThe objection that the goods are not sufficiently described, that is, that the mortgage did not contain such a sufficient and full description of the chattels mortgaged that the same might be readily and easily known there-by as required by the 5th sec. of the Chattel Mortgage Act of Manitoba, also fails. Numerous cases decided in Ontario under a statute precisely similar ([2]) have held such a description sufficient, and were I to hold otherwise I should overrule this long line of cases, which I am not prepared to do. Moreover, even if the question was res Integra, I should not be disposed to consider this an insufficient description, for it seems to me that giving the statute a fair and reasonable construction it is here sufficiently complied with, and that to hold otherwise would be in effect to make it impracticable to give an effectual chattel mortgage upon property of this description, a stock of goods contained in a shop or store, the business of which was actually going on. For if this description does not suffice it would be in effect to require that in all such cases there must be an actual change of possession which would of course compel the stoppage of the business.\nThe American authorities decided on enactments corresponding in terms with that under consideration, sustain the view that the goods were here sufficiently described, and that it is not essential that they should be set forth with such particularity as to be capable of being identified by the written description in the mortgage without aid from any parol or extrinsic evidence, nor need the description be such as to enable a stranger to identify the articles without any aid from other evidence ([3]). In any case, even when the description is of the most minute kind, such assistance must be sought from extrinsic evidence to identify and ascertain the property comprised in the mortgage, and therefore it has been held in the American courts that it is sufficient that the mortgage points out the subject matter of it so that \u201c a third person by its aid, together with the \u201caid of such enquiries as the instrument itself suggests,\u201d may identify the property covered.\u201d When these conditions are complied with I am of opinion that the deed may be said to embrace a description of the articles sufficiently full and certain to enable them to be readily and easily distinguished. This is, I think, what was done in the present instance.\nThe decision of the court below should be reversed and the rule nisi discharged.\nFournier and Taschereau JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. HENRY J.\u2014I think the statute would be sufficiently satisfied by a general description such as \u201c all the goods\u201d in a certain store, properly locating it, and a detailed description of them is in such a case altogether unnecessary, because the particular store being ascertained the description covers all the goods with as much certainty as if each article were specified and described. If, however, to a general description is added a detailed one by description of the articles and quantities of different kinds of goods, and that there are more goods of that particular kind than mentioned, and from which the others could not be distinguished, none at all, I take it, would be covered either by the general description or the detailed one. In the absence of such a difficulty to ascertain what is meant, or which particular kind is meant, I think the transfer would be good. For instance, a man gives all the horses in his stable and all the cows, and he gives five calves, and there are found to be ten there, it would not cover the five because you could not tell which five of the ten was meant to transfer, and so with these ribbons. The transfer says all the clothing that is there, and then gives the number of yards. I think in such a case that would be covered by a bill of sale, but where a difficulty would arise in selecting out of larger quantities specific articles a reduced quantity or number, then I take it none would pass. A mistake in the description, however, of certain goods would not invalidate the sale of the whole, which, if it had not been for that particular description, would have been good. I think under the circumstances, then, that the bill of sale was good to the extent of the goods that were in that building, that would not be subject of difficulty in ascertaining, as I before stated. I think the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Paterson, Baker & MacLean\nSolicitors for respondents Wolff & Co.; Ewart, Bodwell. & Wilson.\nSolicitors for Respondents McKinnon & Proctor: Bain, Blanchard & Mulock.\n[1] See p. 131.\n[2] Harris v.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT ON NOVA SCOTIA.\nGrant to Township\u2014Land for school\u2014Charitable trust\u2014Acceptance of by trustees\u2014Discretion of trustees\u2014Doctrine of Cy pres.\nBy the patent or grant of the Township of Cornwallis, in Kings Co., N. S., made in 1761, four hundred acres of land were declared to be \"for the school.\" By a subsequent grant from the Crown in 1790, the said four hundred acres were declared to be vested in the Rector and Wardens by the name of the Church of Saint John, in the said Township, and the Rector and Wardens of the said Church for the time being \"in special trust, to and for the use of one or more school or schools, as may be deemed necessary by the said Trustees, for the convenience and benefit of all the inhabitants of the said Township of Cornwallis, and in trust that all schools in said Township furnished or supplied with masters qualified, agreeably to the laws of this Province, and contracted with for a term not less than one whole year, shall be entitled to an equal share or proportion of the rents and profits arising from said school lands, provided the masters or teachers thereof shall receive and instruct, free of expense, such poor children as may be sent them by the said trustees.\"\nThe grantees took possession of the land mentioned in said grant, and they and their successors in office have ever since remained in possession of it, and until the year 1873 the rents and profits arising from such land were distributed among the schools of said Township, and poor children sent by the trustees to, and educated in, said schools according to the terms of the trust. In 1873, however, the then trustees discontinued such distribution and allowed the funds realized from said lands to accumulate, the reason alleged therefor being that the schools of the Township had become so numerous that the sum appropriated to each would be too small to be of use, and also, that under the free school system all the poor children of the township were educated free of expense and the object for which such funds had previously been supplied no longer existed.\nThe present defendants were invested with the said trust in 1879, when the revenue of the said lands had accumulated until they amounted to over $1,200. Shortly after they became such trustees it was determined to build a school house in a certain district in said Township with the money. A meeting of the vestry of the church was held and a resolution passed authorizing such school house to be built on land leased from the church; the school was to be non-sectarian, but after school hours any of the children that wished could receive instruction in the doctrines of the Church of England. On a suit to restrain the defendants from using the trust funds to build such school house and praying for an account.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and restoring that of the court of first instance, that the trustees had no discretion as to the application of the trust funds, but were bound to distribute them among all the schools of the Township, which would be entitled to participate under the terms of the trust, however wanting in utility such a disposition of said funds might be.\nHeld also, that the Attorney General of the Province was the proper person to bring this suit.\nHeld, per Strong J. that in interpreting the trust, in order to explain the apparent repugnancy in the grant in providing that the rents were to be distributed among one or more schools, &c., and also among all the schools in the township, the probable condition of the township, in respect to the number of schools therein, at the time the grant was made, coupled with the long continued usage which has prevailed in the manner of administering the trust, could be considered as a rule of guidance for such interpretation.\nHeld also, per Strong J., that under the doctrine of Cy-pr\u00e8s, a reference might be made to the master, to report a scheme for the future administration of the charity.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], reversing the judgment of the Judge in Equity[2] ordering an injunction to restrain the defendants from improperly using the trust funds in question in the suit and a reference to the master for an account of such funds.\nBy the patent or grant of the Township of Cornwallis in 1764, four hundred acres of land were declared to be set aside for school purposes; and by a subsequent grant in 1790, the said lot of four hundred acres was granted to William Twining, rector, and John Burbidge and Benjamin Belcher wardens, of the church of St. John, in said township, and to the rector and wardens of the said church for the time being, in special trust for the use of the school or schools in Cornwallis aforesaid. The habendum of the said grant is as follows:\nTo have and to hold the said parcels, lots or tracts of four hundred acres of land, and all and singular other the premises hereby granted unto the said William Twining, rector of the said Church of St. John, and John Burbidge and Benjamin Belcher, wardens thereof, during their continuances in the said offices respectively, and to the rector and wardens of said Church of St. John for the time being, in special trust to and for the use of one or more school and schools as may be deemed necessary by the said trustees for the convenience and benefit of all the inhabitants of the said township of Cornwallis, and in trust that all schools in said township, furnished or supplied with masters qualified agreeably to the laws of this province and contracted with for a term not less than one whole year, shall be entitled to an equal share or proportion of the rents and profits arising from said school lands, provided the masters or teachers thereof shall receive and instruct, free of expense, such poor children as may be sent them by the said trustees.\nThe said rector and wardens accepted the trust created by said grant, and from that time until the year 1873 the profits realized from the said lands were divided among all the schools in the township of Cornwallis. In 1873, however, the then trustees refused to make such distribution and allowed the trust funds to accumulate, and in 1879, when the present defendants became trustees, they received from their predecessors over $1,200 of trust funds. The reason alleged for not continuing to distribute the funds was, that under the free school system, which had been in operation since 1865, all poor children in the township were, by law, educated free of expense, and the primary object for the expenditure of the trust funds no longer existed; and also, that the schools had become so numerous that the amount received by each on the distribution would be too small to be of use.\nThe present defendants resolved to use the money in their hands to build a school house in a certain section of the township, and this suit was brought to restrain them from so using the funds. The Judge in Equity, before whom the case was heard, granted an injunction and ordered an account to be taken of the rents and profits of the school lands His judgment is reported in Russell's Equity Reports, page 429 The majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia agreed in reversing the judgment of the Judge in Equity, holding that the trustees had a discretion as to the manner of carrying out the trust, and under the altered state of circumstances since the trust was created they had not exercised that discretion unlawfully. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRoscoe for appellants.\nHenry Q.C. for respondents\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In this case I agree with every word of the judgment of the learned Equity Judge. His judgment, in my opinion, should not have been reversed.\nOf course the learned Equity Judge only intended to say that the money is to be distributed among those schools which come within the words of the \"trust,\" that is, in trust that all schools in said township, furnished or supplied with masters qualified agreeably to the laws of the province and contracted with for a term not less than one whole year, shall be entitled to an equal share or proportion of the rents and profits arising from said school lands, provided the masters or teachers thereof shall receive and instruct, free of expense, such poor as may be sent to them by the said trustees. This the learned judge has clearly indicated. I think the judgment of the Supreme Court reversing that judgment entirely wrong, and this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the equity judge restored. STRONG J.\u2014This appears to be a very plain case, and one which may be decided by the application of elementary principles of the law relating to charitable trusts.\nIn the first place, however, it will be well to dispose of an objection in limine to the maintenance of the suit as an information of the Attorney General of the Province of Nova Scotia. I entirely agree with the late Judge in Equity in what he has said upon this head. The Attorney General of the province is clearly the proper officer to sue in respect of all matters having locality in the province. This is a matter having such locality, and no reason has been, or could have been, suggested why the duty of suing in respect of a charitable trust of lands within the province, the objects of the charity being also entirely provincial, should be cast upon the Attorney General of the Dominion. The same point was raised before me in the Attorney General v. Niagara Falls International Bridge Company[3], and for the same reasons as those I there assigned, which apply with even greater force here, I now hold this point to be untenable.\nIt is said the defendants have not the legal estate in the trust lands, since the grant in the deed of the 31st December, 1790, having been to the then rector and church wardens, and the rectors and wardens for the time being, of the Church of St. John in the township of Cornwallis, the only estate which could have vested was a life estate in the immediate grantees, as the rector and church wardens were not a corporation, and that consequently the defendants are not accountable as trustees. Without stopping to enquire whether a grant by the Crown to named persons, described as and actually at the time holding certain offices, and their successors in those offices, does or does not create a corporation by implication\u2014a question for an affirmative answer to which there is considerable authority\u2014it is sufficient here to say, that the letters patent created a valid charitable trust, and that in any case, much more in the case of a charity, a Court of Equity will never allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee. The defendants have assumed to act as trustees, and are such de facto if not de jure, which is sufficient for all the purposes of the relief sought by this information\u2014an injunction to restrain an improper diversion of the trust funds from the legitimate objects of the charity, and an account of the monies received by them from their predecessors and which have since come to their hands as rents.\nAs regards the proper construction of the trust, I also agree with the late Judge in Equity, though this is the most difficult question which the case presents. At first sight there might seem to be a repugnancy between the early and the latter part of the limitations of the trust, the former saying that the trust was to be \"for \"the use of one or more school or schools as might be \"deemed necessary by the trustees,\" and the latter declaring a trust for all schools which should comply with the conditions named. This, I think, coupled with the long continued usage which has prevailed in the manner of administering the trust, is sufficiently explained by an observation in the judgment of Mr. Justice James, who very pertinently points out that there may have been, at the early day at which the grant was made, \"only one school in the township, perhaps not one,\" But for the usage, however, I should have had some doubt as to this, in the absence of any evidence of what the circumstances actually were at the date of the grant. That this is a legitimate mode of interpreting a charitable trust, when there is any ambiguity in its terms, is well established by authority[4].\nThen as regards the conditions imposed with reference to the contracts with the masters, and the free instruction of poor children, it appears that these conditions have been altogether superseded by the general school law of the Province, which makes all public schools free. It follows, that according to the strict terms of the trust, as applied to the existing state of things, the income is divisible amongst all the schools in the township, however wanting in utility such a disposition of the funds might be, and the trustees of their own motion, and without the authority of the court, had no right to make any other application of them; they were consequently guilty of a breach of trust in appropriating the charity funds in their hands to the erection of a school house, and more especially as the building was upon the land of other proprietors.\nIt appears, therefore, that such a decree as the late Judge in Equity proposed to make, and, as I assume, would have been drawn up for the purpose of carrying out his adjudication if an appeal to the full court had not been interposed, would have been perfectly correct so far as it would have enjoined the defendants from laying out any of the trust funds upon the building, and also so far as it would have directed an account of rents received, as well as of the monies handed over by the defendants' predecessors.\nAgreeing, as I do, however, with Mr. Justice Weatherbe, that this is a proper case for the application of the doctrine of cy-pr\u00e8s, and not feeling the difficulty which he felt in administering that relief, I think there may be superadded to the directions I have already mentioned a reference to the master to report a scheme for the future application of these funds. It is said that there are some sixty schools in this township, and a division of the income amongst such a number would be carrying out the general intention of the charity in such a way as to make it useless. It is said by the text writer, already quoted[5]:\nThe doctrine of cy-pres is applied by the Court of Chancery to cases not only where the terms of the gift in trust for charitable purposes are in themselves ambiguous or imperfect, but also where, being originally precise and complete by lapse of time or otherwise, they had become unsuited, under altered circumstances, to carry out the general intentions of the founders.\nThe law as thus laid down, and which is supported by a large number of decided cases, manifestly applies to the present case. The \"altered circumstances\" here require that some new scheme for applying the income of the charity to educational purposes, which was the general intention of the Crown in founding it, should be devised.\nIt is quite clear, on the authorities, that charity informations have always been regarded in courts of equity as exceptional cases, so far as the rules of pleading are concerned, and that in such cases the court will give any relief which may seem to it to be appropriate, although not specifically prayed for. I again refer to Mr. Tudor's book[6] as correctly summarising the law as to this point also. It is there said:\nMany of the formalities of pleading, adopted in ordinary cases, have not been enforced in cases of charities, and it has been laid down by Lord Hardwicke that on an information by the Attorney General for the regulation of a charity it is the business of the court to give a proper direction to the charity without having regard at all to the propriety or impropriety of the prayer of the information. Attorney General v. Jeanes[7].\nThus, if the wrong relief or no relief at all, with regard to particular objects or a particular person, is prayed, the Court of Chancery will nevertheless give proper relief. And a fortiori, when there is a prayer for general relief, proper relief will be given upon an information for a charity without any specific prayer; thus where an information was filed to set aside a lease of a charity estate, and for general relief, Lord Eldon said that it was perfectly settled that the information had prayed quite enough to authorize an account of the rents.\nThe authorities referred to by the writer will be found entirely to bear out this statement of the law.\nThe decree, therefore, in my opinion, besides ordering or continuing the injunction (as the case may be), and directing the accounts already mentioned, should have added to it a reference to the master to report a scheme for the future administration of the charity. There may also, if the Attorney General desires it, be a reference to appoint new trustees As to the costs, the defendants must pay all the costs both here and below up to the decree, but the future costs, as well as the further directions consequent on the master's report, must be reserved to be disposed of by the Supreme Court in Equity, when the cause comes before it on the report.

Reasons for judgment.\nThe Dominion Government having leased certain property in the city of Montreal for the use of Her Majesty with the condition that the Government should pay all taxes and assessments which might be levied and become due on the said premises during the term of the lease, the corporation of the city of Montreal brought an action against the owners of the property for the municipal taxes accruing during the period of time the said property was so leased to and occupied by the Government of the Dominion of Canada. On an intervention fyled by the Attorney General of Canada praying that the action be dismissed:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Strong J. dissenting, that the property in question was exempt from taxation under C. S. L. C. ch. 4 sec. 2. Corporation of Quebec v. Leaycraft distinguished (1).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court in so far as the intervention of the present appellant had been dismissed, and in so far also as the defendants in the suit had been condemned to pay the taxes claimed The facts and pleadings are fully set out in the judgment of Strong J. hereinafter given.\nChurch Q.C. appeared on behalf of the appellant, and Roy Q.C. on .behalf of the respondents.\nThe following statutes and authorities \"were referred to by counsel: \u2014\nFor appellant: Cons. Stats. L. C. ch. 4 sec. 2; Quebec Interpretation Act, 31 Vie. ch. 7 sec. 5 (P.Q.); 37 Vic. ch. 51 sec. 237 (P.Q.); 36 Geo. III. ch. 9 sec. 62; 10 and 11 Vie oh. 17;.B. N. A. Act sec. 125; 23 Vic. ch. 61 sec. 58; Maxwell on Statutes ([1]).\nFor respondent: The Corporation of Quebec v. Leay-craft and the Attorney General, Intervenant ([2]); Harrison's Municipal Manual ([3]); Cons. Stats, L. C. ch. 1 sees. 8 and 9.\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J. As to the contention founded on the clause in the lease in relation to the payment of taxes by the Crown this, in my opinion has nothing whatever to do with this case; it is merely a matter of contract between the lessor and lessee with which the corporation of Montreal has nothing whatever to do; that provision merely amounts to this, if the land is not exempt then the crown, as between lessor and lessee agrees with the lessor to pay all and every the taxes, of whatever nature they may be, that may arise or become due and exigible upon the said premises during the period of the lease, but if the land is not legally assessable by reason of an exemption in favour of the crown then no taxes could arise or become due and exigible and therefore none are to \" be \"paid by either the lessor or lessee and so the clause no doubt introduced by the lessor ex majori cautel\u00e2, becomes of no effect.\nIndeed, the plaintiffs, in their declaration, do not pretend to claim the right to assess on any such ground, u Their claim is that the defendants are indebted to them in the sum of $1832.12 for assessments or taxes imposed according to law, and the by-laws of the corporation on the immovable property belonging to the defendant's, situate, &c., for the years '74, '75, '76. This is perfectly intelligible, and if these taxes have been imposed on defendants according to law, they are recoverable, and this brings up the simple and only question in issue: Were they imposed according to law? The corporation can get no right to assess property not assessable by reason of any contract entered into between private individuals be they the proprietor and his lessee or any other parties, in reference to the property. Their only right to assess is by virtue of authority of the legislature, and if the legislature has given no such authority, what right have they to levy any assessment? If therefore this property is by law exempt from assessment, that ends the matter, and this, as I have just said, is the only question in the case. It is admitted that Her Majesty by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, occupied the property for which the taxes are claimed in virtue of the leases produced and these leases show that the property was for the use of the militia department, and that department had the right to erect all rifle ranges necessary for rifle practice and temporary sheds and tents which may be required. It cannot, I should think, be disputed that the property of the crown, or property occupied by Her Majesty or Her servants for Her Majesty, is exempt from taxation, and it seems to me equally beyond dispute that this exemption can only be taken away by express legislative enactment. It is not necessary to go back to the old authorities which all establish and recognize this royal prerogative be-cause in the case of the Mersey Docks v. Cameron ([4]) Mr. Justice Blackburn read the opinion of the majority of the judges which was adopted and acted on by the House of Lords and in which he thus enunciates the law on this subject:\nThe crown not being named in the statute of Elizabeth is not bound by it; and consequently the overseers cannot impose a rate on the Sovereign in respect of lands occupied by Her Majesty, nor on those occupied by Her servants for Her Majesty. The exemption depends entirely on the occupier and not on the title to the property. The tenants of the crown property, paying rent for it, are ratable like other occupiers.\nOn the other hand, where a lease of private property is taken in the name of a subject, but the occupation is by the Sovereign or Her servants on Her behalf, the occupation being that of Her Majesty, no rate can be imposed; Lord Amherst v. Lord Sommers ([5]). So far the ground of exemption is perfectly intelligible but it has been carried a good deal farther, and applied to many cases in which it can scarcely be said that the Sovereign or the servants of the Sovereign are in occupation.\nIn this case is there any statute depriving the crown of this exemption ? None whatever. On the contrary there are statutes of Quebec distinctly, in my opinion, recognizing this exemption and relieving the property of the crown and property occupied by officers of the Crown for the public service from taxation even if such statutes were, in view of the royal prerogative, requisite or necessary. They are as follows: 10 & 11 Vic. Oh. 17; Cons. S. L. C. ch. 4 sec. 2; 23 Vic. ch. 61l sec. 58 and ch 56 secs. 8 and 9.\nIt is therefore for the city of Montreal to show a special right given in express terms to tax property held for Her Majesty. It has not this right under its charter in force during the years in question, viz: 37 Vic. ch. 51. On the contrary, that act expressly declares by section 237:\u2014\"This act shall not affect in a any manner the rights of Her Majesty, her heirs and \" successors.\"\n'The only right to tax the crown which the city of Montreal ever had was that expressly conveyed by 36 Geo. III. ch. 9 sec. 62, which conferred that power, not upon the corporation of Montreal (for none existed), but upon justices of the peace therein named. Section 57 of this act provides that assessments may be levied upon the occupier or occupiers (not the proprietors) of \" lands lots, houses, etc.;\" and section 62 declares that it is expedient that \" public buildings, dead walls and v void spaces of ground belonging to government or societies,\" etc., etc., should be assessable; and, as amplification and explanation of the term the belonging \" to, \" we find in the same section a provision that a particular fund shall be drawn upon for these assessments upon property which may \"belong to His \" Majesty or be occupied for his use.\"\nThese sections show that a right then existed to tax the property held or occupied by the Government; but not now maintainable\n\"First. Because all former acts affecting the respondents have been repealed by their present charter ([6]).\n\" Second. But chiefly because this right to tax was expressly taken away by 10-11 Vic. ch. 17, which reads as follows:\u2014\n\u201cAn Act to exempt the property of the Crown from local rates and taxes in Lower Canada. Whereas, by the laws of that portion of the province formerly the Province of Upper Canada, all property held by or in trust for the Crown is exempt from local taxes and assessments, and it is expedient that such property should be so exempt in that portion of the Province formerly Lower Canada: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada constituted and assembled by the virtue of and under the authority of an act passed G in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and intituled, 'An Act to reunite the Provinces of Upper and L Lower Canada, and for the government of Canada;' and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that, from and after the passing of this act, so much of the sixty-second section, or of any 1 other part of the act of the Legislature of Lower Canada passed in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of King George the Third and intituled, ' An Act for making, repairing and altering the highways ' and bridges within this Province, and for other purposes,' or of any other act or law in force in that portion of this province for merly the Province of Lower Canada as authorizes the imposing of any local rate or tax on any property belonging to Her Majesty, or held in trust by any officer or party for the use of Her Majesty or the demand of any sum of money as commutation for any statute or other labour on any highway in respect of such property, or the performance of such statute labour, or the payment of any such rate or tax imposed on any such property out of the public moneys of this province, shall be and is hereby repealed: and hereafter all such property as aforesaid, in whatever part of this Province the same shall be situate, shall be exempt from all local rates and taxes, statute or other labour on any highway or commutation for the same, any act or law to the contrary notwithstanding; provided always, that any arrears of such rates or taxes accrued and payable in Lower Canada before the passing of this act, may be paid as if this act had not been passed.\nThe Confederation Act Article 125 lays down the general rule, that no property belonging to Canada or any one of the Provinces shall be liable to taxation\n\"The article was moreover, only another way of declaring the principle which the C. S. L. C, cap. 4, sec. 2, had already enunciated; i e., the exemption of any property belonging to or held in trust by any officer or party.\" The section is as follows:\u2014\n\" 2. All property belonging to Her Majesty, or held in trust by any officer or party for the use of Her Majesty in whatever part of this Province the same is situate shall be exempt from all local rates or taxes, statute or other labor on any highway or commutation for the same; but any arrears of such rates or taxes accrued and pavable in Lower Canada before the twenty-eighth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and forty-seven, may be paid as if this Act had not been passed.\u201410.11 Vic. cap. 17. See also 23 Vic. cap. 61 sec. 58. \"The section of the Consolidated Statutes already quoted refers to 23 Vic. cap. 61 sec. 58 which reads as follows *\n\"58. All public buildings intended for the use of the Civil Government, for military purposes, for the purposes of education or religious worship, all property belonging to Her Majesty, or held in trust by any officer or person for the use of Her Majesty, all parsonage houses, burying grounds, charitable institutions and hospitals duly incorporated, and the lands upon which such buildings are erected, shall be exempt from all assessments or rates imposable under this act.\nCh. 1 sec. 8 of the C. S. L. C. declares that\nThe said Consolidated Statutes shall not be held to operate as new laws but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the said acts and parts of acts so repealed and for which the said Consolidated Statutes are substituted 23 V. c. 56 s. 8.\n9. But if upon any point the provisions of the said Consolidated Statutes are not in effect the same as those of the repealed acts and parts of acts for which they are substituted, then as respects all transactions matters and things subsequent to the time when the said Consolidated Statutes take effect, the provisions contained in them shall prevail, but as respects all transactions, matters and things anterior to the said time, the provisions of the said repealed acts and parts of acts shall prevail. 23 V. c. 56 s. 9.\nThese statutes seem to me distinctly to indicate that so far from depriving property occupied by the Crown of exemption from taxation, the intention of the legislature was to grant exemption, certainly not to take from the Crown that which belonged to it by royal prerogative.\nI do not think the case relied on by the plaintiffs of Corporation of Quebec v. Leaycraft and the Attorney General ([7]) is in the least degree in point; that was the case of a warehouse owned and occupied by a private individual for warehousing goods of parties who did not wish to pay the duties immediately, and of which warehouse the crown was neither the owner nor occupier. The only connection the crown had with the warehouse being the right to put a lock on it, the key of which was kept by a customs officer to prevent the goods being removed till the customs duties were paid or satisfied. The actual beneficial occupation being in the proprietor who received the consideration for its use as a warehouse, and in the owners of the goods placed there for safe custody, and for which they paid the proprietor the warehouse dues, the crown having therefore no title to or occupation of the premises, beneficial or otherwise, but the same belonging to and being in the occupation of private individuals, there was, in my opinion, no pretense for saying that the property was exempt from taxation. But in this case the property in question being under lease to the crown, and occupied by officers and servants of the crown, it is, in my opinion, clearly exempt from municipal taxation by the corporation of Montreal.\nI regret very much that we have not had the advantage to be derived from a perusal and consideration of the reasons which led the judges of the Court of Appeal to the conclusion at which they arrived. I have so repeatedly pointed out the grave inconvenience, and it may be possible injury, resulting to litigants from a non-compliance in so many cases, particularly from the Province of Quebec with the rule of this court made under and by virtue of the Supreme Court Act which gives to the rules of the Supreme Court force of law, requiring such reasons to form part of the case, that I suppose it is useless to repeat them now. I would add, however, that in justice to the court appealed from and to ourselves I think we should, as a court of appeal know the reasons on which the court below acted. If it has been thought necessary by statute to provide that the reasons of the judges on appeals before the Privy Council should be transmitted, it seems to be quite as important that we should have them in appeals before this court\nSTRONG J.\u2014In this case the principal action was instituted by the city of Montreal against Les Dames de la charit\u00e9 de l' H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la cite de Montreal (commonly called the Grey Nuns) to recover the municipal taxes assessed upon certain immovable property belonging to the defendants and situated in the city of Montreal for the years 1874 1875 and 1876, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $1,984.46. The defendants pleaded a peremptory exception to the effect that they were not liable to pay the taxes claimed by the plaintiffs inasmuch as during the years in respect of which those taxes were assessed they were not in possession of the land which was leased to the Minister of Militia for the use of the Crown during all the time mentioned in the action, and that Her Majesty's Government for the Dominion of Canada which had so leased the land had charged itself with the payment of the taxes and assessments, and that the city of Montreal cannot by law recover any tax or assessment in respect of lands occupied by Her Majesty for the Government of the Dominion and the exception sets forth three leases each for the term of one year covering the period from 1st of April 1874 to 5th of March, 1877, and alleges that since the last mentioned date the lease has been continued by \" tacite reconduction.\"\nTo this plea the plaintiffs filed an answer alleging that during the time for which the taxes were assessed the defendants were proprietors of the lands and in re-ceipt of the revenues and profits thereof.\nOn the 26th September, 1878, the then Attorney General of the Dominion, acting for and in the name of Her Majesty intervened in the action and subsequently filed a plea to the same effect as that of the defendants to the principal demand, producing as exhibits the three leases mentioned in the defendants plea which each contained a clause by which the Minister of Militia for the Crown undertook to pay taxes and indem-nify the lessors against the same. And to this plea by the Attorney General the plaintiffs filed an answer in all respects similar to that filed in response to the exception of the principal defendants. No facts being in dispute the cause was heard in the Superior Court upon an admission that the taxes claimed were in accordance with the assessment roll and that the Crown had had possession during the time alleged under the leases mentioned. The Superior Court on the 8th November, 1880, rendered a judgment dismissing the defence of the Grey Nuns the principal defendants, and condemning them to pay the amount claimed in the action and also dismissing the contestation of the action by the Attorney General and adjudging that the \" intervenant \" was bound to indemnify the principal defendants from all the consequences of the judgment against them.\nAgainst this judgment the Attorney General appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, which rendered a judgment dismissing the appeal so far as the judgment upon the principal demand is concerned, and reforming the judgment upon the intervention by substituting an order of dismissal of the intervention for the adjudication of the Superior Court that the Crown should indemnify the defendants.\nFrom this latter judgment the Attorney General now appeals to this court.\nI am unable to concur in the view taken by the majority of this court, that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was erroneous. By the leases which form part of the record (having been produced as exhibits,) it appears that the lands in question were leased by the Grey Nuns to the Minister of Militia in his official capacity for the purposes of a rifle range. The lands were therefore, I fully concede, to all intents and purposes leased for the use of the Crown and the possession and enjoyment had under the leases was the possession and enjoyment of the Crown, and the Crown and the defendants are therefore in the same position exactly as if the lease had been directly to Her Majesty. But I am unable to see any ground in this for exempting the proprietors from taxation, The taxes are not claimed from the Crown by the city. The only statutory enactment which is pointed to as authorising such an exemption is that contained in the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, ch. 4 sec. 2, by which it is enacted that:\nAll property belonging to Her Majesty, or held in trust by any officer or party for the use of Her Majesty, in whatever part of this Province the same is situate shall be exempt from all local rates or taxes statute or other labor in any highway or commutation of the same; that any arrears for such rates or taxes accrued and payable in Lower Canada before the 28th July, 1847, may be paid as if this act had not been passed.\nThere is manifestly nothing in this section exonerating proprietors who may happen to have the good fortune to have the Crown as tenants of their immovable property from such rates, taxes and assessments as may be imposed by the city authorities pursuant to the terms of the act of incorporation of the city of Montreal. These taxes are not imposed in respect of the leasehold interest, but in respect of the proprietorship of the land which is of course absolutely in the defendants, the Crown having a right to enjoy it only, under a mere personal contract, in no way operating as a dismemberment of the property or conferring any real right whatever It cannot therefore be said that these taxes are imposed upon property \" belonging to or held in trust \" for the Crown so as to bring\u00e9 it within the terms of the enactment quoted. There is no use in referring to anterior enactments, if any could be referred to authorizing such an exemption as is claimed, for by the 8th and 9th sections of the Interpretation Act (Cons. Stats. of Lower Canada, cap. 1) the provision contained in chap. 4 section 2 already extracted, is to be deemed declaratory of such former laws, and if in anything it differs from them it is to be taken, as regards the future, as substituted, for such anterior legislations.\nIt being, impossible, therefore, to rest the defence upon any positive legislation, resort is had to an argument derived rather from the doctrines of political economists than from any juridical principles. It is said, as I understand this argument, that the pretensions of the defendants and of the Attorney General must, irrespective of any statutory exemption, be taken to be well founded, because there being no direct authority to tax the crown (which I entirely admit) this assessment is indirectly a proceeding levying taxes on the crown, inasmuch as the crown, being bound to indemnify its lessons against the payment, will ultimately have to bear the burden. If I was not a single dissentient judge in this court I should have thought that this argument is so obviously fallacious as scarcely to call for observation, but as I differ from the other members of the court I am bound to assume that it is not so untenable as it appears to me and is entitled to respectful consideration.\nThere is no doubt that the city of Montreal cannot tax the property of the crown. This I freely admit. The crown cannot be affected by a statute giving powers of local taxation to a municipal body unless it is expressly named and express powers to tax its property are conferred which is not the case in the Montreal Act of Incorporation. But as I have already said there has been no attempt to impose a tax upon the crown. This argument therefore must mean that the incidence of the tax is such that the burden of it will fall ultimately upon the crown. No legal authority can be cited in support of such a position. The theories of authors who treat of a speculative science like political economy are not, in my opinion, proper elements of judicial decisions, except only in those cases where the draftsmen of Acts of Parliament having unfortunately borrowed terms from the nomenclature of that science the courts are forced to place an interpretation upon them in order to construe the act.\nI know nothing about the incidence of this tax all\nI say is that the Montreal Incorporation Act authorizes the city to tax proprietors in respect of their immovable property, and the powers conferred by it have been followed by the city, for the Grey Nuns, the principal defendants in this action and no one else are the own-ers of the full property in the lands upon which these taxes have been imposed, and upon this short ground alone it seems to me very clear that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench is free from error and ought to be affirmed, and this opinion, it appears to me is fully sustained by the case of Leaycraft v. The Queen ([8]).\nI may add, however, that the argument which is professed to be derived from the economists seems to me particularly unfortunate, for, without professing to decide this case on other than the purely legal grounds already stated, it is not out of place to say that the authorities which the defendants are driven to invoke do not support their pretensions, for, viewed in the light of the doctrines taught by political economy, this . tax is to all intents and purposes a tax upon rent, and according to a consensus of the best authorities in that science, a tax upon rent (using the word in its popular sense) being a tax upon the profits of the land is a burden falling upon and ultimately to be borne by the proprietor, and not by the tenant or occupier, even in a case which does not occur here where such tenant or occupier may be bound to pay the tax in the first instance, the theory of course being that the tenant who has to pay taxes pays so much less rent for the land. Consequently there is no pretence for saying that owing to the incidence of the tax this is in. effect a burden imposed upon the crown. Something was said in argument to the effect that if the taxes are held to be legally imposed, that this is tantamount to holding that the moveable property of the crown on the lands in question is liable to seizure. The plain answer to this, however, is that no such result necessarily follows.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014concurred with Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J.\nHENRY J.\u2014I think that the corporation have no right to impose a tax on this property. It was leased to the government for a military purpose, and it was one of the terms and conditions of the lease that the government should pay the taxes. If that had not been inserted in the agreement the government would have had to pay the rent representing such taxes; but having taken upon itself to clear the other parties of the taxes, it clearly shows that the taxes will have to be paid by the government, if the attempt of the corporation is successful\nI agree with the majority of this court that the corporation has no power to levy the taxes on these premises for the period of time they were occupied by the Dominion Government.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. This property is held in trust by the Minister of Militia for the use of Her Majesty, and, under the very terms of ch. 4 sec. 2. C. S. L. C. is exempt from taxation. Moreover it is for the respondent to show a right to tax this property not for the crown to show an exemption. A tax upon a property held and occupied, as this one by the crown for public purposes must necessarily fall upon the Crown; that is to say, be paid out of the revenues of the Dominion. In the very terms of the B. N. A Act, the city of Montreal is not authorized and cannot be authorized to levy the funds necessary for the administration of its municipal government upon the inhabitants of the rest of the Dominion, and I am sure that the legislature did not intend to authorize them to do so. It would have been granting them powers withheld from and refused to the other municipalities of the province. For under art. 712 of the Municipal Code, as amended by 36 Vic, ch. 21 sec. 18, properties occupied, as this one is, by the Government, are specially exempted from taxation.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Chapleau, Church, Hall & Nicholls.\nSolicitor for respondents: Ro\u00fcer Roy.\n[1] 7 Q.

Per Strong J.\u2014That the assignee was confined to the schedule, but effect must be given to the word \u201cintent\u201d in the statute and as the evidence showed that a bon\u00e2 fide effort was made to ascertain the names of all the creditors before the execution of the deed, it did not appear that the insolvent intended to prefer the scheduled creditors and the deed, therefore, was not void under R.S.O. cap. 118 sec. 2.\nSemble, per Strong J.\u2014That the word preference in R.S.O. cap. 118, sec. 2, imports a \u201cvoluntary preference\u201d and is not applicable to the case of a deed obtained by a creditor or creditors who to obtain it have brought pressure to bear on the debtor.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas Division[2] in favor of the respondent.\nThe material facts affecting this appeal are as follows:\u2014\nIn 1882 one Thompson, a trader, being in difficulties and pressed by the respondent Garland who had issued a writ against him, went to Toronto and held a meeting of his creditors, at which meeting it was determined that Thompson should assign his estate to the Appellant McLean for the benefit of all his creditors. Before executing the deed of assignment a son of McLean went over all his books with the insolvent and made out what was supposed to be a complete list of the creditors. The deed was then prepared and executed by Thompson and by McLean. It provided for the payment of certain rents and taxes, and then for the payment in full, or pro rat\u00e2 as far as the assets would extend, of the debts of the creditors mentioned in a schedule annexed.\nThe respondent, Garland, having obtained judgment against Thompson, issued an execution, and the sheriff made a levy upon the goods assigned to McLean by the aforesaid deed. An interpleader issue was ordered to be tried to determine the title in said goods, and on the trial in the Common Pleas Division judgment was given for the Respondent and execution creditor Gar- land, who had produced evidence to show that one Sinclair was a creditor of Thompson for a small amount and had not been included in the scheduled list of creditors, the court holding that this made the deed preferential of the creditors who were included and, consequently, void. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the judges of that court were equally divided in opinion and the appeal was dismissed. McLean then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. Cassels Q.C. and Galt for the appellant.\nThe deed was made between Thompson, the debtor, and McLean, the appellant, and both are bound by the recital to treat this deed as one for the benefit of all Thompson\u2019s creditors. Carpenter v. Buller[3]; Chitty on Contracts[4].\nThe appellant subimts: (1). That the deed of assignment in question was made and executed for the purpose of paying and satisfying ratably and proportionably, and without preference or priority, all the creditors of A.W.E. Thompson their just debts within the meaning of R.S.O. ch. 118 sec. 2.\n(2). That this appears not only by the deed itself but by the strongest affirmative evidence.\n(3). That if Sinclair were a creditor he could have proved his claim and ranked on the estate, and that if necessary the schedule can be amended by adding his name.\n(4). That if Sinclair\u2019s trifling debt was excluded by accident, this cannot have the effect of avoiding the deed.\n(5). That no debt from Thompson to Sinclair was proved by the respondent.\n(6). That the Respondent\u2019s name being upon the schedule it is not competent for him to complain that the name of some other creditor is not there. Sinclair\u2019s claim was produced for the first time at the trial, and Thompson having by that time removed to the North-West, it was impossible to make any inquiries into it.\nThe following authorities were cited: Kerr v. Canadian Bank of Commerce[5]; Brayley v. Ellis[6]; Alexander v. Wavell[7].\nRobinson Q.C. and Walker for the respondent.\nThe said deed of assignment was made for the payment of those creditors only who were mentioned in the schedule annexed to the deed, after the payment of rent, charges and assessments, &c., which were made a first charge on all the assets assigned. As a matter of tact certain creditors, namely, Alexander Sinclair and J. and J. Taylor, were excluded altogether from any benefit under the deed, and therefore the deed was and is invalid as against the respondent, an execution creditor of the assignor. Creditors could not be added to the schedule.\nDrever v. Mawdesley[8]; Gault v. Baird[9]; Buvelot v. Mills[10]; Wood v. Rowcliffe[11]; Kingston v. Chapman[12]; Sellin v. Price[13].\nEven if the deed could be reformed as between the assignor and assignee, the immediate parties to it, it could not be reformed so as to affect the rights of creditors who were not parties to it. After the rights of an execution creditor had intervened, the deed could not be reformed so as to prejudice his rights and after any creditor became a party to it by filing his claim with the assignee, or in any other way intimating his willingness to accept the provisions of the deed, the deed could not be reformed, and he would have the right to insist upon having the assets distributed among those creditors only who are mentioned in the schedule. The onus of proving that all creditors were included in the schedule was on the appellant, and without calling the assignor as a witness there could not be, and there was, no evidence of that fact. Watts v. Howell[14].\nThe recitals in the deed cannot control or enlarge the operative words in it unless the latter are ambiguous.\nIngleby v. Swift[15]; N.W. Ry. Co. v. Whinray[16]. Buvelot v. Mills[17].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The consideration for making this deed, as expressed on its face, was that there should be a fair and equitable distribution of the debtor\u2019s property amongst his creditors, for the purpose of paying and satisfying, ratably and proportionately, and without preference or priority, all the creditors their just debts. This consideration is not limited to a distribution among the parties named in the schedule. The trustee having accepted the property in this case, is he not bound, notwithstanding a mistake in the schedule, to distribute the funds in accordance with the consideration on which he received them, that is, among the persons mentioned in the schedule, assuming them to be all the debtor\u2019s creditors? But if it should be that by accident or inadvertence a creditor is omitted, then, in accordance with the condition on which the deed was made, and the property received by the assignee, should not the distribution be among all the creditors?\nI therefore think, that having received the property on the consideration of distributing it ratably among all the grantor\u2019s creditors, the trustee could not withhold a ratable proportion from any, and if he did so the creditor accidentally omitted would have a right to enforce payment of his ratable, proportional share with the creditors mentioned in the schedule. I am not satisfied that there was a debt proved to be due to Sinclair, but if there was I think the assignment was made bon\u00e2 fide and without any intent whatever to defeat or delay creditors or to give any creditor a preference over any other creditor or creditors.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion, with the majority of the Court of Appeal, that there was sufficient prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the delivery of the goods sold by Alexander Sinclair to the assignor Thompson for the price of $26.86. The receipt given was, it is true, nominally by the warehousemen who were to keep the goods until they could be forwarded, but, as I understand, the same warehousemen were also the carriers or the agents for the carriers who were to take the goods to their destination, in which case the delivery was also a delivery to the carrier for the present purpose, though the liability of the carriers as such did not of course begin until they were actually shipped. Moreover, Sinclair says he wrote several letters to the debtor, but received no answer. It is to be presumed that these letters were received. And there is an inference in the case of letters of this kind that silence imports acquiesence. On the whole, I think the case could not well be decided on this ground against the respondent, more especially as much turns on the construction of Sinclair\u2019s evidence which presents some ambiguity and the learned judge who presided at the trial has interpreted it in favor of the respondent.\nI also entirely agree with the learned judges in the Court of Appeal who held that on the construction of the deed Sinclair was not entitled to the benefit of it. The operative parts of a deed always control the recitals, and the trusts here declared are expressly for the scheduled creditors and no one else. If authority is required for this proposition the case of Buvelot v. Mills[18], referred to by Mr. Justice Osler in delivering the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas seems directly in point. Further I cannot agree with the dictum in Thorne v. Torrance[19] that the trustee has any right to add to the list of creditors, nor that on the strength of the mere recital in the deed that it was intended for the benefit of all creditors, taken by itself alone, and without more, a Court of Equity could interfere to rectify the omission in the schedule.\nBut I feel compelled to dissent from the court below and on the same grounds as those the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas has very forcibly put forward as the principal reasons for the judgment he has given. The statute R.S.O. c. 118, sec. 2, as it seems to me, is nothing more than a re-enactment of the statute 13 Eliz. with something added which the statute of Eliz. did not provide for, that addition being the avoidance of deeds made by an insolvent with intent to give one or more of his creditors a preference over the others or one other of such creditors. The exceptions are enacted for greater caution and have nothing to do with the present question. The real point for decision when it is sought to invalidate a deed under this sect. 2 must in every case be:\u2014Is it sufficiently proved that the deed was made with intent to give a preference? And the answer to this must depend on all the evidence, extrinsic as well as that contained in the deed itself. If there is no extrinsic evidence shewing how the benefit of the trusts came to be witheld from certain creditors, or from one certain creditor, the conclusion must be inevitable. It must be presumed that the assignor intended the necessary consequence of his act, which would be to give creditors who, by the express words of the deed, were entitled to the benefit of the trusts declared by it, a preference over other creditors not included in its terms; the result being unavoidable that the deed is void under this section of\u2019 the statute. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of shewing by extrinsic evidence that the surrounding circumstances attending the execution of the deed were such as to rebut any presumption of an intent to prefer. If the mere effect of the deed itself was to be conclusive then the word \u201cintent\u201d might as well be stricken out of the statute altogether. It must also be remembered that as the statute originally stood on the statute book it contained certain penal clauses, by one of which the \u201cintent,\u201d not to prefer, it is true, but to defraud, creditors, was made punishable as a misdemeanor. The intent so referred to in the penal clause, being the same intent as avoided the deed in one of the events provided for in the section now represented by this second clause, was of course to be arrived at by the same evidence, and no one can doubt that on such a prosecution all the surrounding circumstances would be admissible to shew the absence of fraudulent intent. And if so the intent would be ascertainable in the same way when the issue was on the validity or invalidity of a deed, and, to carry it still one step further, also when the enquiry was as to the intent to give a preference, for we cannot suppose, without putting an arbitrary construction on the act, that the deed in the latter case was to be held conclusive of the intent any more than in the former.\nAgain, as the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas has put it, the preference cannot be shewn without admitting evidence dehors the deed, and whenever extrinsic evidence is admitted to establish any proposition reason and authority both require that extrinsic evidence should likewise be admissible to counteract it.\nThen the cases on the statute of Eliz. which have determined that in the case of a deed expressing to be made for a mere nominal consideration, and so on its face a mere voluntary conveyance and therefore void as against creditors, evidence is admissible to shew that in fact a valuable consideration was given, are also strong authorities in favor of the appellant in the present case.\nOn the whole, therefore, it seems to me very clear that evidence was admissible to rebut the presumption that a preference was intended, which certainly did arise as soon as it was shewn that there was a creditor from whom the benefit of this deed was withheld.\nThis reduces the question to one of the sufficiency of the evidence for the purpose referred to. Now it is shewn, that this assignment was not the mere voluntary act of the debtor himself, but was made at the instance of his creditors; that finding himself about to be pressed by the defendant\u2019s execution he went to Toronto and laid the state of his affairs before an informal meeting of a number of his creditors there; that this meeting resolved that an assignment for the benefit of creditors, that is, as Mr. McLean in his evidence states, for the benefit of all the creditors whose names could be ascertained, should be made; hat for the purpose of ascertaining exactly what Thompson\u2019s liabilities and assets were Mr. Isaac McLean, the appellant\u2019s son, went to Thompson\u2019s place of residence and business at Gore Bay, on Manitoulin Island, and there, by examination of the books and inquiries of the insolvent himself, endeavoured by every means in his power to ascertain the names of all the creditors; and that from all the information he was able to acquire from Thompson, and to gather by searching and examining the books and papers, he \u201cmade out a full and complete list of his creditors so far as he told me and so far as the books shewed.\u201d There is nothing in the finding of the learned Judge who presided at the trial to shew that he did not give credit to the evidence of the appellant and to that of Isaac McLean, and I see therefore no reason why the evidence of both should not be considered as entitled to consideration; more especially as it is uncontradicted and is in accordance with all the probabilities.\nThen we have the fact that all parties to the deed and all parties interested under the deed who were privy to and cognizant of its execution, intended to include all creditors, but that one creditor whose debt only amounted to the small sum of $26 86\/100 was by inadvertence and accident unintentionally omitted from the schedule and so not prim\u00e2 facie entitled under the trusts declared. Further, we have this direct evidence confirmed by the inferences to be drawn from the circumstances of the case; for it surely cannot be presumed that the debtor, who had taken pains to communicate his insolvent condition to the general body of his creditors with a view to insuring a fair distribution of his estate, and who had submitted himself to their direction and was acting under those directions in making this assignment, designedly, and with intent to give a preference over this one creditor to whom he owed $26 86\/100, suppressed his name in order that he should be excluded from the deed. Such a presumption would be against all the facts and all the probabilities, and I therefore conclude that upon the evidence of the circumstances preceding and attending the execution of the deed, and assuming that the validity of the assignment depended on the intention of the debtor alone, any presumption of an intent to prefer arising from the fact of Sinclair\u2019s debt having been omitted from the schedule is sufficiently rebutted.\nBut I do not wish to be understood as conceding that even if it had been distinctly proved that Thompson designedly concealed this debt it would make any difference, for I should be prepared to hold, if it were necessary to do so, that where a deed is made, as this deed was, at the instance and upon the request of creditors the section in question does not apply unless the creditors are themselves parties to the intent to give a preference or have notice of the debtor\u2019s design so to do and acquiesce in it.\nFurther, I desire to express no opinion whether a deed given as this manifestly was under pressure from creditors can in any case, even when the creditors obtaining it are preferred, be avoided as a preference under this second section, for as I have had occasion to say before, in cases arising under the late Insolvent Act, I consider the word preference as importing a voluntary preference and not applicable to the case of a deed obtained by a creditor or creditors who to obtain it have brought pressure to bear on the debtor. But whether this applies to the case of a general assignment of all the debtor\u2019s property is a point requiring further consideration, and which does not, in the view 1 take of the evidence, call for decision in the present case.\nThat the conclusion I arrive at imposes no hardship upon the omitted debtor is, I think, apparent from the consideration that upon the facts here proved relief on the head of accident and mistake would be granted as of course in a Court of Equity. We have the deed reciting an intention to assign the property comprised in it upon trust for all creditors; we further have the facts proved that the utmost diligence was exerted in order to get a complete list of the creditors, thus carrying out the intention of the meeting of the Toronto creditors as far as it was possible to do so, and that it was only owing to the loose state of the insolvent\u2019s books and to his forgetfulness, that Sinclair\u2019s name was omitted; at least such must be the irresistible inference from the evidence. A very different case for relief in Equity is thus made from that upon which it was suggested relief could be obtained in Thorne v. Torrance, and I do not hesitate to say that in a case like the present relief would be accorded as of course, and that any party to the deed who, upon a proper application being made to him before suit, should refuse to consent to a rectification, and who by such refusal would render resort to the court necessary, would be made liable for costs.\nAs regards the provisions respecting rent and assessments I read the deed as referring to rents and assessments which would be charges upon the land at the time of sale and which would of course in any Court have priority, inasmuch as the purchaser would be entitled to deduct these amounts from his purchase money, or if the lands should be sold subject to the charges the price obtained would be so much the less.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs both here and in all the Courts below.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred with His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nHENRY J\u2014I have the misfortune to differ from my learned brethren in this case. The deed of assignment under R.S.O. ch. 118, is void unless it is for the benefit of all creditors: now it is not a question of intention that we are called upon to decide but one of fact. Here the party makes out a deed and wants to pay all his creditors; in carrying out his intention he makes it for the benefit of those creditors only who are mentioned in the schedule and leaves out one of his creditors. Now if he can by mistake leave out one creditor, why not two or three. Is it sufficient for him to say he intended to include him? Reading the document we find he has left out Alexander Sinclair from the schedule, and the learned Judge so found at the trial of the case, and upon the true legal construction of this document it rested on the respondent to prove that all creditors were included, and this he has failed to do.\nWe are told equity can rectify any mistake. I do not see how that comes in at all. A party to a deed can rectify a mistake, provided the mistake is a mutual one, but how can you reform a document so as to affect the rights of a person who was not a party to the deed at all? I must confess I cannot see how the principles of equity are applicable to such a case as the present.\nWith regard to taxes, I think the party had a right to provide for the payment of them in full, of taxes on the land out of the proceeds of the land; but I do not think he could prefer the payment of such taxes out of personal assets. I think this is going beyond the law.\nI am therefore of opinion that this document is not complete and it is not one which the law provides for. The appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellant: Caston and Galt.\nSolicitors for Respondent: Walker and Scott.\n[1] 10 Ont.

The judgment in this case was pronounced in the Court of Appeal on June 30th, 1884, the two following months being the vacation of the court. On September 13th O'Sullivan deposited $500 and applied for leave to appeal, which was refused, the court holding that the application should have been made within thirty days from the date of the pronouncing of the judgment, as the vacation did not prevent the time from running.\nA substantial question affecting the rights of the parties arose on the settlement of the minutes, and was subsequently brought before the court for decision. In consequence of this the judgment was not formally entered until November 14th, 1884.\nOn November 27th, 1884, O'Sullivan applied to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to give security under sec. 31 of the Supreme Court Act as amended by sec. 14 of the Amendment Act of 1879. This application was referred to the full court.\nD. A. O'Sullivan supported the motion.\nJ. L. Whiting contra.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This was a motion made in chambers for an order allowing an appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, or for an order that the appellant may be at liberty to give proper security.\nI have been a good deal embarrassed as to what should be done in this case. It is claimed that in Ontario the time for appealing should run from the time the judgment was pronounced, and that as the judgment in this case was pronounced before vacation, the application should have been made during vacation. I was of opinion at first that the party was not obliged to apply during vacation, but this application need not be decided on this point. The decision was pronounced in June, but the minutes were not settled and entered until some time in the autumn. The question is whether the time runs from the date of the pronouncing of the judgment, or from the entry of the certificate. I understand the practice in Quebec to be that the judgment is always entered as of the date on which it was pronounced, and therefore no question can arise as to appeals coming from the Province of Quebec; and also in Ontario where there is simply a judgment declaring that the appeal is dismissed or allowed as the case may be, and there is nothing more to be done; but when the decision requires something more to be done at the settlement of the minutes, as in this case whether the plaintiff should be held personally liable for the costs, then I think that until the settlement of the minutes and entry of the certificate a party should not be compelled to take his appeal. I am therefore inclined to think the time ought to run in this case from the date of the entry of the certificate, which was entered on the 14th of November last.\nSTRONG J. was of opinion that the motion should be granted.\nFOURNIER, HENRY and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nMotion allowed and leave to appeal granted.\nSolicitor for appellant: Robert Mahon.\nSolicitors for respondents: Britton & Whiting.\n",

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014On the 8th of September, 1855, Thomas Mackay made his will whereby, after appointing his wife and his sons, Alexander, John, Charles and Thomas, executrix and executors thereof, with a provision in the event of his wife marrying again that she should cease to be executrix, he devised and bequeathed to his said executrix and executors in these words:\u2014\nAll and singular the moneys, debts, stocks, bills, bonds, mortgages, debentures and other securities, goods, chattels and effects, lands, tenements and hereditaments whatsoever and wheresoever situate,and all interest in the same of which I shall die possessed, and to which I shall be in any way entitled at the time of my death, in trust, for the several uses and purposes hereinafter mentioned and declared, and to be held and applied and disposed of as hereinafter mentioned and appointed; that is to say\nFirst.\u2014For payment of debts, &c.\nSecondly\u2014For payment of \u00a350 to Bytown Protestant Hospital, &c.\nThirdly.\u2014In the event of his wife surviving him, in trust for her maintenance and support so long as she shall live, and of his children so long as they shall live with their mother, &c., and the testator directed that his wife, so long as she lived and continued his widow, should have the full right to possess and manage the property and the profits, &c., thereof, for such purposes, and in the event of her marrying again then for the payment out of the rents, &c., to her of \u00a3500 annually, which annuity he charged on his said property and estate in lieu of dower.\nFourthly.\u2014In trust also that at the death or second marriage of my said wife, should such happen, my son Thomas, if he be then living, shall have and take lot No. 1, in the front concession on the Ottawa, of the township of Gloucester, in the county of Carleton, and Province of Canada, containing two hundred acres, more or less (see deed from Francis Sarague), which I hereby devise to him, his heirs and assigns, to and for his and their own use forever. And that my sons, Alexander, John, Charles and Thomas aforesaid, shall have and take all my other real estate in the township of Gloucester aforesaid, namely, lots Nos, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in the said front concession of said township (see deeds from Henry Munro, Gideon Olmstead and Clements Bradley; also deed from Government of lot No. 2), with all mills, houses and buildings thereon erected. Also ten acres of land in the city of Ottawa, in said county, being a part of lot letter \u201cO\u201d in said city (except the part sold to John McKinnon, Esquire), with all mills, houses and buildings thereon erected. Also Green. Island, near the mouth of the Rideau river, in said county, with all mills, houses and buildings thereon erected. All which I hereby devise to my said sons, Alexander, John, Charles and Thomas, and to their heirs and assigns, to and for their own use forever, as tenants in common, subject nevertheless, to the payment of the legacies and annuities in and by this my will, bequeathed and made chargeable thereon. And that my daughters, Arm, Christina, Jessie and Elizabeth, shall, have and take all my houses, lands, tenements and real estate in the city of Montreal, which I hereby devise to my said daughters, their heirs and assigns, to and for their own use forever as tenants in common.\nAnd I hereby will and direct that all the said devises in this section of my will mentioned and devised, shall take effect upon, from and after the said death or marriage of my said wife, and not sooner.\nAnd all his other real estate of every nature and description in trust to be sold, and the rents, &c., to be . at the disposal of his wife so long as she should live and remain unmarried for the support of herself and his children, and after her death or marriage to be equally divided among his children with power of conveyance to his widow unmarried, and after her death to his eldest surviving son.\nIn trust also that at the death or marriage of my said wife, as aforesaid, all my personal property and estate then remaining shall be equally divided among my said children, either in money or in kind as to my said executors shall seem best, allowing one year for the making of such distribution.\nProvided always, and Thereby will and bequeath, that in the event of any of my said children dying without legal issue before coming into possession of his or her share or shares of the property or money hereby devised or bequeathed, then the share or shares of such child or children to go to and be equally divided among the survivors, and the legal issue of such, if any. as shall have died leaving issue.\nAnd in the event of any of my said children dying before coming into possession as aforesaid, and leaving legal issue, such issue in every case to take the portion or share which would have belonged to his, her, or their father or mother if then living. And to the husband or wife of each of my said children, who shall alter marriage, and before coming into possession as aforesaid, die without issue, leaving such husband or wife, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds annually, as an annuity payable out of, and chargeable upon, the share which would have belonged to such child if living.\nThe question at issue in this case arises under that part of the fourth devise, viz:\u2014\nIn trust, also, that at the death or second marriage of my said wife, should such happen, my son Thomas, if he be then living, shall have and take lot No. 1, in the front concession, &c., which I hereby devise to him, his heirs and assigns, to and for his or their own use forever.\nThe appellants contending that this is a contingent gift to Thomas, depending on his being alive at the death of his mother, the question then simply is: Did Thomas take a vested or contingent remainder?\nThe courts unquestionably favor a construction which gives a vested interest in property where there is ambiguity or doubt, and the intention that the interest shall be contingent is not clear, but not to defeat the clear intention of the testator.\nChief Justice Best puts this clearly in Duffield v. Duffield[3]:\nThe rights of the different members of families not being ascertained whilst estates remain contingent, such families continue in an unsettled state, which is often productive of inconvenience and sometimes of injury to them. If the parents attaining a certain age be a condition precedent to the vesting estates, by the death of their parents before they are of that age children lose estates which were intended for them, and which their relation to the testators may give them the strongest claim to.\nIn consideration of these circumstances the judges, from the earliest times, were always inclined to decide that estates devised were vested; and it has long been an established rule for the guidance of the courts at Westminster in construing devises, that all estates are to be holden to be vested, except estates in the devise of which a condition precedent to the vesting is so clearly expressed that the courts cannot treat them as vested without deciding in direct opposition to the terms of the will. If there be the least doubt, advantage is to be taken of the circumstances occasioning the doubt; and what seems to make a condition is holden to have only the effect of postponing the right of possession.\nIn considering the whole scheme, or rather scope and object of this will, I think it very clear that the testator intended to dispose of the whole of his property, and did not contemplate any contingency whereby there should be an intestacy as to any part of it. I can discover nothing in this will to indicate that the testator intended or contemplated that any of his real estate, specifically devised, should in any event remain to be dealt with as undisposed of, as appellants contend. The testator after providing for his wife, then specifically devises certain portions of his real estate among his children, male and female; these portions subject to the interest of the wife, I think he intended to dispose of absolutely to the objects of his bounty.\nMuch stress is laid by the appellants on the words in the devise to Thomas, \u201cif he be then living,\u201d which are not to be found in the devises to the other sons and the daughters, but I think these words in substance amount to no more than the language of the paragraph which immediately follows the devises, viz.:\u2014\nAnd I hereby will and direct that all the said devises in this section of my will mentioned and devised (which clearly includes the devise to Thomas) shall take effect upon, from and after the said death or marriage of my said wife and not sooner.\nWhich completes, in my opinion, the disposition of the will in reference to these specific devises.\nI may here notice that it has been strongly urged, and the argument appears to have influenced the minds of the Chancellor and Mr. Justice Patterson, that the clause following the residuary bequest, which I have already quoted, providing that in the event of any one or more of the children dying without legal issue before coming into possession of her or their share, &c., \u201cthe share or shares of such child or children should go to and be equally divided among the survivors and the legal issue of such, if any, as should have died, leaving issue,\u201d and the other providing for the event of any of the children dying before coming into possession aforesaid and leaving legal issue, show an intent that the interest taken by Thomas in lot No. 1 was contigent, but I entirely agree with Chief Justice Hagarty and Justices Burton and Ferguson, that these paragraphs refer to the personal property and estate to be divided in money or kind, disposed of in the residuary clause and bequest, and have no reference whatever to the specific devises of the real estate to the sons and daughters which are to them respectively and their heirs and assigns, whereas disposition of the personalty refers only to the legal issue of such as shall have died leaving issue. The last clause relating to these specific devises appears to me to show very conclusively that all these specific devises were intended by the testator to be placed on one and the same footing, though the words \u201cif he be then living\u201d are not used in connection with the other devises. Without these words then and without this paragraph what is the devise to Thomas? It is unquestionably a devise to Thomas, his heirs and assigns to and for his and their own use forever. Now in re Duke Hannah v. Duke[4]it is said by James L.J.:\u2014\nThere is a strong, or I may say a stringent, rule, that if we have words clearly making a vested gift, clear words are required to convert it into a contingent one.\nMr. Jarman thus states this general rule[5]:\u2014\nWhere a testator creates a particular estate, and then goes on to dispose of the ulterior interest expressly in an event which will determine the prior estate, the words descriptive of such event occurring in the latter devise will be construed as referring merely to the period of the determination of the possession or enjoyment under the prior gift, and not as designed to postpone the vesting.\nThen have the words of futurity been inserted for the purpose of postponing the vesting or do they refer simply to the deferred possession or enjoyment?\nAs to this Mr. Jarman again says[6]:\u2014\nThe result of authorities is thus summed up by Sir W.P. Wood in Maddison v. Chapman[7]: The true way of testing limitations of that nature is this: Can the words, which in form import contingency, be read as equivalent to \u201csubject to the interests previously limited?\u201d\nVice-Chancellor Wood\u2019s language is thus:\u2014\nThe class of authorities of which Pearsall v. Simpson[8] may be taken as the leading case, merely establish that where there is a limitation over which, though expressed in the form of a contingent limitation, is in fact dependent upon a condition essential to the determination of the interests previously limited, the court is at liberty to hold, that, notwithstanding the words in form import contingency, they mean no more, in fact, than that the person to take under the limitation over is to take subject to the interests so previously limited. I apprehend the true way of testing limitations of that nature is this: Can the words which in form import contingency be read as equivalent to \u201csubject to the interests previously limited?\u201d\nTake the simplest case: A limitation to A. for life, remainder to B. for life, and upon the decease of B., \u201cif A. be dead,\u201d then to C. in fee. There the limitation to C. is apparently made contingent upon the event of A.\u2019s dying in the life time of B. Nevertheless, inasmuch as the condition of A.\u2019s death is an event essential to the determination of the interest previously limited to him, the court reads the devise as if it were to A. for life, remainder to B. for life, and on B.\u2019s death, subject to A.\u2019s life interest (if any) to C. in fee.\nTheobald on Wills[9].\nBut in the case of successive limitations \u201cwhere there is a limitation over which, though expressed in the form of a contingent limitation is, in fact, dependent on a condition essential to the determination of the interests previously limited, notwithstanding the words in form import contingency, they mean no more, in fact, than that the person to take under the limitation over is to take subject to the interests previously limited.\u201d\nMaddison v. Chapman[10]; Webb v. Hearing[11]; Pearsall v. Simpson[12]; Franks v. Price[13]; Chellew v. Martin[14]; Edgeworth v. Edgeworth [15].\nI think the testator intended this to be an immediate absolute devise or gift to Thomas and his heirs, an absolute disposition of the property subject to the wife\u2019s interest, and that the words which accompany this gift, though apparently importing a contingency indicate no more than the determination of the prior estate, no more than certain circumstances on the happening of which the party entitled shall have and take the possession and enjoyment, that is to say, on the termination of the interest previously secured to the wife, and so was a vested estate in fee in Thomas and his heirs subject to the executory trust to be executed for the benefit of the wife during her widowhood or life, and not a condition that the devisee should survive the wife, but was intended only to mark the period at which the devise should take effect in possession and the devisee should have the full benefit of the devise and be put in complete possession, that possession being necessarily deferred on account of the antecedent benefit given to the wife. The devise to Thomas being in succession to the interest devised for the benefit of the wife, the gift to both were alike immediate, though Thomas and his heirs could not have the benefit until after the death or marriage of the wife, and therefore Thomas took a remainder in fee, which having vested immediately on the testator\u2019s death was not defeated by his own death in the life time of his wife.\nIn Goodtitle v. Whitby[16]Lord Mansfield;\u2014He said he would lay down a rule or two of construction, previously to giving his particular opinion on this case. 1st. Wherever the whole property is devised, with a particular interest given out of it, it operates by way of exception out of the absolute property. This rule is laid down in Matthew Manning\u2019s case [17].\n2nd. Where an absolute property is given, and a particular interest is given, in the mean time, as \u201cuntil the devisee shall come of age, &c., and when he shall come of age, &c., then to him, &c.,\u201d the rule is, that that shall not operate as a condition precedent, but as a description of the time when the remainder\u2014man is to take in possession.\n* * * * *\nHere, upon the reason of the thing, the infant is the object of the testator\u2019s bounty; and the testator does not mean to deprive him of it, in any event. Now suppose that this object of the testator\u2019s bounty marries and dies before his age of twenty-one, leaving children; could the testator intend in such an event to disinherit him? Certainly he could not. And as to the testator\u2019s heir-at-law, his heir-at-law is only to take what the testator has not devised away from him.\nIn the leading case of Hanson v. Graham[18], Sir Wm. Grant says:\u2014\nThe only cases alluded to in May v. Wood[19] are cases of real estate, beginning with Boraston\u2019s case[20], and ending with Doe Wheedon v. Lea[21]. The principle of them all is stated by Lord Mansfield in Goodlittle v. Whitty[22], &c. He then quotes the rules laid down\u2014the first and second\u2014as above, and after making observations on that case and Boraston\u2019s case, he says:\u2014\nSo in Manfield v. Dugard[23] it was clear, the testator meant to postpone the enjoyment of the son for the sake of the antecedent benefit of the wife; but he clearly meant a vested remainder, not \u2018contingent, whether the son should take any benefit at all in the estate. But that makes a very different question from this, whether where there is no precedent estate, no purpose whatsoever, for which the enjoyment was to be postponed, you shall say the enjoyment only is to be postponed.\nSo in the case before us there was a reason for postponing the possession, and, in my opinion, it is very clear that nothing but the enjoyment was intended to be postponed.\nMr. Washburn[24] says:\u2014\nAn estate is vested in interest when there is a present fixed right of future enjoyment.\nAnd he quotes from Fearne[25]as follows:\u2014\nThe present capacity of taking effect in possession, if the possession were now to become vacant, and not the certainty that the possession will become vacant before the estate limited in remainder determines, universally distinguishes a vested remainder from one that is contingent.\nSo that when the testator died leaving. Thomas him surviving, Thomas had the then present absolute right and capacity to have and take the estate the instant the prior estate should determine, and though he should die and not have the enjoyment, as he did in fact, it would descend to his heirs who would take in his place.\nI cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that when the testator used these words, \u201cwhich I hereby devise to him, his heirs and assigns, to and for his and their own use forever\u201d he ever intended or contemplated that if his son died before his mother, leaving children his heirs, that such children should not enjoy the property, because their father happened to die before the death or second marriage of his mother, and that under such circumstances the testator as to his property would have died intestate.\nNor does the limitation in this case contain any incident but what is essential to the determination of the estate previously limited.\nLush J. in Leadbeater v. Cross [26] delivering the judgment of the court says:\u2014\nNo doubt the life estate in question is limited in terms of contingency, terms which, literally construed, make the happening of the event, namely, the survivorship of the tenants for life, a condition precedent to the gift. But we are to look not at the form but the substance of the devise.\nOne of the rules of construction laid down in Powell on Devises[27] is:\u2014\nWhere an estate in remainder is limited in terms of contingency on the happening of certain events, and the events described are precisely those on which (the preceding estates having determined) it will fall into possession, it is construed to be, not a contingent gift conditioned to take effect on these events, but a devise immediately vested, the possession of which is necessarily dependent on the events in question.\nAnd I think we may apply to the case before us the words of the learned judge:\u2014\nThis rule, which is deduced by the learned author from the cases which he quotes, could not have been more accurately framed to meet this case if it had been framed for the purpose, and it is one which commends itself to common sense.\nHere then is an absolute gift to a person and his heirs \u201cwhich I hereby devise to him and his heirs and assigns, to and for his and their own use forever,\u201d with words accompanying the gift apparently importing a contingency or contingencies, but in reality only indicating certain circumstances, viz: \u201cthe death or the marriage of the widow,\u201d on the happening of either of which the estate vested by the gift should take effect in possession and enjoyment by the devisee or his heirs or assigns, and though the death of the devisee before the happening of either of such events prevented his personal enjoyment of the property, that enjoyment and possession on the happening of the event passed to the \u00bb heirs or assigns of the devisee, who were as much the object of the testator\u2019s bounty as the devisee himself\u2014a result in accordance with the express intention of the testator\u2014rather than to the heirs of the testator himself,\u2014a result I can find no indication in the will that the testator contemplated.\nTherefore I construe this devise as if the testator had said, \u201cI hereby devise lot No. 1 to Thomas and his heirs and assigns, to and for his and their own use forever, which he shall have and take (that is the possession and occupation) at the death or second marriage of my wife, if he be then living,\u201d and is no more or less than is contained in the paragraph which says, \u201c the devises shall take effect after and upon the death or marriage of my said wife, but not sooner.\u201d That is, in my opinion, shall take effect in possession, inasmuch as having devised for the benefit of the wife they could not take effect sooner. In other words, the intention of the testator was that the devise to Thomas and his heirs should confer a vested remainder, to take effect absolutely in possession on the marriage or decease of the widow\u2014either of which events removing the prior estate out of the way\u2014in effect, a devise of the whole estate instanter to Thomas and his heirs, with the exception of a partial interest carved out for the benefit of the widow. With respect to words of apparent contingency they are referable to the possession merely though the disposition of the ulterior interest should be, as Mr. Jarman expresses it, \u201cin terms which literally construe would seem to make such ulterior interest depend on the fact of the prior interest taking effect; in such cases it is considered that the testator merely uses the expressions of apparent contingency as descriptive of the state of events under which he conceives the ulterior gift will fall into possession\u201d; the object of the testator, apparently, being to make it clear beyond all doubt that though devised absolutely the interest in the wife was not to be interfered with\u2014that the devises shall be clearly understood to be subject to the life interest or until marriage of the wife.\nHaving given the estate to Thomas and his heirs, it never could have been the intention of the testator to die intestate as to such estate, if Thomas happened to die before the marriage or death of the wife. Had the testator intended in the event of Thomas so dying to take the estate away from his children or heirs, I think we should have found such intention clearly expressed to give it away from such children or heirs, or a devise or limitation over in case he so died. In this case there is, in my opinion, no residuary devise as to this property, and the reason seems to me obvious, because the testator intended to, and I think must have supposed he had, disposed of the fee simple. I cannot think the testator intended to create an intestacy, but on the contrary he intended that the property should go to his son Thomas and his heirs, and he or they should enter into the possession and enjoyment thereof on the decease or marriage of his wife.\nAnd therefore I think it may be said in this case as Lord Westbury in Edgeworth v. Edgeworth[28] says:\u2014\n* * * * *\nUpon the whole, therefore, we should unquestionably disturb that conclusion which is to be collected from the words of the will. We should depart from the settled canons of construction\u2014that you are not to construe words as importing a condition if they are fairly capable of another interpretation\u2014and we should entirely defeat the intention of this testator, which plainly was to make a complete disposition of the property, if we adopted a conclusion which would leave that intention baffled, and end in having it declared that there was an intestacy.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The only question argued on this appeal was as to the construction of a particular devise contained in the will of the Hon. Thos. Mackay, where as by the testator gave a certain parcel of land to one of his sons, Thomas Mackay the younger. The devise in question is in the words following:\u2014\nIn trust also that at the death or second marriage of my said wife, should such happen, my son Thomas, if he be then living, shall have and take lot No. 1 on the first concession of the Ottawa, of the Township of Gloucester, in the County of Carle ton, and Province of Canada, containing two hundred acres more or less, which I hereby devise to him, his heirs and assigns, to and for his and their own use forever.\nThe testator had previously given all his real and personal estate to trustees in trust for his wife for life or during her widowhood. The question of construction which has been raised as to this devise to the testator\u2019s son, Thomas Mackay the younger, is as to whether it was vested or contingent. I have arrived at a conclusion differing altogether from that of the Court of Chancery, and of two of the four judges who heard the cause in the Court of Appeal, and whose opinions were that Thomas Mackay, the devisee, took a vested estate in remainder subject to the life estate of his mother, for I am of opinion that the proper construction was that adopted by the late Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Patterson, viz.: That this devise was contingent on Thomas Mackay, the son, surviving his mother. It appears to me to be perfectly plain that the words, \u201cif he be then living shall have and take,\u201d have reference to the vesting of the estate and not merely to enjoyment or possession. If the words at the end of the paragraph, \u201cwhich I hereby devise to him, his heirs and assigns to and for his and their own use forever\u201d had been omitted, there would have been no doubt or question of this. In that case the only words of gift would have been, \u201cshall have and take\u201d and the vesting must necessarily have depended on them alone. The added words of limitation are, however, supposed to make a difference. The answer to this is, I think, that which Mr. Justice Patterson has pointed out namely, that the proper office of these words is to describe the quantity of the estate to be taken by the devisee, and that they can have no influence whatever on the question of the time of vesting. Again, as was forcibly argued by Mr. Gormully, if the words \u201cif he be then living\u201d are not construed as making the devise contingent they are redundant and useless, for the possession was already deferred until the death or second marriage of the testator\u2019s widow by the preceding provisions of the will. The authorities which go to show that, when the devise in remainder is to take effect upon the contingent determination of a prior estate, the estate in remainder vests notwithstanding the words of contingency, are not applicable, since the contingency here has no connection whatever with the life estate of the widow, which is only subject to a contingent determination in the event of her second marriage. Thomas Mackay surviving his mother is an event wholly independent of and collateral to the duration of the estate given to her. I do not think any reference to authorities in a case like the present, not depending on any general rule of construction, but merely on the interpretation of the language in which the testator has expressed himself in this particular instance, is called for or would be useful. Then, it does not appear to me to be a legitimate mode of arriving at the testator\u2019s intention to contrast this devise with those in favor of his other sons in which no reference is made to that now in question, and to speculate upon the testator\u2019s omission to give any reasons for making any distinctions between his son Thomas and his three other sons as regards the vesting of the estates which he gave to them in the properties respectively devised to them. Therefore, construing the words as they stand. I have no hesitation in determining that the proper conclusion is to hold the devise to Thomas Mackay a contingent remainder. If, however, in any subsequent part of his will the testator had so referred to this devise as to explain his intention to be to give a vested estate to Thomas, that of course would have the effect of changing the prim\u00e2 facie construction already indicated. I have, however, searched the will in vain for any such explanation. Nothing can be found in the slightest degree to alter or affect the terms of this gift. The words contained in the same numbered section of the will \u201cand I hereby will and direct that all the said devises in this section of my will mentioned and devised shall take effect from and after the death of my said wife, and not sooner\u201d are no more than an emphatic reiteration of the previous provisions that all the estates previously devised to the testator\u2019s sons, including Thomas, were to be subject to the life estate of his wife. Whether they related only to the possession or had reference to the vesting itself, and so cut down vested estates previously given to the three sons, other than Thomas, to contingent remainders, is a question we have not now to determine. If I had to determine it, however, I should have very little hesitation in holding, that they had not any such effect, and that the estates conferred upon the three sons, Alexander, John and Charles, by a previous clause of the will, and which I think were vested, remained unaffected by this provision. I may say in passing, though it is of no importance as regards the present decision, that the apparent uselessness of a construction which would attribute vested estates in remainder to the sons other than Thomas, liable to be divested if these sons should pre\u2011decease their mother and the effect of which would therefore be that during their mother\u2019s life these three sons took estates which they could not enjoy and which were not marketable, is no objection to the construction I adopt. If the language of the testator calls for it, as I think it does, all we have to do is to interpret his words according to settled rules, and we are not to permit ourselves to violate his directions because they appear to us to lead to a disposition of his property which would be wanting in practical utility. But it is sufficient for the present purpose to say, that whether the passage I have extracted relates to possession or vesting, it in neither case contains anything inconsistent with the construction which holds the devise of lot No. 1 to Thomas Mackay to be a contingent remainder.\nThen, the devise to Thomas being held to have been contingent, the subsequent disposition of this lot No. 1 in the event which happened of his death before his mother must depend upon the residuary clause beginning with the words \u201call other my lands, tenements, houses and hereditaments and real estate.\u201d Nothing can be better established than that a devise of other lands includes undisposed of interests in lands in which partial interests in contingent estates which have failed have been previously given, as upon a like principle a gift of \u201cunsettled lands\u201d includes unsettled interests in lands in which particular estates have been by the same will previously settled. Then it seems a totally inadmissible construction to say that the provisions containing the gift over in case of the death of any of the testator\u2019s children without issue, and the clause substituting the issue of children, who may die before the testator\u2019s widow, for their parent, does not apply to every devise and bequest, as well specific as residuary, contained in the will. The words of this clause, \u201cin the event of any of my children dying without legal issue before coming into possession of his or her share or shares of the property or money hereby devised or bequeathed them, the share or shares of such child or children to go to and be equally divided among the survivors, and the legal issue of such, if any, as shall have died leaving issue,\u201d are surely sufficiently comprehensive to include all previous gifts, as well residuary as specific, contained in the will, unless we are to attribute to the word \u201chereby,\u201d which primarily must mean \u201cby this will,\u201d some secondary meaning, which would be purely arbitrary since no context calls for it. I cannot conceive how the testator, desiring to make this clause applicable to every one of his dispositions, could have expressed himself more aptly and generally, and I am unable to follow the argument which seeks to confine this provision to the personal property mentioned in the next preceding clause. I am unable to accede to the proposition that the description of the property and the limitations show it to have been the testator\u2019s intention so to restrict it; the word \u201cproperty\u201d is comprehensive of lands and real estate, and is even more appropriate to describe such subjects than personalty, and there is nothing in the gift over to survivors, or the substitution of issue by the clause following it, inconsistent with a disposition of realty. Then, holding that this clause of survivorship applies to all the preceeding devises contained in the will, it requires no demonstration to show that the following clause,\u2014that substituting issue for parents\u2014also applies to the same subjects of disposition. It follows from this, that, even if we were to construe the devise to Thomas as vested instead of contingent, our judgment in the event, which has happened, of his death before his mother must be the same. I should add that I do not see anything in the substitutional clause inconsistent with holding that Thomas did not take a vested estate, whilst the other sons did take such an estate but one liable to be divested in the event of their deaths before their mother. This substitution of issue is consistent with both constructions.\nThen, if this lot No. 1 formed part of the residuary lands, and these residuary lands were included in these provisions as to survivorship and substitution, as I hold they were, the consequence, in the events which have happened, will be, that on the death of Elizabeth Keefer, although that occurred in the life time of her mother, her children who survived her took an absolute vested estate in remainder, not liable to failure on the death of any of the children before the tenant for life, but subject only to Mrs. Mackay\u2019s life estate, in one-fourth of this lot No. 4. I say they took it absolutely and not subject to failure in the event of death in Mrs. Mackay\u2019s life time; for, according to the most modern authorities, a substitutional gift to children of a parent\u2019s share is not subject by implication to a contingency to which the vesting or determination of the original share of the parent may have been subject[29]. I have already said, that I do not regard the passage in the will, by which the testator directs that all the devises in the fourth section of his will shall take effect from and after the death or marriage of his wife, as importing contingency, but merely postponement of enjoyment; but even if they were to be held as referring to the vesting, I should still be of opinion that they had no reference to the substitutional gifts to the children, although these, also, are comprised in the fourth section of the will though in a subsequent part of it.\nThe words used by the testator are that \u201cissue\u201d are to take the portion or share which would have belonged to his, her or their father or mother if then living. It is clear upon authority as indeed would almost necessarily be implied without it, that the word \u201cissue,\u201d thus used correlatively with \u201cfather or mother,\u201d means children[30]. The substitution is, however, to be restricted to those children who survived their mother; children who predeceased her, if any, are to be excluded. This also depends on a well settled rule applicable to substitutional gifts of a class of children for parents who die \u00bb before the happening of a particular event, and appears to proceed upon the principle that the testator is to be presumed not to have intended to substitute for a dead person one previously deceased[31]\nThe children of Mrs. Keefer of course take as amongst themselves as tenants in common and not as joint tenants by force of the statute law of Ontario, R.S.O. ch. 105, sec. 11.\nI have not considered that portion of the decree which relates to the lands devised by the testator other than lot No. 1, as I understood at the argument, and gathered from the way in which the appeal was presented by the appellant\u2019s factum, that the decree of the Court of Chancery in this respect was not objected to. For the same reason I say nothing about the partition or an account against the trustee. If any directions are required on these heads I suppose the parties will speak to the minutes.\nThe costs of all parties as well in this court as in both of the courts below, should, I think, be paid out of the estate of the Hon. Thos. Mackay, the testator.\nThe following minutes will sufficiently indicate the proper variations to be made in the decree:\u2014\nVary the decree of the Court of Chancery as follows: For the first paragraph substitute the following declaration.\n1. This court doth declare that lot No. 1 in the 1st Concession, on the Ottawa, in the Township of Gloucester, in the County of Carleton, in the will of the Hon. Thos. Mackay mentioned, was by the said will devised to the plaintiff in trust for the testator\u2019s son, Thomas Mackay the younger, for an estate in fee simple in remainder, subject to the life estate of the testator\u2019s widow, but that such estate in remainder was subject to the contingency of the said Thomas Mackay the younger surviving the said testator\u2019s widow, and that upon the death of the said Thomas Mackay the younger before his mother the said remainder failed.\nAnd that for the second paragraph of the said decree there be substituted the following declaration:\u2014\n2. And this court doth further declare that at and upon the death of Elizabeth Keefer in the pleadings mentioned, the plaintiff became and was seized of one undivided fourth part of the said lot No. 1 in trust for the surviving children of the said Elizabeth Keefer in remainder as hereinafter mentioned, and that the said children of the said Elizabeth Keefer, who survived her, thereupon became absolutely entitled to an equitable estate in fee simple in remainder expectant on the death or second marriage of the said testator\u2019s widow in one undivided fourth part of the said lot No. 1, as tenants in common. And that upon the death of the said Anne Crichton Mackay, the widow of the said testator, the said plaintiff became seized of the remaining undivided three-fourth parts of the said lot No. 1 in trust for Annie Keefer, Christine Mackay and Jessie Clark, in the pleadings named, and the said Annie Keefer, Christine Mackay and Jessie Clark became absolutely entitled to an equitable estate in the said remaining three undivided fourth parts of lot No. 1 as tenants in common in fee simple. 3. And this court doth in all other respects affirm the said decree and the order of the Court of Appeal.\n4. Order that the costs of all parties to this appeal be paid out of the estate of the Hon. Thos, Mackay.\nFOURNIER J. concurred with RITCHIE C.J.\nHENRY J.\u2014Thomas Mackay, through whom both parties in this case claim on the 1st September, 1885, executed his last will and testament by which he appointed his wife and his sons, Alexander, John, Charles and Thomas, executrix and executors thereof, and by it devised and bequeathed to his executrix and executors all his estate, real and personal, as follows:\u2014\nAll and singular, the moneys, debts, stocks, bills, bonds, mortgages, debentures and other securities; goods, chattels and effects, lands, tenements and hereditaments whatsoever and wheresoever situate and all interest in the same, of which I shall die possessed and to which I shall be in any way entitled at the time of my death, in trust for the several uses and purposes hereinafter mentioned and declared, and to be held and applied and disposed of as hereinafter mentioned and appointed, that is to say: First, for the payment of debts; and secondly, for payment of \u00a350 to the Bytown Protestant Hospital.\nThirdly.\u2014In the event of his wife surviving him in trust for her maintenance and support \u2018during her life time and for the maintenance and support of his children so long as they should live with their mother, &c., with directions that his wife, so long as she lived and continued his widow? should have the full right to possess and manage the property devised and bequeathed and the profits, &c., thereof, for such purposes, but in the event of her marrying again then for the payment out of the rents and profits, &c., to her of \u00a3500 annually, which annuity he charged on his said property and estate in lieu of dower.\nThe controversy which has arisen between the parties to this action is as to the construction of that part of the fourth devise, which is as follows:\u2014\nIn trust, also, that at the death or second marriage of my said wife, should such happen, my son Thomas, if he be then living, shall have and take lot No. 1, in the front concession, &c., which I hereby devise to him, his heirs and assigns to and for his or their own use forever.\nWhat then was the legal interest of Thomas at his father\u2019s death? Did he take a vested or contingent remainder? What did the testator intend? We must gather his intention from the words of the devise and from, the whole of the will. He devised and bequeathed all his estate, real and personal, to his executrix and executors in trust for the support of his widow and children during her life and widowhood, and while the children lived with her; and in trust, also, that at the death or second marriage of his wife, should such happen, his son Thomas, if he should be then living, should have and take lot No. 1. He then directs that his four sons, including Thomas, should have and take all his other real estate in the township of Gloucester, namely, lots two, three, four and five, in the same concession as lot No. 1, with all mills, houses and buildings thereon erected. Also, ten acres of land in the city of Ottawa (except a part sold to John McKinnon, Esq.) Also, Green Island near the mouth of Rideau river, with all mills, houses and buildings thereon erected\u2014all these properties he devised to his four sons (including Thomas), their heirs and assigns as tenants in common.\nThe testator devised his houses, lands, tenements and real estate, in the city of Montreal, to his four daughters Ann, Christina, Jessie and Elizabeth. All the devises and bequests in the will, except those to his wife, are appointed to take effect on the death of his wife or on her second marriage, if such should happen, and they included all his estate, real and personal, his wile in the meantime to have the use of all for her support and that of his children. And all his property then remaining undisposed of specially by his will to be divided equally amongst his then surviving children or their legal representatives.\nIt will thus be seen that the testator appointed for his son, Thomas, independently of the devise to him of lot No. 1, an equal share with his three other sons of all his estate, real and personal. Independently of lot No. 1 Thomas got the same share of his father\u2019s estate as his brothers, but the will provided for his getting lot No. 1 in addition, but, as the will provides, in case he should be alive at the death or second marriage of his mother. Lot No. 1, devised with all his other property to his executrix and executors, of whom Thomas was one, in trust for the benefit of his wife during her life or widowhood, was in trust, also, that at the death or second marriage of his wife, his son Thomas, if he should be then living, was to take it, which he thereby devised to him, his heirs and assigns. Taking the disposition of his estate by his will, why should the testator only in this one of the many devises contained in his will limit the devise of lot No. 1 by the use of the words \u201cif he be then living,\u201d if he did not intend them to have the natural construction such words should bear? I can readily conceive why something special or extra should be provided and appointed for one of a number of sons, if alive, to take it personally on the happening of some future event, when the same reason would call for leaving the same property to become only the property of the son\u2019s heirs or assigns. I can readily understand that a father might fairly decide to devise to each of his sons an equal share of certain real estate to go to them, their heirs and assigns as vested remainders, which I take to be the result of the devise to the four sons, and in case one of them named by him should be alive on the happening of a certain event, and on that condition that he should also receive something further. I am of the opinion that such was the intention of the testa- tor in regard to lot No. 1, and that he did not intend to devise that to the heirs or assigns of Thomas in case of his death before the death, or widowhood of his mother. The devise to Thomas, his heirs and assigns, was, therefore, in my opinion, contingent on Thomas being alive at the happening of the event named.\nA construction which gives a vested interest is, no doubt, favored by the courts where there is ambiguity or doubt, but where the intention to create a contingent estate or interest is reasonably evident or clear that intention must be respected and carried out. In this case the condition precedent to the vesting, that is, that Thomas shall be then living, is, I think, clearly expressed, and we cannot treat it as a devise creating a vested interest without going in opposition to the terms of the will.\nI think we must assume that the testator advisedly used the words \u201cif he be then living,\u201d as a condition precedent; or, amongst other reasons, why were they inserted at all? The testator has used words sufficiently strong and explicit to create a condition precedent, and what right have we to say they were not intended to have any effect, and that without any evidence intrinsic or otherwise to sustain such a declaration? I gather from a study of the whole will that the testator had his own reasons for imposing the condition precedent in question.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and judgment given for the appellants with costs to be paid out of the estate of the testator.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only question raised before us upon this appeal is: Was the estate devised to Thomas Mackay the younger, by the will of his father, in lot No. 1, in the front concession, on the Ottawa, in the township of Gloucester, an estate in fee vested in him upon the death of his father, subject to the estate of his mother therein during her life or widowhood, or was it an estate in fee contingent upon his being alive at the death or second marriage of his mother, which ever should first happen? The testator by his will devised and bequeathed all his real and personal estate of every description to his executrix and executors therein named, in trust for the several purposes particularly stated in sections numbered from one to five. In the third section he declared the trust to be as to the whole of his said property for his wife so long as she should live and continue his widow and unmarried, and by the fourth section, which is the one with which we have to deal, he declared the trust to be that at the death or second marriage of his said wife, should such happen, his son Thomas, if then living, should have and take the said lot No. 1 which he hereby devised to him, his heirs and assigns, to and for his and their own use forever, and that his sons, Alexander, John, Charles and Thomas, aforesaid, should have and take certain other real estate therein particularly mentioned, all which he thereby devised to his said sons, Alexander, John, Charles and Thomas, and to their heirs and assigns, to and for their own use forever, as tenants in common; subject, nevertheless, to the payment of the legacies and annuities by his said will bequeathed and made chargeable thereon; and that his daughters, Ann, Christine, Jessie and Elizabeth, should have and take all his houses, lands, tenements and real estate in the city of Montreal, which he thereby devised to his said daughters, their heirs and assigns, to and for their own use forever, as tenants in common. The section then proceeds:\u2014\nAnd I hereby will and direct that all the said devises in this section of my will mentioned and devised shall take effect upon from and after the said death or marriage of my said wife and not sooner.\nAnd all other my lands, tenements, houses and real estate of what nature and kind soever, and wheresoever situate, and as well in Great Britain as in Canada in trust to be sold, &c., &c., &c., and the rents, issues, profits, price, and proceeds thereof to be at the disposal of, my said wife so long as she shall live and remain unmarried for the support of herself and my said children, and after her death or marriage to be equally divided among my said children. * * * * * In trust, also, that at the death or marriage of my said wife as aforesaid all my personal property and estate then remaining shall be equally divided among my said children either in money or in kind as to my said executors shall seem best, allowing one year for the making of such distribution.\nProvided always, and I hereby will and bequeath, that in the event of any of my said children dying without legal issue before coming into possession of his or her share or shares of the property or money hereby devised or bequeathed, then the share or shares of such child or children to go to and be equally divided among the survivors and the legal issue of such, if any, as shall have died leaving issue.\nAnd in the event of any of my said children dying before coming into possession as aforesaid and leaving legal issue, such issue in every case to take the portion or share which would have belonged to his, her or their father or mother if then living, and to the husband or wife of each of my said children who shall after marriage and before coming into possession as aforesaid, die without issue, leaving such husband or wife, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds annually as an annuity payable put of and chargeable upon the share which would have belonged to such child if living.\nThe testator then bequeathed a silver cup presented, to him by Col. By, to his said wife during her life or widowhood, and at her death or second marriage he gave and bequeathed the same to his youngest son then living, and all his books he gave and bequeathed to his sons, Alexander, John, Charles and Thomas, to be taken possession of and equally divided among them at the death or second marriage of his said wife.\nIn the fifth and last section the testator made provision for the event of his wife dying before him.\nNow the testator by the third section of his will declared the trust purposes for which the devisees in trust should hold the whole of his property, real and personal, during the life or widowhood of his wife. In the fourth he declared the trust purposes as to the whole of his real estate and as to such of his personal estate as should remain at the death or second marriage of his wife, with a direction for the sale during the life of his wife and the conversion into personalty, subject to the control of his wife so long as she should live and remain unmarried for the support of herself and her said children, of the whole of his real estate not specifically devised to any one after the death or second marriage of his wife. In the first paragraph of this fourth section, which contains the declaration of trust as to the particular parcels of real estate devised to his sons, it is declared that at the death or second marriage of the testator\u2019s wife, his son Thomas, if then living, shall have and take the lot No. 1 now in question, which the testator thereby devised to him in fee simple, but these words \u201cif then living\u201d are not used in the sentence declaring the trust in respect of the lots devised to the testator\u2019s four sons, of whom Thomas is one as tenant in common. We cannot hold, as it appears to me, from the language used in this paragraph that the testator\u2019s intention was to give to his son Thomas an estate in fee in lot No. 1, contingent upon his being alive at the death or second marriage of his mother, and an estate in fee in the lands of which he was made devisee in common with his brothers, vested upon the testator\u2019s death, but subject to the estate during life or widowhood devised to the testator\u2019s wife. On the contrary, the estate of Thomas in the subject of both devises must, I think, be of the like nature\u2014vested or contingent\u2014and that it is the latter appears to me to be sufficiently clear from the context, for at the close of the next following paragraph of the same section which contains the declaration of trust as to the lands devised to the testator\u2019s daughters, in which paragraph the words \u201cif then living\u201d do not appear either, is added a sentence which applies to all the previous declarations of trust as well in respect of the lands devised to sons as in respect of those devised to daughters, namely:\u2014\nI will and declare that all said devises in this section of my will mentioned shall take effect upon, from and after the said death or marriage of my said wife and not sooner.\nThis sentence, as it appears to me, was inserted for the express purpose of supplying the want of the repetition of the words \u201cif then living\u201d in the sentences containing the declaration of trust in respect of the lands devised to the testator\u2019s four sons as tenants in common, and to his daughters also as tenants in common, and to remove all doubts which the absence of those words from those sentences might raise; and the effect of this sentence is, in my opinion, to put all the devises to the testator\u2019s sons and daughters alike upon the same footing; that is to say, devises in fee contingent upon their respectively being alive at the death or second marriage of the testator\u2019s wife. To construe this sentence as merely postponing the enjoyment in possession of lands vested by the will in the devisees in fee subject to the estate therein of the testator\u2019s wife during her life or widowhood, would be to make it wholly nugatory and to hold it to have been introduced for a purpose quite unnecessary; for the previous devise to the widow during her life or widowhood had already, without more, effectually postponed during her life and widowhood the enjoyment in possession by the sons and daughters respectively of the lands mentioned.\nTreating then all of these specific devises to sons and daughters to be alike contingent upon their respectively being alive at the death or second marriage of the testor\u2019s wife, the proviso in the section becomes naturally applicable to all the estate, real and personal, devised in the section, and makes the will perfect in providing for the disposition of the testator\u2019s estate in the event of the contingency, upon which the devises to the sons and daughters should take effect, not happening. I cannot see anything in the proviso to justify us in construing it as applying to personalty alone. The words are sufficient to comprehend realty as well as personalty, and if the previous devises of realty to sons and daughters be contingent, the application of the proviso to those lands is essentially necessary to make the will complete and perfect in its structure. The proper way to construe the will, as it appears to me, is to ascertain, if possible, and I think it is, from that portion of the section which contains the devises to sons and daughters what is the nature and extent of the estate so devised, for the purpose of determining whether the proviso can affect the lands comprehended in such devises, instead of reading the proviso by itself and limiting it to personalty, when the language is comprehensive enough to include realty, and so limiting it to deduce therefrom what is the extent and nature of the estate in realty devised by a previous sentence in the section. Moreover the construction of the proviso as applying to personalty alone is, as it appears to me, open to the objection that it might, so construed, defeat a purpose sufficiently clearly appearing in the proviso itself, by which it is provided that the husband or wife of each of the testator\u2019s children who should, after marriage and before coming into possession, die without issue leaving such husband or wife, should receive an annuity of fifty pounds, payable out of and chargeable upon the share which would have belonged to such child, if living. Now, as the personalty is left to the disposal of the testator\u2019s wife for the support of herself and the testator\u2019s children during the life or widowhood of his wife, and as it is only so much of such personalty as shall be remaining at her death or second marriage that is bequeathed to the children, it might be that nothing should remain to meet that bequest or not sufficient to secure out of it the payment of the annuities bequeathed to the husbands and wives of such of the testator\u2019s; children as should die without issue during the life of testator\u2019s wife. These annuities in such case would fail unless they are made payable out of, and chargeable upon, the share in realty as well as in the personalty that would have belonged to such child if living. Consistant, too, with this, is the devise in the first paragraph of the section by which the devise to the four sons as tenants in common is expressly made \u201csubject to the payment of the legacies and annuities in and by the will bequeathed and made chargeable thereon.\u201d Construing therefore the devises of realty to all of the testator\u2019s sons and daughters as contingent upon the event of their respectively being alive at the death or second marriage of the testator\u2019s wife, the whole will becomes consistent and complete in its structure, and for the above reasons I am of opinion that Thomas, the testator\u2019s son, did not take an estate in the lot No. 1 vested in him on the testator\u2019s death, but that the estate devised to him was contingent upon his being alive at the death of his mother, and as that contingency never happened the lot became subject to the limitations of the proviso.\nAppeal allowed with costs to be paid out of estate of Hon T.

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In this case a bill was filed by the plaintiff, Catherine Peterkin, for the redemption of a lot of land in the township of Dover conveyed by her and her husband to one James McFarlane in 1866. The allegations in the bill are as follows:\u2014\n\u201c1. That on and prior to the 31st day of August, A.D. 1866, the plaintiff was the owner of and seized in fee simple of the N.W. half of Lot No. 14, in the 13th Con. of the Township of Dover E., in the said County.\n2. Shortly before the date above mentioned, the plaintiff being in want of money, by her agent, one James Peterkin, applied to the defendant James McFarlane, (who has died pendente lite), to advance to her the sum of $500, on the security of the said land, and it was agreed by and between the plaintiff and the said deceased defendant, James McFarlane, that the said deceased defendant James McFarlane should advance to the plaintiff the said sum of $500, and that your complainant and her husband, in manner then required by law as to married women, should convey the said land as security for the repayment of the same.\n3. Accordingly on the said 31st day of August, 1866, in pursuance of such agreement, the said deceased defendant James McFarlane paid to the plaintiff the said sum of $500, and the plaintiff and her said husband thereupon by indenture dated and executed on the said last mentioned date, and made between the plaintiff and her husband of the one part, and the deceased defendant James McFarlane of the other part, conveyed the said land to the said deceased defendant James McFarlane, absolutely in fee simple.\n4. The said indenture though absolute in form was intended by the plaintiff, and it was expressly understood between her, the plaintiff, and the said defendant James McFarlane, since deceased, that it should stand only as a security for the re-payment of the said money from the date of payment of same to her, and that upon such re-payment the said deceased defendant James Farlane should re-convey the said land to the plaintiff free from all incumbrances.\n6. No money, except about ten dollars has been repaid to the said deceased defendant, James McFarlane, on account of the said sum so advanced, and the whole thereof is due with interest except the said ten dollars.\n7. That some time prior to the 13th day of June, A.D. 1871, the plaintiff had arranged a sale of one-half the said land in order to redeem the same and obtain a reconveyance from the said deceased defendant James McFarlane, and proposed to the said deceased defendant James McFarlane to do so, or to borrow money if he required it on the land and redeem it from him, but he then informed the plaintiff that he would not allow her to either sell the half of it or mortgage it, but that when she got the money for him otherwise than by selling or borrowing on the said land he would reconvey it to her\n8. That subsequently the plaintiff made an application to and offered to pay the said deceased defendant James McFarlane the said $500 and interest thereon and any costs he might be entitled to; but he refused to take the same, and he, the defendant, James McFarlane, since deceased, then professed and pretended that the said indenture being absolute in form he was not bound to receive the said money or to treat said indenture as a security, and claimed that having an absolute title thereunder, he was not bound to reconvey to the plaintiff on payment of said money and interest, that other parties took advantage of him when they could, and that he was bound to do the same with the plaintiff.\n9. That for some time prior to about and since the said last mentioned date the timber growing and being on said land became of great value, and the said defendant, James McFarlane, deceased, about the time of the last mentioned date in pursuance of his threat to the plaintiff to treat the said conveyance as absolute and thereby to cheat and defraud her, did absolutely sell and convey the said land by indenture of bargain and sale to the defendants, Colin H. Rose and Duncan McKenzie, who were co-partners at the time in obtaining, manufacturing and selling timber, sawlogs, cordwood, and staves, said indenture bearing date the said 13th June, A.D. 1871, for the consideration of to wit $1,200.\n10. That prior to the sale and conveyance of the said land by the said deceased defendant, James McFarlane, to the said defendants, Colin H. Rose and Duncan McKenzie, the said last named defendants, had full knowledge and actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to said land and of her right to redeem the same on re-payment of the said money to the said deceased defendant, James McFarlane, and took the same from the deceased defendant, James McFarlane, with full notice and knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and right thereto.\n11. That by indenture of bargain and sale bearing date 21st June, 1872, the said defendants, Colin H. Rose and Duncan McKenzie, having previously cut and removed trees, timber and wood from the said land, of very great value, to wit over $2,000, conveyed the said land to the defendant, Thomas Burke, who, prior to the purchase, sale and conveyance of the said land by the said deceased defendant, James McFarlane, to the defendants Colin H. Rose and Duncan McKenzie, and by them to him, had full knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and right of redemption, and became a purchaser thereof with notice of the premises.\n11a. The said defendants, Colin H. Rose, Duncan McKenzie and Thomas Burke, on their part, however, now contend that they are purchasers for value of the said land, without notice or knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\n12. That by an indenture by way of Mortgage bearing date the 29th day of June, A.D. 1872, the said defendant Thomas Burke, conveyed the said land to the defendants Colin H. Rose and Duncan McKenzie, to secure the payment of the sum of $1,050 and interest, which appears by the records of the Registry Office of the county of Kent to have been assigned by them to one Zenos W. Watson, by deed of assignment bearing date the 12th July, A.D. 1872.\u201d\nThe defendants Colin H. Rose and Thomas Burke by their answers admit, for the purposes of this suit, the truth of the allegations contained in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th 9th and 12th paragraphs of the plaintiff\u2019s bill herein.\nBut Rose says he was not aware that the land after conveyance to J. McFarlane and prior to purchase by him and Duncan McKenzie was ever claimed to be plaintiffs, and was first informed of such claim 80th \u2022December, \u201878, when served with bill. That the purchase by him and McKenzie from McFarlane was in good faith and upon good and valuable consideration, viz., $1,200 and without notice of plaintiff\u2019s claim; that his and McKenzie\u2019s conveyance to Burke was with no knowledge of plaintiffs claim, nor does he believe Burke had any knowledge thereof.\nBurke says he was not aware that Rose and McKenzie had any notice of plaintiffs claim prior to the purchase or during time they owned land, and is informed and believes they had no notice prior to sale to him; that purchase by Rose and McKenzie from McFarlane was bon\u00e2 fide and upon good and valuable consideration; that he is not aware that plaintiff ever claimed to have any claim after sale to McFarlane and prior to sale by C.H. Rose and McKenzie to himself; is informed, and believes plaintiff never claimed any right thereto during time same was owned by Rose and McKenzie; that he purchased but not with notice of any claim or right of redemption, but bon\u00e2 fide and for good and valuable consideration, viz, $1,550 and without any notice of any claim of plaintiff thereto.\nDuncan McKenzie answers\u2014admitting and answering in the same way as Rose\u2014so that plaintiffs case is admitted with the exception of the allegations that Rose and McKenzie had prior to sale by McFarlane to them full knowledge and actual notice of plaintiffs claim, and that Burke prior to sale by McFarlane to Rose and McKenzie, and by them to him had full knowledge of plaintiffs claim and right of redemption, and became a purchaser thereof with such notice.\nThe case was heard on this state of the pleadings and the court declared the conveyance from plaintiff to McFarlane was intended to be and was only a security for the re-payment to McFarlane of $500 advanced by him to plaintiff on 31st August, 1866, with interest at 6 per cent.\n\u201c2. And the court doth \u2018further declare that the defendants Colin H. Rose and Duncan McKenzie, purchased the said lands from the said James McFarlane, deceased, with full knowledge and actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to said lands, and her right to redeem the same, and doth order and decree the same accordingly.\u2019\n3. And the court doth further declare that the defendant Thomas Burke purchased the said lands from the said defendants Colin H. Rose and Duncan McKenzie, with full knowledge and actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to said lands, and of her right to redeem the same, and doth order and decree the same accordingly.\n4. And the court doth further order and decree that an injunction do issue out of and under the seal of this court, perpetually restraining the said defendant Thomas Burke, his servants, workmen and agents, from committing any wastes, spoil or destruction on the said lands.\n5. And the court doth further order and decree that it be referred to the master of this court at Chatham, to take an account of the amount still due by the plaintiff in respect of the advance of five hundred dollars to her by the said James McFarlane, deceased, in the first paragraph here of mentioned, and also an account of the value of the timber, trees, and wood cut down and removed from the said lands by the defendants, or any of them, or by the said James McFarlane in his lifetime, and an account of all other waste committed by them or any of them.\n6. And in the event of the said master finding that the amount found due by the defendants or any of them exceeds the amount found due by the plaintiff, or in the event of the said master finding that the amount found due by the defendants, or any of them is less than the amount found due by the plaintiffs, then upon payment by the plaintiff to the defendant Thomas Burke of the balance found due by her within six months after the said master shall have made his report, and at such time and place as the said master shall appoint, this court doth further order and decree that the defendants do assign and convey the said lands to the plaintiff free and clear of all incumbrances done by them or any of them; such conveyance to be settled by the said master in case the parties differ, and to deliver up to the plaintiff, upon oath, all deeds and writings in their or any of their custody or power, relating to the said lands.\n7. And this court doth further order and decree that the defendants do pay to the plaintiff what, if anything, shall be found due by them, or any of them, in excess of the amount found due by the plaintiff, and her costs of this suit up to and inclusive of this decree, forthwith after taxation thereof by the said master. 8. And the said master is to enquire and state what sum, if any, was due by the plaintiff to the said James McFarlane, at the time of the tender to him by the plaintiff, to pay the amount then due, in the eighth paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s amended bill mentioned, and whether the sum so tendered was equal to, greater or less, than the amount then due, and in the event of the said master finding that the sum so tendered was equal to or greater than the amount then due, he is to tax to the plaintiff her costs of this suit subsequent to this decree, which are to be deducted from the amount, if anything, found due by her as aforesaid, but in the event of the said master finding that the amount so tendered was less than the amount then, due he is to tax to the defendant John P. Alma, his costs subsequent to this decree, which are to be added to the amount, if any, found due by the plaintiff as aforesaid.\n9. And this court doth further order that the defendant Thomas Burke do forthwith pay to the plaintiff ten dollars, her costs of the motion to vary the minutes of this decree, and to the defendant John P. Alma, five dollars, his costs of said motion.\u201d\nBurke appealed and the court of Appeal allowed the appeal and allowed the appellant to file a supplemental answer setting up the defence of the registry laws and such other defence as he may be advised, plaintiff to be at liberty to proceed to a second hearing in the court below.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court where his appeal was dismissed. Burke filed his supplemental answer, in which he says he gave Rose and McKenzie a mortgage to secure a balance of the purchase money which Rose and McKenzie since assigned to Watson; that he had no notice of plaintiffs claim and purchased and paid the money and gave the mortgage in good faith in reliance on the title as shown by the records of the registry office, and claims he is a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser and claims the benefit and protection of the registry laws thereupon.\nThereupon the following replication was filed on the 14th day of March, 1881:\u2014\n\u201cThe plaintiff joins issue on the supplemental answer of the defendant, Thomas Burke, filed herein.\nThe defendant C.E. Pegley, by petition dated 26th August, 1880, sought to re-open the suit under the first decree as to the defendants, other than the appellant Thomas Burke, by praying for leave to file a supplemental answer.\nOn the 21st day of September, A.D. 1880, an order was made by the referee allowing the said petitioner to file a supplemental answer. From this order the plaintiffs appealed to a judge of the Court of Chancery, and upon hearing of such appeal the Hon. V.C. Proudfoot allowed such appeal with costs. The said Pegley appealed from said last mentioned order to the Court of Appeal, and his appeal by the decision of said court was dismissed with costs.\u201d\nNotice of setting down for examination of witnesses and hearing on the issue raised by the supplementary answer of Thomas Burke was served, and the cause duly came on on the 81st March, 1881. Before the evidence was gone into a question was raised as to what issues were before the court, and it was contended by the defendants\u2019 counsel that the whole matter was re-opened, and that the plaintiff was obliged to prove not only notice to the different purchasers, but also the right of redemption. The learned Chancellor decided that the case was reopened as to the question of notice under the supplemental answer of Thomas Burke, and that that was the only issue before the court, as it affected Thomas Burke.\nMr Justice Patterson, in his judgment on the appeal of Thomas Burke on the refusal of the Chancellor to allow Burke to amend and plead the registry act, says:\u2014\nWe have no report of the judgment delivered by the learned Chancellor, nor any information as to the views taken by him of the evidence, or of the opinion he may have formed of the witnesses examined before him.\nIn the judgment delivered on this second hearing we are not left in doubt as to what those views are. The learned Chancellor says:\u2014\nThe defendant Burke having appealed from my decree giving to the plaintiff a right to redeem the land sold by McFarlane to McKenzie and Rose, and sold by them to Burke, and having been allowed by the Court of Appeal to set up the registration of his title, by supplemental answer, an indulgence which I had refused to him, the cause was again carried down to a hearing before me at the last sitting of the court at Chatham; when further evidence was given on both sides.\nBefore dealing with the further evidence I desire to say that I refused the indulgences asked for by Burke, because I was satisfied by the evidence which was taken viv\u00e2 voce before me, that the defence set up was not a righteous one. There was much in the evidence of Burke and McKenzie, especially in that of Burke, which I discredited. I thought him untruthful, and that the weight of evidence upon the question of notice greatly preponderated in favor of the plaintiff I formed my judgment, of course, not only from the words uttered by the respective witnesses, but from their demeanor, and the many circumstances which aid a judge of fact before whom evidence is given, to form correct judgment as to its truthfulness, and the weight properly due to it.\nAt the recent hearing I did not, any more than at the former hearing, consider it to be an open question whether or not the dealing between the plaintiff (by her agent James Peterkin), and McFarlane, was a security for the repayment of an advance of money. This fact is so distinctly admitted by the answer of Rose and Burke who answered together, and by the separate answer of McKenzie, that no other evidence of it could be required. Evidence of the fact was indeed given, but I think upon all but one occasion it was given incidentally in the giving of evidence of notice to McKenzie and Burke. I have no reason to suppose that the admissions contained in the answers were made by mistake.\nThe answers are sworn, and I see no reason to doubt that the admissions were made because the fact admitted had been ascertained to be true. At the recent hearing, besides the evidence then given, the evidence given at the previous hearing was before me. My Brother Proudfoot, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal, has commented upon the answer and the evidence of McKenzie. His comment is so accurate and just that I cannot do better than adopt it.\nAt the recent hearing the plaintiff and James and Alexander Peterkin reiterated the evidence given by them at the previous hearing.\nAt this hearing the learned Chancellor says material further evidence of notice to Burke was given at the last hearing, the substance of which he gives, and then observes: Burke was present in court while this evidence was given, but was not called as a witness, his counsel saying that they relied upon the evidence given by him at the former hearing He was called as to one point by the plaintiff, but said nothing as to the evidence which had just been given in his presence. The Chancellor concludes:\u2014\nNotice to McKenzie is proved direct from the plaintiff herself, with a good deal of corroborative evidence from other witnesses. Actual notice to Burke is proved to my mind quite as satisfactorily. He learned what claim was made by the plaintiff from herself and from James Peterkin. And the evidence given at the recent hearing in addition to that at the former hearing, proves that he had knowledge, not from one quarter only, but from several, of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and of its nature. His own admissions to Kime and Hardy are corroborative of the same fact. To put it at the lowest, the evidence given at the recent hearing makes it impossible to believe the assertion of Burke that he had not, before he purchased, notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. It has been said in this case as it has been said in other cases, that it is almost incredible that a man should purchase when he knows of a claim in another, to or upon the same land. But it is not every man that knows of the equitable doctrine that where a man has such notice of title in another as would make his purchase inequitable, an exception is created thereby, to the effect given generally by the Act of Registration. Burke is not the first man who has thought that (to use his own words) if a man has a clear deed he can give a clear deed; and who, to his cost, has acted upon that belief. That belief, and reliance upon advice which he understood (perhaps mistakenly) to have been given to him, that he could purchase, are, I can scarcely doubt, the key to his conduct, In my judgment, the evidence has brought home both to McKenzie and to himself notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and I think his abstaining from giving evidence at the recent hearing may properly be attributed to a consciousness that he could not deny the evidence given upon that occasion.\nThe redeemable character of the transaction is admitted on the pleadings and is not now, in my opinion, open to discussion. I think, therefore, the only point we have to consider in this case is: Was the learned Chancellor wrong in finding, as a matter of fact, that McKenzie and Burke had actual notice? If the parties had actual notice, I have no doubt this would defeat the registered title.\nAfter carefully considering the evidence and reading the judgments delivered in this case by the learned Chancellor and the learned Judges in the Court of Appeal, I am unable to say that the Chancellor was wrong in the conclusion at which he arrived on this point, and therefore, I think, the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that we ought to dismiss this appeal. I agree with the late Chancellor and Mr. Justice Proudfoot that the only question open on the second hearing, was the defence of the registry act set up by the supplemental answer of Thomas Burke. By the original decree pronounced on the 18th of October, 1876, all questions in the cause which were open at the original hearing were concluded. By the order of the Court of Appeal of the 10th March, 1879, (subsequently affirmed on an appeal to this court) the defendant, Thomas Burke, was allowed to file a supplemental answer \u201csetting up the defence of the registry laws or such other defence as he might be advised.\u201d And it was also ordered \u201cthat for that purpose the replication filed in the court below be withdrawn if necessary, and that the plaintiff be at liberty to proceed to a second hearing of the cause in the court below.\u201d This order does not, however, disturb the decree which stands undischarged and unaltered, except in so far as it might, in the event, be affected by the determination of the questions to be raised by the supplemental answer of Thomas Burke, and even to that extent only by implication, for the order does not in terms provide for any variation of the decree either presently or prospective. The only additional defence set up by the supplemental answer of Thomas Burke was that of the registry laws. It appears to me, therefore, that the second hearing was properly restricted to a trial of the questions arising on that defence, namely; whether the defendant, Thomas Burke, had duly registered his conveyance; whether he had, at the time he acquired his title, actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s equity; and whether, if he had such notice, that disentitled him, in equity, to the protection of the registry laws. It is impossible to see how the Chancellor could have admitted further evidence of defences raised upon the original record, concluded, as all such questions were, by a decree which had never been vacated, and which he, at the hearing, had no power to discharge. It would, no doubt, have been better if the original decree had been altogether discharged by the order of the Court of Appeal, with leave to the parties to make use, for the purposes of the second hearing, of the depositions already taken, and to give such further and additional evidence as they might be able to bring forward.\nI am able to say that when the practice was first introduced in the Court of Chancery of permitting retrials on the ground of the discovery of new evidence, this was the form of order adopted in such cases by some of the judges, and it has the merit of saving expense without occasioning any inconvenience provided the second hearing is before the same judge as the first, This, however, was not the course adopted by the Court of Appeal; the directions of the first decree which determined the issues raised by the defendants other than Thomas Burke, as well as those arising upon the original answer of Thomas Burke, were not displaced, and so the cause was necessarily heard piece meal, and therefore we find no one completed decree containing the decision of the court which has to be sought for partly in the decree of October, 1876, and partly in that of June, 1881. The result of this was that when this cause came before the Court of Appeal the original decree was res judicata, and unappealable by lapse of time, no leave to appeal against it having been given, and so the present appeal must be regarded, as it was properly treated by Mr, Justice Proudfoot, as an appeal from the decision of the Chancellor on the single question of the registry laws which was alone open on the second hearing. If this is a correct conclusion it sufficiently accounts for the omission of the counsel for the appellant to raise the question, which has so fully been considered in the judgments of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, as to the nature and effect of the transaction between Mrs. Peterkin and McFarlane, of which it was incumbent to prove notice, whether it was a conditional sale or a mortgage\u2014a point which appears not to have been taken at the argument, inasmuch as Mr. Justice Patterson says his attention was first called to it by other members of the court after the appeal had been heard. This fact confirms the view I take as to the effect of the order on the first appeal, for the counsel for the appellant would scarcely have passed over such a point had he supposed it to have been open. It appears to me, however, that upon the evidence and the admissions in the answers the Chancellor\u2019s conclusions that the transaction was a mortgage and not a conditional sale were entirely correct. Whether or not the witnesses who gave such evidence were entitled to credit, and whether their testimony was entitled to prevail against that of the witnesses which conflicted with it, was a question for the judge who heard and saw the witnesses and upon which his finding should be held final. Assuming the evidence of James Peterkin to be entitled to credit, as the Chancellor must from his finding have held it to have been, I should have thought it very difficult to say, upon the statement of the facts which we find in his deposition, that a conditional sale and not a mortgage was the true character of the transaction which took place with McFarlane.\nJames Peterkin\u2019s own account is as follows:\u2014\nI am brother-in-law of plaintiff\u2019s. I saw McFarlane about land in question when Mrs, Peterkin owned it. She sent me to Thompson, son-in-law of McFarlane, asking him to advance money on a mortgage on the property. I saw McFarlane about the land. He came with me out of the house to the shop, and said he would give $500 on the lot and his lifetime to redeem it. I stayed at McFarlane\u2019s house all night, and he next morning made me the offer of advancing $500 on the place in the morning, with his lifetime to redeem it. I then went out to Mrs. Peterkin with a deed which was signed the next day. I told her of the arrangement, and she was agreeable. This land was then worth about $1,000. I had conversation with McFarlane about the land before his death, as it was reported that he was going to sell the place. Mrs. Peterkin sent me to ask him whether the half might not be sold so that the other half might be redeemed. I went to him and spoke to him and he seemed to be agreeable; all he wanted he said was his money.\nIt therefore appears that Peterkin went to McFarlane for the purpose of borrowing money on the security of the land; that he was only authorized by the plaintiff to raise a loan or mortgage not to negotiate a sale; that (as it must be implied) the application actually made was for an advance by way of loan, and that that application was acceded to by McFarlane. The case is not to be looked at solely from the point of view of the party who advanced the money, but we are to consider what was said and done by both parties to the transaction. There is nothing, so far as I can see, in this statement (which for the purposes of appeal we are compelled to take as a correct narrative of what actually occurred) showing any intention on the part of the Peterkins to make an absolute sale subject to a right of re-purchase. I take it to be clear that if a man goes to another and asks for a loan on the security of land and receives for answer, \u201cyes, provided you give me an absolute deed of the land,\u201d that that would beyond all doubt be a mortgage and not a sale. Then, if he adds, \u201cand you shall have my lifetime to redeem it,\u201d can that make any difference? For this is the precise question here. I cannot see that it would. It is no answer to say that there was no loan because McFarlane had no right to recover the money. That is clearly false reasoning, for if there was a loan there was a right to sue for the money as soon as the term of credit expired, and the very question involved in that of mortgage or no mortgage is: Was there or not a loan and a right to sue for recovery of the money? Where the party asking for the money clearly intends a mortgage and nothing else, and the terms of the transaction or the conduct of the other parties do not positively exclude the character of loan, I take it that it must be so considered.\nIt has often occurred to me that where an absolute deed is given as a security, and where there has been no professional intervention originally in arranging the terms of the transaction, that misunderstanding frequently arises from the mistaken views which the party who advances the money takes of the legal effect of the transaction, in erroneously assuming that an absolute deed gives him an irredeemable right, and that I think is an admissible hypothesis here.\nBut what I found my opinion upon is this:\u2014Here there was an application for a loan and for nothing but a loan; it was acceded to, nothing being said between the parties as to a sale, and no intention of selling on the part of the grantor being directly proved or to be inferred; but the party to whom the proposition is made carries it out upon terms as to re-payment not inconsistent with a loan, and in a form which a Court of Equity says shall not affect the right of redemption, and which is therefore also consistent with the assumption that it was a loan. In such a case I should unhesitatingly hold that the true character of the transaction was a mortgage, and not a sale subject to a right of re-purchase, and I should feel that if I did not so hold I should be overturning principles of decision which, having been recognized by the Court of Chancery for nearly forty years (at least since the year 1849), have become part of the established law of property. But when we consider that this point of a conditional sale was never pleaded in the answers, nor raised either in appeal or in the court of first instance, but that on the contrary the defendants in their sworn answers admit that the transaction was a mortgage, I should have thought it impossible to reverse a decree proceeding as much upon the implied admissions of the parties as upon anything else. With what justice could this decree now be reversed when, for all that appears, the plaintiff might, if the point of the conditional sale had been raised by the answer and she had thus been put to proof respecting it, have brought forward overwhelming evidence of her case by proving admissions made by McFarlane or otherwise, and if the decree could not for this reason be reversed, would it be just or reasonable now, some seven years after the original decree was made, to discharge that decree and permit a supplemental answer to be filed, and send the parties down to a third hearing, when no application is made by the defendants themselves for any such indulgence? On the whole, looking at the state of the\u2019 pleadings and the state of the proceedings, this question now raised here in the appellant\u2019s factum and in argument, although not argued in the Court of Appeal, seems to me to be wholly untenable.\nThe question upon which this appeal must therefore depend is that raised by the supplemental answer of Thomas Burke, namely, his claim to priority under the registry laws. For the purpose of postponing a registered instrument Courts of Equity, except in the instance of a single decision which I will presently refer to, have always required actual and direct, as distinguished from merely constructive, notice. What such actual and direct notice is may well be ascertained very shortly by defining constructive notice, and then taking actual notice to be knowledge, not presumed as in the case of constructive notice, but shown to be actually brought home to the party to be charged with it, either by proof of his own admission or by the evidence of witnesses who are able to establish that the very fact, of which notice is to be established, not something which would have led to the discovery of the fact if an enquiry had been pursued, was brought to his knowledge. In Jones v. Smith[2] Sir James Wigram, V.C., there says that constructive notice occurs in the following cases:\nFirst, cases in which the party charged has had actual notice that the property in dispute was in fact charged, incumbered or in some way affected and the court has thereupon bound him with constructive notice of facts and instruments, to a knowledge of which he could have been led by an inquiry after the charge, incumbrance or other circumstance affecting the property, of which he had actual notice; and secondly, cases in which the court had been satisfied from the evidence before it that the party charged had designedly abstained from enquiry for the very purpose of avoiding notice.\nNotice of the kind first described, which merely puts the party on enquiry as to the facts of which it is material he should have knowledge, is clearly insufficient to postpone a registered instrument. But it is not to be assumed from this that actual notice to an agent will not bind the principal for the purpose in question. Notice of this latter kind, to which Lord Chelmsford has given the name of imputed notice, being treated as actual notice to the principal and that whatever the character of the agency may be, whether in the case of principal or agent strictly so called, or in that of one partner acting for the partnership, or a trustee for his cestui que trust, in all these cases actual notice to the agent is held to be as effectual to postpone a registered instrument as if given to the principal directly[3].\nIn a case of Wormald v. Maitland[4], Stuart V.C. held that constructive notice was sufficient to postpone a registered deed. But this case has been distinctly overruled in Ireland by Russell v. Cashell[5], by Brewster Lord Chancellor, and in England in Chadwick v. Turner[6], where Turner L.J. says that notice for this purpose \u201cmust be clear and distinct and amounting in fact to fraud.\u201d\nApplying the law as thus stated to the circumstances of the present case the fact of which it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove actual notice was not that Mrs. Peterkin had some undefined interest in the land, but that she had a right to redeem or recover the land or, in other words, that Macfarlane acquired the land as a security for money lent, and held it as a mortgagee.\nWhat the learned judges who dissented in the Court of Appeal say however is this\u2014whilst they do not propose directly to open the whole case so as to treat the first decree as erroneous for giving effect to a right of redemption when there was only right of repurchase, yet, in effect, they do this indirectly when they come to deal with the secondary question of notice by holding that there having been originally, as between Macfarlane and the plaintiff, no right of redemption, notice of a right to redeem is unavailing. This is in effect to nullify the decree which, as I have already endeavoured to show, was res judicata, making the law between the parties and entirely concluding the question of mortgage or no mortgage. It being then an established fact that the conveyance to Macfarlane was, in equity, a mere mortgage, the notice to be proven is notice of that fact and of that fact only. I am also prepared to hold that, putting the decree aside altogether, the evidence and the admissions in the answers sufficiently show that the transaction was really a mortgage and not a sale.\nAs regards the case of Barnhart v. Greenshields[7], that was not a case of the registry laws at all, an observation which is of course in the defendant\u2019s favor. What is there said as to notice coming from strangers was extra judicial, as the real ground of the decision was that the notice, even if it had come from a party interested, was notice of a fact too remotely connected with the fact of which notice had to be made out, to put the parties on enquiry; but accepting what is there said as giving the correct rule by which to test the evidence in the present case, it may be held that if there was no other evidence of notice here than that alleged to have been received by these defendants in conversation with strangers, that would not be sufficient.\nIt is to be remarked that the supplemental answer filed by Thomas Burke under the order of the Court of Appeal permitting him to set up in that way the defence of the Registry laws or such other defence as he might be advised does not properly and sufficiently plead this defence. What should have been pleaded was that the defendant Thomas Burke had duly registered his deed, accompanied by a denial of the allegations of notice in the bill at the time of registration; and the registration of the deed by which the lands were conveyed to. Rose and McKenzie should have been pleaded in the same way, accompanied by a similar denial of notice to them at the time of registration. This however is not the mode of pleading adopted, but it is alleged that when Thomas Burke purchased, the title was a registered title and that he purchased in reliance on the title \u201cas shown by the records of the registry office\u201d; there being no denial of the notice to Rose and McKenzie most distinctly and accurately charged by the 11th paragraph of the bill, nor any allegation that the conveyance to Thomas Burke was ever registered (indeed the registration of this last deed nowhere appears in the pleadings), and the only allegation of the registration of the deed to Rose and McKenzie is that included in the statement, already mentioned, that the title was a registered title when Thomas Burke purchased. This was manifestly not a proper mode of pleading and technically it was insufficient. After the great indulgence extended to the defendant by permitting this defence to be set up after decree, it would seem to be no hardship on the defendant to require that he should plead the defence he was permitted to add with reasonable precision and certainty, and in such a way as to show that the registry laws really did constitute a defence. As regards the defendant Thomas Burke I am not however disposed to decide the case on the narrow ground of a point of pleading. But as regards the registration of the deed to Rose and McKenzie the objection to the pleading is not merely technical but is substantial, and I think it is incumbent on us to hold, in accordance with the opinion of Mr. Justice Proudfoot, that the defence of the registry laws as applicable to the conveyance to them was not set up and was not intended to be set up, and therefore that the defence in question was confined to the conveyance to Thomas Burke, and that the plaintiff was consequently only called upon to prove notice to that defendant.\nI am of opinion that the evidence at the first hearing, without more, was amply sufficient for the plaintiff\u2019s purpose in this respect, and was such that, taken in connection with the Chancellor\u2019s findings upon it in favor of the plaintiff, it ought to have been held a conclusive answer to the application to let in the supplemental defence; and had I been present when the appeal to this court was heard I should certainly have ventured to express this opinion The evidence of notice I refer to is that contained in the deposition of the plaintiff herself and of James Peterkin; the latter I do not consider a stranger but as a person who throughout the whole of the transactions with reference to this land acted as the agent of the plaintiff. James Peterkin, it is indeed suggested, had some interest in the land, but however this might have affected the credit to be given to his testimony by the judge in whose presence he was examined, it is otherwise a matter with which these defendants have no concern. Mrs. Peterkin in her evidence at the first trial says;\u2014\nTalked with Thomas Burke about the land. That was after the conversation with McKenzie, and the spring before McFarlane sold it. He came to the house to see if McFarlane had agreed to sell half of the land so that the other half could be redeemed. Burke was going to buy half if we could arrange about the other half. I told him McFarlane would not sell half to redeem the other. Burke asked me if McFarlane had got a clear deed of the place, and I said he had got a clear deed, giving McFarlane\u2019s lifetime to redeem it, or as soon as the money was made up. Burke said he thought that if McFarlane had a clear deed, that he could give a clear deed. I told him he could give him a clear deed but not a good title. Burke said that if James Peterkin took some one to McFarlane that he would be a strange uncle if he would not do right. McFarlane was Peterkin\u2019s uncle by marriage.\nJames Peterkin, in his deposition taken at the first hearing, is equally explicit as to notice to Burke He says:\u2014\nBurke and I had some talk as to the way the property stood. I told Burke that the property was Mrs. Peterkin\u2019s, and that I was doing the business for her. Burke wanted me to go to McFarlane and reason the thing with him. But I told Burke I did not think it was of any use, as I had done the best I could. I explained to Burke that McFarlane had got a deed of the land, but that he had given Mrs. Peterkin his lifetime to redeem it.\nI told Burke how much money McFarlane had advanced and that $500 was the amount required to redeem it.\nIf this is not (subject, of course, to the weight and credit to be attached to the witnesses) sufficient proof of notice, I am at a loss to know how notice could ever be proved.\nIt is direct actual notice that although McFarlane had an absolute conveyance of the land it was redeemable during his lifetime, a strictly true and accurate description of the agreement which had been made with McFarlane, as had been determined by a decree which at the time of the appeal was not open to question. The actual notice required is of course actual notice of facts and not of conclusions of law; it was not requisite that the plaintiff and James Peterkin should, in order to make what they told Burke sufficient notice, have gone further and stated that in legal effect the facts they communicated to him made McFarlane in law a mortgagee of the land. Upon this principle, had the transaction been a conditional sale with a sufficient memorandum in writing, I should still have thought this was sufficient actual notice of it. It is also to be said of this evidence that it establishes notice, not from strangers but from the plaintiff herself and her agent, and it was not in the course of a mere casual conversation that the statements were made, but when Burke was contemplating and in negotiation about a purchase of part of the property and was making enquiries about the title with a view to such purchase. Having regard to the nature of the evidence of notice at the first hearing, and to the consideration that the Chancellor had given credit to the witnesses, I should have thought that it would have been proper, in giving the defendant Thomas Burke leave to set up the registry laws, to have confined any further proceedings in the Court of Chancery to a mere argument of the question of law arising upon the 68th section of the registry act. This, however, was not done, and on the 31st March, 1881, nearly six years after the first trial, the issue went down to a second hearing before the same judge, when the same witnesses were again examined, but Thomas Burke, who on the first trial had given evidence on his own behalf and then denied notice, did not, on this subsequent occasion, venture to repeat his denial, though he was called on another point.\nMrs. Peterkin\u2019s evidence at the second trial, on the material point, was as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Had you ever any talk with Burke? A.\u2014Yes, I had some talk with Mr. Burke.\nHis Lordship\u2014That was Thomas? A.\u2014Yes.\nMr. Boyd\u2014Was it Thos. Burke? A.\u2014Yes; he came to the house and asked me if McFarlane was agreed to sell one half of the land so as to redeem the other; Thomas Burke called at the house and asked me if Thomas was agreed to sell one-half so that we could redeem the other, and I told him I was not agreed to sell one-half so as to get the other redeemed, and he asked me who deeded the land to McFarlane, and I told him I did, and he asked me what kind of a deed I gave him, and I told him a clear deed, and Burke said he thought if McFarlane got a clear deed he could give a clear deed, and I told him he might give him a clear deed but not a good title, and I told him on account of the claim against it, that I was given McFarlane\u2019s lifetime to redeem it. Q.\u2014When was this? A.\u2014It was the Spring before Rose and McKenzie bought it; that would be the Spring of 1871.\nQ.\u2014You told him you had your lifetime to redeem it? A.\u2014McFarlane\u2019s lifetime to redeem it; he came to see if McFarlane was agreed to sell one-half to allow us to redeem the other.\nQ.\u2014What led to that? A.\u2014We sent James Peterkin, my husband and I, to Mr. Burke to see if he would buy the other one-half so that we could redeem the other.\nQ.\u2014Had you any other talk with Thomas Burke about this place after that? A.\u2014Yes, I talked with him after that; he was at the house several times; once he said that no other one could do such a mean thing as McKenzie.\nThen James Peterkin gives substantially the same account of what passed between him and Burke but more fully. He says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Had you any talk with Mr. Burke while McFarlane had the place? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014That is Thomas Burke? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Well, what was that? A.I was sent to Mr. Burke to see if he would not buy a part of the place, half of their place to redeem the other.\nQ.\u2014Who sent you? A.\u2014My sister-in-law, Mrs Peterkin; I went to Mr. Burke and he came the next day, I think it was, and I showed him over the land and he seemed to be satisfied with the land; still he would rather have the whole of it, he said, but he would give $550 for the half of it.\nQ.\u2014What was said to him about the state of the title, about McFarlane? A.\u2014I explained to him that McFarlane had a deed of the land, that he had given his lifetime to redeem it.\nQ.\u2014To whom had he given his lifetime to redeem it, did you tell him? A.\u2014To Mrs Peterkin.\nQ.\u2014When was that? A.\u2014That was in the spring of 1871, I think; that was just before he sold it to Rose and McKenzie.\nQ.\u2014And you wanted to sell half to get money to clear off the rest? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014$500 was what Macfarlane advanced? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Now after McKenzie bought had you any conversation with Burke? A.\u2014I do not recollect of having any.\nQ.\u2014Did he say anything to you about McKenzie having bought? A.\u2014Not that I recollect of.\nMR. BOYD\u2014YOU say you do not remember any conversation with Burke after that? A.\u2014No.\nQ\u2014Or his saying anything to you about the land? A. After Mc- Kenzie bought it?\nQ.\u2014Yes? A.\u2014I think he said that there was not another man in the Township that was mean enough to buy it, knowing the way it was. Something to that effect.\nHIS LORDSHIP\u2014YOU think he said that? A\u2014Yes, sir, something\nto that effect.\nHIS LORDSHIP\u2014I do not know exactly what you mean; you think he said something to that effect, and you think it was that; you think that that is what he said, that is what you mean? A.\u2014Yes.\nBurke did not venture to deny this latter evidence of the plaintiff and James Peterkin and it remains therefore uncontradicted.\nAs I have already stated this evidence, if worthy of credit which was a question for the judge, is in my opinion conclusive to establish actual direct notice, which made it a fraud in Thomas Burke to set up an absolute title under his purchase from Macfarlane and to claim the protection of the registry laws.\nIn his judgment delivered after the second hearing the Chancellor makes the following observations on the evidence:\u2014\nBefore dealing with the further evidence I desire to say that I refused the indulgences asked for by Burke, because I was satisfied by the evidence which was taken viv\u00e2 voce before me that the defence set up was a righteous one. There was much in the evidence of Burke and McKenzie, especially in that of Burke which I discredited. I thought him untruthful, and that the weight of evidence upon the question of notice greatly preponderated in favor of the plaintiff. I formed my judgment, of course, not only from the words uttered by the respective witnesses, but from their demeanor, and the many circumstances which aid a judge of fact before whom evidence is given, to form a correct judgment as to its truthfulness and the weight properly due to it.\nThe remark attributed to Burke, (and I have no doubt truly attributed to him notwithstanding his denial,) that no one but McKenzie would be mean enough to make the purchase, is also material, for it assumed that McKenzie knew when he made the purchase that the plaintiff had a redeemable interest in the land, an interest which he appears to have supposed was extinguished by McFarlane\u2019s sale.\nGeorge Kime says that he was present when Burke and Alexander. Hardy were talking together, when Burke said that he had consulted Mr. Atkinson, and also Mr. Scane about purchasing this land; that Mr. Atkinson had advised him not to purchase and that Mr. Scane advise d him that he could. Alexander Hardy, who had been examined at the former hearing, also says he had another conversation with Burke besides that spoken of by Kime; that in this other conversation Burke said that Mr. Atkinson had advised him that he could not purchase on account of the claim of the Peterkins; that Mr. Scane advised him that he could; that it was only a question between Mrs. Peterkin and McFarlane.\nBurke was present in court while this evidence was given, but was not called as a witness for himself, his counsel saying that he relied upon the evidence given by him at the former hearing. He was called as to one point by the plaintiff, but said nothing as to the evidence which had just been given in his presence.\nActual notice to Burke is proved to my mind quite as satisfactorily. He learned what claim was made by the plaintiff from herself and from James Peterkin. And the evidence given at the recent hearing in addition to that at the former hearing, proves that he had knowledge, not from one quarter only, but from several, of the plaintiffs claim and of its nature. His own admissions to Kime and Hardy are corroborative of the same fact. To put it at the lowest, the evidence given at the recent hearing makes it impossible to believe the assertion of Burke that he had not, before he purchased, notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. It has been said in this case, as it has been said in other cases, that it is almost incredible that a man should purchase when he knows of a claim in another, to or upon the same land. But it is not every man that knows of the equitable doctrine that where a man has such notice of title in another as would make his purchase inequitable, an exception is created thereby to the effect given generally by the act of registration. Burke is not the first man who has thought that (to use his own words) if a man has a clear deed he can give a clear deed; and who, to his cost, has acted upon that belief. That belief, and reliance upon advice which he understood (perhaps mistakenly) to have been given to him that he could purchase, are, I can scarcely doubt, the key to his conduct.\nIn my judgment, the evidence has brought home both to McKenzie and to himself notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and I think his abstaining from giving evidence at the recent hearing may properly be attributed to a consciousness that he could not deny the evidence given upon that occasion.\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that the notice amounts to actual knowledge brought home to Burke before he purchased, that the transaction with McFarlane was a mortgage, and that the learned judge who heard and saw the witnesses having found that they were truthful and worthy of credit, we must accept that finding as final and conclusive.\nThere remains to be considered the question of law relating to the effect to be attributed to the 60th section of the Statute 31 Vic. ch. 20, now the 81st section of ch. 111, of the Revised Statutes. This is certainly a point of great general importance, and one which it appears had never, before the present case came before the Court of Appeal, been the subject of decision in an appellate court.\nThe doctrine which sanctions the holding of notice of an unregistered conveyance to be sufficient to postpone the priority acquired by the statute owes its origin to the decision of Lord King in the case of Blades v. Blades[8], which was followed by that of Lord Hardwicke in Le Neve v. Le Neve[9], who then, (speaking of the Middlesex Act), says:\u2014\nThe intention of the Registry Act appears from its preamble to be plainly to secure subsequent purchasers and mortgagees against prior secret conveyances and fraudulent incumbrances. Where a person had no notice of a prior conveyance there the registering of the subsequent conveyance shall prevail against the prior, but if he had notice of a prior conveyance then that was not a secret conveyance by which he could be prejudiced * * * It would be a most mischievous thing, if a person taking advantage of the legal form appointed by an act of Parliament, might, under that, protect himself against a prior equity, of which he has notice.\nIt thus appears that in its origin this doctrine was founded on the construction of the statute into which it was held there ought to be read, as it were by implication, an exception of unregistered conveyances which are not secret but known to a purchaser claiming the protection afforded by the act to registered deeds. It is true that this doctrine has repeatedly been disapproved of by very eminent judges. Sir William Grant, M.R., in Wyatt v. Barwell[10]; Lord Romilly, M.R. in Ford v. White[11]; Longfield J. in re Rorke[12]; Lord Alvanley M.R. in Jolland v. Stainbridge[13]; Lord Brougham in Mill v. Hill[14]; Bramwell L.J. in Greaves y. Tofield[15].\nBut notwithstanding the formidable array of authority against the policy of this rule we find it, so recently as 1874, acted on by the House of Lords in the case of Agra Bank v. Barry[16], where Lord Cairns C., if he does not express approval of it, does very decisively state and act on the opinion that it is too firmly established to make it either desirable or possible that it should now be repudiated by judicial authority merely[17]. He says:\u2014\nAny person reading over that act of Parliament (the Irish Registry Act) would perhaps in the first instance conclude, as has often been said, that it was an act absolutely decisive of priority under all circumstances, and enacting that under every circumstance that could be supposed, the deed first registered was to take precedence of a deed which, although it might be executed before, was not registered until afterwards. But, by decisions, which have now, as it seems to me, well established the law, and which it would not be, I think, expedient in any way now to call in question, it has been settled that, notwithstanding the apparent stringency of the words contained in this act of Parliament, still, if a person in Ireland registers a deed, and if at the time he registers the deed either he himself or an agent, whose knowledge is the knowledge of his principal, has notice of an earlier deed, which, though executed, is not registered, the registration which he actually effects will not give him priority over that earlier deed. And, my Lords, I take the explanation of these decisions to be that which was given by Lord King in the case of Blades v. Blades upwards of 150 years ago, the case which was mentioned just now at your Lordships\u2019 Bar. I take the explanation to be this, that inasmuch as the object of the statute is to take care, that by the fact of deeds being placed upon a register, those who come to register a subsequent deed shall be informed of the earlier title, the end and object of the statute is accomplished if the person coming to register the deed has, aliunde, and not by means of the register, notice of a deed affecting the property executed before his own. In that case the notoriety, which it was the object of the statute to secure, is effected, effected in a different way, but effected as absolutely in respect of the person who then comes to register as if he had found upon the register notice of the earlier deed.\nOther authorities have more distinctly placed the doctrine on the ground, that a person who purchases with notice of the title of another is guilty of fraud, and that a Court of Equity will not permit a party, so committing a fraud, to avail himself of the provisions of a statute itself enacted for the prevention of fraud. And this principle is one which has long been recognized and applied by Courts of Equity, not merely in cases arising under the Registry Acts, but to cases arising under the Statute of Frauds and the Statute of Wills also; the doctrine of part performance, the admission of parol evidence to establish an absolute deed to be a mortgage, and the conversion of a legatee or devisee into a trustee, being all referable to the same general rule of equity. In McCormick v. Grogan[18], Lord Westbury says:\u2014\nThe Court of Equity has from a very early period decided that even an act of parliament shall not be used as an instrument of fraud; and if in the machinery of perpetrating a fraud an act of parliament intervenes, the Court of Equity, it is true, does not set aside the act of parliament, but it fastens on the individual who gets a title under that act and imposes upon him a personal obligation, because he applies the act as an instrument for accomplishing a fraud.\nIf we had here to consider only the same question which has been so often decided in England, and which was the subject of the decision in Barry v. Agra Bank, it would be mere useless prolixity to recapitulate the grounds of the previous decisions, and make the foregoing extracts. But we have not to decide the same question, but an entirely new one arising on the 68th section of the registry act (Revised Statutes ch. 111 sec. 81), and it thus becomes essential to enquire whether the doctrine of Courts of Equity in postponing a registered purchaser, who has notice of a prior unregistered deed, is one founded on a general rule of equity applicable generally to all prior titles and equities, or upon an exceptional rule, which is to be confined to the case of notice of such titles and equities, as arise upon written instruments, which might themselves have been registered, and therefore a discussion of the reasons which have led Courts of Equity to apply this principle is not irrelevant, but on the contrary, such considerations must form the very foundation of the present adjudication. The section in question (I take it from the Revised Statutes) is as follows:\u2014\nNo equitable lien, charge, or interest affecting land, shall be deemed valid in any court in this province as against a registered instrument executed by the same party, his heirs or assigns, and tacking shall not be allowed in any case to prevail against the provisions of this act.\nThe bad draftmanship which is conspicuous in this clause has been well pointed out by Mr. Justice Patterson, but I agree with him that it is impossible to give it any other construction than this, namely, that it only applies to \u201cequitable liens, charges or interests\u201d which arise purely by operation of equity and which do not arise on any written instrument. Such rights arising on written instruments are manifestly provided for by the preceding section, and to hold them to be within the provision now under consideration would be to introduce a direct conflict between the two clauses of the act.\nThen it would seem to be proper, in the first instance, to consider what would be the consequence if this 81st section stood alone as an innovation upon the former legislation, and as if the act had contained, no such enactment as to the effect of notice as that comprised in the 80th section. Would a court of equity in such case have been justified in applying the doctrine of notice, as theretofore applied in respect of unregistered instruments, to equities arising without writing?\nTaking either the reasons given by Lord Cairns in Agra Bank v. Barry that notice affects in another way the same object as that for which registration was required, or the broader grounds for the general rule, laid down by Lord Westbury, that a party who is guilty of fraud is not entitled to the protection of an act of Parliament, it is, I think, manifest that a Court of Equity could not have refused to apply the doctrine of notice to the case of an equitable lien of which there was no written evidence, without making an arbitrary distinction entirely unwarranted by the statement of the law as we have it from both the eminent judges whose words have been quoted.\nThen does the provision in the 80th section afford any reason why a distinction should be made.\nIt is a rule to be regarded in the construction of statutes, sanctioned by many authorities, that if a statute enacts that what was already before the statute a general rule of law applicable to all cases should be thereafter applied in some particular case, an intention to alter the law is not to be implied, but it is rather to be inferred that the legislature intended to lay down the particular rule for greater caution and certainty or for some other reasons. It is also a well understood principle that the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity is never to be considered as taken away because by statute a similar jurisdiction is imposed on courts of law.\nIf therefore we take these rules of construction as guides in construing the statute now in question there will, I think, be little difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the former jurisdiction of Courts of Equity was retained, and was applicable to the 81st section, notwithstanding the provisions of the 80th section, making the former equitable doctrine of notice a statutory rule thereafter, and as such applicable in courts of law as well as in Courts of Equity, and that the rule \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d has no application to these two sections.\nI am further of opinion that the omission to make notice applicable to the 81st section can be accounted for on sufficient grounds consistently with the foregoing construction. At the time the original act, from which the revised statute was consolidated, was passed the jurisdiction of law and equity in the Province of Ontario was administered by separate courts. In a court of law a case might frequently arise, and did frequently arise, where the legal title depended on prior registration, entitling a subsequent purchaser to priority over another claiming under a prior unregistered deed passing the legal estate. In such a case, owing to the different principles acted on with reference to the effect of notice by courts of law and courts of equity, the earlier grantee could not succeed at law, even though his adversary admitted the fact of notice; to obtain relief on that ground the first purchaser was compelled to resort to a Court of Equity, although the court of law could just as well have awarded him the same relief. It seems, therefore, very obvious that it was to remedy the inconvenience and injustice which arose in cases of this kind that the 80th section was passed. But as regards cases in which the prior claim was based on some lien, charge or other equity within the 81st section, and not depending on a deed or written instrument at all, such for instance as a vendor\u2019s lien, or an equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds, there would have been no use in conferring jurisdiction on courts of law since the competition in such cases not being between two claimants of the legal title, as might well be the case when there were were two succesive deeds the first unregistered and the last registered, but between two equitable claimants, or between an equitable and a legal claimant, it would have been useless to confer jurisdiction upon courts of law to act upon the doctrine of notice in such cases, inasmuch as from the nature of the equitable title of the party claiming priority by reason of notice, such a case never could come within the jurisdiction of a Court of law, as that jurisdiction existed when the registry act of 1868 was passed.\nFor these reasons I think it very clear that the decision of Mowat V.C. in Forrester v. Campbell[19], was in all respects right and ought to be adhered to.\nAlthough it does not affect the present decision in any way, I think it not out of place to point out here, that the rule as to notice embodied in the 80th section is much more stringent than that recognized in the decisions either upon the English or Irish registry acts. As Mr. Justice Patterson has remarked in his judgment notice after a purchaser has acquired his title and paid his purchase money, if before he has registered his deed, is, by the express words of the 80th section, sufficient to postpone him. This seems a very harsh rule and is one which never prevailed in equity but is in direct opposition to the previous authorities, Elsey v. Lutyens[20]; Essex v. Baugh[21]; Reddick v. Glennon[22]; and also contrary to the analogy afforded by the doctrine of tacking and equitable priority generally, by which a purchaser or mortgagee without notice could at any time, and after having had notice, protect himself by getting in a prior legal estate. It is true that Lord Cairns in Agra Bank v. Barry speaks of notice before registration being sufficient, but as the point did not arise there, and as all the authorities and reasonings to be discovered on the \u2018 point are against such a rule, I take this to have been unintentional. Having regard to the terms of the 80th section, a purchaser is hardly safe unless his conveyance is executed in the registry office so that it may be placed upon record without allowing an interval for subsequent notice. Indeed this practice of executing deeds in the registry office, is said in a late case in the English Court of Appeals actually to prevail in the North Riding of Yorkshire, though for a less urgent reason than that which calls for it in Ontario.\nI am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed, and with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I think the majority of the Appeal Court of Ontario came to the proper conclusion in this case, and I adopt the judgment of Vice Chancellor Proudfoot as embodying my views as to the issues raised.\nWhen the case was previously before this court I was of the opinion that the money was loaned by Mr. McFarlane on the security of the land conveyed to him absolutely, but which was understood and agreed upon to be subject to the right of redemption during his life.\nIt has been considered that from the evidence there was but an undertaking in words on the part of Mr. McFarlane to re-sell the land and re-convey it, but I cannot so conclude. The words that are shown to have been used are that Peterkin had during Mr. McFarlane\u2019s life time to redeem the property\u2014not to purchase it back.\nI also fully concur with the views of Vice Chancellor Proudfoot and those other learned judges who coincided with him as to the effect of the Registry Acts in such cases\nI think the judgment of court below and the decrees of the learned Chancellor herein should be affirmed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and that the plaintiff\u2019s bill should be dismissed from the Court of Chancery of Ontario with costs.\nThe case as asserted by the plaintiff in her bill, in short substance is, that being the owner in fee simple of the land in the bill mentioned, she, through the intervention of her agent, one James Peterkin, applied to one McFarlane for a loan of $500 which McFarlane agreed to lend to her upon the security of the said land, and that upon the advance of the said sum being made by him to her in pursuance of the above agreement, she, by deed dated the 31st August, 1856, conveyed the said land to McFarlane in fee simple, and that, although the said deed was in point of form absolute, it was expressly intended and understood between the plaintiff and McFarlane that it should stand as security only for re-payment of the said sum at any time to the said McFarlane; and that the said McFarlane afterwards in pursuance of a threat made by him to treat the said deed as absolute and thereby to cheat and defraud the plaintiff, by indenture bearing date the 18th June, 1871, in consideration of $1,200 absolutely sold and conveyed the said land to Colin H. Rose and Duncan McKenzie, who prior to the sale and conveyance of the said land to them had full knowledge and actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s right to redeem the said land upon re-payment of the said sum to the said McFarlane, and that by indenture bearing date the 21st of June, 1872, the defendants Rose and McKenzie having previously cut and removed from the said land timber of great value\u2014to wit of the value of $2,000\u2014conveyed the said land in fee to the defendant Thomas Burke, who prior to the sale of the said land by McFarlane to Rose and McKenzie, and by them to him had Ml knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s right of redemption aforesaid, and became purchaser thereof with notice of the premises, and the bill prayed, among other things, that it might be declared that the indenture executed by the plaintiff to McFarlane, although absolute in its form, was intended by way of security only for re-payment of the said sum of $500, and legal interest at the most thereon from the date thereof, (although nothing had been said about interest in the bill, nor in the agreement therein alleged as to the borrowing by the plaintiff of the said sum of $500,) and that the plaintiff is entitled, and may be let in, to redeem the said land.\nNow, if it were not for the frame of the answer, which upon the evidence as appearing in the cause must, I think, be admitted to have been improvident and uncalled for, there could not be any question upon the subject. But the appellants cannot, I think, in the face of the evidence, be prejudiced by the frame of their answers, the gist and substance of which is that admitting it to be true as alleged in the bill, that although the deed executed by the plaintiff to McFarlane was absolute in point of form, it was agreed between them that it should operate as a mortgage security only for re-payment of the said alleged loan of $500, and subject to redemption upon payment thereof to McFarlane, nevertheless the appellants are not to be prejudiced or affected by any such agreement, intent or understanding, for that they were respectively purchasers for value by registered title without notice of any such agreement or right of redemption.\nI entirely agree with the very able judgments of Chief Justice Hagarty and Mr. Justice Burton, in which, as it appears to me, Mr. Justice Paterson also concurred, that the evidence clearly displaces the case as alleged in the bill, and shows beyond all doubt that McFarlane never lent or agreed to lend to the plaintiff the said sum of $500, nor any sum; that no debt was ever due from the plaintiff to McFarlane, and that he never agreed to hold the land by way of mortgage security for repayment of any debt; but on the contrary that the transaction which took place between James Peterkin and McFarlane was an out and out sale of land to McFarlane, which was perfected by the execution of the deed by the plaintiff to whom James Peterkin had but shortly previously by deed transferred the land. And the utmost extent of the evidence, assuming it to be uncontradictory in its character and quite true, is that McFarlane verbally and voluntarily, and so in a manner not binding upon him, promised James Peterkin, whom McFarlane regarded as the person selling the land, although the deed to McFarlane was executed by the plaintiff, that he, James Peterkin, might repurchase the land, and that he, McFarlane, would re-sell and convey it to him upon re-payment of the sum of $500 at any time during his, McFarlane\u2019s, life time, nothing whatever being said about interest Now, whether any such promise ever could have been, or, in fact, was given, I do not think it necessary to enquire, for the case does not turn upon the credibility of witnesses; but upon this, that the promise, assuming it to be established by the evidence, is clearly not the agreement alleged in the bill upon which the equity relied upon by the plaintiff is made to rest, and such a promise, even though knowledge of it should be clearly brought home to the appellants, could not justify a finding against them upon the issue upon which they have rested their defence, namely, that they were purchasers for value without notice of the equity relied upon in the bill, namely, that McFarlane acquired the land upon the faith that he should hold it merely as a mortgage security for a loan of a sum of money made by him to the plaintiff and for which she was his debtor, the land being only held as security for the debt.\nThe passages in the evidence which are relied upon by the late learned Chancellor as establishing notice to the defendant Thomas Burke are not, in my judgment, evidence of any notice whatever binding upon him, or which can have any effect to defeat his purchase; they are for the most part loose observations made by persons having no interest in the subject, and who had no knowledge whatever of the circumstances under which McFarlane acquired title, or of the nature of the claim which the plaintiff had, if she had any\u2014and her own conduct in abstaining from asserting any claim if she had any while Rose and McKenzie were to her knowledge stripping the land of all its valuable timber might well be regarded as shewing that she had no claim such as she now asserts. A decree against Thomas Burke under the circumstances as appearing in the case cannot, in my judgment, be supported upon the authority of any precedent nor upon any principle of Equity. It carries the doctrine of notice of an equitable claim alleged to exist in a plaintiff defeating a sale to a defendant by a good legal conveyance executed for valuable consideration beyond anything which is in my opinion warranted by any decided case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Scane, Houston & Craddock.\nSolicitors for respondent: Atkinson & Christie.\n[1] See 9 Ont.

Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nAppeal\u2014New trial ordered by Court below\u2014Questions of law\u2014Insurance policy\u2014Insurable interest\u2014Special condition\u2014Renewal\u2014New contract\nJ., the manager of appellant's firm, insured the stock of one S., a debtor to the firm, in the name and for the benefit of the appellant. At the time of effecting such insurance J. represented appellant to be mortgagee of the stock of S. S. became insolvent and J. was appointed creditor's assignee, and the property of the insolvent was conveyed to him by the official assignee. On March 8, 1876, S. made a bill of sale of his stock to J., having effected a composition with his creditors under the Insolvent Act of 1875, but not having had the same confirmed by the court. The insurance policy was renewed on August 5, 1876, one year after its issue. On January 12, 1877, the bill of sale to J. was discharged and a new bill of sale given by S. to the appellant, who claimed that the former had been taken by J. as his agent, and the execution of the latter was merely carrying out the original intention of the parties. The stock was destroyed by fire on March 8, 1877. An action having been brought on the policy it was tried before Smith, J., without a jury, and a verdict was given for the plaintiff. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia set aside this verdict, and ordered a new trial on the ground that plaintiff had no insurable interest in the property when insurance was effected, and that no interest subsequently acquired would entitle him to maintain the action.\nOne of the conditions of the policy was \"that all insurances, whether original or renewed, shall be considered as made under the original representation, in so far as it may not be varied by a new representation in writing, which in all cases it shall be incumbent on the party insured to make when the risk has been changed, either within itself or by the surrounding or adjacent buildings.\"\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld,\u20141. That the appeal should be heard. Eureka Woollen Mills Co. v. Moss[1] distinguished.\n2. That the appellant having had no insurable interest when the insurance was effected, the subsequently acquired interest gave him no claim to the benefit of the policy, the renewal of the existing policy being merely a continuance of the original contract.\nThis was an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[2], making absolute a rule nisi for a new trial.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the head note.\nGormully for the appellant:\nThe court decided yesterday, in the case of The Eureka Woollen Mills Co. v. Moss, that they would not hear an appeal when the court below had ordered a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. In this case the ground for ordering a new trial was that no insurable interest in the plaintiff had been shown, and, by the practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, a verdict for the defendant could not be entered, and the only course open to the court was to grant a new trial. Under sec. 20 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act I submit that we are entitled to have this appeal heard.\n[RITCHIE, C.J.\u2014This case is distinguishable from Eureka Woollen Mills Co. v. Moss. We will hear the appeal.]\nWhen Strong gave the bill of sale to Jenkins he was in possession of the goods, and his discharge by the court made the mortgage of the eighth of March valid. On the fifth of August a new premium was paid, and I contend that each payment of premium is a new contract. It was not intended to make a change in the policy, but to continue a binding contract of insurance.\nI am going to contend that a party need not have an interest in the property at the time of effecting the insurance; it is sufficient if he has such interest at the time of the loss.\nTrentaine for the respondents was not called on.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nI do not think this is an arguable case at all. I think that before a man can recover on a policy of insurance he must have an insurable interest in the property when he effects the insurance. The renewal was merely a continuance of the original insurance and not a new policy. This appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Robert Motton.\nSolicitor for respondents: F. J. Tremaine.\n[1] 11 Can. S. C.

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE JUDGE IN EQUITY OF THE PROVINCE OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nInsurance against loss by fire\u2014Condition in policy\u2014Not to assign without written consent of company\u2014Breach of condition\u2014Chattel mortgage.\nWhere a policy of insurance against loss or damage by fire contained the following provision:\u2014\n\"If the property insured is assigned without the written consent of the company at the Head Office endorsed hereon, signed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the company, this policy shall thereby become void, and all liability of the company shall thenceforth cease:\"\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that a chattel mortgage of the property insured was not an assignment within the meaning of such condition.\nAppeal, by consent, from the decree of Mr. Justice Palmer, Judge in Equity for the Province of New Brunswick, in favor of the respondent (plaintiff below).\nThe firm of Peters & Sutherland, of the city of St. John, N. B., effected an insurance for the sum of $2,000 with the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company on their stock of boots and shoes in the premises in which they did business; not long after, the said Peters & Sutherland executed a chattel mortgage on their stock of boots and shoes, being the property covered by the said insurance, in favor of Charles H. Peters, the respondent, who allowed them to remain in possession of, and sell, the said stock; while the said mortgage was outstanding the said stock was destroyed by fire, and the company refused to pay the insurance thereon on the ground that the chattel mortgage was a breach of a condition in the policy that the property insured should not be assigned without the written consent of the company indorsed on the policy; the mortgagee brought a suit in equity against the company to recover the insurance, and a decree was made in his favour; the company then appealed, by consent between the parties, to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLash Q.C. for the appellant, referred to Cons. Stats. U. C. cap. 52 sec. 30; Smith v. Niagara District Mutual Ins. Co.[1].\nHanington, for the respondent, contended that it would require an absolute transfer of all the interest of the insured to make a breach of this condition. If not, a sale of the goods insured in the ordinary course of business might constitute a breach. He referred to Taylor v. Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co.[2]; Crusoe v. Bugby[3]; Goodbehere v. Sevan[4]; Croft v. Lumley[5]; Hitchcock v. North Western Ins. Co.[6].\nJohns v. James[7]; Marks v. Hamilton[8]; May on Insurance[9]; Phillips on Insurance[10]; Sands v. Standard Ins. Co.[11].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The case set forth that it is admitted:\u2014\nThat a chattel mortgage was given by said defendants, John Peters and Thomas F. Sutherland, to said plaintiff, upon the property and effects mentioned in said policy of insurance, duly executed by said John Peters and Thomas F. Sutherland, on or about the 17th day of August, A.D. 1883, and duly filed in the office of the Registrar of Deeds in and for the City and County of Saint John on the 29th day of said month of August, a copy of which said chattel mortgage, it is agreed, may be filed and read as part of this case.\nIt is admitted that the chattel mortgage aforesaid was made and executed by the said defendants, John Peters and Thomas F. Sutherland, to the said plaintiff without procuring the written consent of the said defendants, the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada, thereto, and that no consent in writing to the said chattel mortgage was ever indorsed by the said defendant, the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada, on the policy; that, in fact, the said Abraham D. G. Vanwart (the company's agent) had not, nor had the said Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada heard of said chattel mortgage having been made before said fire, nor had any notice been given to them, or either of them, or to their agent.\nThat the delivery of the shoes mentioned in the attestation clause of said chattel mortgage to the plaintiff was so made as a matter of form, as the parties to said chattel mortgage believed it to be a necessary form in order to make said chattel mortgage legal as a chattel mortgage, and, in fact, the said plaintiff did not, previous to the time of the fire above mentioned, enter into possession of any of the property or effects mentioned in said chattel mortgage, or take any proceedings to foreclose said chattel mortgage, or realize the amount secured thereby.\nThat the said Peters & Sutherland, after the execution of said chattel mortgage, continued in possession of said property and effects, and paid over to the plaintiff, from time to time, amounts on account of the amount secured by said chattel mortgage, as they had likewise done on account of the amounts due him before its execution, but there is still due to said plaintiff, on account of the amounts secured by said chattel mortgage, a large amount in excess of the amount of $2,000 insured under said policy as aforesaid.\nThat the said plaintiff and the said John Peters and Thomas F. Sutherland, or William Peters, junior, at the time of making said chattel mortgage or said trust deed, had not, nor had any of them, read over the conditions of said policy, and none of said parties intended to commit a breach of any of the conditions of said policy, and neither of them knew or believed that such chattel mortgage or trust deed would affect said policy in any way.\nIt is admitted that if the said policy was in force and valid at the time of said fire, the said plaintiff is entitled to maintain this action and to recover against the defendants, the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada, the sum of $2,000 and interest thereon from the 26th day of December, A.D. 1883.\nI differ entirely from Mr. Justice Palmer as to the meaning of the words \"property insured\" in the third condition. That learned judge says they may fairly mean the insurable interest in the subject insured. That, certainly, is what is insured, and such interest is property. With all due deference to that learned judge, I think the property insured was the following property:\nTheir stock of boots and shoes, findings, and machinery contained in the premises occupied by them, on the second flat of the four-storey brick building with gravel roof, situate on the south-west angle of Carmarthen and Union streets, City of St. John N.B., occupied by insured and other tenants as a steam power boot and shoe factory, furniture and brush and soap factories, and grocery\u2014\nas specified in so many words in the policy. Then we have the third condition, in reference to which the policy is made and accepted, and declared to be part of the contract, \"that if the property insured is assigned without the written consent of the company.\" What property? In my opinion, clearly the stock of boots and shoes, &c. But, if anything is wanting to make this more clear, we have the last words of the condition, \"but this condition does not apply to change of title by succession, by operation of law, or by reason of death.\" Change of title? To what, if not to the stock of boots and shoes, does this apply? Then again, if it could possibly be required to be made plainer, we have condition four: \"When property insured is only partially damaged no abandonment, &c.\" What is this property insured but the stock of boots and shoes? So at the end of this condition: \"No abandonment of property insured will be allowed,\" &c. Does this apply to the insurable interest?\nSo again, in condition twelve, as to the directions to be observed by persons entitled to make a claim under the policy, we have, inter alia: 5. He shall also declare what was the whole actual cash value of the property insured; and what interest the assured had therein at the time of the loss.\n6. Whether there was any incumbrance thereon, and, if any, giving full particulars thereof.\n7. In what general manner the premises insured, or the premises containing the subjects insured, or the several parts thereof, were occupied, &c.\nAlso by condition 15:\nIf any difference arise as to the value of the property insured, of the property saved, or amount of the loss, &c.\nBut it is, in my opinion, idle to pursue the matter further; the case is too clear for argument. There is not a doubt, in my mind, that the assignment of the property insured referred to the insured subject, the thing insured. I have looked at the cases relied on by the learned judge, and cannot discover that they have the slightest bearing on this case; nor can I agree with the learned judge, that \"it follows that the only question is what is the meaning of the words \"property insured.\" The question is simply: Was the execution of a chattel mortgage, without the written consent of the company, such an assignment of the property insured as would render the policy void under the third condition?\nI think this must be read as an absolute assignment of the property insured, of all the assured's interest therein, and that the condition, as against the assured, should not be read as forbidding a mortgage of or incumbrance on the property, where the assured retains an insurable interest. That condition must be strictly construed, and, as said by Chief Justice Cockburn in Fowkes v. Manchester and London Assurance Ass.[12]:\nIn construing an instrument prepared by the company and submitted by them to the party, affecting insurance, it ought to be read most strongly contra preferentes. Forfeitures are certainly not favored by the law. It has been well said that in enforcing forfeitures courts should never search for that construction of language which must produce a forfeiture when it will bear another reasonable construction which will not produce such a result.\nIn the last edition of the Imperial Dictionary assign is, in law, to transfer or make over to another the right one has in any object, as in an estate, chose in action or reversion, and in this sense we may fairly assume that the words were used. A mortgage is one thing, an assignment of the property is quite another; the one being conditional, the other absolute. In order to operate as a forfeiture, I think the assignment must divest the assured of all interest in the property, as he would be by change of title, by succession, by operation of law, or by reason of death, which changes are excepted from the operation of the condition, but so long as an insurable interest remains in the assured the policy is valid to the extent of that interest. Condition number twelve, in its fifth and sixth paragraphs, which provide directions for parties making claims under the policy, seems to indicate that the property may be encumbered without the knowledge or consent of the insurers.\nPar. 5.\u2014In such statutory declaration he (the insurer) shall declare what was the whole actual cash value of the property insured, and what interest the assured has therein at the time of the loss.\nPar. 6.\u2014Whether there was any incumbrance thereon, and if any, giving full particulars thereof.\nBut nowhere is it said that where an insurable interest is shown, the policy is avoided by any incumbrance thereon. If it was intended that the policy should be forfeited, notwithstanding the assured retained an insurable interest in it, I think such an intention should be clearly apparent from the language of the policy or condition. I think the assignment should amount to an absolute transfer of the assured's whole interest in other words, a transfer of the title and determination of his interest.\nThe case from Ontario Sands v. Standard Ins. Co.[13], holds that in a condition \"if a property is assigned without the written consent, &c.,\" the word \"assign\" did not cover a dealing with the property by way of mortgage, with which decisions the American authorities seem to be entirely in accord.\nI think therefore the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Sutherland et Peters, apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 une assurance pour un an, le 29 mars 1883, sur leur fonds de commerce, compos\u00e9 de chaussures et d'articles concernant la manufacture de chaussures, consentirent un chattel mortgage (hypoth\u00e8que sur les meubles) en faveur de l'intim\u00e9, comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale d'une dette. Celui-ci ne prit pas possession des articles en question et ne fit aucun proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour r\u00e9aliser sur le chattel mortgage. Le 8 d'octobre suivant, les effets couverts par la police d'assurance et par le chattel mortgage furent consum\u00e9s par un incendie. La question r\u00e9sultant de ces faits est de savoir si la cr\u00e9ation d'un chattel mortgage sur les meubles assur\u00e9s, constitue une violation de la troisi\u00e8me condition de la police d'assurance, con\u00e7ue en ces termes:\nIf the property insured is assigned without the written consent of the company at the head office indorsed hereon, signed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the company, this policy shall thereby become void, and all liability of the company shall thenceforth cease; but this condition does not apply to change of title by succession, or by operation of law, or by reason of death.\nLa cr\u00e9ation du mortgage est-elle en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une violation de la condition que les meubles assur\u00e9s ne peuvent \u00eatre transport\u00e9s sans le consentement de la compagnie? et comme le chattel mortgage ne laisse plus aux assur\u00e9s que le droit de racheter leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en remboursant le montant de ce mortgage, leur reste-il encore, dans ce cas, un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable?\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des assur\u00e9s ne consistant plus apr\u00e8s le chattel mortgage que dans un droit de r\u00e9demption (equity of redemption), ce droit peut-il \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme compris sous les termes property insured? Le terme property, en mati\u00e8re d'assurance, a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, comme ayant une signification assez \u00e9tendue pour comprendre un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable. Voir Holdbrook v. Brown[14]; Wiggins v. Mercantile Ins. Co.[15]; Locke v. North American Ins. Co.[16]. Si les mots property insured comprennent fun int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable, il ne reste donc qu'\u00e0 savoir si apr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution du chattel mortgage, les assur\u00e9s poss\u00e9daient encore un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable. Par l'article 15 du cas sp\u00e9cial, il est admis que la livraison mentionn\u00e9e dans la clause d'attestation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi faite que comme mati\u00e8re de forme et sous l'impression qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 du chattel mortgage, mais qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 cette livraison n'a pas eu lieu, et que de fait, avant l'incendie, l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pris possession d'aucun des effets mentionn\u00e9s dans le chattel mortgage et n'avait adopt\u00e9 aucun proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour r\u00e9aliser la somme dout le remboursement \u00e9tait garanti de cette mani\u00e8re Peters et Sutherland \u00e9taient donc encore en possession des articles affect\u00e9s au chattel mortgage, et pouvaient, en payant le montant ainsi garanti, rentrer dans leur droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et alors, dans le cas d'incendie, la perte des effets assur\u00e9s retombait sur eux. Il r\u00e9sulte de cette position qu'ils avaient conserv\u00e9 dans les effets en question un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable suffisant pour leur permettre de recouvrer le montant couvert par la police d'assurance. Cette cour ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 exprim\u00e9 son opinion sur ce qu'elle consid\u00e8re comme un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable dans la cause de Clark v. Scotish Imperial Insurance Co.[17], et dans celle de Anchor Marine Ins. Co. v. Keith[18], je crois qu'il serait inutile de citer \u00e0 ce sujet d'autres autorit\u00e9s que celles de ces deux causes et des nombreuses d\u00e9cisions sur lesquelles la cour s'est alors appuy\u00e9e pour en venir \u00e0 la conclusion qu'elle a adopt\u00e9e. Je consid\u00e8re donc ce point comme r\u00e9gl\u00e9 et, en cons\u00e9quence, que l'intim\u00e9 a droit do recouvrer sur la police.\nMais l'appelant ayant aussi invoqu\u00e9 comme d\u00e9fense le fait qu'il y avait eu violation de la troisi\u00e8me condition par la cr\u00e9ation du chattel mortgage, qui dans ses termes contenant un transport de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9e, il est n\u00e9cessaire de voir quelle interpr\u00e9tation il faut donner au mot assigned dans cette condition. L'intim\u00e9 a fait \u00e0 ce sujet une savante dissertation en se basant sur les r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation pour en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que le mot assigned n'a rapport dans cette condition qu'\u00e0 une ali\u00e9nation compl\u00e8te des articles assur\u00e9s qui n'aurait laiss\u00e9 aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable \u00e0 Peters et Sutherland. Une clause semblable a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l'objet de discussions importantes dans les cours de la province d'Ontario, dans la cause de Sands v. Standard Ins. Co.[19]. Dans la m\u00eame cause, entendue de nouveau in banco, et rapport\u00e9e au 27 vol. Grant, p. 167, le jugement de l'honorable juge Proudfoot d\u00e9cidant que la condition dont il s'agit ne s'appliquait pas \u00e0 une ali\u00e9nation par hypoth\u00e8que (mortgage), mais \u00e0 un transport absolu, fut confirm\u00e9 par tous les juges. La condition dont il s'agit en cette cause est semblable, dans ses parties essentielles, \u00e0 celle qui faisait le sujet de la discussion dans la cause de Sands v. The Standard Ins. Co.; il n'y a qu'une diff\u00e9rence sans importance dans les termes qui ne sont pas de nature \u00e0 modifier la question d'interpr\u00e9tation du mot assigned dans la troisi\u00e8me condition dont il s'agit ici. L'interpr\u00e9tation admise est \u00e9videmment applicable en cette cause. En cons\u00e9quence, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an action by the respondent as mortgagee of Peters & Sutherland on certain goods and assignee of a policy of fire insurance issued by the appellant company to the said Peters & Sutherland on the same goods previous to the execution of the chattel mortgage. The question as to the validity of the assignment was submitted under a special case in which everything necessary to the recovery of the respondent is admitted except as to the validity of the policy when the loss occurred, which was a few months after the execution of the chattel mortgage and the assignment of the policy. The third condition of the policy is as follows:\u2014\nIf the property insured is assigned without the written consent of the company, at the head office, indorsed hereon, signed by the secretary or assistant secretary of the company, this policy shall, thereby, become void, and all liability of the company shall thenceforth cease; but this condition does not apply to change of title by succession, or by the operation of the law, or by reason of death.\nThe 18th and 19th clauses of the special case are as follows\nIt is submitted that the said plaintiff is the lawful assignee for value of said policy of which the said defendants, the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company, had notice immediately after the said lire, but the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada had not notice of any assignment of the policy to the plaintiff until after the said fire, nor has the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada done any act showing they accepted the plaintiff as their assured.\nIt is admitted that if the said policy was in force and valid at the time of said fire, the said plaintiff is entitled to maintain this action and to recover against the defendants, the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada, the sum of $2,000 and interest thereon from the 26th day of December, A. D. 1883. The case concludes as follows:\u2014\nIt is contended on the part of the defendants, the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada, that the third condition indorsed on the said policy was a proper and reasonable condition, and the execution and delivery of the said chattel mortgage was a breach of the said third condition indorsed on said policy of insurance, and that the said policy therefrom became void and of no effect whatever, and that the plaintiff cannot recover thereunder. It is admitted, however, that if the execution and delivery of said chattel mortgage was not a breach of said third condition, then the said policy of insurance was valid and in force at the time of said fire.\nThe question for the court is whether the said policy of insurance was valid and in force at the time of said fire. If so, then the plaintiff to have judgment for the amount aforesaid, said sum of $2,000 and interest and costs of this suit, and, if not, the said defendants, the Sovereign Fire Insurance Company of Canada, to have judgment with costs.\nReference is made in the special case to an assignment alleged to have been made subsequent to the mortgage, and before the loss by Peters and Sutherland to Wm. Peters, junior, of all their property for the benefit of their creditors, but it appears that nothing was done under it, and the creditors did not execute it, but at all events, no question was raised on it so as to affect the policy. We have therefore only to decide as regards the mortgage. I have no doubt that Peters and Sutherland, after the mortgage given as security, had an insurable interest in the property covered by the policy. That after the mortgage they might have insured the property covered by it, and that the creation of the security by the mortgage was not such a transfer or assignment of the property as is prohibited by the third condition of the policy. The assignment therein referred to, is one by which the property is absolutely and wholly assigned, so that no interest in it remains in the assignor. Such is not the case where security by mortgage is given on the insured property.\nI have no doubt of the correctness and validity of the decision appealed from to this court, and am therefor of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The case of Burton v. The Gore District Mutual Insurance Company[20], and cases of that class being cases depending upon the peculiar provisions of the statutes relating to mutual insurance companies, have no bearing upon the present case, but although an absolute assignment of an insurer's whole interest in chattel property avoids the policy, and divests the insured of all right to recover thereunder upon the property being subsequently destroyed by fire without any condition indorsed on the policy to that effect, still, I think that it is an absolute disposition by assignment of all title in the insured property which is pointed at by the condition in question; the context in which the word \"assigned\" is used in the condition, leads, I think, to this conclusion. The object of the condition is, I think, to provide that although a change of the whole title by assignment without consent of the insurers shall avoid the policy, as indeed it would without any such provision, still that change of title by succession, or by operation of law, or by death, shall not. So that in these latter cases the parties becoming entitled to the property shall have the benefit of the insurance, while the assignee of the title, that is of the whole title, in the case of assignment, as in the other cases, shall not, unless such assignment be consented to by the insurers in the manner provided for in the condition. I agree therefor that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Silas Alward.\nSolicitors for respondents: Hanington, Milledge & Wilson.\n[1] 38 U. C.
