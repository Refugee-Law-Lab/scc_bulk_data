[1914] ch. 75, sec. 14) providing that an acknowledgment of title in writing shall interrupt the adverse possession does not apply to possession of Crown lands and such acknowledgment is not an interruption under the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\"\nThe provision in the \"Ontario Limitation of Actions Act\" of 1902, making an acknowledgment apply to interrupt possession of Crown lands is not retroactive or, if it is, it cannot apply to a case in which the adverse possession had ripened into title before it was passed.\nPer Duff J.\u2014As intrusion does not, in itself, deprive the Crown of possession the occupation required to attract the benefit of the first section of the \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" 9 Geo. III, ch. 16, is not technically possession; but lands are \"held or enjoyed\" within the meaning of that section where facts are proved which, in litigation between subject and subject, would constitute civil possession as against the subject owner.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court (16 Ex. C.R. 67) in favour of the Crown on information of intrusion was reversed, Fitzpatrick C.J. holding that the Crown had failed to prove title, Idington, J., that the claim was barred by the negative clause of the first section of the \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" and the other judges that the defendants had obtained title by operation of the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\" APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the Crown on information of intrusion.\nThe information of His Majesty the King was filed in the Exchequer Court for the purpose of recovering possession of a piece of land situated at the south-east corner of Rideau Street and Mosgrove Street in the City of Ottawa. The land was portion of the ordnance lands of the City of Ottawa, the title being vested in Her late Majesty's Officers of Ordnance and was partly occupied at one time by what was known as the By-Wash or Waste-Weir Reserve extending from the Rideau Canal Basin to Rideau street through which the overflow or surplus waters of the canal found their way from the canal basin as it existed many years ago. The appellants' grandparents went into possession of this land in the year 1832 without having acquired a title from the Officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance. In the month of February, 1890, an information was filed in the Exchequer Court of Canada against the parties then in possession thereof, including the parents of the defendants in the present action. No defence was filed and judgment was obtained by default, and entered for possession of the lands and premises in the information mentioned, and upon that judgment a writ of possession was issued to the sheriff of the County of Carleton and placed in his hands. Subsequently an order was obtained for the issue of a new writ of possession which writ was duly issued on the 16th day of January, 1902, and placed in the hands of the sheriff.\nThe said defendants were not evicted under the judgment and writs of possession above mentioned, but continued in possession of the land, and as they had died it was considered advisable by the Crown to exhibit a new information against the defendants in this action, who claimed, and were in occupation of the land. They entered a defence in which they denied the title of the Crown and further pleaded that the title to the lands was vested in them inasmuch as they and their parents had been in uninterrupted, actual, visible and continuous possession and enjoyment of the lands and premises since the year 1832, and were still in full possession and enjoyment thereof. To this defence the respondent replied setting up the former proceedings and the judgment which was obtained against the persons under whom the appellants claim, and further pleaded that the defendants either as defendants in the present action or as claiming under the defendants in the former action, were estopped from denying the Crown's title.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Cassels in the Exchequer Court on the 11th May, 1915. In support of the information the Crown placed in evidence all the proceedings in the former action of intrusion, and also produced a letter written by Susan Cousens and Sarah Cousens to the then Minister of Public Works. The former of these persons, Susan Cousens, was afterwards Susan Hamilton and mother of the appellants in this action, and one of the defendants in the former action. That letter is as follows:\u2014\n\"Ottawa City,\n\"17th October, 1871.\n\"Sir,\u2014We the undersigned (being sisters) beg to inform you that having understood that the small property or lot situated on the southern side of Rideau street and adjoining the by-wash (leading from the Canal) on the west side of it, on which there is a wooden building, has been applied for by the St. George's Society for the purpose of erecting a hall thereon. We would hope that the same might not be sold, as we consider our right to it cannot be alienated from the length of time said lot has been possessed by our family, namely, 39 years. Our father the late James Cousens in his lifetime settled upon this lot in 1832 with permission of the Ordnance Department, our mother outlived our father and resided upon this property for a number of years and at her decease bequeathed it to us, and we have continued upon it ever since. Our father's name was entered upon the books of the Department at the time of his settling down here which was then called By-town, these facts are known to many of the citizens.\n\"The corporation taxes levied from time to time have been duly paid all along to this date, and we most urgently and respectfully solicit that the aforesaid lot be sold to us, as we consider we have the prior right and are willing to pay any reasonable amount for a deed of the same.\n\"We remain,\n\"Your most obedient servants,\n\"Susan Cousens.\n\"Sarah Cousens.\n\"Hon. H. L. Langevin, C.B.\"\nThe judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Cassels held that His Majesty was entitled to recovery of possession of the said lands.\nFripp K.C. for the appellants. The Crown did not prove title. The \"sixty feet around the basin and by-wash\" reserved to the Crown by 7 Vict. ch. 11, when the unused lands were restored to former owners, must mean to refer to the junction of the basin and by-wash and so does not include our land.\nAnd title must be proved: Doe d. Fitzgerald v. Finn[2]; The Queen v. Sinnott[3]; Tuthill v. Rogers[4].\nThe letter to Sir H. Langevin in 1871 was no acknowledgment of title. See Doe d. Curzon v. Edmonds[5].\nThe appellants were never dispossessed during the sixty years; Day v. Day[6]; and the provisions of the Ontario \"Limitation of Actions Act\" cannot affect them.\nHogg K.C. for the respondent. The judgment obtained by the Crown in 1890 and the letter to Mr. Langevin in 1871 are, and either of them is, sufficient to uphold the judgment appealed against.\nWhere an effectual claim is made by the Crown within the sixty years, its remedy is not barred: Attorney-General for British Honduras v. Bristowe[7], at pages 155-6.\nAs to the acknowledgment see Halsburys Laws of England, vol. 19, page 132.\nFripp K.C. for the appellants.\nHogg K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada brought this suit by information claiming possession of certain lands and premises therein described and which now are, and for the past eighty-four years have been, in the possession of the defendants or their predecessors in title.\nThe matter comes before the courts in a rather curious fashion because in the year 1890 the Attorney-General brought a similar suit to recover possession of those, amongst other lands, and obtained judgment in default of pleading. Possession, however, was never had under this judgment and no writ of possession has been issued or applied for in the name of His present Majesty. The defendants then interested in the lands now in question are dead, and the Attorney-General has thought it necessary to take these proceedings in which he must prove the title of the Crown in right of the Dominion. The defendants have been in possession for more than twenty years since the judgment of 1890.\nWhether the Crown could have relied simply on the judgment by default of 1890 as establishing the title of the Crown is a question which I think we are not called on to decide, because in the present proceedings counsel for the Crown set up a title which he stated at the opening of the trial, as follows:\u2014\nHis Lordship :\u2014How did the Crown get title to it?\nMr. Hogg:\u2014The Crown got title under the original statutes. The canal was constructed under the statute of 8 George the Fourth, and by 7 Victoria, ch. 11. That statute vested the property in the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance in Great Britain: that the Rideau Canal and all its appurtenances became vested in the. Principal Officers of Ordnance, and remained in that way until Confederation, and became part of the property of the Dominion of Canada under the \"Confederation Act.\" That is the short history of the title, so far as the Crown is concerned.\nThis is clearly erroneous. If the canal and all its appurtenances remained vested in the Principal Officers of Ordnance until Confederation, there is nothing in the \"British North-America Act, 1867,\" which would have made it the property of the Dominion of Canada.\nThe \"British North America Act\" by section 108 provides that\nthe Public Works and Property of each Province enumerated in the third schedule to this Act shall be the property of Canada;\nthe third schedule is headed\nProvincial Public Works and Property to be the Property of Canada; the first item in this schedule is\nCanals with Lands and Water Power connected therewith\nand the ninth is\nProperty transferred by the Imperial Government and known as Ordnance Property.\nNow there is no doubt that the Rideau Canal was Ordnance Property and as such it appears to this day in the schedule to the \"Ordnance and Admiralty Lands Act\" (R.S.C. [1906], ch. 58). If, therefore, it passed to the Dominion under the \"British North America Act 1867,\" it was as Ordnance Property. The legal advisors of the Crown have evidently supposed that it passed like ordinary canals the Property of the Province under the first enumeration in the third schedule of\nCanals with Land and Water Power connected therewith.\nThis is the only item of the third schedule which is printed in the extract from the \"British North America Act\" 1867, given in the printed\nSchedule of Statutes and Parts of Statutes to be referred to on argument of this Appeal.\nBut whether the canal passed to the Dominion under the first or the ninth item in the third schedule it would be, of course, an essential link in the title to prove that it was at Confederation the property of the Province of Canada, and not only has no attempt been made to shew this, but counsel, as appears from his statement above quoted, has set up that it then remained vested in the Principal Officers of Ordnance.\nIt does not follow, of course, that because the title which the Crown has set up in this suit is bad it has not really a good title. I am certainly aware that there are a number of statutes dealing with the Rideau Canal but I do not think it is incumbent on the court to search amongst pre-Confederation statutes and other evidences of title for the purpose of seeing if a good title can be made out. Moreover, there may be points of difficulty and doubt arising on these statutes and documents. It would, indeed, seem absurd to suppose that the court should have to deduce the title and decide upon its validity independently of either of the parties to the suit.\nThe statute of the Province of Canada, 19 Vict. ch. 45, can scarcely be looked upon as a model of clearness or accuracy. If it is to be held to establish that the Ordnance properties of which it purports to dispose had been transferred to the province, it would seem that this could only be by implication; there is no recital to that effect such as we find in the Dominion statute, 40 Vict. ch. 8, whereby certain other Ordnance property transferred directly to the Dominion was disposed of. In the provincial statute, on the contrary, there is only a recital of the intention that they should be transferred whilst the second schedule to the Act, which alone can be material here, is headed\nMilitary Properties in Canada proposed to be transferred to the Provincial Government.\nThe description in the schedule is, however, of the most meagre description; indeed it does not seem to deal with the canal at all. The schedule is in the following form:\u2014\nThe Second Schedule.\nReferred to in this Act being the Schedule of Military Properties in Canada proposed to be transferred to the Provincial Government.\nSituation\nApproximate Quantity of Land.\nA. R. P.\nDescription of Buildings or Military Works.\n(Amongst the Properties enumerated are)\nRideau and\nOttawa Canals\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026.\u2026\u2026\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\nCity of Ottawa, Barracks. Blockhouses and Adjuncts of the Canals. The canal, it will be seen, is only mentioned as giving the \"situation\" of the properties mentioned in the third column. Again are we to suppose that the lands on either side of the canal and round the basin and by-wash are to be considered \"adjuncts of the canal\"? Even if they are included in this expression may not the Province of Ontario have some claim to these lands?\nI am, of course, giving no opinion on any of these points and merely mention them as possible difficulties arising on the title of the Crown; it is unnecessary to pursue their consideration further since I hold that it was for the respondent to shew title which has not been done. I think as I have already intimated that the respondent having set up in this suit a title which is defective cannot be heard now to say that the judgment given by default in 1890 establishes that the title of the Crown is a good one.\nIf the lands now claimed are Dominion property they are apparently subject to the \"Ordnance and Admiralty Lands Act,\" and this might be of importance to the defendants even if the judgment appealed from were upheld since the Act reserves special privileges to persons in actual occupation of such lands with the assent of the Crown. With this, however, we are not immediately concerned.\nThe Crown permitted the defendants or their predecessors in title to remain in undisturbed possession for fifty-eight years before taking action in 1890 and took no steps to enforce the judgment then obtained during the ensuing twenty-four years. During this long lapse of time all parties concerned have died. The form of government of the country has been repeatedly changed, and the then newly founded and insignificant By-town has become a great city, the capital of the Dominion of Canada. Under these circumstances, I think the courts need not hesitate to require the strictest proof of a claim to oust the defendants. Failing this, I think substantial as well as legal justice will have been done by leaving them undisturbed in the possession which they have so long held.\nThis is a case in which we may recall what the Privy Council has said concerning the difference in the relation between the Crown and the subject in this and in older settled countries. Such long periods of time as those prescribed in the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" seem to consort more with the slowly altering conditions in the latter, than with those in a country which has witnessed such phenomenal changes as Canada during the past century. Without encroaching on the functions of the Legislature we may endeavour to mitigate the hardships of a rigorous enforcement of rules which change of time and place render oppressive.\nHolding the view above stated it is not necessary for me to deal with other points raised at the trial and dealt with in the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court. The plaintiff not having proved title cannot recover judgment on the claim for possession of the lands. The appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014Several questions arose out of this appeal which, I confess, I have had some difficulty in solving.\nA copy of a plan of a portion of the Rideau Canal, dated in 1847,\nshewing the boundaries as marked on the ground of the land belonging to the Ordnance at Bytown (Ottawa) and the part of lot C, Concession C, in the Township of Nepean taken from N. Sparks signed by Michael McDermott, C.E. and P.L.S., and also by the Lieutenant-Colonel and a number of officers of the Royal Engineers was apparently received in evidence at the trial, though objections were taken to its reception. A witness proved it to be a copy of the original plan on file in the Department of the Interior, Ottawa, Ordnance Branch, and I do not doubt it was properly received.\nIf properly in evidence, it would place beyond doubt the fact that the lands in question were part of the 60 feet around the basin and by-wash of the Rideau Canal.\nThe Ordnance stones X. Y. marked O. B. S. on the plan shew the by-wash to have extended to Rideau Street. There is no evidence whatever as to the date when these ordnance boundary stones were placed but they must have been so placed before the date of McDermott's plan, in 1847, and most probably before 1846, the date of the statute making clear what part of the canal and its adjuncts were retained by the . Crown.\nBut apart from that plan I agree with the learned trial judge that the oral evidence given at the trial with respect to the locus and the by-wash of the canal in conjunction with the several written acknowledgments of title made by the defendants and their predecessors in title sufficiently establish the title in the Crown to the locus in question.\nAfter quoting part of the evidence given by John Little a witness in his 84th year, the learned judge concludes, and I agree with him, that \"the by-wash\" in question is\nno doubt the creek which was referred to by this witness and the cottage in question would be erected on the 60 feet. The learned judge, after referring to and quoting the \"Ordnance Vesting Act\" of 1843, 7 Vict. ch. 11, providing for the restoration to the parties from whom they were taken of the lands taken for the Rideau Canal and afterwards found not to be required and the subsequent statute of 1846, ch. 42, 9 Vict., making clear what was intended by the previous Act of 1843, namely, that its provisions should be construed to apply to all the lands at By-town set out and taken from Nicholas Sparks, except\n(1) So much thereof as was actually occupied as the site of the Rideau Canal, as originally excavated at the Sappers' Bridge and of the Basin and By-wash, as they stood at the passing of the Ordnance Vesting Act; excepting also:\n(3) A tract of 60 feet around the said Basin and By-wash.\nconcludes\nThat the Basin and By-wash and the 200 feet along the canal and the 60 feet along the By-wash were retained by the Crown.\nI do not think there can be any reasonable doubt of the correctness of this conclusion.\nOnce that conclusion of fact is reached there cannot remain any doubt as to the title of the Crown. The statute, 19 Vict. ch. 45, of the late Province of Canada passed in 1856, recites amongst other facts that\nthe Ordnance lands of this province consist at the time of the passing of this Act of the several lands, estates and property comprised in the two schedules to this Act,\nand that Her Majesty had signified Her gracious intention (inter alia).\nthat all such of the lands and other real property comprised in the said part recited Act (7th Victoria) as are comprised in the second schedule to this Act annexed, and all title, estate and interest therein respectively, should be transferred from the said Principal Officers and become re-invested in the Crown, for the public uses of this Province.\nThe enacting clause of this Act carries out specifically the expressed intention of the recital and vests all the lands, etc., mentioned in the second schedule absolutely in Her Majesty for the benefit, uses and purposes of the province.\nAmongst these lands so transferred from the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance and vested in the Crown for the use of the province was the \"Rideau and Ottawa Canals\" and \"adjuncts of the Canals.\"\nI cannot doubt, therefore, that after the passage of this Act the by-wash, so called, of the Canal basin extending as far as Rideau Street and the reservation of 60 feet on each side of it being adjuncts of the canal were vested in the Crown for the use of the Province of Canada and were transferred by the \"British North America Act\" to the Dominion.\nThe Crown, therefore, may, under the evidence given and these statutes, be said to have proved title to the land sued for.\nBut the question at once arises out of the defence of over 60 years continuous possession set up by the defendants in themselves and their predecessors in title.\nThe fact of such continuous possession seems to have been sufficiently proved and would entitle the defendants to judgment, unless the acknowledgments of title made by them in their letters to the Honourable Hector Langevin, Minister of Public Works in 1871, the Honourable Alexander MacKenzie, Premier and Minister of Public Works in 1874 and to Sir John Macdonald, premier, in 1890, together with the judgment by default obtained by the Government on a writ of intrusion brought by the Crown for the recovery of these lands in 1890, together, or any one or more of them, operated as an interruption of such possession. I confess that upon this question I have had many doubts, not indeed as to the meaning and legal effect of these letters as an acknowledgment of title in the Crown, because I have no doubt whatever that they did so operate, but on the question whether such an acknowledgment is sufficient under the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" to interrupt a possession which the evidence shews was not as a fact interrupted.\nThe actual possession of the defendants and their predecessor in title was never interrupted. They remained in continuous possession for over the required sixty years and were never ousted nor disturbed by the Crown.\nIf it can be held that the provisions of the \"Real Property Limitations Act\" relating to acknowledgments of title and the effect of such acknowledgments extended to the Crown, and that the Crown could avail itself of such acknowledgments as interrupting defendants' possession of the lands, then the case for the Crown is made out, in my opinion, and the appeal should be dismissed.\nI cannot, however, reach that conclusion. The \"Nullum Tempus Act\" does not contain any reference to acknowledgments of title as staying the running of the period of prescription, but it does provide that an interruption by entry and receipt of the rents and profits by the Crown shall stay the running of such period. It would seem a bold step for the Court to add yet another fact or incident to those the Nullum Tempus statute expressly mentions as interrupting possession against the Crown. After a good deal of hesitation I am unable to say that it should do so; and I agree with the argument that this section of the \"Real Property Limitations Act\" (now section 14 R.S.O. [1914] ch. 75) should not be construed as including adverse possession of Crown lands because that Act had no application to such possession, which is specifically dealt with by the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\"\nIn the year 1902 the section of the \"Real Property Limitations Act\" providing for the effect of an acknowledgment in writing of the title of the person entitled to any land or rent by the person in possession was for the first time declared applicable to\nrights of entry, distress or action asserted by or on behalf of His Majesty.\nThe letters of the defendants on which the Crown relies as such acknowledgment, were written years before that statute of 1902 (2 Edw. VII. ch. 1, sec. 18) was passed; and at the time it was passed the prescriptive period of sixty years of uninterrupted and continuous possession by the defendants and their predecessors in title had elapsed.\nThe statutory title of the defendants under the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" was therefore complete years before the legislation was passed in 1902, unless, of course, it is held that the provisions of the \"Real Property Limitations Act\" relating to acknowledgments before they were expressly made applicable to rights of entry or action by the Crown can be invoked by the Crown. As I have already said, I incline to the opinion they cannot be so invoked. Nor can I construe the legislation of 1902 as having a retrospective operation upon possession which had already ripened into and become a statutory title. Whatever may be said in favour of a retrospective operation being given to the legislation of 1902 with respect to the possession of land which had not ripened into a complete statutory title in the possessors or claimants, I cannot yield to the suggestion that it can have such a retrospective operation with respect to a possessory title which had so ripened.\nIt seems clear under the decided cases of In re Alison[8] and Sanders v. Sanders[9], that where a statutory title has once been acquired under the Statute of Limitations it cannot be defeated by any subsequent acknowledgment or even by any subsequent payments of rent unless these continue for such a period as creates a new statutory title.\nThe reasoning of the learned judges in these two cases in appeal would indicate that the statutory title so gained was, as stated by Jessel M.R.\na complete title which extinguished the other.\nAssuming that to be so, then it would seem most unreasonable to give a retroactive effect to the statute of 1902 which would operate to destroy a complete statutory title gained years before, and resurrect an extinguished one. That certainly goes to destroy the argument that the statute is one relating to procedure only.\nThen as to the effect of the recovery of the default judgment by the Crown before the prescriptive period had elapsed but notwithstanding which the defendants continued in possession and were not dispossessed I have also entertained some doubts.\nI cannot find any direct authority which gives a different effect to a judgment recovered by the Crown on a writ of intrusion from that recovered in an ordinary ejectment between subject and subject, or which indicates that the former had the effect of interrupting the defendants' possession while the latter admittedly has not. The best consideration I have been able to give the question leads me in the absence of authority to the conclusion that the mere obtaining of a judgment against the defendant on a writ of intrusion without further action dispossessing the defendant does not operate to interrupt the defendant's possession and that to do so there must be an actual dispossession under the judgment, or an attornment or payment of rent by the party in possession.\nFor these reasons, I concur in allowing the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The information of intrusion herein is answered by a general denial of all the facts alleged therein and of any title in the Crown or possession by it of any of the lands in question, and by an assertion of title in appellants and possession since the year 1832.\nThe respondent replies, amongst other things, that an information of intrusion was filed against a number of persons including predecessors in title of the appellants and judgment got by default for the possession of the lands in question and other lands in the year 1890.\nThe respondent put in evidence a certified copy of the proceedings in said case including the judgment for default of appearance awarding possession to the respondent.\nThe claim of the respondent is rested thereon and upon an alleged statutory title. His counsel by way of proving the identity of the land in dispute with part of the whole included in said proceedings, called a surveyor who testified, according to certain plans, filed subject to objection, that the lands in question fell within the description therein, and in the information of intrusion, upon which the judgment for recovery of possession had been awarded.\nThere was no evidence adduced relative to the actual survey on the ground or to the authenticity of the said plans so filed, or that any of them were based upon or practically identical with, or in fact formed part of the evidence necessary to maintain the alleged statutory title (if any) of the respondent to the lands in question. That statutory title depends upon statutes which can only operate and be properly made effective by the production or proof of the documents therein referred to and especially the plan as that\nof those (lands) marked and described as necessary for the said purposes on a certain plan lodged by the late Lt.-Colonel By of the Royal Engineers, the officer then employed in superintending the construction of the said canal, in the Office of the Surveyor-General of the said late Province and signed by the said Lt.-Col. By, and now filed in the office of Her Majesty's Surveyor-General for this Province.\nWe have in the record a plan evidently made in 1847, after all the said legislation now relied upon, and after the settlement between one Nicholas Sparks and those acting for the Crown. We are asked to act upon this plan. But why? I am puzzled to understand, for the plan which the Legislature proceeded upon was that of Lt.-Col. By, thus referred to.\nThere is nothing I can discover identifying this plan in 1847 with said plan certified by Lt.-Col. By, which assuredly should be taken as the guide determining what land respondent might claim herein.\nAs already pointed out there is nothing in evidence identifying the work on the ground with that of Lt.-Col. By or his plan.\nThe case was evidently launched by the officers of the Crown in reliance solely upon the force and effect to be given the said judgment, for everything else seems to have been ignored.\nEven the acknowledgment upon which the learned trial judge rests his judgment, was evidently considered of as little importance as I attach to it, for reasons to be assigned presently. The counsel for the Crown at the trial after presenting the certified copy of the judgment, introduced it and other material thus:\u2014\nThe only other evidence I have is the evidence that was taken on discovery. I do not know whether your lordship has looked at that.\n*****\nMr. Hogg:\u2014There are one or two letters or petitions that are attached to this ancient fyle that I would put in, merely to shew the relations that were existing between the government and these people at that time.\nThe learned trial judge found himself unable to attach the importance counsel for the Crown evidently had attached to the said judgment and the effect thereof.\nHe therefore accepted as an answer to the claim of continuous possession for sixty years, the following alleged acknowledgment in writing:\u2014\nOttawa City,\n17th October, 1871.\nSir,\u2014We the undersigned (being sisters) beg to inform you that having understood that the small property or lot situated on the Southern side of Rideau Street and adjoining the Bywash (leading from the Canal), on the west side of it, on which there is a wooden building, has been applied for by the St. George's Society for the purpose of erecting a Hall thereon. We would hope that the same might not be sold, as we consider our right to it cannot be alienated from the length of time said lot has been possessed by our family, namely, 39 years. Our father, the late James Cousens, in his lifetime settled upon this lot, in 1832, with permission of the Ordnance Department; our mother outlived our father and resided upon this property for a number of years and at her decease bequeathed it to us, and we have continued upon it ever since our father's name was entered upon the books of the department at the time of his settling down here which was then called By-town, these facts are known to many of the citizens.\nThe corporation taxes levied from time to time have been duly paid all along to this date, and we most urgently and respectfully solicit that the aforesaid lot be sold to us, as we consider we have the prior right and are willing to pay any reasonable amount for a deed of the same.\nWe remain,\nYour most obedient servants,\nSusan Cousens.\nSarah Cousens.\nHon.

Even if the only statute invoked by the appellants had contained a provision excepting its application and operation in the case of such acknowledgments in writing as are given effect to by many statutes of limitation, I should much doubt the efficacy of this writing which clearly points to some agreement or grant conditionally binding the Crown, in honour at least, to give the ancestor of the signers a right to purchase at some price to be fixed, and which has never been fixed, and appeals to a record in the department at the time of \"his settling down here\" which I take it means; upon the lands in question.\nI asked in the course of the argument if any inquiry or search had been made relative to said entry or record of the import thereof, and was answered by counsel on either side that no such search or inquiry had been made.\nIf respondent ever seriously intended to rely upon this or other letters as acknowledgments falling within any conceivable exception to the operation of the statute we should have been told in evidence what the official relation respectively was, of each of those to whom such letters were addressed, to the land in question so that thereby we might have been enabled to understand how either one of them could be held an agent of respondent to receive such letters of acknowledgment.\nI should be loathe to attach much (if any) importance to such a document without the fullest information at least on the part of the Crown relative to the import of what such a claim as made therein implied, and how it could be treated as an acknowledgment taking away the rights acquired by the statute.\nThere are in the record two other letters from one of the same parties, and a descendant, and others, addressed respectively in 1874 and 1890 to the Premier of Canada for the time being, upon the question. Strange to say there does not appear according to the record to have been any reply made to any of these letters.\nIt is to me inconceivable that these several letters should go unanswered and if answered that there is no copy of record of reply thereto.\nThe only reason I can assign for the non-production of the replies, is that counsel did not think it conceivable at the trial that the Crown could properly rest its case upon either that I have quoted, or the others I refer to.\nWith the greatest respect for the learned trial judge I am unable to give that effect which he has given to the letter above quoted.\nI understand how easy it would be for him and those arguing, accustomed to the consideration of acknowledgments as a usual part of statutes of limitations, to overlook the fact that their utility in the way of answering any statute of limitation is dependent upon whether or not the statute of limitations in question has made any acknowledgment a bar to the operation of the statute or an exception therefrom.\nThe statute invoked in this case is the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" of 1769, 9 Geo. III. ch. 16, of which the first part of the first section thereof seems in itself complete, and reads as follows:\u2014\nWhereas an Act of Parliament was made and passed in the Twenty-first year of the Reign of King James the First, intituled, An Act for the general Quiet of the Subjects against all Pretences of Concealment whatsoever; and thereby the Right and Title of the King, His Heirs and Successors, in and to all Manors, Lands, Tenements, Tythes, and Hereditaments (except Liberties and Franchises) were limited to Sixty years next before the Beginning of the said Session of Parliament; and other Provisions and Regulations were therein made, for securing to all His Majesty's Subjects the free and quiet enjoyment of all Manors, Lands, and Hereditaments, which they, or those under whom they claimed, respectively had held, or enjoyed, or whereof they had taken the Rents, Revenues, Issues, or Profits, for the Space of Sixty Years next before the Beginning of the said Session of Parliament: And whereas the said Act is now by Efflux of Time, become ineffectual to answer the good End and Purpose of securing the general Quiet of the Subject against all Pretences of Concealment whatsoever: Wherefore be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Assent and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That the King's Majesty, His Heirs, or Successors, shall not at any Time hereafter, sue, impeach, question, or implead, any Person or Persons, Bodies Politick or Corporate, for or in anywise concerning any Manors, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Tythes, or Herditaments whatsoever (other than Liberties or Franchises) or for or in any wise concerning the Revenues, Issues, or Profits thereof, or make any Title, Claim, Challenge, or Demand, of, in, or to the same, or any of them, by reason of any Right or Title which hath not first accrued and grown, or which shall not hereafter first accrue and grow, within the Space of Sixty Years next before the filing, issuing, or commencing, of every such Action, Bill, Plaint, Information, Commission, or other Suit or Proceeding, as shall at any Time or Times hereafter be filed, issued or commenced for recovering the same, or in respect thereof; unless His Majesty, or some of His Progenitors, Predecessors, or Ancestors, Heirs, or Successors, or some other Person or Persons, Bodies Politick or Corporate, under whom His Majesty, His Heirs, or Successors, any Thing hath or lawfully claimeth, or shall have or lawfully claim, have or shall have been answered by Force and Virtue of any uch Right or Title to the same, the Rents, Issues, or Profits thereof, or the Rents, Issues, or Profits of any Honour, Manor, or other Hereditament, whereof the Premises in Question shall be Part or Parcel, within the said Space of Sixty Years; and that the same have or shall have been duly in charge to His Majesty, or some of His Progenitors, Predecessors, or Ancestors, Heirs, or Successors, or have or shall stood insuper of Record within the said Space of Sixty Years.\nThere would seem no exception to this taking away of any right of action except those specified therein of which neither such like acknowledgment as relied upon nor any former action for mere recovery of possession is one.\nThe judgment in question was merely for possession and nothing else was prayed for except the costs of suit. It was entered 14th April, 1890, and a writ of hab. fac. pos. was issued thereon the same day. Nothing further was done till the 16th January, 1902, when an order was made by the late Mr. Justice Burbidge, then judge of the Exchequer Court, directing that a writ of possession do issue out of said court.\nThat is followed by a pr\u00e6cipe for a writ of possession. Whether issued or not does not appear.\nThe record is thus completed so far as we know.\nNow assuming the foregoing quotation from the Act to be as it seems self-contained, how can the said judgment and such acts as done thereunder (which in no way interrupted the adverse possession of those under whom the appellants claim) be said to answer the clear and imperative language of the section so far as barring any right to bring an action?\nThe statute makes no provision for an acknowledgment of any kind save in the way and form expressed in the specified exceptions in the Act.\nThe \"Real Property Limitations Act of Ontario\" in force at that time and in all subsequent re-enactments or revisions thereof down to 1902, contained in a section thereof a distinct provision for an acknowledgment in writing being\ndeemed according to the meaning of that Act to have been the possession of the person to whom given,\nbut that cannot be presumed to be available for use under the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\" That section in R.S.O. 1897, was numbered \"13.\"\nThe whole of the said \"Real Property Limitations Act\" is clearly intended to apply only to cases as between subject and subject, except some provisions dealing with some easements and profits. Its various editions, as it were, throughout all the time in question down to 1902, remained as regards these exceptions, and I think in other respects relative to the effect of acknowledgments in writing, exactly the same. The sections 34 to 39 inclusive in R.S.O. 1897, and what is referred to in the section 42 thereof, shew what these exceptions cover.\nThese exceptions fail to touch such land as in question herein.\nThese sections are, moreover, instructive as shewing how the acknowledgments in writing which have been relied on must be conceived and framed. The language which might meet the requirements of section 13 in R.S.O. 1897, might fall far short of being useful under these sections 34 and 35, or section 42.\nThe language of the Act as to acknowledgments enlarging or preserving the rights of mortgagees or mortgagors is again of a different nature and illustrates the intention to confine such kind of legislation strictly to that being dealt with and the relation between those thus specified.\nThe fact that.it was found thus necessary to define wherein the Crown should and should not be affected seems, if anything needed, to exclude all else having relation to the Crown as beyond the scope of the Act.\nI shall revert presently to the later development in legislation and to the question of acknowledgment in this regard.\nI, meantime, submit that as the said acknowledgment could have no effect when given, it could not be made effective after the full sixty years had run which gave appellants an absolute bar to this action, we are not much concerned with such development.\nThe truth is that a statute of limitations is nothing more or less than a definition of circumstances under which the courts are forbidden to aid him who otherwise would be entitled to seek their assistance to recover for him his money or his property.\nAnd what one Act of that kind may provide is of little help in the case falling under another such Act unless clearly intended to be read together.\nThere is, as the result of legislative development, now usually added to that negative conception, some provision for vesting in him who has enjoyed possession of land for the time specified, the title thereto which is to be recognized by the courts.\nThe ideas I am suggesting and seeking to give expression to are perhaps better and certainly more concisely expressed and illustrated by Lightwood in his work on \"Time Limit of Actions,\" chapter 1, as follows:\u2014\nPrior to the year 1833 a right to recover land might be barred either by the Statute of Limitations (32 Hen. 8, c. 2, which barred real actions, such as the writ of right and novel disseisin, and 21 Jac. 1, c. 16, which barred ejectment), or by the operation of the Statute of Fines (4 Hen. 7, c. 24).\nThe Statute of Fines both barred the remedy and extinguished the right; the Statutes of Limitation only barred the remedy: Hunt v. Burn (1702), 2 Salk. 422.\nBearing all these considerations in mind and the fact as proven and found by the learned trial judge and indeed not seriously disputed, that the appellants and those under whom they claim have been in undisturbed possession since some time in 1832 the part of section 1 of the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" which I have quoted above, and the author already referred to at page 143 of his said work aptly calls the negative or limiting clause of the Act, seems a complete bar to the respondent's claim to relief herein.\nThat bar was complete I take it by the end of 1892. What possible right can the court have to rely on something not expressed in the statute? I might let the matter rest there by concluding with the result that the appeal should be allowed with costs. But it is due to the learned trial judge's opinion on the point of acknowledgment that I should present a number of considerations, which have occurred to me, more or less bearing thereupon. I have already pointed out why I think acknowledgments in 1871 could not fall within the \"Ontario Real Property Limitations Act.\"\nTen years after the sixty years in favour of the appellants had run, the Ontario Legislature, by 2 Edw. VII. ch. 1, sec. 2, enacted as follows:\u2014\n2. The enactments described in the schedule to this Act are hereby repealed, but as regards the Imperial statutes if, and, so far only as the same are in force and within the legislative authority of this Province.\nThe \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" 9 Geo. III. ch. 16, is one of those mentioned in the schedule referred to and the note therein is\nsubstituted for this. See sections 17-20 of this Act.\nIn the sections thus referred to is contained a new code as it were relative to the lands of the Crown and actions to recover same.\nIn the 4th subsection of section 18 provision is made for an acknowledgment in writing taking lands out of the statute and giving a new point from which time is to run.\nThat legislation was in turn superseded and repealed. In the process of the revision of the Ontario Statutes sometimes such tentative legislation appears and disappears.\nThe final result would seem to be that in preparing the \"Limitations Act\" the revising commissioners in 1910 seem to have incorporated into that Act the substance of that legislation of 1902, by enacting by section 2 the provision that in this Act \"action\" shall include an information on behalf of the Crown and in section 4, subsection 2, the section providing for an acknowledgment in writing and many others of the Act are made applicable to the Crown.\nI cannot imagine that it ever was intended by anyone that this provincial legislation was intended not only to be retroactive, but also to affect the rights of any one in his relations to the Crown on behalf of the Dominion.\nNor can I think that, even if any one so intended it should affect the said relations, it would be successful unless adopted by Parliament.\nOf course so far as the Crown on behalf of the Province of Ontario was concerned, or may now be concerned, and the relations between it and Ontario subjects of the Crown in that behalf, I assume it was quite competent for the Ontario Legislature to repeal the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" so far as it had any force and effect in Ontario.\nI cannot find that the Dominion Parliament in any way ever meddled with the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" or enacted anything to make that local legislation applicable in the relation between Crown and subject.\nHence I am of the opinion that any Ontario legislation giving the Crown the right to receive acknowledgments in writing, as if efficacious to affect the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" independently of the Dominion Parliament, would be ultra vires.\nBut it seems to me that all that legislation is by 3 & 4 Geo. V. ch. 2, sections 6, 7, 8 and 9, expressly rendered inoperative so far as it concerns the rights of such parties as these appellants, whose rights to plead in bar herein the sixty years possession, had matured before any such legislation as Ontario's Legislature had in any of these ways enacted. The case of Gauthier v. The King[10], illustrates wherein provincial law is to be administered in the Exchequer Court and when discarded.\nAnother question of some difficulty to me is the effect of the recovery of the judgment in 1890 in its bearing upon the rights of the appellants when we consider the effect of the affirmative clauses of section 1 of the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\"\nAlthough holding, for the reasons already given, the first clause of said section conclusive as to this action, yet there may be something arguable in the effect of the words\nno verdict, judgment, decree, judicial order upon hearing or sentence of Court shall hereafter be had or given, in any action, bill, plaint, or information in any of His Majesty's courts at Westminster,\netc., etc., which appear at the end of the last clause of the whole section, on their bearing upon the validity of the title supposed to have been transferred by the second clause.\nThe question arises whether these words imply that the title of the Crown must have been tried and found by such court. I submit that no mere default judgment for want of appearance according to modern practice could ever have been in the contemplation of the Parliament which a hundred and fifty years ago framed this enactment.\nIn the case of Attorney-General v. Parsons[11] it was objected that the title could not be proved in a case of Information of Intrusion but first found by inquest of office when the defendant had been for twenty years in possession. The court held not, but seems to have assumed that under 21 Jac. 1, ch. 14, sec. 4 (c), the title must be proved in such a case as it was. And Alderson B. referred to Manning's Exch. Prac. 198.\nSee the case of Attorney-General v. Mitchell[12] and case on page 88.\nThe possession is theoretically assumed at common law to be in the Crown as exemplified by the authorities: Co. Litt. 41 b. 57 b.; Vin. Abr. Prerog. 2, 4; Bac. Abr. Prerog. E. 6; Elvis v. Archbishop of York[13] which were relied upon in argument in the case of Doe dem. Watt v. Morris[14], and apparently conceded but contended the King is put to his office found, citing Com. Dig. Prerog. D., Reynel's Case[15].\nThe case decided nothing touching what I am concerned with here but its argument and view of the courts is suggestive of much to be borne in mind here.\nBrown in \"Limitations as to Real Property,\" page 90, says:\u2014\nOn an intrusion upon the Crown the actual possession is acquired by the intruder (Plowd. 546) and after twenty years, continues in him \"until the title has been tried, found or adjudged for the King\" (21 Jac. 1, c. 14 (E); 15 Car. 1, c. 1 (1)), but in point of law the possession with respect to the nature of the remedy, is still considered to be in the Crown (Doe d. Watt v. Morris14 and a grantee from the Crown after the intrusion is in no better or more favourable position than the Crown itself, and must recover such possession by a similar remedy through and in the name of the Crown, and cannot recover by ejectment in his own name (ib.).\nLightwood on Time Limitations, wherein is contained almost the sole attempt at any analysis of section 1 which I have found among the many text writers I have consulted, at pp. 147 et seq., says:\u2014 There follows in the English Act a third clause which, like the first two clauses, was copied from 21 Jac. 1, c. 2, and was intended to secure the possessor who had held adversely to the Crown for sixty years against persons claiming under the Crown under grants of pretenced titles, or, to use Lord Coke's words, \"against patentees and grantees of concealments, defective titles, or lands not in charge, and all claiming under them.\" A beneficial law, he calls it, both for the Church and the Commonwealth, in respect of the multitude of letters patent and grants of these natures and qualities, but it had become obsolete before the date of the English Act, in which it was needlessly introduced. It is not found in the corresponding Irish enactment (48 Geo. 3, c. 47).\nThe first clause of section 1 is negative and exclusive of the right and title of the King; the second is affirmative and establishes the estate of the subject (3 Inst., p. 190). In effect, the second corresponds to sec. 34 of the R.P.L.A., 1833, which extinguishes the title against which the statute has run. \"These distinct clauses,\" said Blackburn, M.R., in Tuthill v. Rogers[16] \"had objects perfectly different.\nThe first was a limitation to the suit, and baired the remedy of the Crown; the second, by confirming for all time thereafter the estate had or claimed by the subject and enjoyed for sixty years, against the Crown's title, barred and extinguished that title and transferred it to the subject.\nIt seems to me that these and other indications as well as the nature of the proceedings in such an action\u2014 and for that matter in any other action\u2014at the time of this enactment\u2014forbid the thought that such a proceeding taken, and ended in the record before us, as result thereof in 1890, was something quite foreign to what is required by the words I have quoted from the third clause of the first section of the \"NullumTempus Act.\"\nIndeed the language used in many of the authorities I cite, and to be found suggested by others cited therein, indicates that the use of an information of intrusion for the mere purpose of a recovery of possession would formerly have been considered an improper proceeding and suggests a doubt, if the proceedings leading up to the alleged judgment by default were not entirely misconceived if intended to fulfil such a purpose as that now in question, or as having anything to with what was contemplated by said section.\nIn Friend v. Duke of Richmond in 1667[17] at page 461, it was said by Hale C.B., that:\u2014\nThe judgment in intrusion is not in the nature of a seisin or possession, but only \"quod pars committatur et capiatur pro fine,\" And upon that an injunction issues for the possession against the party himself and all claiming under him. And though a petition of right lies against the King in this case, yet when the King has granted the land over, an entry may be made upon his patentee. * * * Nor does an information of intrusion suppose the King out of possession, for that would be contrary to the purport of the writ, which supposeth that the party intruded upon the King's possession.\nSee Robertson's \"Civil Proceedings by and against the Crown,\" page 177, under head of \"Information of Intrusion\" to end of chapter, page 185.\nChitty on Prerogatives also has on page 380, the following:\u2014\nThese lands shall be held on the usual tenures, etc. Usual fee-farm rents confirmed. Putting in charge, standing insuper, etc., good only when on verdict. Demurrer or hearing, the lands, etc., have been given, adjudged, or decreed to the King.\nSee also Burton's Exchequer Practice, page 223 of vol. 1; Brown's Ex. Prac., page 10, and cases cited; and the cases of Greathead v. Bromley[18]; Langmead v. Maple[19], and especially the dictum of Willes, J., p. 270 and top 271, that:\nIt is not sufficient to constitute res judicata that the matter has been determined on; it must appear that it was controverted as well as determined upon;\nand Thorp v. Facey et al., in 1866[20], judgments by Erle, C.J., Willes, J., and Smith, J., not as printed in case herein, and see Manning's Practice, pages 98 et seq. I submit that a careful consideration of all implied in the authorities referred to in the said several text writers, and cases I cite, leads to the conclusion that the judgment relied upon does not fall within the meaning of that section.\nThe judgment therein referred to is one to be recovered in Westminster Hall. Without pressing that unduly, it is to be observed that in the case of Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Love[21] when the court above held the statute to be in force in New South Wales against the contention that there was no such office as contemplated by the language of the exception, that court said (p. 686) that the only result would be that there is nothing upon which the exception preserving the Crown's right could operate, but certainly would not cut down the enacting part of the statute.\nWithout pressing that too far it may be held that the judgment contemplated is one resulting from proof, not given in the proceedings in question in 1890, but which would become inevitably necessary before a judgment could have been entered as herein, not only twenty years but fifty-eight years after the statute had begun to run against the Crown.\nI think the cases relied upon by Mr. Justice Cassels as to the effect of a judgment in ejectment are conclusive as against a proceeding which was nothing but one for default of appearance in ejectment. Changing the name of a thing has no legal effect or at least should have none. The information in question was nothing but an ejectment suit.\nI desire to make that position clear for an information of intrusion has been, when properly brought for the recovery of damages, or of rents and profits, aptly compared to an action of trespass quare clausum fregit. It may be conceivable that such an action might be proceeded with by such ex parte proceedings as to prove the title and bind. Possibly the same might take place in the proceeding to judgment in an information of intrusion and it appearing there had been no adverse possession for twenty years, a judgment by default might stand good.\nI gravely doubt the efficacy thereof in face of the dictum of so great a lawyer as Willes J. quoted above, as to the necessity for the issue being controverted.\nBut in any event if possession had run for over twenty years, I think it should not stand unless some proof adduced of the title even if the proceedings ex parte.\nIt must be understood I am speaking of something that may operate under or as against the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\"\nI repeat all this does not touch the right of appellants in this case to have this information dismissed but merely the question of what their rights may be when that has been (if ever) done.\nAnother question has weighed much upon me by reason of the stress laid both in the court below and before us on the case of Magee v. The Queen[22] when the late Mr. Justice Burbidge gave judgment for the Crown.\nA perusal of that case suggests that we should have had the facts there proven gone into and proven here. Of course we cannot accept or act upon what appears therein as statement of fact, yet when one has been invited to read such a recital of fact it becomes painful to suspect therefrom that if we had been as fully supplied with facts as the court was in that case and a trifle more suggested thereby, we might be induced to conclude that the title if still outstanding in any one but appellants had passed to the Crown on behalf of Ontario.\nIt does seem a very remarkable thing that though the only reason alleged for this land having (if ever) been acquired on behalf of the Crown, was that it was intended to serve the purposes or uses of a canal, yet no one has ever felt under the necessity of using it for that purpose during all the long period it has been supposed to be the property of the Crown.\nIt is quite clear that under section 108 of the \"British North America Act\" all that passed to the Dominion was what could fairly be said to be then part of that in the schedule referred to therein, and described as\ncanals with land and water power connected therewith,\nIf lands had been ninety years ago supposed to be needed perhaps for contractors building the canal, but in truth useless for the canal as such, I cannot think they passed to the Dominion.\nIndeed I am of the opinion that lands acquired by the Crown on behalf of any of the confederated provinces for purposes of any canal, but which had obviously always been or become useless in that connection, remained at Confederation the property of the Crown on behalf of the province so concerned.\nIt requires some straining of the imagination to discover how lands that had remained for thirty-three years before the \"Confederation Act\" in the possession of people who never had anything to do with the canal in question, could then, in 1866, be properly described as lands connected therewith.\nAnd as bearing upon the suggestion that these lands never had any connection in fact with the canal, it may be observed that the letter treated by the judgment below as an acknowledgment seems to have been prompted by some proposition to acquire them as a site for a St. George's Hall within five years after Confederation. What had happened their use for the purposes of the canal? Is this in a letter so much pressed on us not rather suggestive that those concerned had applied to the wrong Crown?\nAnd when we are told nothing more than we find in evidence herein I am unable to understand how such a claim can be maintained.\nI cannot in face of these and many other peculiarities of this case, assent to the proposition that the lands described in the information are part of those belonging to the respondent, or that they ever belonged to the Crown, on behalf of the Dominion, if at all.\nWe have put forward in the 9th Vict. ch. 42, sec. 1, something to indicate that the lands round the canal basin and by-wash intended to be of use for the canal had been \"freely granted by Nicholas Sparks\" but when or how has not been shewn.\nTime had run in favour of the first adverse possessor of the land in question (under whom appellants claim) at least fifteen years before then.\nThe words \"freely granted\" are of very doubtful import and may mean much or little when the story of the surrounding facts and circumstances are forthcoming to give them a clear, vivid meaning.\nIf Sparks had the fee simple then vested in him when adverse possession first taken by the predecessors of appellants, or thereabout, then there was an adverse title as against him started running which for aught we know may have ripened long before anything done on the part of the Crown to stop its running. It is not necessary I should try to follow this further for the necessary material is not before us.\nI suggested in the course .of the argument that the words\nProvided no buildings be erected thereon\nin the first section I have just now referred to, might well have been used as words of description and designed for the express purposes of protecting such people as Cousens.\nEvidently there were others possessed of buildings on land squatted on, left undisturbed till the growing city needed a new street, and basin and by-wash had long disappeared.\nThe meagre evidence in the way of historical inquiry falls far short of what I imagine might have been adduced, as it seems to have been, in the case of Magee v. The Queen[23], and might have lightened up much.\nThere are some conclusions reached by Mr. Justice Burbidge which on the facts as presented in the report of that case, do not appear to me self-evident.\nThe suggestion that the acknowledgment in 1870 or the judgment in 1890, might well furnish some evidence of a title independently of their value under the statute, seems to me quite untenable. In regard to the former there is theoretically, in one view, if the evidence had been adduced, no doubt of the title of the Crown, or in the other case of its possession.\nThey add nothing in either way. The question is simply whether the \"Limitations Act\" applicable has been stopped running thereby which I say it has not, because neither one of these things which might so operate has been proven. Mr. Hogg very properly as counsel abstained from entering upon a part of the later history relative to the judgment which does not appear in evidence and possibly, if I understood him correctly, he only surmised a probable explanation.\nYet I cannot understand why we should be asked to permit a recovery upon a judgment (for that is what it comes to) which, for some mysterious reason, if ever worth anything, cannot now be enforced in the ordinary way.\nAppellants submit it has in law become spent. I am curious to know if it ever was in law worth anything.\nI think the appeal should, be allowed with costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014I do not think it is necessary to decide the question whether or not there is sufficient evidence that the property in question is within the area acquired by the Crown under the authority of 8 Geo. IV. ch. 1, or vested in the Crown by force of 7 Vict. ch. 11, sec. 29. I shall assume that at the time the appellant's predecessor in title went into possession and erected a log hut upon the lot in 1832, a tract including this lot had been \"set out and ascertained\" in compliance with the provisions of the first mentioned statute as land required as a site for the Rideau Canal and its accessories. The question of substance is whether the appellants are now entitled to succeed in the litigation on the ground that the suit instituted by the Crown is barred by the \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" 9 Geo. III. ch. 16. In that enactment by the preamble it was recited that certain provisions and regulations had been made by 21 Jac. I. ch. 22:\u2014 For securing to all His Majesty's subjects the free and quiet enjoyment of all manors, lands, and hereditaments which they or those under whom they claimed respectively had, held, or enjoyed, or whereof they had taken the rents, revenues, issues, or profits for the space of sixty years next before the beginning of the said session of Parliament; And whereas the said Act is now by efflux of time become ineffectual to answer the good end and purpose of securing the general quiet of the subjects against all pretences of concealment whatsoever.\nThe statute then proceeds to enact that:\u2014The Crown shall not sue any person for or in any wise concerning any lands or hereditaments (other than liberties or franchises), or the rents and profits thereof, by reason of any right or title which has not first accrued within 60 years next before the commencement of the suit, unless the Crown or its predecessors in title have been answered by force of any such right or title, the rents or profits thereof (or the rents or profits of any honour, manor, or other hereditament whereof the premises in question are part) within the said space of 60 years (or that the same have been duly in charge to the Crown or have stood insuper of record within such space); and then follows a clause definitely establishing the title of the subject who shall have \"held or enjoyed\" any lands in respect of which His Majesty claims any title which did not first accrue within the space of 60 years before the commencement of the proceedings.\nIt is undisputed that the appellants and their predecessors have in fact been in actual occupation and in fact have used and \"enjoyed\" the land in question since the year 1832. To all appearance they have during that period acted in respect of the land as if they were the owners. They have, for example, made improvement as they have seen fit and have paid all the taxes. Prim\u00e2 facie, therefore, there is a clear case of sixty years' holding and enjoying attracting the benefit of the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\" Certain acts of the appellants and their predecessors are, however, relied upon as shewing that this occupation is not of such a character as to entitle them to the benefit of the statute.\nFirst it is argued that a letter written in 1871 and a petition filed in 1890 constitute acknowledgments of title which are said to interrupt the running of the statute. As to the letter of 1871, with great respect to the learned trial judge, I think it does not amount to an acknowledgment of title in the Crown. The letter contains a declaration that the rights of the writers \"cannot be alienated\" and in view of that I do not think the letter can be regarded as an acknowledgment of title. The petition of 1890 goes further and if I had considered it necessary to pass upon the question I should have had some difficulty in deciding whether or not that petition read alone contains an acknowledgment of title within the meaning of the \"Real Property Limitations Act\" (C.S.U.C. ch. 88, sec. 15; R.S.O. 1887, ch. 3, sec. 13). I do not find it necessary to decide this point because first, the petition of 1890 must be read with the letter of 1871, and the petition of 1874, in both of which documents the petitioners asserted they were entitled to possession of the property and, secondly, because, in my opinion, a mere acknowledgment of title was not, at the time these alleged acknowledgments were given, sufficient to interrupt the running of the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\"\nThe provision of the \"Real Property Limitations Act\" above mentioned, is a provision enacted in 4 Wm. IV. (ch. 1, sec. 26) with reference to the limitations established by that statute. That statute effected various changes in the older law; for example, the doctrine of \"adverse possession\" was so much modified that it might almost be said to have been abrogated; and the right to preserve title by \"continual claim\" was abolished. Acknowledgment of title in writing, however, it was explicitly declared should interrupt the running of the limitations thereby established. The limitation created by the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" was not within the contemplation of the enactment by which this was accomplished, and I do not understand upon what ground it can be held that this provision is available in the present proceedings.\nCounsel relied upon sections 17 and 18, ch. 1 of the Ontario Statutes, 1902. Section 17 is in effect a reenactment of the first section of the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\" Section 18, sub-sec. 4, is a provision the effect of which is to interrupt the running of the statute in the case of acknowledgment of the title of the Crown in writing. The argument is that by force of sec. 18, sub-sec. 4, the so-called acknowledgments are an answer to these proceedings. That argument must be rejected because the effect of the second clause of the first section of the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" taken together, is to establish the title of the subject on the expiry of the prescribed period, and there is nothing in the Ontario Statute of 1902 to indicate an intention on the part of the legislature that this statute should operate to divest a title acquired before it was passed\u2014the statutory period having in this case expired ten years before, in 1892.\nThese so-called acknowledgments, however, have some relevancy in relation to another question which must be dealt with, and that is the broad question whether or not the land was \"held or enjoyed\" by the appellants and their predecessors in such a character as to attract the benefit of the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\" The question is: Have the appellants and their predecessors \"held or enjoyed\" the land as contemplated by the statute for a period of 60 years since the right of the Crown to take proceedings by information of intrusion which is now asserted first commenced?\nThe Crown cannot be disseized by a mere intrusion. The occupation, the holding or enjoying, therefore, contemplated by the statute as attracting the benefit of its provisions cannot be technically possession; but it seems reasonable to read the statute as contemplating such occupation as, if the question arose between subject and subject would constitute civil possession as against the subject-owner. On this assumption two elements are involved in the occupation required, exclusive occupation, in the physical sense, \"detention,\" and the animus possidendi, that is the intention to hold for one's own benefit which, be it observed, is presumed to exist from the fact of \"detention\" alone. Given an occupation possessing these features the statutable conditions are, I think, fulfilled.\nThe first element is admittedly present. Are there circumstances disclosed by the evidence which rebut the presumption of the existence of the animus possidendi ? The answer to this last question turns upon the point whether or not the land was \"held or enjoyed\" in a character inconsistent with the existence of the intention on the part of the occupants to hold for themselves? The circumstances to be considered are chiefly those disclosed by the letters and the petitions of the appellants and their predecessors.\nThe following relevant facts may be inferred from the statements in these letters which, of course, are properly in evidence as admissions against the appellants. First, that Cousens, under whom the appellants claim, went into possession by the permission of Colonel By, in 1832. Secondly, that a dwelling was erected by Cousens which he and his family occupied until the time of his death, and afterwards by his descendants, and various improvements were made by him. Thirdly, that applications from time to time were made, whether before or after Cousens's death does not appear, to purchase the property and that the answers were to the effect that the property was required for the purposes of the canal. Fourthly, that in 1871 a letter was written by the appellant Susan Hamilton requesting a deed of the property and explicitly laying claim to a right to retain it on the ground of possession. Fifthly, a petition was presented to the Government on the 10th August, 1874, by the same appellant asking in view of certain contemplated Government improvements that her \"right\" in the property be protected and that a legal title be granted to her. Sixthly, that in 1890 the Crown having commenced proceedings by an Information of Intrusion, the same appellant presented to the Government another petition throwing herself, as she said, upon the clemency of the Government but making no claim to any right sufficient to afford a legal defence to the proceedings taken by the Grown.\nWith regard to the circumstances under which possession was taken by Cousens, one must not overlook the fact that the statutes above referred to and particularly the Act of 7 Vict., shew unmistakably that the title to this property, which ex hypothesi formed a part of certain land owned by one Nicholas Sparks, was in dispute between Sparks and the officers having charge of the construction of the canal a very short time after possession was taken by Cousens; a dispute which was not settled finally for something like ten years. The bare facts that Cousens went into possession with the permission of Colonel By and that the lands subsequently, by force of 7 Vict. became vested in the Crown for the purposes of the canal are not sufficient to shew that Cousens' occupation was an occupation on behalf of the Crown. They are not sufficient in themselves to repel the presumption arising from the character of the occupation as indicated by the conduct of Cousens himself in erecting a house, making improvements and paying taxes. There is the additional circumstance to be considered in connection with this, that section 29 of the Act 7 Vict., in confirming the grant from Sparks of a strip of 60 feet \"around the basin and by-wash\" explicitly annexed the condition that no building should be erected upon the land so ceded to the canal authorities. I am not now touching the point whether or not this was a condition subsequent by force of which erection of buildings would defeat the grant. The point is that prim\u00e2 facie the continued occupation of this land for the purposes of a residence is not in these circumstances entirely consistent with the assumption that the property was held by the resident on behalf of the public authority which had bound itself and upon which the legislature had imposed the duty to see that no buildings were placed upon it.\nThe letter and the petitions of 1871, 1874 and 1890, respectively, contain nothing supporting the theory that the land had been held on behalf of the Crown; on the contrary, they are almost demonstrative that in the eyes of the persons who signed those documents they and their predecessors had occupied the property solely for their own behoof.\nOn the whole I am unable to find anything in all these circumstances which counterbalances the prim\u00e2 facie case established by the evidence touching the nature of the occupation in fact. The point is raised, however, that a judgment having been pronounced in proceedings commenced by Information of Intrusion in the year 1890 declaring that the lands in question were in the possession of the King and awarding judgment of a moveas manus, stayed the operation of the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\" I am unable to agree with this. The occupation of the appellants' predecessors was not interrupted in fact by that judgment, nor had it the effect of so changing the character of it as to make it an occupation on behalf of the Crown.\nAnglin J.\u2014In the suit of the Crown to recover possession of a lot of land on the south side of Rideau Street, in the City of Ottawa, claimed as part of the Ordnance lands held with, and for the purposes of, the Rideau Canal, the defendants plead two distinct defences\u2014denial of the Crown's title and the acquisition of an adverse title under the \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" (9 Geo. III. ch. 16, sec. 1).\nProbably actually out of possession of the property for eighty-two years before the Information now at bar was filed\u2014from 1832 to the 3rd December, 1914\u2014admittedly out of possession and having had no acknowledgment of its title during more than twenty years, the Crown properly assumed the burden cast upon it by the statute, 21 Jac. I., ch. 14, of proving a subsisting valid title.\nCounsel representing the Attorney-General sought to establish that the land in question formed part of a tract of 60 feet \"round the Basin and By-wash\" of the Rideau Canal at Ottawa reserved to the Crown out of unused lands acquired from Nicholas Sparks and to be returned to him under the statute 7 Vict. ch. 11, as defined by the statute 9 Vict. ch. 42; that these lands had been transferred to the late Province of Canada and vested in the Dominion of Canada on Confederation; and that the claim of title by possession set up by the defendants was answered by a judgment for possession recovered by the Crown in 1890 against their predecessor in occupation and by written acknowledgments of the Crown title.\nIn view of the conclusion that I have reached as to the defence under the \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" I shall merely state the result of a somewhat prolonged and critical investigation of the title preferred on behalf of the Crown. The references in the letter of 1871 and the petition of 1874, respectively written and presented by the defendants' predecessors in occupation, and in the testimony of the defence witnesses, Little and Maloney, to the house in question as situated on the west side of the by-wash, establish as against the defendants, at least prima facie, that the by-wash extended past the property in question and that that property was included in the reservation to the Crown under 7 Vict. ch. 11, as explained by 9 Vict. ch. 42, of a 60 foot tract \"round the Basin and By-wash.\" It should be noted, however, that on the plan of 1847, produced from one of the public departments and put in evidence on behalf of the Crown, the western limit of the 60 foot tract reserved appears to pass through the house occupied by Cuzner. It may well be, therefore, that a portion of the land on which the house stood was not within the reserved tract.\nI do not question the transfer to the Province of Canada of whatever land was comprised in this 60 foot tract as part, or an \"adjunct\" of the Rideau Canal (19 Vict. ch. 45, sec. 6, and last item of the second schedule) or that it became the property of the Dominion of Canada under sec. 108 of, and item 1 or item 9 of the third schedule to, the \"British North America Act\" 1867.\nIt has been stated by very high authority that the purpose of the statute, 21 Jac. I., ch. 14, was to place defendants to informations of intrusion laid by the Crown, in cases to which it applies, on the same footing with regard to proof of title as that held by defendants in ordinary actions of ejectment: Emmerson v. Madison[24], at page 576. The procedure upon such informations is also assimilated to that in actions of ejectment. Shelford's Real Property Statutes, (9 ed.) p. 111. The judgment obtained by the Crown in 1890 was never executed. Possession of the land was never taken under it. In this respect resembling a judgment in ejectment, as to the effect of which the cases are cited by Mr. Justice Cassels, the judgment on the information of 1890 does not afford any proof of the Crown title now available by way of estoppel, admission or otherwise and does not operate as an interruption of possession such as would defeat the prescriptive claim of the defendants under the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\" It is at the highest evidence that the defendants' predecessor in possession had not at the date of the information laid in 1890 a right to possession good as against the claim of the Crown, as in fact, upon the evidence before us, she probably then had not, the adverse possession having up to that time lasted only fifty-eight years. If an acknowledgment of title in the Crown would suffice to defeat a prescriptive claim under the \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" the judgment of 1890, in my opinion, would not amount to such an acknowledgment. Why this judgment was never executed we are left to surmise. No explanation has been vouchsafed of this extraordinary feature of a peculiar case.\nThough for a time disposed to think that the letters of 1871 and 1890 written by the defendants' predecessors in occupation, one to the Minister of Public Works (see 31 Vict. ch. 12, sec. 10) and the other to the Prime Minister, might be regarded merely as offers to pay for \"a paper title\" by way of further assurance of a title by length of possession asserted by the writers, on further consideration I am unable to place that construction upon them. They contain admissions of title in the Crown and otherwise satisfy the requirements of acknowledgments under the \"Real Property Limitation Act.\"\nBut the appellants maintain that acknowledgments of title sufficient for the purposes of the \"Real Property Limitations Act\" do not interrupt the running of the period of prescription under the \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" because, while the latter Act provides for such an interruption by receipt of rents or profits, etc., it contains no reference to acknowledgments of title written or verbal.\nFor the respondent it was contended that in answer to the claim of title under the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" the Crown may avail itself of the provision for acknowledgments made in the \"Real Property Limitations Act,\" to be found in ch. 88 of the C.S.U.C., 1859, sec. 15, and in the subsequent revisions of the same statute. But this section on its proper construction, in my opinion, is limited in its application to cases within the purview of the statute of which it forms part and cannot be extended to cases of adverse possession of Crown lands, to which the \"Real Property Limitation Act\" has no application. Although the rule under which the Crown is entitled to claim that it is not bound by a statute in which it is not named does not prevent its taking advantage of a statute though not named in it, that fact cannot justify extending the application of a provision such as that with which we are dealing, even at the instance of the Crown, to cases that it was never intended to cover.\nApparently to remedy the omission from the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" of any provision for the interruption of the prescriptive period under it by an acknowledgment of title, the Legislature of Ontario, in 1902, introduced for that province, as an amendment to the \"Nullum Tempus Act,\" a provision similar to the acknowledgment section of the \"Real Property Limitation Act\" (2 Edw. VII. ch. 1, sec. 18 (iv.)). At that time, however, the prescriptive period under the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" in regard to the land in question had already been completed for about ten years; and the letters relied upon as acknowledgments had also been written many years before.\nAssuming that such an amendment to the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" enacted by a provincial legislature may be invoked in a proceeding involving the title of the Crown to property claimed in right of the Dominion, it seems to me inconceivable that it can affect the case now before us. There might have been an argument for giving a retrospective operation in this proceeding to the legislation of 1902 had the effect of the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" been merely to bar the remedy of the Crown, leaving its title and estate in the land untouched. It might then have been deemed an enactment for the regulation of a course of procedure (The Ydun) [25], in which there can be no vested right: Republic of Costa Rica v. Erlanger[26], at page 69. But the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" does a great deal more. Although the fact that the Crown has been sixty years out of actual possession of land adversely occupied does not establish title in a person who had occupied the land for a period which had begun when the actual occupation of the Crown had ceased but had lasted for less than the sixty years as against a stranger who has subsequently obtained possession; Goodtitle v. Baldwin[27]; sixty years' adverse possession continuously held by one person, or by several persons successively claiming one under the other extinguishes the title of the Crown and as against the Crown establishes the title of the person, or the last of the persons, so in possession (3 Inst. 190). The effect of the several clauses of section 1 of the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" is that the remedy of the Crown is first barred and then its title is extinguished and transferred to the subject holding adverse possession: Tuthill v. Rogers[28], at pages 62, 72. To vested rights so acquired it would be contrary to sound construction to apply legislation couched in terms such as those of clause (iv.) of sec. 18 of the statute, 2 Edw. VII. (Ont.), ch. 1, which is not in its form or nature declaratory and does not contain a single word indicative of an intention that it should have a retroactive application. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the attempt to meet the defendants' claim of title as against the Crown under the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" by invoking the letters of 1871 and 1890 as acknowledgments of title, fails because the \"Nullum Tempus Act\" prior to 1902 did not provide for an interruption by an acknowledgment of title of the prescription which it enacts.\nAfter counsel for the defendants had called several witnesses to testify to the occupation of the property in question by James Cuzner and his wife and their descendants down to the time of the trial, counsel for the Crown admitted the sufficiency of the proof of possession already adduced, as appears by this passage in the record:\u2014\nMr. Fripp:\u2014I think my learned friend will admit\u2014he does not require me to call any more witnesses\u2014as to our possession. Mr. Hogg:\u2014No, I think not.\nHis Lordship:\u2014Continuous possession for more than sixty years.\nMr. Fripp:\u2014Yes,\nThe learned trial judge accepted the proof of possession given by the defendants as sufficient. In finding against them on this branch of the case he proceeded solely on the acknowledgment of title contained in the letter of 1871.\nI am, for the foregoing reasons, with respect, of the opinion that the defendants are entitled to succeed under the \"Nullum Tempus Act.\" I would, therefore, allow this appeal with costs and would dismiss the information with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAppeal allowed with' costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fripp & Magee.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hogg & Hogg.\n[1] 16 Ex.

Carter, Deceased (Defendants) Respondents.\n1916: November 22, 23; 1917: February 6.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Consideration\u2014Settlement of action\u2014Statute of Frauds\u2014Trade agreement\u2014Restraint of trade\u2014Crim. Code s. 498.\nIn 1905, M. and his two brothers entered into a contract with R. by which they gave him exclusive control of their salt works with some reservations as to local trade. R. assigned the contract to the Dominion Salt Agency, a partnership consisting of his firm and two salt manufacturing companies, which agency thereafter controlled about ninety per cent. of the output of manufacturers in Canada.\nHeld, that the contract was not ex facio illegal and as the Canadian output was exceeded by the quantity imported which may have competed with it, and the price was not enhanced by reason of this control by the Agency, the Court should not hold that it had the effect of unduly restraining the trade in salt or that it contravened the provisions of section 498 of the Criminal Code.\nIn 1914, M., as administrator of his father\u2019s estate, brought action against the estate of C. who, in his lifetime, had been president of the Dominion Salt Agency and president of and largest shareholder in one of the companies composing it. This action was based on an alleged agreement by C., in connection with the settlement of a prior action against the three partners in the Agency, by which he promised to pay five-sixteenths of the difference between the amount claimed and that paid on settlement. Evidence of the agreement was given by the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor in the former action and by defendants\u2019 solicitor also.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (36 Ont. L.R. 244), Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, that the settlement of the action was good consideration for C.\u2019s contract; that his agreement was not a promise to answer for the debt of another and did not need to be in writing; that it was sufficiently proved; and that the evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitor in the former action was corroborated (R.S.O. [1914] ch. 76, sec. 12) by that of the solicitor for the defendants.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The solicitor was not an interested party and corroboration was not required for that reason; if required for any other it was furnished.\nThe original agreement transferring the salt business to R. was executed by the three brothers \u201cas representing the estate of M. deceased.\u201d The action which was settled was brought by the same three persons. After the settlement letters of administration to M.\u2019s estate were taken out.\nHeld, that the present action was properly brought in the name of the administrator but, if necessary for defendants\u2019 protection, his two brothers might be added as plaintiffs.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nGarrow for the appellant. The settlement of the action was consideration for Carter\u2019s contract and fulfilled the condition which made it binding. Halsbury Laws of England, vol. 7, par. 719.\nThe contract was not a promise to answer for the debt of another. Harburg India Rubber Comb Co. v. Martin[2]; Brown v. Coleman Development Co.[3]; Conrad v. Kaplan[4].\nThe plaintiff as administrator had a right to bring this action. Hill v. Curtis[5], at pages 99 and 100.\nThere was no proof that the original contract unduly restrained trade. See Hately v. Elliott[6]; The Queen v. American Tobacco Co.[7] Weir for the respondents. Carter only expressed an intention not understood to be binding. See Farina v. Fickus[8].\nThere was no corroboration of Proudfoot\u2019s evidence which not only the statute but the circumstances required. See Hill v. Wilson[9]; In re Hodgson[10].\nThe administrator of the MacEwan Estate had no right of action. There was no privity between the estate and Carter. Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge and Company[11]; Purchase v. Lichfield Brewery Co.[12]; and plaintiff\u2019s brothers could not be added as parties to defeat the operation of the Statute of Limitations. Campbell v. Smart[13]; Clarke v. Smith[14]. See also Walcott v. Lyons[15].\nAs to the illegality of the contract see Rex v. Elliott[16]; Mason v. Provident Clothing Co.[17]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. (dissenting)\u2014I have come to the conclusion that this appeal ought to be dismissed. I do not give much credit to what has been said concerning the late Mr. Carter being desirous as a man of honour and as a matter of business honesty to pay his share of the appellant\u2019s claim in the former action. I know nothing of Mr. Carter beyond what appears in the record, but I think it is clear that he was engaged in transactions of a dubious character and being a rich man was not only willing but anxious that they should not be brought into public prominence by being discussed in a court of law. Carter was president and manager of the Empire Salt Company, Ltd., one of the companies banded together in the Dominion Salt Agency of which he was also president. Whether he had rendered himself liable under section 496 of the Criminal Code might depend upon whether the objects of this concern were unduly in restraint of trade, but that they were in restraint of trade there can be no doubt. Herbert Morris Limited v. Saxelby[18]; Andrew Miller and Co. v. Taylor and Co.[19]\nBut though I think Carter had the best of reasons for wishing to have the action settled as he succeeded in doing, there is no reason on the face of things to suppose that he did not get it settled for the amount agreed upon after much negotiation between the solicitors for the parties.\nIt is suggested that he was willing to pay personally a further sum which would represent his share of the balance of the claim beyond the amount for which it was settled and that he entered into a binding contract with the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor to do so. It would, I think, require clear evidence to establish this and it seems to me that not only have we no such evidence but there is a good deal of evidence which would prevent a finding to this effect. That Carter would have been willing to pay whatever was necessary is possible, but that he intended to pay more than he could help is, I think, improbable.\nThe evidence of any member of the bar is entitled to be received with respect in the courts but it would be invidious to allow any personal considerations to enter into our estimate of such evidence. Whilst therefore accepting Mr. Proudfoot\u2019s account of what took place between himself and the late Mr. Carter as being in accordance with his belief, it is necessary to weigh the evidence and remember that he is speaking of what took place years ago and that his conclusion is far from being supported by the circumstances.\nI agree with the reasons for the judgment of the Appellate Division in holding that the evidence is of too doubtful and uncertain a character to enable the court to find upon it any proof that a binding promise was ever made or intended to be made.\nIt seems to me most remarkable that Mr. Proudfoot should have omitted to inform his clients of such a promise and the fact that he allowed payment to stand over for years until after the death of Mr. Carter, the only person who could possibly have given any other explanation of the matter, renders it impossible to accept his recollection and understanding of the matter unaided as it is by writing of any sort or description.\nDAVIES J.\u2014A great many questions were raised and debated at bar upon the hearing of this appeal. Some of them related to the binding effect of the promise or contract sued on and alleged to have been made by the deceased, Carter, in his lifetime with Mr. Proudfoot, K.C., the solicitor of the appellant MacEwan, in order to effect a compromise of an action then pending in which Carter was interested, and as to the necessity of corroborative evidence of such promise, and whether if made it was a promise to answer for the debt of another within the Statute of Frauds, and lastly whether there was any consideration for the promise.\nOn all these questions I concur with the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Riddell of the Appellate Division and with the opinion of my brother Anglin J. in this court.\nThe only question upon which I entertained any doubt was whether the original agreement made between the MacEwans and one Ransford with respect to the control of their Salt Works in Goderich and for moneys alleged to be due under which agreement the compromised action had been brought, was an agreement in restraint of trade and contrary to the policy of common law and of the Criminal Code, section 498, and so unenforceable at law.\nThis question was not referred to by the Appellate Division in their judgment which was determined on the other questions raised.\nIt was, however, pressed forcibly in this court by Mr. Weir.\nMr. Garrow for the appellant contended that even if the original agreement was unenforceable as being in restraint of trade and contrary to public policy, the contract on which the present action was brought was not affected thereby, as the contract now in question was based upon an entirely distinct agreement or promise made by Carter.\nBut if I felt obliged to hold the original agreement unenforceable as being in restraint of trade, I would also feel myself compelled to refuse the aid of the court in enforcing the present agreement which, in my opinion, is based upon and depends absolutely upon the existence and enforceability of the original agreement the action with respect to which was compromised.\nThe substantial ground relied upon by Mr. Garrow was that this original agreement was not void on grounds of public policy and as being contrary to the 498th section of the Criminal Code.\nThe original agreement was made between the MacEwans representing the estate, and one Ransford, and was put in evidence.\nIt was to last for a period of five years and in consideration of the annual payment of $2,000 for the said period, gave the sole and exclusive control of the Salt Works and Plant of the MacEwans at Goderich to Ransford, with a provision allowing the MacEwans to \u201cmanufacture salt and sell the same to supply what was known in business as the local retail trade of Goderich\u201d but \u201cat prices which they would be advised of from time to time by Ransford.\u201d A further provision was to the effect that the MacEwans agreed not \u201cto be interested directly or indirectly in the manufacture or sale of salt in any other place or places in Canada\u201d while the agreement lasted.\nNo evidence of any kind was given by the defendants (respondents) that competition had been unreasonably or unduly prevented or that trade had been unreasonably or unduly restrained in the article of salt in any way, or that the agreement was unreasonable in the interest either of the parties or of the public, or that MacEwan had any knowledge that Ransford was acting for a larger combination and not for himself alone, while the evidence of MacEwan and Ransford was in favour of the plaintiffs (appellants) upon these points.\nThe respondents relied upon the agreement as being sufficient in itself and as being ex facie one which the courts would hold to be an undue or unreasonable restraint of trade.\nI am not able to accept that argument. The mere fact standing alone and without other evidence that for a consideration which it is not contended was unreasonable the owner of a salt mine or works and plant should agree to give the sole and exclusive control for a limited period to another person of those works and plant retaining only a right to manufacture for the local trade and sell to that trade at prices to be fixed by the purchaser of the control of the salt works, would not in my judgment justify the court in holding such an agreement illegal.\nI think the question of illegality is one which as a general rule depends upon the surrounding circumstances and that in a case such as this at any rate where no evidence of these surrounding circumstances was given, this contract on the face of it cannot be held so unreasonable as between the parties, or so detrimental to the public, that the court would refuse to enforce it.\nThe latest authorities on the question fully support this position. They are: Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia v. Adelaide Steamship Co.[20], which is a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and North Western Salt Co. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co.[21], a decision of the House of Lords. The headnote to this last decision states the facts as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff company was a combination of salt manufacturers formed for the purpose of regulating supply and keeping up prices, and it had the practical control of the inland salt market. The members of the company were entitled to be appointed as its distributors, i.e., agents to sell on behalf of the company the salt which it had purchased from them. The defendants, who had not joined the combination, agreed to sell to the company for four years 18,000 tons of salt per annum, of which a certain proportion was to be table salt, at a fixed uniform price per ton, and undertook not to make any other salt for sale. They were to have the option of buying back the whole or a part of their table salt in each year at the plaintiff company\u2019s current selling price and were to be appointed distributors on the same terms as the company\u2019s other distributors. The defendants having sold salt in violation of this agreement, the plaintiff company sued them for breach of contract. The defendants did not by their defence raise the issue of illegality, but they sought to rely on certain facts and documents admitted in evidence at the trial upon other issues as shewing that the agreement was illegal as against public policy. The House of Lords, reversing a majority decision of the Court of Appeal, held that the agreement there in question and substantially stated in the headnote was not ex facie illegal.\nUpon the authority of these two cases determined, one by the Judicial Committee and the other by the House of Lords, I have no hesitation in deciding that ex facie the original agreement in question here is not illegal. The speeches of the noble lords who determined the case of the North Western Salt Company21 are most illuminating and instructive upon the question I am discussing. I will content myself with quoting a few extracts only, one from the Lord Chancellor Haldane, at p. 472:\u2014\nIn an appeal which recently came before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia v. Adelaide Steamship Co.[22], my noble and learned friend Lord Parker delivered on behalf of the committee a judgment in which the law on these subjects was fully reviewed. Among other statements in that judgment there is one which bears closely on the question before us. After explaining the difference between a monopoly in the strict sense of a restrictive right granted by the Crown, and a monopoly in the popular sense in which what is meant is that a particular business has been placed under the control of some individual or group, he says (p. 796) that it is \u201cclear that the onus of shewing that any contract is calculated to produce a monopoly or enhance prices to an unreasonable extent will be on the party alleging it, and that if once the court is satisfied that the restraint is reasonable as between the parties the onus will be no light one.\u201d\nMy Lords, I desire to adopt this proposition as applicable to the question before us.\nAnother from Lord Moulton at page 476:\u2014\nIt may be shortly put as follows: if the contract and its setting be fully before the court it must pronounce on the legality of the transaction. But it may not do so if the contract be not ex facie illegal, and it has before it only a part of the setting which it is not entitled to take, as against the plaintiffs, as fairly representing the whole setting. The other extract, which I think very applicable to the appeal now under consideration, is from Lord Sumner at page 481. He says:\u2014\nWhatever else can be made of it, if anything, this is certain, that we do not know half of the facts material to the case. For myself I should require to know much more of the conditions of the trade and of the effect of such arrangements as these before I could profitably express any opinion on the practical rights and wrongs of the sale of salt. In such a matter partial information is as bad as none.\nFor the above reasons and on the above authorities, I concur in allowing the appeal and restoring the judgment of the trial judge, Sutherland J.\nDUFF J. dissented from the judgment allowing the appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The facts of this case appear in the judgment in the Ontario courts[23].\nMr. Proudfoot\u2019s evidence was accepted by the learned trial judge. While there are, no doubt, circumstances dwelt on by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas which, as Mr. Justice Riddell puts it,\nwould\u2014or might be\u2014suspicious in persons of less high standing than Mr. Proudfoot,\nI cannot agree with the learned Chief Justice that they warrant rejecting his testimony or treating the definite promise made by Carter, to which he deposes, as an indefinite expression of mere intention, or as meant to create not a legal contract, but only the moral obligation of \u201ca gentleman\u2019s bargain.\u201d I concur in Mr. Justice Riddell\u2019s interpretation of Mr. Proudfoot\u2019s testimony and, unless I should discredit him\u2014which I am certainly not prepared to do\u2014the conclusion seems to me inevitable that the late James I. Carter meant to enter into a legal contract\u2014collateral to the settlement of the then pending litigation, but for which that settlement and the fact that he would thereby be relieved from what he deemed a humiliating, if not a dishonest position formed the consideration\u2014to pay to the estate of the late Peter MacEwan, represented by the three plaintiffs then before the court, five-sixteenths of the sum of $3,200 or $1,000.\nThe evidence of Mr. Proudfoot was not that of an opposite or interested party within R.S.O. c. 76, s. 12. Yet if, for any other reason, corroboration of it should be necessary or desirable I agree with Riddell J. that it is supplied by the evidence of Mr. Hanna.\nFor the reasons assigned by that learned judge and by Mr. Justice Sutherland, I am also of the opinion that the defendants\u2019 objections based on the Statute of Frauds and on the fact that the present plaintiff sues alone as administrator of his father\u2019s estate are ill-founded. If thought desirable for their protection by the defendants, the plaintiff\u2019s two brothers, who were joint plaintiffs with him in the former action, may be added as parties, as Mr. Justice Riddell has suggested.\nAnother defence, chiefly relied upon by the respondent in this court, which was pleaded and was noticed in the trial judgment, is that the contract on which the former action was brought was illegal and that its illegality so tainted the agreement now sued upon, made in consideration of the compromise and settlement of that action, that it cannot be enforced. The illegality of the original contract has never been determined. The question of its validity might have been settled in the former action, but not without considerable trouble. The rights of the parties could not be known without a judicial decision. For aught that appears the plaintiffs at that time bon\u00e2 fide forbore further litigating a doubtful question. The consideration moving from them was the abandonment not of a right, but of a claim. In relinquishing their right to litigate that claim they gave up something of value. Miles v. New Zealand Alford Estate Co.[24] Carter on his part escaped from an unpleasant position. There was, therefore, consideration for his promise and that consideration possibly was not illegal. Moreover, as his claim was presented at the trial the plaintiff did not invoke the alleged illegal contract.\nOn the other hand, what the defendant\u2019s testator agreed to do was to make good to the MacEwan estate a part of the moneys which it sought to recover under the very contract alleged to be illegal. Though in a sense collateral, was not Carter\u2019s agreement in fact tantamount to a security to the plaintiffs for a partial payment of the fruits of the impugned contract and therefore, if that contract was illegal, itself fatally tainted? Everingham v. Meighan[25], at pages 360 et seq. Did it not spring from, and was it not a creature of, the contract alleged to be illegal? Fisher v. Bridges[26], at page 649; Clay v. Ray[27]. (But see 1 Smith\u2019s L.C. (1915), pp. 435-6; Armstrong v. Toler[28], at pages 271 et seq.)\nIn order that this defence should succeed, however, the illegality of the original contract must be established. It is attacked as a contravention of section 498 of the Criminal Code, the scope of which was somewhat considered in Weidman v. Shragge[29]. The learned trial judge dealt with this branch of the present case in a single sentence. He said:\u2014\nI am unable to find upon the evidence that the defence of the contract being void as against public policy was made out. It is not adverted to at all in the opinions delivered in the Appellate Division.\nThe MacEwans by their contract with Ransford, in consideration of an annual payment of $2,000, gave him control of their salt works and plant at Goderich for five years and agreed not to be interested directly or indirectly in the manufacture or sale of salt elsewhere in Canada, to discourage the erection of other salt works at Goderich and to turn over to Ransford all orders or offers for the purchase of salt which they should receive, other than for retail sales, retaining, however, the right to supply \u201cthe local trade,\u201d but at prices of which Ransford should advise them. I am not prepared to pronounce this contract ex facie illegal. Although it was executed after the formation of the Dominion Salt Agency, the MacEwans were unaware that Ransford was making it in the interests of that company, to which he subsequently assigned it. If they knew at all of the existence of the Dominion Salt Agency, they did not know that \u201cthere was an attempt being made to round up the salt trade.\u201d This evidence given by Hugh J.A. MacEwan is uncontradicted. Moreover it has been shewn that during the period in question, while the Dominion Salt Agency may have controlled 90% of the output of salt by Canadian manufacturers, the importation of salt, duty free, exceeded that output, and for aught that appears to the contrary this imported salt competed with the domestic article. It is also proved that no enhancement in the price of salt resulted from the formation and activities of the Dominion Salt Agency. Under these circumstances I am not prepared to hold, reversing the learned trial judge, that it has been established that in making the agreement with Ransford the MacEwans contravened s. 498 of the Criminal Code. The purpose may have been to limit the facilities for producing, manufacturing, supplying and dealing in salt and to lessen competition therein, but that it was to do so \u201cunduly\u201d has not been shewn. North Western Salt Co. Ltd. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co. Ltd.[30], at pages 469, 471. Neither can I say without more evidence than the present record furnishes as to the circumstances under which the agreement was made and the situation of the salt trade at the time that the restriction imposed upon the McEwans\u2019 right to manufacture and deal in salt was greater than was reasonably necessary for the protection of Ransford in taking over the control of their Goderich works and agreeing to pay therefor the sum of $2,000 per annum, or that it was clearly injurious to the public interest. Attorney-General of Australia v. Adelaide Steamship Company, Limited[31], at pages 794-7; Maxim Nordenfeldt Guns and Amunition Co. v. Nordenfeldt[32]; Collins v. Locke[33]; Dubowski & Sons v. Goldstein[34], at page 484; Underwood & Son v. Barker[35], at pages 303, 305.\nOn the whole case I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by my brother Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Charles Garrow.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A.

VII. c. 30 (Ont.)\u20143 & 4 Geo. V. c. 36 (Ont.).\nWhere the expropriation of land is governed by the provisions of the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906 the date for valuation is that of the notice required by sec. 68(1). The effect is the same under the Act of 1913 if the land has not been acquired by the railway company within one year from the date of filing the plan, etc.\nThe compensation for the land expropriated should not be diminished by an allowance for benefit by reason of the railway to the lands not taken, the Ontario \u201cRailway Acts\u201d making no provision therefor.\nOn appeal in a matter of expropriation the award should be treated as the judgment of a subordinate court subject to re-hearing. The amount awarded should not be interfered with unless the appeal court is satisfied that it is clearly wrong, that it does not represent the honest opinion of the arbitrators, or that their basis of valuation was erroneous.\nWhere the land expropriated is an important and useful part of one holding and is so connected with the remainder that the owner is hampered in the use or disposal thereof by the severance he is entitled to compensation for the consequential injury to the part not taken: Holditch v. Canadian Northern Railway Co. (50 Can. S.C.R. 265; [1916] 1 A.C. 536) distinguished.\nTo estimate the compensation for lands expropriated the arbitrators are justified in basing it on a subdivision of the property if its situation and the evidence respecting it shew that the same is probable. Held, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. that to prove the value of the lands expropriated evidence of sales between the date of filing the plans and that of the notice to the owner is admissible and also of sales subsequent to the latter date if it is proved that no material change has taken place in the interval.\nBrodeur J., dissenting, held that the damages should be reduced; that the arbitrators should have considered only the market value of the lands established by evidence of recent sales in the vicinity.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming the arbitrators\u2019 award on an expropriation of respondent\u2019s land by the appellant company.\nThe various questions raised on the appeal are shewn in the above head-note.\nR.B. Henderson and O\u2019Connor for the appellant. Holditch v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[1], shews that compensation should not be allowed for injurious affection.\nThe benefit to remaining lands should be set off. Nicholls on Eminent Domain, page 330, par. 279.\nTilley K.C. for the respondent referred to Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Taylor[2].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin dismissing this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I assent to the judgment proposed dismissing this appeal, with very great reluctance. That reluctance is occasioned by my belief that the damages awarded are greatly excessive.\nIf I had been sitting in the first court of appeal, I think I should have voted to set the award aside on the ground that the valuation of the arbitrators was excessive and not justified by the evidence. \u2018\nBut sitting in this final court of appeal, I cannot ignore the fact that the Court of Appeal for Ontario (2nd Division) has unanimously confirmed that valuation. I have not been able to find that the arbitrators proceeded upon any wrong principle in making up their award.\nFor some time I wavered considering whether, under the proved facts and the evidence, I should not, even in the face of the approving judgment of the Court of Appeal, allow the appeal on the ground that the valuation was so excessive as almost to shock one.\nAfter reflection and consultation with my colleagues I have decided to assent to the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nDUFF J.\u2014The first question is: What is the date with reference to which the value of the land taken and compensation for damages are to be ascertained? The decision upon this question must be the same whether the rights of the parties are ruled by the \u201cOntario Railway Act\u201d of 1906 or by the \u201cOntario Railway Act\u201d of 1913.\nI think it is the Act of 1906 to which we must look, for the reason that when the Act of 1913 came into force (the 1st July, 1913), the respondent\u2019s right to compensation had accrued. This follows from a consideration of certain provisions of the Act of 1906 as amended by an Act of 1908. This last mentioned Act (ch. 44, sec. 5), amending section 68 of the Act of 1906, provides for the service of a notice upon the owner giving a description of the land to be taken, a declaration of readiness to pay a specified sum or rent as compensation giving also the name of the person to be appointed as arbitrator on behalf of the railway company and for the appointment of arbitrators in the case of failure on part of the owner to accept the sum offered and the ascertainment of the proper compensation by the arbitrators so appointed. Service of this notice is an election by the railway company to take the lands to which it relates subject to the right of abandonment given by sub-section 17. Notwithstanding this provision for abandonment I think the right of the owner upon the service of notice becomes a right which may be put into effect by the appointment of an arbitrator subject, however, to defeasance by the exercise on part of the railway company of the right of abandonment on the conditions prescribed by sub-section 17. He, therefore, has a status not prejudicially affected by repealing or amending legislation in the absence of some express or necessarily implied enactment that such legislation shall so operate: Main v. Stark[3]. It follows that the right of the respondent was a right to be compensated according to the principles laid down by the Act of 1906 and the amendments which had been passed down to the time the notice was given. Section 68 of the Act of 1906 as amended in 1908 evidently contemplates a valuation as of the date of the notice. But if we are governed by the Act of 1913, by section 89 (2) of that Act the date of the \u201cacquisition\u201d of the property is the decisive date when the property is not acquired within one year after the deposit of the plan and book of reference.\nThe contention advanced on behalf of the appellant railway company that compensation is to be ascertained by reference to the date of the deposit of the plan, profile and book of reference (sec. 89, sub-sec. 2 of 3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 36) therefore fails, and compensation must be ascertained by reference to a date not earlier than the date of the service of the notice under section 68 of the Act of 1906 amended as above indicated. The arbitrators have decided that it is im- material as affecting the amount of compensation to be awarded whether this date be taken to be that of the notice which was the 3rd of March, 1913, or that of the warrant of possession which was the 2nd of April in the same year. There seems to be no reason to doubt the correctness of this and consequently the view of the arbitrators on the first point is one to which I think no exception can be taken.\nThe next question to be decided is whether certain provisions of the \u201cOntario Railway Act\u201d (ch. 207, sec. 20, sub-sec. 9, R.S.O., 1897), are applicable which require that the arbitrators in deciding upon the amount of compensation to be awarded are to ascertain the increased value given to the lands not taken by reason of the\npassage of the railway through or over the same of by reason of the construction of the railway where the railway is to pass through such lands\nand that such increased value is to be set off against the\ninconvenience, loss or damage arising from the taking possession or the using of such lands.\nThe argument is based upon section 44 of the company\u2019s special Act, passed in 1901 (1 Edw. VII., ch. 91), and it is in substance that this section 20, sub-section 9, of the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d (ch. 207; R.S.O., 1897), is by the provisions of the special Act made an integral part of that Act and that it continues to apply to the company and company\u2019s works by force of the special Act itself quite independently of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.O., 1897, ch. 207, and that consequently it remained unaffected by any amendment of the last mentioned enactment. The conclusive answer to this argument is found in the last sentence of section 44 of the special Act:\u2014\nAnd the expression \u201cthis Act\u201d when used herein shall be understood to include the said clauses of the said \u201cRailway Act\u201d and of every Act in amendment thereof so incorporated with this Act. The concluding words \u201cso incorporated with this Act\u201d cannot be read as governing the words \u201cevery Act and amendment thereof\u201d without depriving these last mentioned words of all office because the \u201cclauses of the \u2018Railway Act\u2019 of Ontario\u201d (meaning indisputably ch. 207, R.S.O., 1897), specified in the earlier sentence of section 44, are the provisions which have been \u201cso incorporated.\u201d That expression \u201cclauses of the \u2018Railway Act\u2019 of Ontario\u201d either does or does not include amendments of those clauses. If it is to be read as including them, then cadit qu\u0153stio; if it does not, then \u201cevery Act and amendment thereof\u201d must be taken to add something to the phrase \u201cthe said clauses of the said \u201cRailway Act\u201d and if the phrase add anything, there is no reason for putting any limitation upon the meaning of it which would exclude the amendment by which section 20, sub-sec. 9, of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d became non\u2011operative.\nThe next question is whether under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906 itself, which does not include any provision corresponding to section 20, sub-sec. 9, of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (ch. 207, R.S.O., 1897), the arbitrators are bound to allow a set-off as against the compensation that would otherwise be payable in respect of injurious affection.\nMr. Henderson argues that as the owner is entitled only to compensation for loss it is necessarily involved in this, that in estimating the amount of compensation allowance must be made for any increase in value due to the construction of the railway.\n\u201cThe principles\u201d said Lord Buckmaster delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Fraser v. The City of Fraserville[4], on the 25th January, 1917, which regulate the fixing the compensation of lands compulsorily acquired have been the subject of many decisions, and among the most recent are those of Lucas v. Chesterfield Gas and Water Board[5], Cedars Rapids Manufacturing Company v. Lacoste[6], and Sidney v. North-Eastern Railway Company[7], and the substance of them is that the value to be ascertained is the value to the seller of the property in its actual condition at the time of expropriation, with all its existing advantages and with all its possibilities, excluding any advantage due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired.\nTo this may be added a reference to Lord Justice Moulton\u2019s observations in Re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board[8], that the owner receives for the lands he gives up their equivalent, that is, that which they are worth to him in money. The property is therefore not diminished in amount but to that extent is \u201ccompulsorily changed in form.\u201d\nA good deal no doubt may be said in favour of the view that a rigorous application of the principle of compensation thus stated excludes from consideration, in estimating the value of the lands taken on the appropriate date, any elements of value due to the existence of the railway scheme and as regards damages would necessitate the taking into account of any augmentation of value in the lands with respect to which damages are claimed that would flow from the construction or operation of the railway.\nI think this is not the correct principle for estimating value or damages under either the Act of 1906 or the Act of 1913. By the Act of 1913 a date is given with reference to which the value of the land taken, or damages as the case may be, must be ascertained and it is not denied that where this value can be ascertained by reference to the price which could be obtained on a sale to others than the railway company, the claimant is entitled to compensation to the full extent of the value so ascertained.\nThe Act of 1906, it is true, does not explicitly appoint a time with reference to which the value of the lands taken is to be fixed, but having arrived at the conclusion that the statute sufficiently indicates for that purpose the date of the service of the notice the same result follows.\nAs to damages, it is clear, I think, that the claimant is entitled to demand as compensation the difference between the value of the property affected on the date with reference to which the damages are to be appraised, as it would be if the railway were not to run through part of it and that which it is in fact worth to the owner in money on that date taking into consideration the fact that it is to be traversed by the railway.\nMr. Henderson\u2019s next point is that compensation has been awarded on the assumption that the block of 27 acres would be subdivided and sold in lots; on that assumption the owner would not, he argues on the authority of Holditch v. Canadian Northern Railway[9], be entitled to compensation for damages in respect of the whole of the block, but only in respect of those lots which the railway actually crosses. The owner, he contends, cannot claim compensation on two inconsistent assumptions; he cannot have compensation for land taken on the assumption that the property is to be subdivided and sold, and compensation for damages in respect of the part not taken on the assumption that it is to remain as it is.\nI think the arbitrators have not proceeded upon inconsistent assumptions, they have, I think, considered the property as a property capable of subdivision and of producing certain returns for the owner in that state. And as compensation they have allowed the difference between the value of the block as of the appropriate date if it were to remain untouched by the railway and its value on the hypothesis that it is to be traversed by the railway. I think they were right in this. The claimant is entitled to say: \u201cMy block of land in its existing condition would now be worth so much in its entirety for the purposes of subdivision without the railway; it is now worth so much less if the railway is to cross it. I claim compensation for the difference.\u201d\nThe final contention of Mr. Henderson is that the amount awarded is demonstrably excessive.\nThe whole block, of which part (a strip along Dundas Street forty feet wide) was taken, was an area of 27 acres, about ten miles west of the Toronto market, which about three weeks before the notice was served had been bought by Everson for the price of $926 an acre, about $25,000 in the aggregate. The land actually taken had an area of three acres, and for it the arbitrators allowed as compensation a little over $5,000 as well as $3,000 as compensation for injury to the part retained.\nThe right of appeal from the award of the arbitrators is given by sub-section 15 of section 90 of the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1913 in language not substantially different from that of R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, sec. 209(1), which language was under consideration in Atlantic and North West Railway Company v. Wood[10], where Lord Shand delivering judgment for the Judicial Committee stated the effect of the enactment to be the providing for a review of the judgment of the arbitrators as if it were the judgment of a subordinate court, it being the duty of the first appellate court to examine the evidence and while not superseding the arbitrators entirely, giving effect to the court\u2019s own view if satisfied that the view of the arbitrators is wrong. The fact that the Ontario court of appeal whose duty it was so to review the decision of the arbitrators has unanimously confirmed the award and without comment, is a serious obstacle in the way of the appellants here. In Johnston v. O\u2019Neill[11] Lord Macnaghten said:\u2014\nThe appeal is in reality an appeal from two concurrent findings of fact. In such a case the appellant undertakes a somewhat heavy burden. It lies on him to shew that the order appealed from is clearly wrong. In a Scotch case, Gray v. Turnbull[12], where there was an appeal from two concurrent findings of fact in a case in which the evidence was taken on commission and neither court saw the witnesses, Lord Westbury, after referring to the practice in courts of equity to allow appeals on matters of fact, makes this observation: \u201cIf we open the door to an appeal of this kind, undoubtedly it will be an obligation upon the appellant to prove a case that admits of no doubt whatever.\u201d In an English case, Owners of the P. Caland v. Glamorgan Steamship Co.[13], Lord Watson expressed himself as follows: \u201cIn my opinion it is a salutary principle that judges sitting in a court of last resort ought not to disturb concurrent findings of fact by the courts below, unless they can arrive at\u2014I will not say a certain, because in such matters there can be no absolute certainty\u2014but a tolerably clear conviction that these findings are erroneous, and the principle appears to me especially applicable in cases where the conclusion sought to be set aside chiefly rests upon considerations of probability.\u201d\nThe appellants\u2019 situation is not improved where the first tribunal has had the advantage of a view and where the controversy relates entirely to the value of land, a subject in most instances full of uncertainty. There is a crowd of recent cases in which this principle had been accepted; Montgomerie & Co. v. Wallace-James[14]; Greville v. Parker[15]; The Glasgow[16], are examples. Except in regard to the points already discussed and disposed of Mr. Henderson does not argue that the award itself gives evidence of the arbitrators having misdirected themselves; his contention is that the evidence supplied by actual sales of property in the vicinity and of the price paid for this very block only three weeks before the service of the notice, conclusively demonstrates\u2014if the price paid on actual sales is to be accepted as the true test\u2014that the actual selling value of the property taken was much less than the arbitrators found it to be; and that the arbitrators erred in principle by largely disregarding the proper inferences from the facts proved in relation to actual sales and in giving predominant weight to the opinions of real estate experts which could not be supported by reference to actual transactions.\nI do not think that there are sufficient grounds for inferring that the arbitrators failed to appreciate the distinction between evidence of this class and evidence of value supplied by actual sales of the very property to be valued within a short space of time before or after the appointed time with reference to which the valuation was to be made. The area taken by the railway was about one-ninth of the total area of the block, and taking the price paid by Everson as a guide, $25,000, and treating all the property as of equal value, the value of the property taken would be about $2,600, while the compensation awarded for this property was $5,300; but this seeming disparity must be considered in light of the fact that in proportion to its size this area was by far the most valuable part of the property. And, moreover, I am not convinced that the arbitrators were wrong in thinking as they evidently did think, that Everson\u2019s vendor had not appreciated the advantages to be gained by subdividing the property.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The majority award on an arbitration under the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d allowed to the landowner as compensation for land taken and injury to his remaining property $8,365. The Appellate Division, after reservation of judgment, but without assigning reasons, unamimously dismissed an appeal by the railway company. From that dismissal the company now appeals on these grounds:\u2014\n(a) The lands should have been valued as of the date of filing the plan, profile and book of reference\u201422nd February, 1912\u2014and not as of the date of the notice served on the owner under sec. 68(1) of the \u201cRailway Act 1906\u201d\u20143rd March, 1913.\n(b) Enhancement of value of the owner\u2019s property not taken, due to the advent of the railway, should have been deducted from the damages awarded.\n(c) Evidence of sales subsequent to the filing of the plan and even to the order for possession was wrongly received.\n(d) The compensation allowed was grossly excessive; the value of the lands was fixed arbitrarily, or by compromise or average, and was not based on market value; the lands should have been valued as farm lands on an acreage basis and not as building lots on a frontage basis.\n(e) If valued as business lots compensation should not have been allowed in respect of lots of which no part was actually taken, there having been as to them no severance entitling the owner to compensation; and nothing should have been allowed for loss of, or interference with, access. (a) Whether the \u201cRailway Act of 1906\u201d (6 Edw. VII., ch. 30), or the \u201cRailway Act of 1913\u201d (3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 36), should govern, the valuation was properly made as of the date at which the notice to the owner was given. The order for possession followed this notice within one month and there was no material change in the interval. More than a year having elapsed between the filing of the plan and the actual acquisition of the land, if the Act of 1913 governs, under section 89(2) compensation must be ascertained as of the date of such acquisition. If the Act of 1906 applies, although notice of the deposit of the plan is by section 67 declared to be general notice to all persons owning lands shewn thereon of the lands required for the railway, until the notice to the owner prescribed by section 68 is given, the and to be taken is not fixed, since the company may desist, or may deviate within the limit of one mile from the line as located on the filed plan (sec. 59, sub-sec. 13). Moreover, this notice must be accompanied by a declaration of the company\u2019s readiness to pay a sum certain as compensation for the land or damages, which a disinterested Ontario land surveyor must certify to be fair. No other date being mentioned, he compensation here referred to is presumably based upon valuation as of the date of the notice and certificate. There is no provision in the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906, such as is found in the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C. ch. 37, sec. 192(2); 8 & 9 Edw. VII. ch. 32, sec. 2), and in the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1913 (sec. 89 (2)), making the date of deposit of the plan, profile and book of reference the date with reference to which compensation shall be ascertained if the lands are actually acquired within one year thereafter. Under these circumstances I think the notice to the owner, given by the company as directed by section 68 of the Act of 1906, under which it professed to proceed, should be regarded as the equivalent of the notice to treat under the English \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d of 1845. The compensation was properly ascertained as of the date when it was given.\n(b) Sec. 53 of the Ontario \u201cRailway Act of 1906\u201d (sec. 59 of the Act of 1913; compare sec. 16 of the English \u201cRailway Clauses Act\u201d of 1845; the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d of 1845 has been held to imply the same right of compensation: The Queen v. Vestry of St. Luke\u2019s[17]; Ricket v. Metropolitan Rly. Co.[18]), requires railway companies to\nmake full compensation * * * to all parties interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of (the companies\u2019) powers.\nNeither in that Act nor in the Act of 1913 is there any provision, such as is found in the Ontario Municipal Act, directing that the compensation to be allowed shall be confined to damages\nbeyond any advantage which the owner may derive from the work,\n(R.S.O., 1914, ch. 192, sec. 325(1)), or such as is found in the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, sec. 198), that arbitrators in fixing compensation shall take into consideration and shall set off against the inconvenience, loss or damage occasioned the increased value, beyond that common to all lands in the locality, that will be given to any lands of the opposite party (i.e., in a case such as this, of the owner) through or over which the railway will pass by reason of the passage of the railway through or over the same, or of the construction of the railway. In the absence of any such provision the authorities under the English \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d seem to establish that no deduction from or set-off against the full satisfaction * * * for all damage (\u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d sec. 16), which the company is required to pay, may be allowed for any benefit or advantage to the owner\u2019s lands\u2014whether common or peculiar\u2014due to the advent of the railway: Eagle v. Charing Cross Railway Co.[19]; Senior v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[20]\nBy a former Railway Act of Ontario (R.S.O., 1897, ch. 207) express provision was made in sub-section 9 of section 20 for the set-off of increased value similar to that in the earlier Dominion \u201cRailway Acts\u201d of 1879 and 1888, upon which In re Ontario and Quebec Railway Company and Taylor[21], and James v. Ontario and Quebec Railway Co.[22], were decided. In the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906, which repeals chapter 207 of the R.S.O., 1897, section 68 replaces section 20 of the Revised Statute, which it amends by omitting sub-section 9 and in lieu thereof inserting, as sub-section 8 (sub-sec. 9 of sec. 90 in the Act of 1913), a clause directing the arbitrators, besides awarding the value of the lands taken, to state the total amount payable for damages. It would therefore seem that, instead of limiting the set-off to benefit peculiar to the owner\u2019s lands as distinguished from that common to all lands in the locality, as the Dominion. Parliament had done by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1903, section 161, the Ontario Legislature deliberately eliminated consideration by the arbitrators of any benefits or advantages to owners and did away with any deduc- tion or set-off on that account in favour of the railway companies.\nThere appears to be no distinction between section 53 of the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906 and the proviso to section 16 of the English \u201cRailway Clauses Act\u201d of 1845. The appellants, therefore, cannot escape the application of the decisions in Eagle\u2019s and Senior\u2019s cases. But for the line of decisions to which those cases belong, and the peculiar course of the Ontario legislation, to which I have adverted, I should have required to consider very carefully what I conceive may have been the view of the late Mr. Justice Street, that compensation to a landowner, part of whose property has been taken, for the damage he sustains from the execution of a work authorized in the public interest, implies recouping him for his net loss thereby occasioned after credit has been given for such benefit as will accrue from the work to his remaining property: Re Pryce and City of Toronto[23]; Re Richardson and City of Toronto[24]. But it may be that in these cases the learned judge was merely expressing his view of the effect of the Ontario \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d which provides for deduction of the value of any advantage to be derived by the landowner from the work.\nPierce, in his work on Railroads, says at page 211:\u2014\nThe general rule of damages, which covers the part taken and the remaining land, is, that the owner is entitled to the difference between the market value of the whole lot or tract before the taking and the market value of what remains to him after such taking.\nThis method of adjusting the compensation gives the railway company credit for benefit or advantage derived by the owner. See too Bauman v. Ross[25], at page 574. Mr. Henderson argued that because section 20 of ch. 207, R.S.O., 1897, was expressly incorporated in the appellant company\u2019s private Act (1 Edw. VII., ch. 91), sub-section 9 of that section, notwithstanding its repeal, remains in force as to it. But the incorporating section (No. 44), though awkwardly phrased, seems to make it reasonably certain that it was the purpose of the legislature that amendments from time to time made to such provisions of the general \u201cRailway Act\u201d as were incorporated in the appellant company\u2019s special Act should be automatically embodied therein. It therefore seems unnecessary in this case to reconsider the effect of the provision of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d (now found in ch. 1 of the R.S.O., 1914, as section 16 (b)) dealt with in Kilgour v. London Street Railway Co., in which the decision of the Appellate Division[26], which also supports the respondent\u2019s contention, was affirmed in this court upon an even division of opinion.\n(c) Evidence of sales between the date of deposit of the plan and that of the giving of notice to the owner was properly received. To whatever objection the evidence of sales subsequent to the latter date may be open, any such evidence admitted would appear not to have affected the result. Evidence of bon\u00e2 fide sales within a short time after an expropriation accompanied by proof that there had been no material change in value in the interval, would seem to me relevant and admissible.\n(d) While I incline to the view that the compensation awarded is excessive and that sufficient weight was possibly not given by the arbitrators to the sale of the property in question at a price equivalent to $926 an acre made by Wood to Everson only three weeks before the notice to the owner was served, the record undoubtedly contains a substantial body of evidence which supports the view that the value of the property was properly estimated on a basis of subdivision and that at the date of the expropriation there was a market for it as building lots at prices at least as great as those on which the arbitrators proceeded. The reasons for the award given by the majority of the arbitrators shew that they made what they deemed the real value of the property to the owner at the date of expropriation the basis of their valuation. They \u201ctried to look at the matter in the way that would produce the least damage.\u201d The amount awarded, while considerably larger than the railway company\u2019s estimate of the proper compensation, was very much less than the owner\u2019s claim and the estimates of his witnesses. It is true that the precise values on which the arbitrators base their award are not to be found in the testimony of any witness on either side. But it must not be forgotten that they had the advantage of a view of the property. They were not bound to adopt the estimate or opinion of any witness or set of witnesses as to value: Calgary and Edmonton Railway Co. v. MacKinnon[27]. That they did not do so by no means warrants the conclusion that the result at which they arrived was reached by compromise or by averaging the values deposed to by witnesses on either side. Not disregarding the evidence, but giving effect to such of it as they deemed credible and trustworthy, and taking into account the facts disclosed by their view of the property and their knowledge of surrounding conditions, it was the arbitrators\u2019 duty to form and to express their own opinions as to value and damages and there is nothing to shew that duty was not conscientiously discharged.\nThe right of appeal is conferred by sub-section 15 of section 90 of the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1913 (R.S.O., 1914, ch. 185, sec. 90, sub-sec. 15) in terms similar to those of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, sec. 209 (1) The court is directed to\ndecide any question of fact upon the evidence taken before the arbitrators as in a case of original jurisdiction.\nThe effect of this provision has been determined by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee to be that the appellate court\nshould review the judgment of the arbitrators as they would that of a subordinate court, in a case of original jurisdiction, where review is provided for.\nAtlantic and North West Railway Co. v. Wood[28], at page 263. Demonstrable error in principle should not be exacted as a condition of interference: James Bay Railway Co. v. Armstrong[29], at page 631. The appellate court is bound to examine the evidence, not entirely superseding the arbitrators, but correcting any erroneous view of it which it is apparent they have taken. Due regard is to be paid to their findings, and the provision of sub-section 16 of section 90 of the Act of 1913, that\nUpon the appeal the practice and proceedings shall be as nearly as may be the same as upon an appeal from an award under the \u201cArbitration Act\u201d\nis not to be lost sight of. A similar provision of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d is noticed by Lord Shand in Atlantic and North West Railway Co. v. Wood28, at page 263. I shall deal with the award in the manner laid down by these high authorities as I understand them.\nWhile by no means satisfied that if disposing of the matter as a judge of first instance, or if at liberty here\nto entirely disregard the judgment of the arbitrators and the reasoning in support of it\nand\nto consider the evidence as if it had been adduced before the court itself,\nI should not have allowed a substantially smaller amount for compensation, treating the award as the judgment of a subordinate court subject to re-hearing as outlined in Coghlan v. Cumberland[30] or as an award appealable under section 17 of the \u201cArbitration Act\u201d (R.S.O., 1914, ch. 65), and, in either case, affirmed by an intermediate appellate court, Montgomerie & Co. v. Wallace-James[31], at pages 78, 82; Greville v. Parker[32], at page 339; The Glasgow[33], at pages 707, 709-10, I am not prepared to hold it so unreasonable or so clearly wrong that we would be justified, without having had the advantage of seeing the witnesses or of a view, in setting it aside or in substituting for it an allowance based upon our own estimate of the proper compensation, which might, as Lord Shand put it in Atlantic and North-West Railway Co. v. Wood[34],\nbe liable to criticism equal to that to which the award was open.\nI am, therefore, somewhat reluctantly obliged to decline to interfere on the ground that the compensation awarded is excessive. Upon the evidence I cannot say that the amount awarded clearly exceeds the actual loss of the landowner based on the real worth of the property to him, ascertained by taking into account its market value (Dodge v. The King[35]), any restrictions to which its user and enjoyment in his hands were subject, all its potentialities estimated at their present value (The King v. Trudel[36]), and the use made of it by him (market price alone not being a conclusive test): South Eastern Railway Co. v. London County Council[37], at page 258, or that the arbitrators reached their conclusion by process of compromise or average, or that it does not truly represent their honest opinion as to damages, or that their basis of valuation was erroneous.\n(e) In support of this ground of appeal Mr. Henderson cited the very recent Privy Council decision in Holditch v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[38], affirming the decision of this court[39]. Their Lordships\u2019 disposition of that case would appear to have depended entirely upon their appreciation of its facts as expressed in this passage of Lord Sumner\u2019s judgment, at page 543:\u2014\nIn the present case the appellant\u2019s relation to the property had been definitely fixed before any notice to take land was served at all. He had parcelled out the entirety of his estate and stereotyped the scheme, parted with numerous plots in all parts of it without retaining any hold over the use to be made of them, and converted what had been one large holding into a large number of small and separate holdings with no common connection except that he owned them all. There was one owner of many holdings, but there was no one holding, nor did his unity of ownership conduce to the advantage or protection of them all as one holding.\nThe facts in the present case differ toto coelo from those stated by Lord Sumner. The owner here had parted with none of his \u201clarge holding.\u201d The subdivision of it into building lots is merely a scheme to which he may resort for its profitable exploitation. The land taken was part and parcel of one entire estate held by one owner and of especial value to the whole as its most important and useful frontage\u2014it was, again to quote Lord Sumner,\nso connected with or related to the lands left that the owner of the latter is prejudiced in his ability to use or dispose of them to advantage by reason of the severance.\nThe appellants\u2019 railway is not to be constructed upon a public highway, as was the case in Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. Fort William Land Investment Co.[40], referred to by Mr. Henderson. It will occupy a private right of way acquired from the respondent. This will lie between his remaining property and Dundas Street to which, in lieu of the immediate access formerly enjoyed, access can hereafter be had from his remaining land only across the railway tracks of the appellants. Part of his land having been taken he is entitled to compensation for all consequential injuries affecting the remaining land to be occasioned by the exercise of the statutory powers, whether in the construction of the railway or in its subsequent operation: Cowper-Essex v. Local Board for Acton[41].\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Second Appellate Division dismissing an appeal by the appellant railway company from an award in favour of the respondent, Everson, for $8,365.00.\nThe lands owned by Everson consisted of 27 acres in the Township of Etobicoke and the part expropriated represents about 1\u00bc acres. The front of those lands is situate on the main road called Dundas Street.\nThe expropriation took place under the provisions of the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d and the first question which presents itself is whether the property should be valued as of the date of the filing of the plan or of the date of the notice of expropriation or order for possession.\nThe Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906 (6 Edw. VII. ch. 30), contains no express provision as to which compensation is to be fixed. It differs in that respect from the provisions of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nSection 59 deals with the plans and surveys of the railway, and section 67 declares that the deposit of the book of reference and the notice of such deposit shall be deemed a general notice to all persons whose property may be expropriated.\nIt is declared also (sec. 59) that deviations of not more than one mile from the line assigned on the plan might be made.\nThe effect of these provisions is that when the plan is certified by the board and deposited, the parties are notified of the proposed route and are entitled to appear and object. So far no question of compensation is dealt with. As a question of fact, the plan might, when deposited affect one part of a piece of land; but in virtue of the power which the company possesses it might locate its lines a mile further and then the property which was first marked on the plan would not be taken at all.\nIt seems to me clear that the object of the deposit of the plan is to give notice to the parties who might object if they find it advisable to do so.\nBy section 68 as amended in 1908 it is provided that a notice might be served upon the owner, giving him a description of the land to be taken, the offer of a certain sum of money and the name of the arbitrator of the company and will be accompanied by the certi- ficate of the land surveyor to the effect that the land shewn on the map is required for the railway or is within the limits of deviation allowed by the Act. Within ten days of the service of the notice the owner must appoint his arbitrator.\nAccording to these different provisions of the Act and in view of the fact that the deposit of the plan might not specifically contain the land not expropriated, it seems to me that the date at which the amount of compensation should be ascertained would not be the date at which the plan has been deposited; but the date at which the notice has been given to the owner. That was the decision reached by the arbitrators and in which I concur: (Saskatchewan Land and Homestead Co. v. Calgary and Edmonton Railway Co.[42])\nIn 1913, after the notice of expropriation had been served but before the arbitrators began to proceed, an amendment was made to the Ontario \u201cRailway Act\u201d by which it was provided that the date of the deposit shall be the date with reference to which compensation should be ascertained.\nI don\u2019t think that this new provision of the law would have a retroactive effect with regard to the facts of this case. As I have said the effect of expropriation should be from the date at which compensation is ascertained.\nBesides, the company had taken possession of the land before this new law came into force.\nEverson, the respondent, acquired the property on the 10th February, 1913, about a month before the service of the notice of expropriation took place. He purchased the 27 acres of land for the sum of $25,000, or about $926 an acre. His witnesses, however, valued it at $103,000, instead of $25,000, the purchase price, and claimed that by the taking of 1\u00bc acres Everson suffers damage for $35,000, or $10,000 more than he paid for the whole property.\nThe arbitrators, however, would not accept entirely the evidence of those witnesses but awarded the very large sum of $8,365.\nThe property is 3\u00bc miles from the western limits of the City of Toronto and it is pretty evident that it will be many years before this property can be converted into town lots.\nThe law requires that the market price of the land expropriated should constitute the basis of valuation in awarding compensation. That market price can be determined by the sales of property in the neighbourhood. We have in this case properties similarly situated which, in the same year 1913, were sold at prices varying from $413 an acre to $645 an acre. Some other farms were even sold at a smaller price. But none of them reached the sum of $926, which the respondent Everson paid on the 10th February, 1913.\nI consider then that Everson paid a very high price. A month later, on the 3rd of March, the notice of expropriation was given and on the 2nd of April, 1913, an order of possession was granted. Would not that sale of a month or two months previous constitute the best basis for determining the market value of that property? I would not hesitate one moment to answer affirmatively to that question.\nThere was no user of the land nor any special circumstances to make it worth more than the market value which was established by the price for which it was sold shortly before the expropriation. (Dodge v. The King[43]). I am, therefore, of opinion that the sum of $926 an acre should have been awarded to the respondent. That would entitle him to get $1,157.50 for the 1\u00bc acres expropriated. Besides, I would grant him $3,000, the sum found by the arbitrators, for damages caused to the rest of the property.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and the court below and the award reduced to $4,157.50.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Royce, Henderson & Boyd.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\n[1] 50 Can.

Act, 1867\u201d ss. 91 (10), 92 (10).\nIn 1910, Parliament voted money for \u201cMontreal River Improvements above Latchford\u201d and the Crown, through the Minister of Public Works, gave a contract to H. in connection with the work. In performance of the work L. placed a cofferdam on each side of the river leaving an opening between them some 200 feet wide. In the spring of 1911 the cofferdam on the north side was covered by three feet of water and the logs of B., being driven down through the opening, were allowed to rest against a pier a few hundred feet below and formed a jam the rear of which was over the cofferdam. Either by weight of the jam or increased pressure by breaking it, in the ordinary mode, the destruction of the cofferdam was caused.\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, that B. was responsible for the injury so caused; that with more care in driving the formation of the jam might have been avoided; that, if breaking the jam in the ordinary way was likely to cause damage, another mode should have been adopted even if it would cause delay and greater expense; and that the employees of B. acted with a wilful disregard of the contractors\u2019 rights and caused \u201cunnecessary damage.\u201d\nHeld, per Davies, Anglin and Brodeur JJ., that, in the absence of Dominion legislation to the contrary, the rights of lumbermen under the Ontario \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d (pre\u2011Confederation legislation) are not subordinate but equal to those of persons acting for the Dominion Government in matters respecting navigation. Per Davies and Duff JJ., Anglin J. dubilante.\u2014The cofferdam was a \u201cstructure\u201d and subject to the provisions of section 4 of the \u201cRivers and Streams Act.\u201d\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014Even if not a \u201cstructure\u201d as it was placed in the river under sanction of Dominion legislation B.\u2019s rights were restricted practically as they would be under section 4.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J.\u2014A vote for \u201cRiver Improvements\u201d does not of itself authorize an interference with the rights of lumbermen under the \u201cRivers and Streams Act.\u201d These rights were exercised in the usual and proper manner and as no breach of duty by B. to avoid \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d was proved he could not be held liable for the damage to the cofferdam.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (37 Ont. L.R. 17) reversing that at the trial (34 Ont. L.R. 204), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the defendant.\nThe necessary facts are stated in the above head-note.\nTilley K.C. and Wentworth Greene for the appellant.\nMcKay K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The appeal is of importance as raising a question of law of far-reaching consequence quite beyond anything involved in the particular case. It is not only the rights of the appellant which are in issue but the result must seriously affect the interests of the large class engaged in the lumber business, the oldest and still one of the principal industries of this country.\nI am further of opinion that the jurisdiction in the subject-matter of both the Dominion and the provinces is involved, and that the respective governments should have had opportunity to present their views before the court if they so desired. Now no authority is shewn or even alleged for interference by the respondents with the right of floating down his logs which the appellant undoubtedly had unless lawfully deprived thereof. It is not enough to produce a contract with any one, even with the Dominion Government, unless there was competent authority for the construction of the work. The judgment appealed from is based, as the Chief Justice of Ontario says,\non the view that the cofferdam was lawfully where it was and was placed there under the authority of the Parliament of Canada in the exercise of its exclusive authority to make laws with respect to navigation.\nI know of nothing to warrant this view. The Chief Justice suggests that \u201cit may reasonably be found on the evidence,\u201d but I can find nothing upon the subject in the evidence. In the factum of the respondents reference is made to four of the Appropriation Acts in which sums of money are authorized to be expended for Montreal River improvements. There is nothing to connect these with any particular works, they seem to be rather evidence that no works in particular were submitted to or sanctioned by Parliament. It may perhaps be assumed that the vote of those moneys was for purposes within the jurisdiction of Parliament in the exercise of its exclusive legislative authority over the subject of navigation, but I do not think the fact that Parliament has placed at the disposal of the Government certain sums of money for improving the river, can by itself authorize an interference with a public right such as is here in question.\nIt has been suggested that the necessary authority may be found in the \u201cPublic Works Act\u201d (R.S.C., [1906] ch. 39), which in section 9 provides that the Minister of Public Works shall have the management, charge and direction of the properties belonging to Canada therein enumerated which include dams and works for improving the navigation of any water, and also works constructed at the expense of Canada.\nThere is a similar statute to the \u201cPublic Works Act\u201d for each of the departments of the Government service. These Acts are purely concerned with administrative arrangements and the division of Government business amongst the members of the Government and their respective departments.\nI do not think the \u201cPublic Works Act\u201d confers any authority on the Minister of Public Works to undertake works for which the sanction of Parliament is necessary; it only provides that such works when authorized by Parliament shall be under the charge of the Minister of Public Works.\nI do not wish to enter on any consideration of possible doubts as to the authority of Parliament in the circumstances; we have not got the facts sufficiently before us. Whether the river is navigable in parts or only capable of being used for floating down logs, does not appear. At the point where the dam was proposed to be erected there are rapids which prevent navigation and there seems to have been no intention of taking any steps to render it possible. The requirements of the river at other points, or even those of the Ottawa River into which the Montreal River flows, may justify the storage of water at the particular point; it is for Parliament to decide whether this is necessary in the interests of navigation. If it has so decided its decision is not to be reviewed in the courts. In this connection it may be noted that the Ottawa River below its confluence with the Montreal River is not navigable throughout, but at the City of Ottawa there are rapids operating large power plants under lease from the Dominion Government. Whether works for power purposes alone are within the authority of the Dominion Parliament may be doubted.\nThat the authority of Parliament is necessary is so clear as to call for little consideration. The question may not have come before the courts of this country, but there are numerous cases reported in the United States where the law is practically the same since it has been held that the jurisdiction of Congress over trade and commerce covers the subject of navigation, though not expressly mentioned as in the Canadian Constitution. I will only refer to the case of the United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co.[3] An Act of Congess of March 3, 1909, had declared that a public necessity existed for absolute control of all the water of St. Marys River in the State of Michigan \u201cprimarily for the benefit of navigation,\u201d and the following propositions (amongst others) were upheld:\u2014\nThe judgment of Congress as to whether a construction in or over a navigable river is or is not an obstruction to navigation is an exercise of legislative power and wholly within its control and beyond judicial review; and so held as to the determination of Congress that the whole flow of St. Marys River be directed exclusively to the improvement thereof by the erection of new locks therein.\nIf the primary object is a legitimate taking there is no objection to the usual disposition of what may be a possible surplus of power.\nI may point out that the \u201cNavigable Waters Protection Act\u201d (R.S.C. [1906] ch. 115) by the 4th section provides that no dam shall be constructed so as to interfere with navigation without the approval of the site and plans by the Governor in Council.\nThe appellant is not suing for an interference with his rights but is being sued for damage alleged to have been caused in the exercise of such rights to works interfering with them. There can be no liability if the works were not duly authorized and this is not shewn.\nUpon careful consideration of the evidence I am of opinion that the drive of the appellant\u2019s logs was carried out in the usual and proper manner and that nothing was done with wilful or careless disregard of injury to the respondents\u2019 property. Even, therefore, on the assumption that the respondents\u2019 cofferdam was lawfully placed where it was, I fail to see why the duty should be imposed upon the appellant when exercising his rights in the same manner as he had hitherto done of adopting, perhaps at great expense and risk through delay, extraordinary precautions to ensure the safety of the structure. The respondents, of course, knew that logs would be driven down the river in the Spring and should have taken proper measures to safeguard their own property. They themselves recognized this by putting up some measure of protection in a glance-boom which however proved defective and inadequate for its purpose. No actionable negligence on the part of the appellant is shewn and the appeal should be allowed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur generally in the reasons and conclusion of my brother Anglin for dismissing this appeal, though I confess I do not share the \u201cgrave doubts\u201d he expressed with regard to the applicability of section 4 of the \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d to the circumstances of this case.\nOn the question of the applicability of that section I am in accord with the opinions of the Chief Justice of Ontario and of Magee and Hodgins JJ. that the injury done to the cofferdam was in the circumstances of this case an \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d within that section and being such was not justified or covered by the general authority to drive logs down the river conferred by the statute. But if I am wrong in my holding of the applicability of that section to this case, I agree with Anglin J. that the presence of the cofferdam\nin the river under the sanction of Dominion legislation imposed upon the exercise by the defendant of his driving rights a restriction almost, if not precisely, the same as that to which section 4 would, if applicable, have made them subject. There was, no doubt, a correlative obligation on the part of the plaintiffs not unnecessarily or unreasonably to hamper or interfere with the exercise of the defendant\u2019s rights.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the reciprocal obligations of the appellant and the respondents are determined by the application of sections 3 and 4 of the \u201cOntario Rivers and Streams Act.\u201d I think the cofferdam was a \u201cstructure\u201d within section 4; and that in order to succeed it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to shew that \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d within the meaning of that section had been caused by the servants of the defendant, the appellant. \u201cUnnecessary damage,\u201d in my opinion, means damage which it was reasonably practicable to avoid under the existing conditions having regard to the nature of the \u201copening\u201d provided. I agree with Mr. Justice Garrow that the plaintiffs, respondents, failed to show neglect of the duty to avoid \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d in this sense.\nIt is necessary to consider the view of the Chief Justice of Ontario in which Mr. Justice Magee and Mr. Justice Hodgins concurred that,\nthe appellant\u2019s cofferdam was lawfully constructed and maintained under the authority of the Dominion Parliament for the purpose of improving navigation, either in the Montreal River or below that river, by the creation of a storage dam to conserve the head waters;\nand consequently that the,\nrights conferred by the \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d were * * * subordinate to the right to maintain the cofferdam and the provisions of section 4 of the \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d as to the dam or other structure being provided with a convenient \u201capron, slide gate, lock or opening for the passage of timber, rafts and crafts\u201d authorized to be floated down the river, cannot cut down or impair the paramount right to maintain the cofferdam.\nThe \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d was originally enacted by the Legislature of the Old Province of Canada (12 Vict. ch. 87). It may be that it is not within the power of the Parliament of Canada directly to repeal or amend any of the provisions of the Act; Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorneys-General for Ontario, etc.[4]; but its provisions may of course be superseded or overridden by the enactments of Parliament within its jurisdiction, and rights given by these provisions may be completely nullified by the competent enactments of Parliament or made subordinate to other rights created by such enactments.\nThe view of the Chief Justice of Ontario indicated above assumes, first, that it is competent to Parliament in exercise of its legislative authority derived from section 91 (10) of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d in relation to \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d to authorize the construction and maintenance of the work which the plaintiffs were engaged in constructing in such a manner as to interfere with the exercise of the rights of the defendant under the \u201cRivers and Streams Act,\u201d and secondly, that in virtue of legislation by the Parliament of Canada the plaintiffs were invested with authority so to construct the work.\nThe power of Parliament to give such authority under section 91 (29) and section 92 (10) of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d is of course unquestionable, but it is not suggested that this work is part of any work which has been declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada; and there is nothing before us to shew that it is part of a work or undertaking extending beyond the limits of the province or connecting the province with one of the other provinces.\nMoreover, I cannot agree that we are entitled to say that the object of Parliament in authorizing the use of public moneys in the construction of this dam was the improvement of navigation; I know of nothing in the record which justifies that conclusion.\nIt should be presumed that the Minister of Public Works had acquired on behalf of the Crown the right to occupy the site of the dam; and no question has been raised as to his right representing the Crown as occupier to construct and maintain the dam just as any other riparian proprietor could do so long as public or private rights are not invaded.\nBut prim\u00e2 facie as an object of legislative jurisdiction the work which the plaintiffs were engaged in constructing was a \u201clocal work\u201d within the meaning of section 92 (10) and therefore prim\u00e2 facie subject to the exclusive legislative authority of the province except in so far as rights of navigation or other rights under the exclusive control of the Dominion might be affected by it.\nI am not, without further examination of the question, prepared to accede to the proposition that the power of Parliament derived from section 91 (10) in relation to the subject of \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d involves in itself without the aid of the powers conferred by section 91 (29) and section 92 (10) the power to grant authority to construct and maintain works entirely local as to a particular province though connected with navigation and shipping in such a manner as to constitute what otherwise would be an invasion of private or public rights which are not rights of navi- gation or incidental thereto and which otherwise would be within the exclusive control of a local legislature. It is unnecessary to decide the general question for the purposes of this appeal; but it may safely be affirmed that the assumption that every work designed for the improvement of navigation or to provide facilities for navigation and shipping is necessarily a work within the exclusive authority of Parliament for all purposes in virtue of section 91 (10) cannot be supported consistently with due effect being given to the language of section 92 (10) which plainly shews that the expression \u201clocal works and undertakings,\u201d as used there, embraces \u201ccanals\u201d and \u201clines of ships.\u201d\nI think it is clear that in fact the plaintiffs were not invested with any authority by Dominion legislation to interfere with the defendant\u2019s rights under the \u201cRivers and Streams Act.\u201d The plaintiffs rely upon clauses in the \u201cAppropriation Act,\u201d 9 & 10 Edw. VII. ch. 1 schedule C, and 1 & 2 Geo. V. ch. 2, schedule C, by which moneys were appropriated for \u201cMontreal River improvements above Latchford.\u201d The mere appropriation of public moneys would not of course in itself give the sanction of law to acts which would otherwise be an invasion of rights given by statutory enactment or public or private rights under the common law. Sections 9 and 12 of the \u201cPublic Works Act,\u201d R.S.C. ch. 39, do not profess to empower a Minister of Public Works to do acts of that character; and it would of course be quite contrary to settled principles to imply any such authority from doubtful expressions.\nBy ch. 143 R.S.C. (the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d), however, compulsory powers are conferred upon the Minister who is the head of a department charged with the construction and maintenance of a \u201cpublic work;\u201d the \u201cpublic work\u201d (it must be implied) being of such a character that Parliament has authority to confer these powers for the construction and maintenance of it. The work in question (which I assume at this point to be a work of that character) being a work in respect of which public moneys were appropriated by Parliament, it is by section 2 a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of that statute. By section 3 large compulsory powers are given to the Minister and it is arguable that these powers are extensive enough to authorize interference with a river or stream in such a manner as to interrupt the exercise of rights arising from the provisions of the \u201cRivers and Streams Act;\u201d although it should be observed that by force of section 35 authority to interfere with \u201cnavigation\u201d in the construction or maintenance of a public work can only be acquired from the Governor in Council.\nBut however extensive the powers of the Minister may be under the \u201cExpropriation Act\u201d in relation to the construction of \u201cpublic works\u201d in streams, it is made plain by the contract executed by the Minister under which the work now in question was being constructed, that no authority to interfere with rights such as those given by the \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d was vested in the contractors by that contract. Paragraph 20 is conclusive upon this point, providing that the contractors\nshall and will, at their own expense, make such temporary provision as may be necessary for the protection of persons or lands, buildings, or other property, or for the uninterrupted enjoyment of all rights of persons or corporations, in and during the performance of said works.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs sue to recover damages for injuries to a cofferdam erected by them in the Montreal River caused by the defendant in driving pulpwood logs during the Spring freshet of the year 1911.\nOn evidence warranting that conclusion, Middleton J. found that the destruction of the cofferdam \u201cwas brought about by the defendant\u2019s logs,\u201d but absolved him from liability on the grounds that in driving the river he was exercising a statutory right conferred by the \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d (now ch. 130 of the R.S.O. 1914), with due caution and in a usual and reasonable manner and that the damage sustained by the plaintiffs was therefore not \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d within the meaning of sec. 4 of that statute, which the defendant had apparently invoked (though he now contends that it does not apply) and the learned judge regarded as applicable.\nIn the Appellate Division the majority of the court (Meredith C.J.O. and Magee and Hodgins JJ.A.) held the defendant liable on the ground that the plaintiffs in carrying out their contract with the Government of Canada had a paramount right to construct and maintain the cofferdam which the defendant in the exercise of his right of driving was bound to respect, at least to the extent of taking all practicable precautions to avoid doing injury to the structure\u2014even such as would involve expense, delay and risk of partial failure of the drive\u2014and that the injuries sustained being ascribable to failure to take such precautions amounted to \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d within sec. 4 of the \u201cRivers and Streams Act,\u201d and apparently would be actionable apart from that statutory provision.\nGarrow and Maclaren JJ.A. dissented on the grounds that the rights conferred by the \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d as pre-Confederation legislation, which Parliament has not qualified or modified, are not subordinate to, but are co-ordinate with, the rights of persons acting under Dominion legislation for the improvement of navigation; that, although the building of the cofferdam by the plaintiffs had the sanction of Parliament as incidental to the construction of the works for the improvement of navigation which they had undertaken, the exigency of their contract did not justify or require that the cofferdam should remain in the river during the Spring freshet; and that, while the defendant would be liable for wilful injury to it, and might be answerable for injury due to negligence, the evidence shews neither the one nor the other.\nIt becomes necessary, therefore, to determine the status of the plaintiffs in regard to the work in question and to consider to what restriction, if any, the exercise by the defendant of his statutory right of driving was subject.\nThat the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament to legislate in respect of matters affecting navigation is paramount (\u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d ch. 91 (10)), and that the authorization of works for the improvement of navigation falls within that power is unquestioned. By the \u201cPublic Works Act\u201d (R.S.C. ch. 39, sec. 9), the Minister of Public Works is given the management, charge and direction inter alia of \u201cworks for improving the navigation of any water.\u201d By sec. 12, he is required to direct the construction of public works (to be) constructed at the expense of Canada, and by sec. 13, it is declared that, except for necessary repairs and alterations, nothing in the Act shall authorize him to cause expenditure not previously sanctioned by Parliament. By implication \u201cParliament in this legislation has authorized and empowered the Minister of Public Works to direct and cause the con- struction of \u201cworks for improving navigation\u201d for which it may provide that public moneys of Canada shall be expended. By 9 & 10 Edw. VII. (D.), ch. l, sch. C, and 1 & 2 Geo. V. (D.), ch. 2, sch. C, public moneys were appropriated by Parliament for\nMontreal River improvements above Latchford.\nUpon the evidence in the record I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that the erection of the conservation or regulation dam, for which Messrs. Lowery and Goring had contracted with the Government of Canada, through the Minister of Public Works, was part of the Montreal River improvements above Latchford, for the construction of which the expenditure of public moneys of Canada had been authorized by Parliament, and, as such, had been undertaken by the Minister under the sanction of Dominion legislation. The construction of a cofferdam as a proper means for the carrying out of that work was within the authorization and I am, with respect, unable to agree with the view of Garrow and Maclaren JJ.A. that its maintenance from one working season to another in order to complete the work was not likewise authorized.\nIf the driving rights of lumbermen had been derived from post-Confederation provincial legislation, or if the Dominion Parliament had declared them to be subject to the rights of persons engaged in carrying out works sanctioned by it for the improvement of navigation, I should agree with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that they were subordinate to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to maintain their cofferdam and must be so exercised as not to infringe that paramount right.\nBut since, as Garrow J.A. points out, the privileges asserted by the defendant were declared or conferred by a pre-confederation statute, and have been left unmodified by the Dominion Parliament, I think they are on an equal footing with those possessed by the plaintiffs in carrying out their contract with the Minister of Public Works. Sanctioned respectively by legislatures each endowed with plenary and exclusive authority over the subject-matter with which it dealt, derived from the same source\u2014the Imperial Parliament,\u2014the several rights of each of the parties litigant are on the same plane, and, in my opinion, must be exercised with due regard to those of the other.\nIf the 200-foot channel left between the plaintiffs\u2019 cofferdam and the nearest of the south side piers was\na convenient opening in a dam or other structure\nwithin the meaning of sec. 4 of the \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d even after the waters of the river had entirely submerged the cofferdam, I would agree with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario and Magee and Hodgins JJ.A. that the injury done to the cofferdam was \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d within that section and, as such, not within the authority to drive conferred by the statute on the defendant. With the latter learned judge I think that,\nthe statute * * * includes both damage unnecessarily caused during the normal and usual process of driving as well as that which arises, though inevitably, from a method of operation, originally improper, unnecessary or negligent.\nThe respondent (defendant) may have followed the practice generally adopted in these and similar rapids. But it is no answer that the damage thereby caused was inevitable if that method should have been modified in view of the circumstances of the particular case, and because the rights of others intervened.\nI gravely doubt the applicability of sec. 4 of the \u201cRivers and Streams Act,\u201d however, to the circumstances of the case at bar. Yet, although the plaintiffs\u2019 cofferdam may not have been a \u201cstructure\u201d within the protection of that section, its presence in the river under the sanction of Dominion legislation in my opinion imposed upon the exercise by the defendant of his driving rights a restriction almost, if not precisely, the same as that to which sec. 4 would, if applicable, have made them subject. There was, no doubt, a correlative obligation on the part of the plaintiffs not unnecessarily or unreasonably to hamper or interfere with the exercise of the defendant\u2019s rights: Hewlett v. Great Central Railway Co.[5]\nA perusal of the evidence has satisfied me that the defendant\u2019s employees acted with reckless indifference to, and an entire disregard of, the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. They proceeded on the assumption that they had an absolute and unqualified right to drive their logs, using whatever means they might find most convenient and best adapted to accomplish that purpose regardless of the effect of employing such means upon the plaintiffs\u2019 rights or of the damage to their property which might ensue. I am convinced that the men in charge of the defendant\u2019s drive knew that the cofferdam was in the river and knew or should have known that the method of driving which they adopted would imperil its existence. I am also satisfied that, although to do so would have entailed delay and expense and possibly the detention of a portion of his logs until the following season, it was not impracticable for the defendant\u2019s men to have driven the river in such a manner that the plaintiffs would have sustained no injury.\nIf the formation of a side jam extending from the piers of the railway bridge 600 feet up the river over the cofferdam and on to MacNeill\u2019s Point was not deliberately brought about by the defendant\u2019s men, as I incline to think it was, they certainly made no attempt to prevent it. Upon the evidence I think it was practicable to have prevented it. A perfectly proper and reasonable method to employ under ordinary conditions to facilitate the driving of rapids such as those above Latchford, the presence of the plaintiffs\u2019 cofferdam rendered the formation of this side jam improper and unreasonable because it involved unnecessary danger to the cofferdam. Again, when breaking the side jam in the sweeping process, instead of first removing the logs above and over the cofferdam, which probably might have been done, though at greater expense, the defendant\u2019s men followed the usual, and, in ordinary circumstances, not improper course of breaking the jam from below, thus allowing the mass of logs above the cofferdam to press down upon it with great force and violence. The damage complained of was due either to the formation of the side jam over and above the cofferdam, or to the pressure upon it occasioned by the method pursued in breaking it. In both these operations there was, in my opinion, an unjustifiable disregard of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. To quote Mr. Justice Hodgins again:\u2014\nThe respondent (defendant) may have followed the practice generally adopted in these and similar rapids. But it is no answer that the damage thereby caused was inevitable if that method should have been modified in view of the circumstances of the particular case, and because the rights of others intervened.\nBut it is said that the plaintiffs should have protected the cofferdam with an adequate glance\u2011boom, whereas the glance-boom which they hung from MacNeill\u2019s Point, apparently for the protection of a green cement pier, was insufficient to safeguard the cofferdam. There was nothing to indicate to the plaintiffs that the river would be driven in a manner that would render such protection of the cofferdam necessary. Before the defendant\u2019s drive of comparatively small pulp-wood began, Gillies\u2019s drive of 40,000 large logs had all gone down without the formation of a side jam or any other inconvenience or detriment to the plaintiffs. If the defendant\u2019s men proposed to drive his pulpwood so as to bring about the formation of a side jam and thus endanger the cofferdam it was at least their duty to have notified the plaintiffs in order that they might have an opportunity, if possible, to provide an adequate glance-boom to protect the cofferdam. Moreover, I am not satisfied on the evidence that even a glance-boom such as the defendant\u2019s witnesses describe would have saved the cofferdam.\nOn the whole case I think the proper conclusion is that in the management of their drive the defendant\u2019s men utterly disregarded the plaintiffs\u2019 rights, ignoring the golden rule expressed in the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non I\u0153das. For the consequences, which should have been anticipated, the defendant should be held accountable.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The Dominion Parliament voted in 1910 a sum of $25,000 \u201cfor Montreal River improvements above Latchford.\u201d Those works consisted in the construction of dams for which a contract was made by the Department of Public Works with the plaintiff-respondent. In the carrying on of the work the contractors had put in two cofferdams, one on the south side of the river and the other on the north. No question arises as to the cofferdam on the south, the claim being entirely in respect of damages to the cofferdam on the north.\nDuring the Fall and the Winter of 1910, one of the three piers which were to be erected in the place where the cofferdam on the north side was put was built. The two others were to be built in the Spring.\nDuring the Spring of 1911, the level of the water rose above the cofferdam, which became entirely covered. In the Fall previous, however, the superintendent of the defendant-appellant had visited the works and knew of the existence of that cofferdam and of the one pier which had been built. He must have known also that two other piers were to be built in the space covered by that cofferdam.\nThe defendant-appellant had a very large quantity of logs to drive in that river. Those logs were in sixteen booms of fifty thousand each.\nThe logs reached the place about the 18th of May and the water was then running between three and four feet over the cofferdam. The logs stuck on the pier of a railway bridge which was a few hundred feet below and piled back and formed a jam on both sides of the river. There was left in the centre of the stream a channel of about twenty-five feet wide through which all the logs ran. When all the logs were removed, it was found that the cofferdam had been destroyed.\nI do not think there is any doubt as to the jam being the cause of that destruction. It remains to be seen, however, who should stand the loss which has been incurred.\nIt is claimed by the plaintiffs that the driving of the logs was negligently done and the damage could have been avoided by reasonable care either in stationing men at the bridge so as to keep the jam from forming, or by ceasing to open new booms until after they had cleared below and thus avoiding the formation of side jams. The six judges in the courts below who heard the case were equally divided. The action was dismissed by the trial judge but that judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division by a majority of three to two.\nThe main ground of the Court of Appeal is that the cofferdam having been placed under the authority of the Parliament of Canada, the rights exercised by the defendant under the \u201cRivers and Streams Act\u201d to drive his logs were subordinate to the right of the Dominion contractors, the Parliament of Canada having exclusive authority to make laws with respect to navigation.\nI am unable to agree with that proposition.\nThe \u201cRivers and Streams Act,\u201d which is to be found in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, contains provisions which were in the law long before Confederation.\nIt provided that the lumbermen would have the right to float and transmit timber down all rivers, and that no person could place any obstruction in those rivers in order to prevent the passage of timber.\nIt was provided also that if it became necessary to construct any dam in order to facilitate the floating of timber, any person was authorized to construct those dams without doing any unnecessary damage to the river or to its banks.\nThe lumbermen were also given the right to go along the banks of the river for the purpose of assisting the passage of the timber without doing any unnecessary damage to the banks of the river and it was also provided that where there was a convenient opening in a dam for the passage of timber, no person should injure or destroy that dam or do unnecessary damage to it.\nThose rights of the lumbermen existed at the time of Confederation and could not be considered as in- ferior to the rights which the federal authorities possess to deal with navigation or with the improvement of navigation.\nThe question then in this case resolves itself, according to my view, as to whether the defendant-appellant has done unnecessary damage.\nIt appears that the jam on the two sides of the river was created by the logs which were contained in the first three or four booms, and at one time even the middle channel was closed. Efforts then were made by the appellant to open that middle channel and those efforts were successful and instead of removing the logs which were jammed on both sides of the river he opened the other booms and let the logs of those booms go down. That necessitated, of course, a stronger pressure on the cofferdam and was, according to my view, the cause of damage which was not necessary.\nIf immediately after the middle channel had been opened the appellant had driven the logs which were in the jam on the two sides of the river, the damage done to the cofferdam could have been avoided or the damage would have been less. But that would have required some more work and some more expense which the appellant did not feel inclined to do and incur.\nThe plaintiffs and the defendant were both having rights and duties with regard to the use of that river. The plaintiffs, as builders of the dam, were bound to see that the construction of that dam would not interfere to any unreasonable extent with the driving of the logs. The defendant had the right to drive his logs into that river, but he should have done it in such a way that unnecessary damage should not be caused to the builders of the dam. He does not seem to have discharged that duty which the law imposed upon him and should then be liable for the damage which he unnecessarily imposed upon the plaintiffs.\nIt was urged by Mr. Tilley that the clause of the contract between the Government and the contractors providing that the contractors\nshall and will at their expense make such temporary provisions as maybe necessary for the protection of persons or lands, buildings or other property or for the uninterrupted enjoyment of all rights of persons or corporations in and during the performance of the said works\nhas not been carried out.\nI am unable to agree with that proposition.\nA glance-boom had been erected, which perhaps it was not necessary for the constructors to do, but was put up all the same in order to prevent the logs from passing over the cofferdam. It was not to be expected that a jam would take place below the cofferdam and would reach it and if such jam has taken place, as I have said, it is only due to the negligence of the appellant. The plaintiffs had done what they had contracted to do.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Greene, Hill & Hill.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Griffiths & Upper.\n[1] 37 Ont.

Act, 1867,\" s. 92.\nBy section 5 of the \"Succession Duties Act\". of British Columbia (R.S.B.C. [1911] ch. 217), on the death of any person his property in the province \"and any interest therein or income therefrom * * * passing by will or intestacy\" is subject to succession duty whether such person was domiciled in the province or elsewhere at the time of his death. M. B. and his brother were partners doing business in Ontario and owning timber limits in British Columbia. The firm had no place of business nor man of business in that province and never worked the limits. The partnership articles provided: \"8. If either partner shall die during the continuance of the partnership his executors and administrators shall be entitled to the value of his share in the partnership assets. 9. On the expiration or other determination of the said partnership a valuation of the assets shall be made and after providing for payment of liabilities the value of such property stock and credits shall be divided equally between the partners, etc.\" M. B. having died while the partnership existed his share in the partnership assets passed by his will to executors. The Province of British Columbia claimed that his interest in the timber limits was subject to succession duty.\nHeld, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting; that under the terms of the articles of partnership M. B. at the time of his death had an interest in the timber limits in British Columbia which passed by his will and such interest was subject to duty under section five of the B.C. \"Succession Duty Act.\"\nHeld, also, that the imposition of the duty, if taxation, was \"direct taxation within the province\" and within the competence of the Legislature of British Columbia.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the order of the Chief Justice who dismissed the appellants' petition.\nThe essential facts will be found in the above headnote. The proceedings commenced by petition to the Supreme Court of British Columbia praying for a declaration that no succession duty was payable by the estate of Mossom Boyd in respect to the lands in the Province.\nLafleur K.C. and David Henderson for the appellants. The share of a deceased partner is situate where the partnership business is carried on. Hanson on Death Duties, pages 109, 113; In re Ewing[2], at page 22; Commissioners of Stamp Duties v. Salting[3], at page 453.\nA partner's property consists of his proportion of the surplus assets after conversion and payment of liabilities. Lindley on Partnership, 8 ed., pages 402, 403; In re Ritson[4].\nJ. A. Ritchie for the respondent. This case is governed by the decision of the Privy Council in Rex v. Lovitt[5], on the Succession Duty Act of New Brunswick which is substantially the same as that of British Columbia.\nNesbitt K.C. for the intervenant, the Attorney- General for the Province of Ontario, referred to Cotton v. The King[6]; In re Muir Estate[7] Attorney-General v. Hubbuck[8].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I think this case must be governed by the decision in Rex v. Lovitt[9]. The only question is whether the fact that the lands were, as is alleged, the property of the partnership instead of being vested in an individual can make any difference, and I do not see that it can.\nIt is said that all that those claiming under the deceased would be entitled to would be a share in the surplus of assets over liabilities of the partnership. How does this differ from the ordinary case of a residuary legatee who is only entitled to the balance of the testator's estate after payment of debts? In the judgment in Rex v. Lovitt[10] it was said:\u2014\nThe tax is on the gross sum though it may be money used in trade and as such be subject to many deductions before it can fairly be treated as not property.\nThe case has been argued as if it depended solely upon the law governing such matters in the absence of express agreement. I am far from satisfied that that is the correct view. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the articles of partnership are certainly not apt for providing for the usual sale, winding-up and division of the surplus of the partnership. It may well be that on a division and execution of proper releases and instruments, such as is contemplated by paragraph 9, each of them, the executors and the surviving partner, would hold onehalf of the lands, the only difference being that they would hold divided instead of undivided shares. Be this as it may I am satisfied that this real estate in the Province of British Columbia passes under the will and I do not think it possible that payment of succession duty can be avoided on any allegation that the devise may be subject to answer possible liabilities of the partnership:\nI do not wish to embarrass the case by suggesting unnecessary points of doubt, but it is remarkable that though the testator appointed executors and trustees of his will, there is no devise or bequest to them of any property whatever. If the land passes under the devise in the will to the widow and three sons of the testator there would seem a still stronger case why they should be liable for payment of the succession duty.\nThat the lands must be considered as personal property is, I think, a question that chiefly concerns the intervenant, but it must be noted that in most, at any rate, of the cases to which reference has been made the question for decision has been whether the property was liable for probate duty.\nThe claim that the share of a deceased partner is situate where the business of the partnership is carried on, does not, I think, further the appellant's case. The distinction is overlooked between the locality where the asset forming part of the partnership property is situated and the place where the share of the partnership is considered to be situate. So far as this particular asset is concerned the business of the partnership must, I think, be considered to have been carried on in British Columbia. In Beaver v. The Master in Equity of the Supreme Court of Victoria[11], where a firm carried on business in London, Melbourne and Adelaide, it was held that the interest of a deceased partner in the business carried on at Melbourne was locally situate in the Colony of Victoria so as to be liable to probate duty in respect of his will.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014The question to be determined on this appeal is whether the share or interest of Mossom Martin Boyd, deceased, in certain real estate situate in British Columbia standing at his death in his name and in that of his partner William T. C. Boyd, is liable for succession duties under the \"Succession Duties Act\" of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 217.\nThe 5th section of this Act, sub-sec. (a), enacts that:\u2014\nOn the death of any person the following property shall be subject to succession duty. All property of such deceased person situate within the province and any interest therein or income therefrom whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto was domiciled in the province at the time of his death or was domiciled elsewhere passing either by will or intestacy.\nThe case came before the courts on the petition of the executors of M. M. Boyd's estate praying for a declaration that the properties in question were not liable for succession duties because they were acquired by the partnership the \"Mossom Boyd Company\" and were paid for out of the partnership funds; and although standing and held in the names of the individual partners were so held by them on behalf of and as part of the assets of the partnership\u2014and that as the 'business of the partnership was carried on in Ontario, where the head office was and where the books were kept, the interest of the deceased partner in these partnership lands was not liable to succession duty under the British Columbia Act.\nThe Chief Justice of British Columbia dismissed the petition without stating his reasons. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for that province the court was equally divided and the judgment of the Chief Justice therefore stood.\nI think the evidence shews that the partnership carried on its business in Ontario at Bobcaygeon where its head office was and its books were kept and that it had no partner or paid agent to transact business in British Columbia though it purchased and sold lands there as elsewhere in Canada under the terms of the partnership deed.\nI think also it is clearly shewn that the lands in question were purchased and paid for out of the partnership funds and that although they stood in the names of the individual partners they did so in trust for the partnership and must on the death of one of the partners and for the purposes of succession duty be treated as partnership property of the firm.\nI am also of opinion that the shares of the individualpartners in these real properties of the firm must betreated in the absence of any binding agreement between the parties as personalty: Attorney-General v. Hubbock[12].\nThe reasons why this must be so are clearly explained by Brett, M.R., at page 285, and Bowen, L.J., at page 289.\nBut in my judgment it does not matter for the determination of the question on this appeal as to the liability of the property in question to pay succession duties whether it is treated as personalty or realty.\nThe sole question is whether the interest, whatever it may be, of the deceased partner comes within the section of the Act I have quoted.\nThe section clearly overrides and excludes the rule of law based upon the maxim \u201cmobilia sequuntur personam'' and therefore, though the deceased's domicile was in Ontario and the lands were treated as personalty, they would not escape liability on that ground.\nThat point being disposed of by the express terms of the statute, we must determine whether the other judicial rules relating to partnership property have also been set aside or overruled by the statute.\nIt is contended on the part of the appellants, that although the lands were situated in British Columbia and the title stood in the individual names of the partners, still, as they were partnership property of a firm carrying on its business in Ontario, they were not liable under the Act for the succession duties.\nThe contention was made and I agree with it that as under the facts the deceased partner had in law and equity no interest in these lands within the meaning of the statute they were simply these British Columbia assets of the partnership and must be held at its dissolution and for the purposes of succession duty to be situate in Ontario where the business of the partnership was carried on\u2014ad tat the only right or interest the deceased partner or his representative had at the time of his death was a right to share in the surplus assets of the partnership.\nThe law on this subject as above\u2014stated is clearly put in Lindley on Partnership, 8th ed., pp. 402 and 403, and Halsbury, vol. 22, p. 55, where the authorities are collected.\nMossom Martin Boyd's interest in the partnership property under these authorities consisted at the time of his death of the surplus assets of the partnership after its debts and liabilities were paid and discharged and this is the only interest which passed or could pass on his death to his representatives. The only right of the executors of the will of the deceased partner, the petitioner in this court, is a right to have such share of the deceased properly ascertained and paid. The right of the British Columbia Legislature to change and displace these rules of law and to make the interest of a deceased partner in partnership property situate in British Columbia liable to succession duties is not disputed.\nThe question is: Has it done so in the section of the statute quoted above, either expressly or by necessary implication? If it has not so changed and displaced these judicial rules with reference to the interest of a deceased partner in partnership property situated within the province, then cadit questio.\nIn the case of Rex v. Lovitt[13],so much relied upon by the two learned Judges in the Court of Appeal as supporting the right of the province to claim the succession duties in this case, the Judicial Committee did certainly determine that a competent legislature may if so minded and by the use of apt language in its legislation impose a succession duty on property within its jurisdiction, even if in so doing it displaces the rule of law based upon the maxim lia sequuntur personam.\nTheir Lordships first decided that the monies there in question being deposits made by the deceased testator in his lifetime in a branch bank in New Brunswick of the Bank of British North America whose head office was in London, England, were primarily at least payable in St. John, New Brunswick, where the branch bank was and came therefore within the words of the statute\nproperty within the province. They held further that the rule of law based upon the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam had been expressly displaced by the language of the section which made all such property liable to succession duties though the testator's domicile may have been outside of the province.\nBut the decision in that case does not help the Crown in the case before us because the British Columbia statute does not profess to displace any of the rules of law relating to partnership property or to alter the rights of a deceased partner or his representatives on his death in or to such property.\nI am quite at a loss to understand what words in the section now under discussion can be invoked to displace any of such judicial rules. If none can then these rules must be given effect to.\nThe mere fact that the property stood in the individual names of the two partners cannot affect the question.\nIt was partnership property and the partners held it in trust for the partnership.\nThe only interest which the partner held was a right to share in the surplus assets of the partnership and as the business was carried on outside of the province the succession duties, if any such were payable at all, would be payable in the province where the business was carried on.\nThe words of the section relied upon as displacing by implication the ordinary rules of law relating to partnerships and the interest of the partners therein are no doubt these,\nall property of such deceased person situate within the province and any interest therein or income therefrom.\nFrom what I have already said it will be apparent that my conclusions are that the deceased partner had no interest in these properties at his death within the meaning of the section in question and that any interest he had with respect to them or that his representatives had under his will was a right to have them treated as partnership properties and to share in the surplus assets of the partnership the business of which was carried on in Ontario and not in British Columbia. In other words, the property was not that of the deceased partner nor had he any interest in it. His sole right and that of his representatives on his death was the right to have the property treated as a partnership asset in winding-up its affairs in Ontario.\nThe answer to the argument arising out of the title to the lands standing in the individual names of both partners at the decease of Mossom Martin Boyd is that previously stated by me, namely, that it being shewn to be partnership property purchased with partnership funds the deceased and his partner would be held respecting them to be trustees for the partnership and the executors of the deceased's will would be compelled to join in a sale of the properties for partnership purposes or otherwise to convey and assure the properties to the surviving partner for partnership purposes. No interest other than his right to a share of the surplus assets of the partnership was held or possessed by the deceased partner at his death or could be disposed of by his will in these properties.\nIf the legislature intended to make any such interest liable to succession duties they would have used express language to displace the rules of law respecting it as they did when they desired to displace the rule of law respecting personal property founded on the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam. I would therefore allow the appeal and grant the declaration prayed for.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The late Mossom Martin Boyd carried on business in Ontario along with his brother under articles of partnership which I will presently refer to, and having made a will, also to be referred to, died 8th June, 1914, when amongst other assets they held timber lands situate in British Columbia.\nThese lands had been acquired and registered in the names of the said Mossom Martin Boyd and his said brother William Thorncroft Cust Boyd and were held as partnership property.\nThe question raised herein is whether the Province of British Columbia can, under its \"Succession Duties Act,\" R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 217, sec. 5, claim that any interest in said lands or income therefrom was subject to succession duties.\nSaid section 5 so far as directly dealing with the matter involved, is as follows:\u2014\n5. (1) Save as aforesaid the following property shall be subject on the death of any person, to succession duty as hereinafter provided, to be paid for the use of the province over and abave the probate duty prescribed in that behalf from time to time by law;\n(a) All property of such deceased person situate within the province, and any interest therein or income therefrom whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto was domiciled in the province at the time of his death, or was domiciled elsewhere, passing either by will or intestacy.\nIt is denied by appellant that this enables the province to .collect duties in any case of death of a partner when the partners had carried on business and resided beyond the province at the time of such death.\nWe have been by means of the liberal citation of cases invited to consider the probate .duties, the succession duties, the death duties, the legacy duties payable heretofore and now under a variety of English statutes, the voters' franchise and legislation bearing thereon, and in the same way the several Acts in force in England and her colonies bearing respectively upon such like duties or rights not overlooking sundry other Acts such as \"Locke King's Act,\" and last but not least the \"Mortmain Acts,\" in order to be helped to a proper understanding of the sections just quoted.\nBriefly put the argument was based upon the theory that land held by the members of a partnership was held as joint tenants and therefore the share of one dying would by due course of law become vested in the survivor or survivors to be held subject to the terms of the articles of partnership as part of the assets of the firm and only be accounted for by the survivor or survivors in course of his or their winding-up the firm business or default through the court which necessarily must observe the doctrine of equity jurisprudence by which all the assets must be treated as personal property and as there could be no claim made by the personal representative of a deceased partner to any of the assets and only a possible claim to share in the residue of the proceeds realized by survivor or court in Ontario in due course of liquidation there was nothing for the said statute to operate upon.\nI have in deference to the course which that argument has taken in the hands of able counsel considered all these cases, but I cannot say that I am much helped thereby to a solution of the actual problem presented to us to determine. Many of these cases cited to us had to distinguish between what should be held to be real and what personal property in certain contingencies for the purpose of applying the Act imposing a pro- bate duty, or for other purposes the equitable doctrines properly relevant in certain cases wherein land had in fact furnished the basis of the dispute but in such view had to be treated as personal property.\nWe have no such distinctions to make herein or at least if such like distinction has to be observed it rests upon other conditions than those arising in many of the cases cited.\nIt matters not whether the interest that passes by this testator's will is real or personal or a mixture of both. Whatever it is the clear purpose of the Act is, if we study its provisions as a whole and regard its purview, to see that whatever passes shall be taxed.\nThere are some rather cogent reasons for holding that under the state of the law in England nothing in said land would have, if governed thereby, passed by such a will but the possible share of the personal representatives of deceased in the ultimate residue of the realized'assets of the firm. .But when I come to try and apply such reasons to this particular statute and its entire purpose and the relation thereof to the peculiar facts of the case and to the laws of British Columbia, to which I am about to advert, I must hold that something in the nature of an interest in the property or the income thereof has passed.\nIt would surprise the appellants to be told that nothing in British Columbia passed by the will.\nIt is self-evident that everyone concerned felt the necessity of holding that something else than suggested in argument passed; else why resort to the British Columbia Probate Court for ancillary letters through the statutory provision for recognition of the Ontario probate?\nAnd when we go a step further we find that, in order to make a title to any purchaser of the British Columbia lands in question, or even to one of those concerned in the event of a partition thereof, it seems necessary in order that there should be any title pass in either such case (the provisions of the '' Land Registry Act\" are such) that the parties concerned must resort to the will and probate and only by means thereof can title be made.\nThese features seem to me to furnish the crux of the case to be considered and decided.\nThere does not seem to be anything in the nature of a transmission to the surviving partner such as formerly enured in England and does yet, by reason of the title being one of joint tenancy.\nThat phase of the English law of real property seems to be practically taken away by reason of the provision of the \"Land Registry Act,\" ch. 127, of the Revised ,Statutes of British Columbia, 1911, sec. 52, which enacts as follows:\u2014\nSection 52. Where by any letters patent, conveyance, assurance, or will, or other instrument made and executed after the twentieth day of April, 1891, land has been or is granted, conveyed or devised to two or more persons, other than executors or trustees, in fee-simple, or for any less estate, it shall be considered that such persons took or take as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants, unless a contrary intention appears on the face of such letters patent, conveyance, assurance, or will, or other instrument, that they are to take as joint tenants.\nIt will be observed that executors or trustees are the only grantees who may receive a title in joint tenancy to be governed by the incidents of survivorship peculiar to such a tenure unless by express provision to the contrary.\nThere is no such implication to be presumed from the mere fact of the existence of a partnership between the grantees.\nThere is no such statutory provision in England, so far as I can find, and certainly the text books indicate that the presumption of a grant to more than one person whether partners or not is, unless otherwise expressed, a grant to hold as joint tenants with all the incidents of survivorship incidental to joint tenancy.\nI need not dwell on the exceptions presumed from circumstances. It may be observed that many English decisions and some of those cited to us turn upon this conception of the law in England\nThe right of survivorship in law founded thereon has often enabled surviving partners to deal properly and advantageously with the partnership estate and even wind it up.\nWe. must also remember \"that the jurisdiction of courts of equity over the administration of partnership is so comprehensive that the views of these courts, treating the entire property of such partnerships for that and like purposes as personal property, being that to which everything in the last resort is reducible by the process they adopt, dominate legal minds.\nHence we find the propositions laid down, perhaps rather broadly, by high authority that all partnership property is personal. Obviously the expressions so quoted relate to such cases as happen to be dealt with for some purpose incidental to a partnership as such, or to the view of courts of equity in administering partnership assets.\nI cannot accede to such a proposition as of universal application and covering cases where the partners see fit expressly to provide for an entirely different treatment of their assets.\nWhat a court of equity may do and find necessary to do in the course of administering a partnership estate in order that third parties may get their share, when no other provision has been made therefor, and the principles and practice of proceeding in a court of equity have to be observed, is one thing. But when third parties have not to be protected and the partners have by their contract between themselves made ample provision for the manner of dealing with partnership assets, it is entirely another thing, and I venture to think that in such a case no court of equity would interfere with that provision or the mode of carrying it out, but rather would aid in the due execution thereof according to the agreement.\nNow what is the condition of things existent in the partnership we have to deal with and to which we have to apply if we can the statute now in question?\nThe articles of partnership are in the case and dated 23rd November, 1892, subsequent to the coming into operation of the statute I have quoted above relative to the nature of the tenure under which the lands acquired by the firm should be held, and constituting it, presumptively at least, a tenancy in common.\nI may remark here that in Ontario there had long existed a statutory provision from which I imagine the British Columbia Legislature copied that which I quote above, substituting the year 1891 for that of 1834 in the Ontario enactment.\nThis fact is, of course, of no further consequence than to suggest the mode of thought likely to prevail with business men of Ontario when acting as partners they enter into a bargain for the management of and dealing with their property including real estate at home and abroad. It may require that due heed should be paid to that circumstance in interpreting the language they have used in framing their articles of partnership and the agreement therein for the winding-up of their estate. When due heed is paid thereto and to the language used in such articles and they are thus found to possess a meaning in accord with what a business man would read therein freed from the hampering preconceptions lawyers often have of what men are about, I submit no court should interfere with, but try to execute, the purpose in the business man's mind.\nThe articles of partnership in question herein provided for its continuation for ten years from the date thereof or until the partnership had been determined by either party giving six months' notice to the other.\nFollowing such provisions are articles 8 and 9 which are as follows:\u2014\n8. If either partner shall die during the continuance of the partnership his executors and administrators shall be entitled to the value of the partnership property, stock and credits to which the deceased partner would have been entitled on the day of the date of his death.\n9. On the expiration or other determination of the said partnership, a full written account shall be taken of all the partnership property, stock, credits and liabilities, and a written valuation shall be made of all that is capable of valuation, and such account and valuation shall be settled, and provision shall be made for the payment of the liabilities of the partnership, and the balance of such property, stock and credits shall be divided equally between the partners, and each shall execute to the other proper releases and proper instruments for vesting in the other, and enabling such other to get in such property, stock and credits.\nClearly this partnership ended by the testator's death and what article 9 provided, probably was duly carried out. And however that may be it is to be presumed it was so until the contrary appears.\nWe are not informed on all this as we might have been. Probably a full exposition of the results of the provisions just quoted and what done pursuant thereto, would have deprived the theoretical argument submitted of much of its application.\nThe will of the testator is produced and assuming it was intended thereby, as suggested by counsel on the argument, to deal with the interest of the deceased in the lands in question it furnishes an illuminating com mentary on the pretensions set up in argument.\nThe will provides a period of ten years is to be allowed for carrying out the greater part of the provisions made therein, in order to prevent any loss to this testator's estate by too hasty a realization of the assets.\nIs not the fair inference that the testator well knowing the above quoted provisions for the settlement of the partnership affairs expected and intended that there should be no enforced winding-up thereof in the manner contemplated in the argument herein, but that after the valuation there should be a division of the lands as well as goods available for partition and the trustee executors be enabled thereby to execute the testator's directions. Every one of long experience in Canada knows the need that exists for dealing with timber limits and lands as this testator directs.\nSuch seems to me to have been the scope and purpose of both the articles of partnership and the will, and that there was thereby a transmission of the testator's interest in the lands in question clearly within the meaning of the statute in question rendering it liable beyond peradventure to the payment of succession duties in British Columbia.\nIn that view there is no need for speculation as to the possible outcome of a winding-up of the partnership by a sale of the assets and on the realization thereof a payment of money in Ontario where the surviving partner and the executors presumably would execute their respective duty or trust and the money be payable.\nThere also seems clearly in such a view no room for the argument presented on the basis of the results of such a speculative way of looking at the matter. Even in such an alternative I by no means have a doubt as to what the legislature intended.\nThe expression of that intention might well have been better put, so as to cover the grounds taken in argument.\nHowever that may be, there is in sub-section (d) of section 5 a provision made against the possible vesting of an estate in a joint tenancy whereby the beneficial owner might under the strict literal terms of sub-section (a) escape.\nThis provision against any possible resorting to such subterfuge clearly suggests, that the case of any other analogous result arising from the doctrine of survivorship in a joint tenancy was not expected as a thing that could arise under the law of British Columbia.\nIt is difficult to imagine a more tangible asset possessing a local situs than land in any country and especially so where both by virtue of the provisions I have quoted the tenancy would be presumed to be a tenancy in common and by the provision of the \"Land Registry Act\" it is contemplated that each of the parties named in the registry as owners, or their representatives, must join in order to effect a transfer of the entire estate.\nThe provision of section 25 of the \"Partnership Act\" declaring that real estate as between the partners shall \"be treated\" as personal or movable and not real and heritable estate, does not seem to me to affect the operation of the Act in the slightest degree so far as it relates to the situs of the property or interest therein to be taxed. It simply fits what courts of equity for purposes of administration have always, at least prim\u00e2 facie, maintained. There may arise sometimes but cannot in this case an arguable question as to the measure of interest of a partner in an insolvent partnership concern or one possessing little value. I express and indeed have no opinion in regard thereto.\nI only refer to it to illustrate that there may be questions other than that of situs arise out of said section 5 in relation to which section 25 of the \"Partnership Act\" may have a bearing.\nThe Province of Ontario desired and was allowed to intervene. The fullest argument possible is always desirable in these cases. But we have no right, and are indeed not asked to pass upon the possible claims of that province, resting upon such theories as the argument presents, to maintain another succession duty even if the British Columbia claim is maintained. That possibility is properly suggested in argument as a reason for great care on our part.\nThe case of Rex v. Lovitt[14], goes a long way to maintain the respondent's claim.\nThe actual situation of the properties and the necessity to obtain probate where situated in order to secure the recovery of it or to enable any dealing with it, were cogent reasons in that case for maintaining the claim. Both exist and are strengthened in this case by the need for compliance with the \"Land Registry Act.\"\nMoreover, in this case it was not seriously disputed in argument that the province would have the power within the jurisdiction conferred by the \"B.N.A. Act\" to impose direct taxation upon or in respect of the land in such a contingency as appears to result from the dissolution of a partnership by death and all involved therein.\nIt comes back to the narrow question of whether or not the legislature has succeeded in expressing it- self within the meaning of that power. I think it has. The act of doing or attempting to do so has to bear the test of its being fitted to British Columbia laws and the condition of things created thereby, or flowing therefrom. Neither the power nor the mode of expressing its exercise can be very adequately helped by analogous cases founded on other laws and other conditions of things.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The Mossom Boyd Company was a firm composed of two members, Mossom Boyd and William Boyd, carrying on (inter alia) a lumber business with its head office at Bobcaygeon in Ontario. The partnership was formed on the 23rd November, 1892, and by the articles was to last for ten years; but the partners continued to carry on business as a partnership at will down to the death of Mossom Boyd in June, 1914. Both partners were domiciled in Ontario. Certain timber lands and timber leases were acquired in British Columbia and, it is admitted, became partnership property, and were partnership property on the death of Mossom Boyd. These properties were acquired and were registered in the names of the partners as individuals, as tenants in common in fee simple or as lessees.\nThe partnership acquired property in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec as well as in Ontario and British Columbia. There was no place of business in British Columbia and, excepting the acts done in acquiring the properties mentioned, in the payment of rent and taxes and license fees and in other acts incidental to the ownership of the property, it did not at any time carry on business in British Columbia.\nThe question is whether the deceased Mossom Boyd had in these properties in British Columbia an interest that on his death became subject to succession duties under section 5, sub-sec. 1a of the \"Succession Duty Act,\" R.S.B.C. 1911, which enactment is in the following words:\u2014\nSec. 5 (1). Save as aforesaid, the following property shall be subject, on the death of any person, to succession duty as hereinafter provided, to be paid for the use of the province over and above the probate duty prescribed in that behalf from time to time by law:\u2014\n(a). All property of such deceased person situate within the province, and any interest therein or income therefrom, whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto was domiciled in the province at the time of his death, or was domiciled elsewhere, passing either by will or intestacy.\nThat no such interest was vested in the decedent is alleged for the reason that by the law of British Columbia as well as by that of Ontario the \"share\" of a partner in the partnership assets is not an interest in any specific asset of the partnership but is merely a right ultimately to receive his share of the proceeds of the sale of the surplus assets after payment of the partnership liabilities. This right, it is said, is of the nature of personal property and the right had its situs, it is alleged (referring to the right of Mossom Boyd), in Ontario where the head office of the business is and where for many purposes the business must be deemed to have been carried on.\nThe conclusions to which we are asked to assent as flowing from this are, first, that no interest devolved under the will of Mossom Boyd which was \"property\" belonging to him\nsituate within the province\nand secondly, that any attempt to subject this right of the decedent to succession duty would be ultra vires as not being\ntaxation within the province\naccording to the meaning of sec. 92 \"B.N.A. Act.\" The second of the questions raised presents little difficulty. The title to land and to interests in land within the boundaries of the province is a subject within the exclusive jurisdiction of the province and no question can be raised touching the authority of the legislature to declare that on the devolution of a registered title consequent upon the death of one of two tenants in common the land or the undivided half interest vested in him whether as trustee or otherwise shall be charged with the payment of a duty to the Crown or that a condition of the registration of the title devolving by reason of his death or of the recognition as jura in re of the rights of the beneficiaries for whom that title is held in trust shall be the payment of such a duty. The extent of the legislative jurisdiction with respect to lands within the province may be gathered by reference to the decision of the Privy Council in McGregor v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Co.[15]. This observation is subject to one qualification and only one, and that is that such legislation would not be effective if it appeared that, although \"taxation,\" it did not when its real purpose was considered, fall within the description \"direct taxation.\" Payne v. Rex[16], at page 560.\nThe first proposition stated above rests upon the assumption that at the time of his death Mossom Boyd had no interest in the partnership lands in British Columbia which could be described as \"property\" or interest in \"property\" within the meaning of the \"Succession Duty Act.\" With his brother as co-partner he was registered tenant in common, having vested in him an undivided moiety in the \"absolute fee\" in the timber lands and being joint lessee under the timber leases. It is argued, however, that the \"absolute fee\" vested in the partners as individuals was held by them as bare trustees for the \"partnership.\"\nThe discussion of the question thus raised will be simplified by adverting to some of the fundamental principles of the English law of partnership. For our present purpose it is most suitable to quote a passage of Lord Lindley's from the 5th edition, Lindley on Partnership, at page 111:\u2014\nThe firm is not recognized by lawyers as distinct from the members composing it. In taking partnership accounts and in administering partnership assets, courts have to some extent adopted the mercantile view, and actions may now be brought by or against partners in the name of their firms; but speaking generally, the firm as such has no legal recognition. The law, ignoring the firm, looks to the partners composing it; any change amongst them destroys the identity of the firm; what is called the property of the firm is their property, and what are called the debts and liabilities of the firm are their debts and their liabilities.\nNotwithstanding the change effected by the \"Judicature Acts\" alluded to in this passage \"we have not yet\" as James L.J. says in Ex parte Blain[17], at page 533:\nintroduced into our law the notion that a firm is a persona\nWhen it is said therefore that property held in the names of the partners as partnership property is held \"in trust for the partnership\" it should be understood that what is meant is not that the partners are not the beneficial as well as the legal owners of the property but that as between the partners themselves and those claiming under them the property is dedicated to the purposes of the partnership, and that each partner holds his interest in trust for such purposes. The partners are owners in the fullest sense both at law and in equity. It is true nevertheless that as between the partners themselves and those claiming under them and generally speaking as between the creditors of the partnership and the creditors of an individual partner the share of an individual partner in the partnership assets is merely the share to which he may prove to be entitled in the clear surplus of the assets after the partnership affairs have been wound up, the property sold and the debts and liabilities paid. This rule and its effect through the operation of the equitable, doctrine of conversion are explained in a well-known passage by Kindersley V.-C. in Darby v. Darby[18], referred to with approval by the Court of Appeal in Attorney-General v. Hubbock[19]. The passage is in the following words:\u2014\nNow it appears to me that, irrespective of authority and looking at the matter with reference to principles well established in this court, if partners purchase land merely for the purpose of their trade and pay for it out of the partnership property, that transaction makes the property personalty and effects a conversion out and out. What is the clear principle of this court as to the law of partnership? It is that on the dissolution of the partnership all the property belonging to the partnership shall be sold, and the proceeds of the sale, after discharging all the partnership debts and liabilities, shall be divided among the partners according to their respective shares in the capital. That is the general rule and it requires no special stipulation; it is inherent in the very contract in partnership. That the rule applies to all ordinary partnership property is beyond all question; and no one partner has a right to insist that any particular part or item of the partnership property shall remain unsold, and that he should retain his own share of it in specie.\nIt is said to be involved in this doctrine that a partner has no right or interest in any specific asset of the partnership and further that the share of each partner in the assets is a right, the situs or constructive locality of which has no necessary relation to the situs in fact of the individual items and that the true rule of law is that for all purposes this share or interest of the individual partner has its seat in contemplation of law at the firm's principal place of business;\nThe crucial question in the present controversy is whether Mossom Boyd had at the time of his death an interest in the British Columbia assets which the statute lays hold of. The question whether or not these assets became notionally converted into personal property on the acquisition of them by the partnership is not immaterial, but it is not the precise point involved.\nIn the present appeal these questions must as Mr. Ritchie argued be considered with reference to the terms of the partnership articles and the relevant provisions are these:\u2014\nWHEREAS the parties hereto are desirous of carrying on the business of manufacturing lumber in all its branches and the purchase and sale of real estate or such other ventures as may from time to time be agreed upon between said parties, and have concluded to enter into and form a partnership according to the true intent and meaning of these presents.\n*****\n8.If either partner shall die during the continuance of the partnership his executors and administrators shall be entitled to the value of the partnership property, stock and credits to which the deceased partner would have been entitled on the day of the date of his death.\n*****\n9.On the expiration or other determination of the said partnership, a full written account shall be taken of all the partnership property, stock, credits and liabilities, and a written valuation shall be made of all that is capable of valuation, and such account and valuation shall be settled, and provision shall be made for the payment of the liabilities of the partnership, and the balance of such property, stock and credits shall be divided equally between the partners, and each shall execute to the other proper releases and proper instruments for vesting in the other, and enabling such other to get in such property, stock and credits.\nThese terms of the contract between the parties seem either to exclude or greatly to restrict the application of the doctrine of Darby v. Darby[20], even as be\u2014 tween the partners themselves. Primarily the business of the firm was lumbering and prim\u00e2 facie, I think, the arrangements of the partners did not contemplate the disposal of such properties as were purchased in British Columbia by sale of them as lands except as the result of agreement between the partners. It is quite true that no lumbering appears to have been carried on by the firm in British Columbia but we are not entitled to assume, I think, that the purchase of the timber lands and the acquisition of the leaseholds were operations merely in the business of \"buying and selling real estate.\"\nIt should be noted that the \"charge\" arising out of the partnership articles was not registered.\nTreating these timber lands as part of the assets of a firm whose business was lumbering it would follow that in law neither partner would as between himself and his co-partner during the existence of the partnership have the right to sell them without the concurrence of the other, a possibility which no doubt never entered the mind of either of them. Then the terms of section 9 exclude the right of either partner, conferred by law in the absence of agreement to the contrary, to insist upon a sale of the partnership property at dissolution, a right which as Lord Justice Cotton pointed out in Ashworth v. Munn[21] at page 374, is not merely a right to insist upon a sale for the payment of the debts but a right in each partner in his absolute discretion to insist upon a sale even after the debts have been paid. This British Columbia property cannot therefore be treated as (to use the words of Bowen L.J. in Attorney-General v. Hubbock[22]:\nin the end subject to a trust for sale; and this, I think, is sufficient evidence of the existence of a \"contrary intention\" within the meaning of section 25 of the \"Partnership Act,\" R.S.B.C. (1911), ch. 175. The general rule therein laid down that where such \"contrary intention\" does not appear partnership property is as between the partners and the heirs and personal representatives of a deceased partner to be treated as personal estate, consequently does not apply.\nSection 8 must of course be considered. That section, I think, should be read with section 9 and its office appears to be to fix the date in relation to which the value of the partnership assets is to be ascertained.\nIn this view it cannot be affirmed that no interest in the British Columbia assets devolved on the death of Mossom Boyd as part of his estate. At his death an undivided interest in these assets was vested in him as land, subject to the operation of the stipulation of section 9.\nTrue the effect of section 9 is to provide a method of distribution which in the result might give the whole of the British Columbia assets to the surviving partner; but at the death of the deceased partner his interest was an undivided interest in the partnership assets as a whole, including the British Columbia assets, an undivided interest in every item of the assets subject to a charge for payment of debts.\nSome light is thrown upon the question of the nature of the partner's legal status with reference to the real property assets of the partnership during the existence of the partnership, by a consideration of the practice existing prior to the passing of the \"Partnership Act\" as regards the taking in execution of a partner's share for his separate debt. Before the passing of that Act partnership property could be seized un- der a writ of fi. fa. upon judgment against one of the partners for his separate debt, the sheriff seizing such of the partnership effects as might be requisite and could be seized under the writ and selling the undivided share of the judgment debtor in them. The legal effect of such seizure and sale is described in Lindley on Partnership (5 ed.), at page 358. The purchaser being a stranger unconnected with the firm acquired for his own benefit all the judgment debtor's interest in the property comprised in the sale and became as regards such property tenant in common with the judgment debtor's co-partners. The purchaser, however, held this interest subject to all the equities which the co-partners had upon it and subject therefore to their right to have all the creditors of the firm paid out of the assets of the firm and consequently pro tanto out of the property seized by the sheriff.\nIt is clear, therefore, notwithstanding the fact that a suit in equity was formerly necessary or might have been necessary in such a case to have the partnership accounts taken and to have the partnership property correctly applied, that each of the partners had an interest in specific assets of the partnership which could be seized and sold under a judgment against him for his separate debt.\nA few sentences from Lord Justice Lindley's judgment in Helmore v. Smith[23], at page 447, may be advantageously quoted:\u2014\nA writ of fi. fa. was issued against one of the two partners in the business of coal merchants. Let us consider what the sheriff could do under that fi. fa. He could seize all such of the assets of the firm as are seizable under a fi. fa., but he could not seize book debts or goodwill. The fi. fa. does not\u2014 touch such things; and it is a mistake and a very serious mistake, to suppose that when the sheriff, under a separate execution against one of the several partners, seizes the partnership goods, and sells the share and interest of the execution debtor in those goods, the sheriff can or does in practice sell the whole of the execution debtor's interest in the partnership. Such a case is conceivable, but in practice it never arises, because there are always in practice assets which cannot be reached by a fi. fa. What the sheriff has got to sell is not the share and interest of the execution debtor in the partnership, but the share and interest of the execution debtor in such of the chattels of the partnership as are seizable under a fi. fa.\nI find some difficulty in holding that an interest which could be seized under afi. fa. in British Columbia and sold by a sheriff under the authority of the writ is not an interest in property situated in British Columbia, and therefore subject to duty under section 5 of the \"Succession Duty Act.\"\nIn 1897 the law of British Columbia was changed by the \"Partnership Act;\" by section 24, sub-sec. 1, of that Act it was provided that a writ of execution should not issue against any part of the partnership property except on a judgment against the firm. By sub-section 2 another remedy is submitted. A judgment creditor having a judgment against a partner is given a right to obtain an order charging the debtor's interest in the property of the firm and subsequently to have a receiver appointed to get in that interest.\nIt seems probable that section 24 would not apply to the property of a partnership such as that of the Mossom Boyd Company, which had no place of business in British Columbia, which carried on business in other jurisdictions and had its principal place of business elsewhere; and if the section does not apply then the old law still remained applicable to the British Columbia assets of this firm and at the time of Mossom Boyd's death his interest in the partnership chattel property in British Columbia was exigible under a judgment against him in accordance with the old law.\nIf section 24 does apply then the second sub-sec- tion could only take effect as authorizing a charging order upon the partner's interest in the property in British Columbia and the appointment of a receiver to realize that interest. On this hypothesis the observation made above as to the difficulty of holding that an interest capable of being so dealt with is not an interest situated within the province and not an interest within section 5 of the \"Succession Duty Act,\" is equally pertinent.\nIn 1897 when the \"Partnership Act\" was introduced into British Columbia and for a number of years afterwards land and interests legal and equitable in land including charges on land and the moneys thereby secured could be seized and sold under a writ of fi. fa. and I can see no reason why the interest of a partner in the firm's real estate should not be subject to be taken in execution under that writ just as his interest in the firm's chattels was. It is useful also to refer to Ashworth v. Munn[24], at pages 370 and 374, cited by Mr. Ritchie as shewing that a partner's interest in the assets of a partnership which possesses land among its assets is an interest in land.\nAshworth v. Munn[25], is an illuminating case. The decision was that a bequest in favour of a charity of the residue of a testator's real and personal property, part of which consisted in money to be derived from the sale of his share of the partnership assets which in part were land, was hit by the \"Mortmain Act\" and void, the share in the partnership assets being, as the court held, an interest in land. Lord Justice James, at page 369, says:\u2014\nIt appears to me that in a private partnership which has got land it is difficult to say that the partner has not an interest in land * * * their interest is exactly in proportion to what the ultimate amount coming due to them upon the final taking and adjustments of the accounts may be.\nThe partnership in question, it may be noted in passing, was one to which the doctrine of Darby v. Darby[26], applied. But the case is chiefly valuable because all their Lordships agreed that their decision must be governed by the judgment of Lord Cairns in Brook v. Badley[27]. In effect the court held that Lord Cairns reasoning, the substance of which is given in a passage I am about to quote, extends to the interest of a partner where land is included in the partnership assets. \"If a testator,\" says Lord Cairns, at page 674,\ndevises his land to be sold, and the proceeds given, not to one person, but to four persons in shares, and if one of those four persons afterwards makes his will, and gives either his share of the proceeds or all his property to charity, the position of that second testator with regard to the estate which is to be sold is in substance that of a person who has a direct and distinct interest in land. The estate is in the hands of trustees, not for the benefit of those trustees but for the benefit of the four persons between whom the proceeds of the estate are to be divided when the sale takes place. It may very well be that no one of those four persons could insist upon entering on the land, or taking the land, or enjoying the land qud land, and it may very well be that the only method for each one of them to make his enjoyment of the land productive is by coming to the court and applying to have the sale carried into execution, but nevertheless the interest of each one of them is, in my opinion, an interest in land; and it would be right to say in equity that the land does not belong to the trustees, but to the four persons between whom the proceeds are to be divided.\nEven on the assumption that \"value\" in section 8 of the partnership articles means value in money, I am unable to agree that no interest devolved having a situs in British Columbia.\nI do not think the effect of section 8 on that assumption, is to convert the tenancy in common of the partners into a joint tenancy. The interest of the de- ceased partner in the partnership assets existing at his death which is explicitly recognized by section 8 would devolve in the usual course subject to the rights created by sections 8 and 9 according to which the surviving partner would be entitled and compellable to take over that interest on payment of its value ascertained under section 9; and in any view there would be a charge on the whole of the partnership assets for the purpose of paying the sum thus due from the surviving partner: Ashworth v. Munn[28]. The registered title to the undivided moiety of the British Columbia real estate vested in Mossom Boyd at the time of his death would devolve upon his heirs and devisees and the surviving partner, I think, would not be entitled to demand a transfer except upon paying this sum.\nI can see no difficulty in ascertaining the portion of this sum which ought properly to be regarded as compensation for the interest in the British Columbia lands since the total amount is determined by the valuation of these lands among the other assets; and I have great difficulty in understanding upon what grounds it can be alleged that the charge upon these lands for the payment of the moiety of their value plus the registered title in fee to that moiety does not constitute an interest dutiable under section 5, subsection la of the \"Succession Duty Act.\" See In re Hoyles[29].\nA number of decisions of the highest authority were cited in which, as between the place of domicile of the partners and the place where the assets were and where the business was wholly carried on, the courts had to decide which place was in point of law[Page 565]\nthe situs of the share of a deceased partner in the partnership assets considered as an entirety; and in such a case it was held that the share had its situs where the assets and the business were: Commissioners of Stamp Duties v. Salting[30]; Beaver v. Master in Equity[31]; Laidlay v. Lord Advocate[32].\nThese authorities decide nothing as to a case where the question in dispute relates to a partnership having immovable assets purchased for the purposes of the partnership business in different jurisdictions and where the partnership articles contemplate carrying on business in those jurisdictions with a principal place of business in one of them; I think they establish no principle which governs the construction of the \"Succession Duty Act\" in its application to such a case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014The late Mossom Martin Boyd was domiciled at Bobcaygeon, in the Province of Ontario. He was a member of the firm of Mossom Boyd & Co. which had its chief place of business at Bobcaygeon where all its affairs were managed. It had neither an office nor a resident agent in the Province of British Columbia. Amongst the partnership assets, bought with the firm's moneys, were certain timber lands and timber limits in British Columbia, title to which was registered in the names of the two partners but was held by them in trust for the firm. The question presented is whether an interest in this property devolved under the will of the late Mossom Martin Boyd which is liable to payment of succession duties under sec. 5 of the British Columbia \"Succession Duties Act\" (R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 217). What passed under the will was the share or interest of the testator in the partnership assets. While living he had no enforceable claim upon or interest in any particular piece of property belonging to the partnership in specie. His only right was to be paid his share out of the surplus assets of the partnership. That and nothing more is the right which he transmitted to his personal representatives: Re Ritson[33], at page 131; Lindley on Partnership (8 ed.), 694-5. It is a right similar to that of a legatee of a share in the residue of an estate, which does not give him a share or interest in any particular property of the estate in specie, but merely entitles him to have the estate as a whole duly administered and to receive the designated share of the clear residue: Sudeley v. Attorney-General[34], at page 21.\nSo far as the firm's assets consisted of lands, in the absence of any binding agreement between the partners to the contrary they are to be regarded as personal estate (Re Bourne[35], at pages 432-3) as between the partners themselves and as between persons claiming under them; In re Wilson[36], at page 343; and they are so to be regarded in cases where the Crown is concerned as well as in other cases: Attorney-General v. Hubbock[37], at page 499.\nWhatever the character is that is impressed on the property when the breath leaves the body of the owner, that is its character for the purpose of the fiscal duties which are alleged to attach upon it: Attorney-General v. Hubbock[38], at page 280.\nThe operation of a contractual provision, the performance of which can only affect the property after the death, need not be considered: ibid, page 286. I find no binding \"agreement between the partners\" which prevented their interests in the British Columbia timber lands of Mossom Boyd & Co. being regarded as personalty at the moment of Mossom Boyd's death.\nThe situs of a share of a deceased partner is where the business is carried on: Stamp Commissioners v. Salting[39], at page 453. A partnership may of course control several separate businesses each carried on in a distinct locality. That was the case in Beaver v. Master in Equity[40]. It is not the case here. All the firm affairs were carried on as one business, managed and directed in and from Bobcaygeon, Ontario. As Lord Herschell said in Laidlay v. The Lord Advocate[41], at page 485:\u2014\nThe question to be determined is what is the local situation of the asset with which we have to deal, because that the testator's interest in the partnership, however it is to be described, was one of his assets is beyond dispute.\nIn my opinion the share of Mossom Boyd in the partnership which devolved under his will was locally situate in Ontario.\nIf it be competent for a legislature whose powers of taxation are restricted to\ntaxation within the province\nto declare that property, to which the general law of the province applicable under the circumstances attributes a situs outside the province, shall nevertheless, for the purpose of this or that species of taxation, be deemed situate within the province (I respectfully adhere to the view which I have more than once expressed that such a legislature has not that power: Lovitt v. The King[42], at page 161; The King v. Cotton[43], at pages 534-5); the legislature of British Columbia has not attempted to abrogate the general principles of partnership law to which allusion has been made, as it was held in Lovitt's Case[44], at pages 221-2\u2014unnecessarily as I view it\u2014the legislature of New Brunswick had done in regard to the application of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam to moveable property of a non-domiciled decedent having a situs within that province. On the contrary, by sections 23 (2), 25 and 46 of the \"Partnership Act\" (R.S.B.C., ch. 175) so far as they go, those principles have been affirmed to be the law of the province.\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to state that the duties are claimed not in respect of the bare legal estate in the lands, which, although it of course devolves in, and under the law of, British Columbia, has no tangible value, but upon the beneficial interest held in trust for the partnership purposes.\nI am, for these reasons, with great respect, of the opinion that the share of Mossom Martin Boyd in the partnership of Mossom Boyd & Co. which devolved under his will was not an interest in property situate in the Province of British Columbia within section 5 of the \"Succession Duties Act.\"\nI also think that the duties in question cannot be regarded as fees payable for services rendered by the provincial authorities of British Columbia in granting ancillary probate: Re Muir Estate[45], at page 458.\nI would, therefore, allow this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pooley, Luxton & Pooley.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Elliott, Maclean & Shandly.\n[1] 23 B.C.

On completion of the houses and on receipt of the balance of price and amount of advances, the vendors to execute a deed of the lots. I. gave contracts for the building which was partly completed, and $3,400 was advanced by the vendors when I. became insolvent and the vendors, under the terms of their agreement, gave notice of forfeiture and took possession of the property. Prior to this liens had been filed for labour and materials supplied and the lien-holders brought action for enforcement thereof against the vendors.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (35 Ont. L.R. 542), Davies and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the vendors were not owners of the property according to the definition of the term \u201cowner\u201d in section 2 (c) of the \u201cMechanics Lien Act\u201d and, therefore, were not liable to pay for the labour and materials supplied for the building, of the houses by I.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014To make the vendors \u201cowners\u201d because the work was done with their privity and consent a direct dealing between them and the materialmen was requisite and of this there was no evidence.\nBy section 14 (2) of said Act, the vendors, under the agreement for sale, became mortgagees of the land sold with their rights as such postponed to those of the lien-holders in respect to any \u201cincreased value\u201d given to the land by erection of the houses thereon.\nHeld, that though they had refused it, at a former stage of the proceedings, the lien\u2011holders should, if they wish, have a reference to permit of revision of their claims on the basis of the vendors being mortgagees, any amount found due to them on such reference to be set-off against the costs payable by them in the Appellate Division and on this appeal.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of the official referee in favour of the appellants.\nThe respondents the York Farmers Colonization Company, Limited, are a land company. They sold to one Irving four lots on Edmund Avenue, Toronto, for $2,400, he paying a cash deposit of $120 and undertaking to erect four houses according to plans furnished by the vendors, the company to advance money for building purposes, and, when the houses were completed, deeds to be given to the purchaser on payment of the balance of the purchase price and re-payment of the advances with interest.\nThe property is under the \u201cLand Titles Act,\u201d R.S.O. ch. 126, and the agreement was not registered.\nIrving proceeded to build the houses and these appellants supplied labour and materials therefor. The appellants registered mechanics\u2019 liens against the property under the Act (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 140) and it is undisputed that they are now entitled to the liens as against Irving\u2019s interest in the property.\nIrving became insolvent and the company exercised their right under their contract with him to serve notice of forfeiture. After the notice of forfeiture they took possession of the property and claim now to hold the houses free from any liability to the appellants under the mechanics\u2019 liens.\nThe houses when completed would have been worth about $2,400 each, that is to say $9,600, independently of the land. The respondent company advanced $3,400 to Irving under the agreement. Two of the houses were about finished, a third was roofed in and the walls of the fourth up to the joists, leaving about $3,000 still to be expended to complete all four.\nThe issue was tried before R.S. Neville Esquire, K.C., official referee, at Osgoode Hall, Toronto. He delivered judgment establishing the liens of these appellants as against the interests of both Irving and the York Farmers Colonization Company in the lands in question.\nFrom this judgment the York Farmers Colonization Company appealed and the Second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversed the judgment of the official referee, being of the opinion that the referee erred in finding that the liens of the appellants attached as against the interest of the respondent company in the property.\nSection 6 of the Act (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 140) provides that:\u2014\n\u201cUnless he signs an express agreement to the contrary * * * any person who performs any work or service upon or in respect of or places or furnishes any materials to be used in the making, constructing * * * any erection, building * * * for the owner, contractor, or sub\u2011contractor shall by virtue thereof have a lien for the price of such work, service, or materials upon the erection, building, * * * and the and occupied thereby or enjoyed therewith or upon or in respect of which such work or service is performed, or upon which such materials are placed or furnished to be used.\u201d\nAnd section 8 (1) provides that:\u2014\n\u201cThe lien shall attach upon the estate or interest of the owner in the property mentioned in section 6.\u201d\n\u201cOwner\u201d is defined by section 2 (c):\u2014\n\u201c(c) \u2018Owner\u2019 shall extend to any person body corporate or politic, including a municipal corporation and a railway company, having any estate or interest in the land upon or in respect of which the work or service is done, or materials are placed or furnished, at whose request and\n(i) upon whose credit or\n(ii) on whose behalf or\n(iii) with whose privity and consent or\n(iv) for whose direct benefit\nwork or service is performed or materials are placed or furnished, and all persons claiming under him or them whose rights are acquired after the work or service in respect of which the lien is claimed is commenced or the materials furnished have been commenced to be furnished.\u201d\nSections 8 (3) and 14 (2) of the Act are as follows:\u2014\n8. (3) Where the land upon or in respect of which any work or service is performed, or materials are placed or furnished to be used, is incumbered by a prior mortgage or other charge, and the selling value of the land is increased by the work or service, or by the furnishing or placing of the materials, the lien shall attach upon such increased value in priority to the mortgage or other charge.\n14. (2) Where there is an agreement for the purchase of land, and the purchase money or part thereof, is unpaid, and no conveyance has been made to the pur- chaser, he shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed a mortgagor and the seller a mortgagee.\nRaney K.C. and C. Lorne Fraser for the appellants. Respondents had an \u201cinterest\u201d in this land and the terms of the agreement for sale respecting the building of houses amounted to a \u201crequest\u201d: Orr v. Robertson[2].\nThese terms also made it impossible for respondents to deny that the work was done with their privity and consent. See Graham v. Williams[3]; Blight v. Ray[4]; West v. Elkins[5]; Gearing v. Robinson[6]; Orr v. Robertson2.\nOn the question of appellants\u2019 rights against the respondents as mortgagees see Thom Canadian Torrens System, page 164; Richards v. Chamberlain[7]; Hynes v. Smith[8]; McVean v. Tiffin[9]; McNamara v. Kirkland[10]; Cook v. Koldoffsky[11]; Charters v. McCracken[12]; Rose v. Peterkin[13]; Miller v. Duggan[14].\nB.N. Davis for the respondents. The appellants\u2019 lien is not superior to ours so far as the advances to Irving are concerned: Cook v. Belshaw[15]; Kennedy v. Haddow[16].\nMere knowledge of the work being done and materials supplied is not \u201cprivity and consent.\u201d See Graham v. Williams[17]; Gearing v. Robinson[18]; Slattery v. Lillis[19] at page 703; Quinn v. Leathem[20], at page 506.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I do not dissent from the judgment dismissing this appeal reserving to the appellant the right to a reference under the conditions mentioned in Mr. Justice Anglin\u2019s notes.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Second Appellate Division of Ontario which reversed that of the official referee before whom the case was tried, which latter judgment maintained the claim of the now appellants to a lien against the interest of the respondents in the lands in question as \u201cowners\u201d under the \u201cMechanics Lien Act,\u201d R.S.O., 1914, ch. 140.\nThe main question argued was whether the appellants were owners of the lands within the meaning of the word \u201cowner\u201d defined in the interpretation clause 2(c) of that Act.\nSubsidiary questions were also raised and argued whether if the claimants were not such \u201cowners\u201d the \u201cmortgage or other charge\u201d which the respondents claimed to have as a prior claim to the appellants\u2019 lien was the balance of the purchase money of the lands sold by the respondents to one Irving which amounted to $2,280 or that sum plus $3,400 which they had actually advanced to Irving under the agreement with him for the building of four houses upon the lands sold to him, in all $5,680.\nThe facts are not in controversy. The respondents, the York Farmers Colonization Company, Limited, are a land company. They sold to one Irving four lots on Edmund Avenue, Toronto, for $2,400, he paying a cash deposit of $120 and undertaking to erect four houses according to plans furnished by the vendors, the company to advance money for building purposes, and, when the houses were completed, deeds to be given to the purchaser on payment of the balance of the purchase price and re\u2011payment of the advances with interest.\nThe property is under the \u201cLand Titles Act\u201d and the agreement was not registered.\nIrving proceeded to build the houses by a contractor, Campbell, and these appellants supplied labour and materials therefor. The appellants registered mechanics\u2019 liens against the property under the \u201cMechanics Lien Act\u201d and it is undisputed that they are now entitled to liens as against Irving\u2019s interest, if any, in the property for the amount.\nIrving became insolvent and the company exercised their right under their contract with him to serve notice of forfeiture. After the notice of forfeiture they took possession of the property and claim now to hold the houses free from any liability to the appellants under the \u201cMechanics Lien Act.\u201d\nThe houses if completed would have been worth about $2,400 each, that is to say $9,600, independently of the land. The respondent company advanced $3,400 to Irving under the agreement to build them. Two of the houses were about finished, a third was roofed in and the walls of the fourth up to the joists, leaving about $3,000 or more still to be expended to complete all four.\nThe agreement after witnessing that the vendors agreed to sell and the vendee to buy from them lots as described for $2,400 went on specially to provide for the building on each lot by the vendee of a solid brick house to be used for private residences only, and that the vendors should lend him $6,400 for the construction of the four houses in instalments as the work progressed, which was to be applied only to the construction of such houses and that the houses should be built according to plans and specifications dated and signed by the vendors.\nMany very special stipulations were inserted for the protection of the vendors\u2019 interests and to secure that\nthe houses should not be used for any purpose that might deteriorate the adjoining property\nwhich I therefore assume was the vendors.\u2019 Time was declared to be of the essence of the contract and discontinuance of the work at any time for two weeks gave the vendors the right to take possession, made the agreement \u201cnull and void\u201d and forfeited to the vendor all moneys paid and improvements made thereunder.\nI think it necessary to state these facts because in construing this \u201cMechanics Lien Act\u201d and the rights of the different parties thereunder, it seems clear that \u201ceach case must be governed by its own facts.\u201d A few general principles have been laid down in the decided cases and accepted as the law, such as that\nmere knowledge of or consent to the work is not either a \u201crequest\u201d or \u201cprivity and consent\u201d within the meaning of the interpretation clause\nand in the case of Orr v. Robertson[21], at page 148, Riddell J., in delivering the opinion of the Appeal Court, said:\u2014\nWhile, to render the interest of an owner liable, the building, etc., must have been at his request, express or implied, there is no need that this request be made or expressed to the contractor\u2014if the owner request another to build etc., and that other proceeds to build, by himself or by an independent contractor or in whatever manner, the building being in pursuance of the request, the statute is satisfied. The taking of a contract from Hyland to build is a request within the meaning of the statute.\nI think this statement of the law as to the construction of the statute a correct one.\nDealing with the main question then as to whether the respondents are under the facts proved \u201cowners\u201d of the land and buildings within the interpretation clause (c) I am not able to agree with the conclusions reached by the court of appeal that the respondents were not \u201cowners\u201d within that clause. That clause (c) reads as follows:\u2014\n(c) \u201cOwner\u201d shall extend to any person, body corporate or politic, including a municipal corporation and a railway company, having any estate or interest in the land upon or in respect of which the work or service is done, or materials are placed or furnished, at whose request and\n(i) upon whose credit or\n(ii) on whose behalf or\n(iii) with whose privity and consent or\n(iv) for whose direct benefit\nwork or service is performed or materials are placed or furnished, and all persons claiming under him or them whose rights are acquired after the work or service in respect of which the lien is claimed is commenced or the materials furnished have been commenced to be furnished.\nIn the case before us it is not disputed that the respondents had an interest in the land. The dispute is whether there was a \u201crequest\u201d and a \u201cprivity and consent\u201d on the part of the respondents with respect to the work done on the buildings and the materials supplied for them for which the lien is sought.\nI do not think, as I have said, a direct request is necessary from the owner to the workman or the materialman. Such a request must be one to be reasonably implied under the facts of each case: Orr v. Robertson[22], above cited, so decided and I agree with that construction of the statute. If that was not so the main purpose and object of the Act, namely the protection of these workmen or materialmen would be easily defeated. All that would be required would be the interposition of a third party between the real owner and the workman or materialman supplying the labour or the materials.\nIn the case now before us, therefore, I do not entertain any doubt on the facts as proved\u2014alike on authority and on the construction of the Act apart from authority\u2014that the work and materials for which a lien is sought to be established was done and materials supplied at the respondents\u2019 request. If that is so, I cannot find any difficulty in concluding also that they were done and supplied with the privity and consent of the respondents.\nThis is not a case of mere knowledge or mere consent on the part of the respondent company. The agreement they made with Irving to whom they sold the lot specially provided for the building of these four solid brick houses in accordance with the plans the company had prepared and which they required him to sign. It also provided for the advance to Irving of a substantial portion of the cost of the buildings and made very special provisions for the forfeiture, under certain circumstances of delay and otherwise, of all moneys paid by Irving to them and of all improvements made by Irving upon the lands. Under these forfeiture provisions the company acted and the referee finds that Irving\u2019s interest was determined and is gone and that the ownership of the land and buildings now belongs to the company. These facts shew that the action of the company was not that of mere knowledge or mere consent to the work being done which the courts have held to be insufficient. The agreement with Irving to build the houses and to advance him a portion of the money necessary to do so was more than a mere request on their part that Irving should build. It bound him to build in accordance with plans and specifications provided by the vendors, respondents, and bound them to supply him with a substantial portion of the moneys necessary to enable him to carry out his contractual obligation\u2014being careful, of course, to secure themselves by stipulations providing for time being of the essence of the contract, and for delay creating forfeiture and making the agreement null and void.\nIf the facts as proved in this case and the agreement under which the houses were partly built do not constitute a \u201crequest\u201d under the statute, I am at a loss to know what facts would. It does seem to me, therefore, that not only was there a \u201crequest\u201d to build, but there was necessarily involved in the agreement to build, the actual building, and the advances made by the respondent of the moneys they contracted to supply from time to time as the work progressed, the \u201cprivity and consent\u201d also required by the section of the statute. It surely was not necessary that there should be direct contractual relations proved between the respondents and the lien claimants for the materials they supplied the contractor and the actual labour they performed. But the fair and reasonable inference from the proved facts is that there was alike such \u201cprivity\u201d and \u201cconsent\u201d of the respondents as satisfies the statute.\nHaving reached these conclusions, holding the respondents \u201cowners\u201d under para, (c) of the interpreta- tion clause of the Act, it is not necessary for me to deal with the other questions raised on the argument.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the official referee.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal. I agree with the conclusions of Meredith C.J. and the reasons assigned therefor.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Although the \u201cMechanics Lien Act\u201d (R.S.O. ch. 140) in sec. 14 (2) expressly declares that an unpaid vendor who has not conveyed shall\nfor the purposes of this Act be deemed a mortgagee,\nit seems reasonably clear that if he fulfils the requirements prescribed by the statutory definition of that term he may also be regarded as an \u201cowner\u201d I am not convinced, however, that the Appellate Division erred in holding that the respondent company was not an owner.\nAs an unpaid vendor the company was not an owner apart from the statutory definition. That definition sec. 2 (c) extends the meaning of \u201cowner\u201d to include a person\nhaving any estate or interest in the land * * * at whose request and * * * with whose privity and consent * * * (the) work or services are performed or (the) materials are placed or furnished,\nin respect of which the lien is claimed. Upon the authorities holding that the \u201crequest\u201d may be implied, of which it is necessary to refer only to Orr v. Robertson[23], the contractual provision by which the respondent company required its purchaser to erect buildings on the land according to approved plans and specifications and within a defined period may have amounted to a \u201crequest\u201d under the statute, although an opinion to the contrary was expressed at the conclusion of the judgment delivered in this case by Mr. Justice Riddell[24]. The learned judge\u2019s reasoning, however, rather points to an absence of the requisite \u201cprivity and consent.\u201d\nWhile it is difficult if not impossible to assign to each of the three words \u201crequest,\u201d \u201cprivity\u201d and \u201cconsent\u201d a meaning which will not to some extent overlap that of either of the others, after carefully reading all the authorities cited I accept as settled law the view enunciated in Graham v. Williams[25], and approved in Gearing v. Robinson[26], at page 371, that \u201cprivity and consent\u201d involves\nsomething in the nature of a direct dealing between the contractor and the persons whose interest is sought to be charged * * * Mere knowledge of, or mere consent to, the work being done is not sufficient.\nThere is no evidence here of any direct dealing by the respondent company with the purchaser\u2019s contractor such as is necessary to establish the \u201cprivity\u201d requisite to constitute the respondent company an \u201cowner\u201d within the definition of the \u201cMechanics Lien Act.\u201d\nFailing to establish the respondent\u2019s interest as \u201cowner,\u201d the appellants prefer a right to a lien under sec. 8 (3) of the Act upon \u201cincreased selling value.\u201d In making this claim they assert the position of the respondent company to be that of a mortgagee. In so doing they necessarily invoke the agreement for sale since it is as an unpaid vendor that the statute declares the respondent to be a mortgagee (sec. 14(2)). Invoking that agreement they must take it as a whole, including its provisions for advances to be made to the purchaser secured by the stipulation for re-payment before conveyance. The priority of this \u201ccharge\u201d on the land does not depend on registration but upon its existence as a charge before the lien arose: Cook v. Belshaw[27]. Under sec. 14 (1) the mortgage or charge is to be regarded as a \u201cprior mortgage\u201d only in respect of payments or advances made before notice in writing or registration of the lien. To the extent to which the selling value of the property has been increased by the work or services performed or the materials furnished by the plaintiffs the company\u2019s interest as such prior mortgagee is subject to the plaintiffs\u2019 lien (sec. 8 (3)): Patrick v. Walbourne[28], at pages 225-6.\nAt the trial before the official referee the plaintiffs expressly abandoned this right to a lien upon increased selling value. They were, nevertheless, as a matter of grace, offered in the Appellate Division an opportunity to apply for\na reference to permit of their claims being reviewed on the basis of the company being only prior mortgagees.\nThey failed to take advantage of the indulgence thus extended. In view of these facts they would have no ground for complaint if this branch of their appeal to this court were not entertained. But, taking all the circumstances of the case into account, I think the ends of justice will be best attained by allowing them, if so advised, even at this late date, to take a reference in the terms which I have quoted from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.\nThe respondent is of course entitled to its costs of this appeal and these costs as well as the costs awarded them in the Appellate Division may be set off against any amounts for which the appellants may establish liens on the reference, should they take it.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal has reference to the application and construction of the \u201cMechanics and Wage-Earners Lien Act of Ontario\u201d (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 140).\nThe appellants have established their claims and we have now to decide whether or not those claims affect the interests of the respondent company. According to sec. 8, sub-sec. 1, the lien shall attach upon the estate or interest of the \u201cowner\u201d in the property. We have then to find out whether the company should be considered an \u201cowner.\u201d\nThe respondent company was the proprietor of the lands in question in this case and, on the 17th of July, 1914, it entered into an agreement with a man by the name of Irving by which the company agreed to sell and Irving agreed to buy the said lands for a sum of two thousand four hundred dollars ($2,400).\nThe agreement recited that Irving desired to build four houses on the lands and required to borrow money for that purpose, and the company agreed to lend him a sum of $6,400 which was to be advanced for the construction of the houses during the progress of the building operations. The agreement provided that the houses should be built according to certain plans and specifications.\nIt was agreed also that the work would begin on the 20th of July, 1914, and be completed in the month of November of the same year, and it was further stipulated that the company should pass a deed of the property within one month after the houses would be completed if Irving re-paid the company all the moneys advanced and the purchase price. It was also agreed that time would be of the essence of the contract and that if the work should, at any time, be discontinued for two weeks the company would have the right to take possession of the property and the agreement of sale would become null and void.\nThe agreements of sale are contemplated by the \u201cMechanics and Wage-Earners Lien Act,\u201d sec. 14, sub-sec. 2, which declares that\nWhere there is an agreement for the purchase of land, and the purchase money or part thereof is unpaid, and no conveyance has been made to the purchaser, he shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed a mortgagor and the seller a mortgagee.\nThis is not, however, all the law on the matter; and, as was stated by the learned Chief Justice in the court below,\nthat, however, does not prevent mortgagees from being more than mortgagees, they are \u201cowners\u201d if they come within the definition of that word contained in the interpretation clause of the Act.\nThe definition is contained in sec. 2, sub-sec. (c), which declares that:\u2014\n\u201cOwner\u201d shall extend to any person, body corporate or politic, including a municipal corporation and a railway company, having any estate or interest in the land upon or in respect of which the work or service is done, or materials are placed or furnished, at whose request and\n(i) upon whose credit or\n(ii) on whose behalf or\n(iii) with whose privity and consent or\n(iv) for whose direct benefit\nwork or service is performed or materials are placed or furnished, and all persons claiming under him or them whose rights are acquired after the work or service in respect of which the lien is claimed is commenced or the materials furnished have been commenced to be furnished.\nThe question then to be determined is whether the building has been built at the request of the respondent company and with its privity and consent.\nThe company appears to be the proprietor of a large number of vacant lots in the vicinity of Toronto and the form of agreement entered into in this case between the defendant company and Irving is one which has been in use by the company and its predecessors for many years. Instead of having those vacant lots built on by the company itself they make arrangements with some contractors, as they have done in this case, because Irving is a contractor and is so called in the deed, by which those contractors obligate themselves to build and if they fail to carry out their contract during a certain period of time then the buildings become the absolute property of the company. If, on the other hand, the contractor carries out his contract, builds the houses and reimburses the money which had been advanced by the company for their construction, and if he pays the price agreed upon for the sale of the land itself, then the contractor is entitled to a conveyance.\nThose contracts of the respondent company had to be considered by the court in the unreported case of Toronto Junction Co. v. Armstrong and Cook. The learned referee tells us in his judgment that the case was tried before the late master in chambers and it is contended that the interest of the company was declared to be charged with the lien; but unfortunately this case is not reported, and it is contended, on the other side, that the judgment which has been rendered has not that effect.\nIt was decided in the case of Orr v. Robertson[29] that a contract similar in many respects to this one should be construed as constituting on the part of the respondent a request. If the company had simply agreed with Irving that it would advance to the latter the necessary money for erecting the buildings, then the relations would be those of mortgagor and mortgagee. But when Irving obligates himself towards the company to erect those buildings, then I would consider that the obligation contracted by Irving is such that he should be considered as having been requested by the company to erect the buildings and that the latter erected them with its privity and consent.\nThis case is distinguished from the case of Graham v. Williams[30], much relied upon by the respondents; because in that case the builder or the intended purchaser never obligated himself to build, it was purely and simply a case of the owner permitting his lessee to erect some buildings and to advance him some money. There was no formal obligation on the part of the contractor to build and the proprietor could not force the intended purchaser to build. It is a very different case from this one, where the contractor has bound himself to build. The company was entitled to retain the building if the contractor had not finished it within a certain time.\nThe case of Garing v. Hunt[31], has also been cited on behalf of the respondents.\nThat case is also, in some respects, based upon a contract very similar to the contract which we have to examine in the present case, but the relations between the parties were those of lessor and lessee, and Falconbridge, J. who rendered the judgment, relied on the fact that a formal consent in writing had not been given, as provided by sec. 5, sub-section 2, of the Act which declared that in cases where\nthe estate or interest charged by the lien is leasehold, the fee simple may also with the consent of the owner thereof be subject to such charge, provided such consent is testified by the signature of such owner upon the claim of lien at the time of the registering thereof and duly verified. That section cannot be invoked in the present case. Irving was not the lessee of the York Farmers Company but an intending purchaser.\nThere is also the case of Gearing v. Robertson[32], which is invoked by the respondents, where the parties were lessors and lessees; and Mr. Shepley, who argued the case for the lessors, claimed also that there was no liability because under section 2 of sub-section 7 there was no consent in writing.\nIn the case of Gearing v. Robertson32, the lease also contained a clause that the lessee was allowed to make some changes in the intended structure of the building, but the lessee never bound himself, as in the present case, to make those improvements. It was simply stated that if the improvements were made the lessee would have the right to be reimbursed at the expiration of the lease.\nThe request certainly did not exist in that case.\nThe contract that we have to deal with in this case is a very different one from those which had to be construed in the last three cases relied upon by the respondent and then those cases have to be distinguished from the present case.\nIt may be urged that the terms of this contract do not contain any clause by which a formal request has been made by the proprietor to build houses on his property for the contract declared that the intended purchaser desires to build and much stress is laid upon the word \u201cdesires.\u201d\nBut the contract has to be construed by all its clauses and if the contract is made in such a way as to defeat the \u201cMechanics\u2019 Lien Act,\u201d I should say that such an agreement should be held against public order (sec. 6).\nI have come to the conclusion that the respondent company should be considered an \u201cowner\u201d under the provisions of the \u201cMechanics\u2019 Lien Act,\u201d and that its interest should be charged with the lien claimed by the appellant.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C.

VII., c. 74 (Man.).\nBy the \"Railway Taxation Act,\" ch. 57, sec. 18, 63 & 64 Vict. (Man.), it was provided that every railway company subject to the Act should be free and exempt from all taxation of every nature and kind within the province except that imposed under its provisions. By ch. 58 of the same session of the legislature, ch. 57 was amended by adding section 22 thereto which provided that nothing therein should deprive any city corporation of any power it had to levy taxes on the real property of a railway company fronting on any street for local improvements. The two Acts were assented to and came into force on the same day. In 1901 an agreement, confirmed by statute, was entered into between the Manitoba Government and the Canadian Northern Ry. Co. by which the Government agreed to guarantee the company's bonds, the company to pay a percentage of its gross earnings to the Government and to be exempt from taxation provided for by section 18 of ch. 57. The \"Railway Taxation Act\" of 1900 became ch. 166 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1902, secs. 18 and 19 being identical with sec. 18 of ch. 57 and sec. 22 of ch. 58 respectively. In 1910 the Act 10 Edw. VII., ch. 74 was passed. Sec. 1 provided \"sec. 18 of ch. 166 R.S.M., 1902, being 'The Railway Taxation Act' is hereby further amended by adding, etc.;\" sec. 2 \"for the removal of doubt respecting the exemption from taxation granted under clause 16 of the agreement\" (of 1901 above mentioned) \"it is declared that the exemption so granted was and is the exemption specified in section 18 of the said 'Railway Taxation Act' existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act and is unaffected by any amending Act or Acts passed concurrently therewith or subsequently thereto.\" Under the foregoing legislation the City of Winnipeg assessed frontage lots of the Canadian Northern Ry. Co. for local improvements.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C. J. that though it is reasonably clear that the reference to sec. 18 in the Act of 1910 was intended for sec. 18 of ch. 57 passed in 1900 yet the language used will not admit of a doubt that ch. 166, R.S.M. 1902, sec. 18 is really referred to and under that Act the company is not exempt from taxation for local improvements. Duff and Anglin JJ. contra.\nPer Davies and Idington JJ.\u2014Sec. 18 of ch. 57 and sec. 22 of ch. 58 must be read together and as if the latter had been made a part of ch. 57; so construing them the exemption of the company from taxation does not cover taxes for local improvements the right to impose which is preserved by sec. 22.\nPer Duff J., dissenting.\u2014The \"Railway Taxation Act\" R.S.M. 1902, ch. 166, referred to in the Act of 1910, was passed in 1900 (ch. 57), and not repealed and re-enacted in 1902. Ch. 58 of the Act of 1900 was an amendment passed concurrently with or subsequently to ch. 57 and does not affect the exemption given by the agreement of. 1901; and, therefore, by the express terms of the Act of 1910, the principle of Salmon v. Duncombe (11 App. Cas. 627), applied.\nPer Anglin J., dissenting.\u2014The reference in sec. 2 of the Act of 1910 to sec. 18 of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" meant sec. 18 of the original Act of 1900, ch. 57, and the exemption given by the agreement was not affected by the provisions of ch. 58 amending same.\nIn 1910 a special survey, under the \"Special Survey Act,\" was made of certain lots, including those in question, belonging to the railway company and each lot was charged with a proportionate share of the cost of the survey.\nHeld, Duff J., dissenting, that the charge so made was taxation and not being a tax for a local improvement the company was exempt from payment.\nJudgment appealed from (26 Man. R. 292), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing in part the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe appellant company was assessed by the City of Winnipeg for local improvements in respect to frontage lots and, having failed to pay, the lots were sold for such taxes. In order to prevent the issue of a certificate of title the company then paid the taxes under protest and brought an action to recover back the amount and another sum charged on the lots as its proportion of the cost of a special survey. The trial Judge, who heard the cause on a case stated by the parties, held that all the taxes were illegally levied and gave judgment for the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal reversed his judgment as to the local improvement taxes and affirmed it in respect to the special survey rates. The legislation on which these judgments were based is set out in the headnote. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nTilley K.C. for the appellants and cross-respondent. A rate for local improvements is a tax within the exemption provided by the agreement of 1910: City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works Co.[2].\nThe charge on the land for the special survey is also taxation: Ecclesiastiques de St. Sulpice v. City of Mont-real[3], at page 403.\nT. A. Hunt K.C. for the respondent and cross-appellant. Chapters 57 and 58 of the Acts of 1900 must be read as one statute: Canada Southern Railway Co. v. International Bridge Co.[4], at page 727.\nPersonal statutes conferring special privileges are construed strictly against the beneficiaries: Sion College v. Mayor of London[5].\nOn the cross-appeal Nova Scotia Car Works v. City of Halifax[6]; Ponton v. City of Winnipeg[7], and McLellan v. Assiniboia[8], were cited.\nTilley K.C. for the appellants and cross-respondent.\nT. A. Hunt K.C. for the respondent and cross-appellant.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This case must be governed by the last statute, i.e., \"the Act to amend the 'Railway Taxation Act,'\" 10 Edw. VII., ch. 74. The first section of the Act declares that\nsection 18 of ch. 166 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1902, being the \"Railway Taxation Act\" is\namended as thereby provided. Section 2 declares that the exemption granted to the appellant by the agreement of 11th February, 1901, is\nthe exemption specified in section 18 of the said \"Railway Taxation Act\" as existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act and is unaffected by any amending Act or Acts passed concurrently therewith or subsequently thereto.\nAs stated by Richards, J.A.:\u2014\nIf we are as hitherto to read the section as referring to the Act of 1900 notwithstanding that ch. 166 of the Revised Statutes of 1902 is mentioned then the respondent is exempt. That this was what the Legislature intended need not be doubted but perhaps nothing but an amending statute can carry out the intention. It does not seem to be a question of construction of the Act, the words of which are not equivocal. The trouble is that the words of the Act are reasonably clear, only they do not carry out the intention of the Legislature.\nMr. Tilley admitted at the argument that the exemption granted is in terms not that of the Act of 1900 but that\nspecified in sec. 18 of the said \"Railway Taxation Act\"\n(i.e., ch. 166 of the Rev. S.M. 1902). This would have been the Act by virtue of the \"Interpretation of Statutes Act,\" R.S.M. 1902, ch. 89, sec. 8 (b), even if ch. 166 had not been mentioned. But he said it is reasonably clear that the Act of 1900 was meant which may be conceded. It is argued that if the Revised Statutes had been intended the addition of the words\nas existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act\nwould have been superfluous and meaningless and that the only conceivable purpose of their insertion was to make clear the application of section 7 of the \"Act Respecting the Revised Statutes.\" This apparently concedes that without the addition of these words, section 7 of the \"Act Respecting the Revised Statutes\" would not have had its application. May not the purpose of their insertion have been precisely to prevent the application which section 7 would have had if they had not been inserted. If the legislature had really intended section 18 of the Revised Statutes of 1902, could it have expressed more clearly an intention to prevent the operation of section 7 of the \"Act Respecting the Revised Statutes\" than by the addition of the words\nas existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act\n(i.e., the Revised Statutes of 1902).\nIt seems a forced construction in any case this calling in aid section 7 of the \"Act Respecting the Revised Statutes.\" What that Act says is that where the provisions of the repealed Act and the Revised Statutes are the same they shall be held to operate retrospectively as well as prospectively; this is a very simple provision and one that hardly seems capable of being invoked to prove that the repealed Act must be that referred to in section 2 of the Act of 1910.\nIt is reasonably clear what the legislature said and also what it intended; further that it did not say what it intended and that without disregarding the words of the statutes it is difficult to give effect to the intention. Although a statute is to be construed according to the intent of them that made it, if the language admits of no doubt or secondary meaning it is simply to be obeyed. As Lord Watson said in Salomon v. Salomon & Co.[9], at page 38:\u2014\nIn a court of law or equity what a legislature intended to be done or not to be done can only be legitimately ascertained from that which it has chosen to enact either in express words or by reasonable and necessary implication.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal involves the proper construction of several Acts of the Legislature of Manitoba relating to the taxation of railways in that province and specially with respect to the power of incorporated cities to collect frontage taxes for local improvements on railway lands.\nI agree with the judgment appealed from affirming that power and right and negativing the right claimed by the respondents in addition of levying on the railway lands and collecting what was called a special survey tax.\nThe reasoning of Chief Justice Howell, concurred in by Perdue, Cameron and Haggart JJ. A., commends itself to me as being sound and reasonable.\nIn the session of the legislature of 1900 there was passed a statute, ch. 57 of the statutes of that year, called the \"Railway Taxation Act,\" imposing upon railway companies owning or operating any line or lines of railway within the province a tax of 2% upon the gross earnings of such railway companies on its lines within the province in the years 1900, 1901 and 1902, and after that, a sum to be fixed by the Lieutenant- Governor in Council not to exceed 3% of such gross earnings. The 18th section of that statute declared railway companies coming within and paying taxes under its provisions to be\nfree and exempt from all assessments and taxation of every nature and kind within the Province of Manitoba by whomsoever made or imposed, except such as are made and imposed under the provisions of this Act.\nAt some period of the session it was found that the language of this exemption clause was too sweeping and went further than was intended and another statute, ch. 58, was passed concurrently with that containing the exempting clause enacting that\nthe \"Railway Act\" passed at the present session of the Legislative Assembly is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:\u2014\n22. Nothing herein contained shall take away from any incorporated city any right or power which any incorporated city may now have of assessing and levying on the real property of any railroad company fronting or abutting on any street or place, taxes for local improvement done, in, under or upon any such street or place according to the frontage of such real property so fronting or abutting on such street or place or relieve any railway or telegraph company owning or operating a telegraph line or lines in the province from the payment of the taxes imposed in that behalf under the provisions of the \"Corporations Taxation Act.\"\nThe two Acts constituting in reality one were assented to by the Lieutenant-Governor together and, in my judgment, should be read together; otherwise the plain, obvious intent and purpose of the legislature not to deprive cities of the right and power of levying taxes for local improvements on railway companies as well as on other owners of lands would be defeated. Read together they preserve this right and power unto these cities and unless subsequent legislation has taken them away they should be maintained.\nIn the following year, an agreement dated the 11th February, 1901, was entered into between the Manitoba Government and the appellant company guaranteeing the payment of certain railway bonds of the appellant by the Province of Manitoba in which the company covenanted up to the maturity of the bonds so to be guaranteed, to pay to the Government a sum not exceeding two per cent. of its gross earnings from its lines in Manitoba and in consideration of such payments it was agreed that\ntheir properties, incomes and franchises shall be exempt from such taxation as is provided for by section 18 of ch. 57 of the Statutes of Manitoba of 1900 during the currency of the said bonds hereby agreed to be guaranteed.\nNow, strictly speaking, no taxation was \"provided for\" in this section 18, but exemption from such taxation as they would be otherwise liable for. What was therefore the law at the end of the session of 1900 when the above two mentioned statutes were passed and on the 11th February, 1901, when this agreement was made?\nCan it be doubted that this section 18 of ch. 57 was to be read and construed as if the amending or declaratory contemporaneous Act with the section named as section 22 had actually formed one of its subsections?\nIn law, I think it did form one of its sub-sections and was to be read and construed as one and that when the agreement in question of the 11th February, 1901, was entered into declaring the appellant company exempt\nfrom such taxation as is provided for by section 18 of ch. 57 of the statutes of 1900,\nit meant section 18 as modified by section 22 and such exemption did not extend to or embrace local improvement taxes from which the legislature had already declared they were not exempt. These frontage taxes for local improvements which that 22nd section of same Act as amended in the same session explicitly declared railway companies should not be relieved from are those we are now asked to declare the company should be relieved from.\nIn the Revised Statutes for 1902, ch. 166, this legislation is re-enacted, section 22 being made section 19, following section 18 which remains numbered as before in the \"Railway Taxation Act.\"\nBut then it is said, assuming that to be so, subsequent legislation in 1910 sets the question definitely at rest as to the meaning of clause 16 of the agreement of February 11, 1901, and exempts the company from liability from local improvement taxes as well as general taxes. That legislation is embodied in 10 Edw. VII. (1910), ch. 74.\nIt makes no direct or specific reference to the local improvement taxes but enacts generally for the removal of doubt respecting the exemption from taxation granted under section 16 of the agreement of 1901 which agreement was validated and confirmed by statute that\nthe exemption so granted was and is the exemption specified in section 18 of the said \"Railway Taxation Act\" as existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act, and is unaffected by any amending Act or Acts passed concurrently therewith or subsequently thereto.\nNow at this time and ever since 1902 sec. 22 of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" had formed section 19 of ch. 166 of the Revised Statutes and if it was intended to repeal that section and exempt the railway from local improvement taxes it was not difficult to say so in a few words. It will be noticed that this legislation declares the exemption so granted was and is the exemption specified in section 18. I have already given my reasons for holding that this section 18 must be read together with section 22 to determine its true meaning and that latter section expressly declared that nothing in that railway Act contained should take away from any city the right to tax for local improvements or relieve any railway from the payment of such taxes.\nThe Act of 1910, which is relied upon as effecting such exemption, merely declares in general terms that the exemption granted by clause 16 of the agreement of 1901 confirmed by ch. 39 of the statutes of that year was and is the exemption specified in section 18 of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" as existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act. We are asked to say that the meaning of section 18 must be found within its own ambit and without reference to sub-section 22 which, in my opinion, formed part of it, though enacted in a separate chapter and withdrew local improvement taxes from its operation. I decline doing so because it would be bad construction.\nI have already given my reasons for holding that at the date of the passage of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" of 1900 the right of the cities to levy and assess railways for local improvements was retained to them and these special taxes were not amongst those from which the railways were exempted and I think the legislation of 1910, though no doubt intended by the promoters to effect that exemption, failed because of the vague and uncertain language used.\nIf the legislature intended to exempt the railways from these local improvement taxes in 1910 they could have expressly said so in a few words.\nIn 1900, when they desired to continue the liability of the railways for these taxes the intention was clearly expressed in section 22 of the Act. In 1902 when the statutes were revised that intention was expressly re-enacted.\nI do not think legislation so clear and explicit, mentioning local improvement taxes specifically, should be held to have been repealed by such vague and general words as the promoters of the Act of 1910 have used carefully avoiding the mention of those local improvement taxes.\nShortly re-stated my conclusion is that section 22 must be read into the \"Railway Taxation Act\" of 1900 as if it formed one of the sections of that Act and that its being enacted as a separate chapter of the same session's legislation makes no difference. That the meaning and intent of section 18 when read in conjunction with sub-section 22 clearly does not include local improvement taxes amongst those exempted. That the subsequent revision of the statutes in 1902 makes that still more clear and that it would require equally clear and plain language to be used to reverse that legislation and exempt railways from local improvement taxes and thus throw heavier burdens upon the other owners of lands liable for such taxes; that the language of the Act of 1910 is altogether too vague and uncertain to effect that object; and there therefore never was a time when the appellant company was exempt from local improvement taxes.\nWith respect to the special survey charges I agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal.\nI would therefore dismiss both appeal and cross-appeal with costs in each.\nIdington J.\u2014Inasmuch as the expression used in the agreement in question by way of incorporating therein section 18 referred to does not when read therewith produce anything quite clear and unambiguous, I am driven to try and make of it something that is apparently what the contracting parties meant.\nThe part of the agreement which adopts for its definition of an exemption from such taxation as provided by a section which is in itself largely an exempting section instead of one directly providing for taxation, seems calculated to present a set of puzzles.\nSurely whatever else was intended to be agreed to and thereby adopted, it must have been the substantial legal effect of section 18 as it stood amended at the date of the agreement.\nI conclude that is the fair interpretation and that the judgment of the court below should be maintained for that reason and the reasons assigned therefor by Chief Justice Howell.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI am unable to comprehend why a municipality should so persist in its wrong-doing and seek to escape from the consequence of its acts as respondent does in regard to the costs it put appellant to. As the payments were made under protest the conception covered by a voluntary payment cannot help it.\nThe survey tax was covered by the phrase \"by whomsoever imposed\" in section 18.\nThe cross-appeal should also be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014With respect I am unable to concur in the conclusion of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.\nThe point raised on the main appeal is, in my judgment, concluded by section 2 of ch. 74 of the statutes of 1910, which is in the following words:\u2014\nFor the removal of doubt respecting the exemption from taxation granted under clause 16 of the Agreement dated the eleventh day of February, 1901, set out in schedule \"A\" to chapter 36 of the statutes passed in the year 1901, it is declared that the exemption so granted was and is the exemption specified in section 18 of the said \"Railway Taxation Act\" as existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act, and is unaffected by any amending Act or Acts passed concurrently therewith or subsequently thereto.\nThe enactment must of course be read and construed in light of the circumstances with reference to which it was passed; and, to apply the principle on which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council proceeded in Salmon v. Buncombe[10], at p. 634, it must not be given a construction which makes it nugatory or insensible with reference to those circumstances unless such a construction is forced upon us by the \"absolute intractability\" of the language used. First, then, what is it that the legislature is dealing with in this section? It is dealing with clause 16 in a certain agreement dated the 11th February, 1901, confirmed and validated by ch. 39 of the statutes of that year and the enactment has specific reference to a certain provision in that clause 16 by which it is stipulated that the\nproperty, incomes and franchises of the company,\nthat is to say of the now appellant company,\nshall be exempt from such taxation as is provided for by section 18 of ch. 57.of the Statutes of Manitoba of 1900.\nIt has explicit reference to this stipulation and it was passed \"for the removal of doubt respecting\" the meaning and effect of the stipulation. What was the nature of the doubt that had arisen? In order to make that clear let us reproduce textually section 18 of ch. 57 of the statutes of 1900. That enactment is in the following words:\u2014\n18. Every railway company coming within and paying taxes under the provisions of this Act or any Act or Acts amending this Act, and the property of every nature and kind of every such railway company, except the land subsidy to which such company is or may be entitled from the Dominion Government, and any land held by it for sale, shall, during the continuance of this Act, or any Act or Acts amending this Act be free and exempt from all assessments and taxation of every nature and kind within the Province of Manitoba by whomsoever made or imposed, except such as are made and imposed under the provisions of this Act, or any Act or Acts amending this Act, and no person or body corporate or politic having power to make assessments or impose taxation of any kind shall during the continuance of this Act or any Act or Acts amending this Act make any assessment or impose any taxation of any kind of or upon any such railway company or any property of such railway company except the land subsidy to which such company is or may be entitled from the Dominion Government and any land held by it for sale as aforesaid.\nThe field in which the exemption hereby created is to operate, it will be observed, is limited by an exception, the exception being such assessment and taxation\nas are made and imposed under the provisions of this Act or any Act or Acts amending this Act;\nand it is upon the scope of this exception that the dispute had arisen. It was occasioned by these circumstances. In the very same year, the year 1900, the legislature passed an Act, ch. 58, amending ch. 57 (which was intituled \"Railway Taxation Act\") introducing an additional section, sec. 22, as part of that Act and by this last mentioned section introduced by this amending Act (ch. 58) it was declared that nothing contained in the Act (i.e., nothing contained in ch. 57 of the \"Railway Taxation Act\") should take away any right or power which an incorporated city \"may now have\" of assessing and levying on any property of a railway company taxes for local improvements. The argument against the railway company, and it certainly was not without force, was that this section introduced as section 22 by way of an amendment brought within the sweep of the exception from the exemption created by section 18, taxes for local improvements so assessed and levied; this consequence resulting, it was argued, from the fact that the exception embraces taxation imposed under the\nprovisions of this Act or any Act or Acts amending this Act,\ntaxation imposed under section 22 being taxation imposed under an \"Act amending this Act;\" and that consequently the exemption from taxation stipulated for by clause 16 of the agreement of February, 1911, which was to be an exemption from such taxation\nas is provided for by sec. 18 of ch. 57 of the statutes of Manitoba of 1910\nmust be held to be subject to an exception embracing taxation for local improvements under section 22. This then was the point in dispute. Did the stipulation which was entered into in February, 1910, defining the exemption to which the company should be entitled, exclude from the scope of that exemption the sort of taxation authorized by section 22 introduced by the amending Act, (ch. 58, statutes of 1900) or did it confer an exemption, the scope of which was to be determined by an examination of section 18 alone without regard to the amending statute?\nThat being the point in dispute and the Act of 1910 being passed for the sole purpose of settling the controversy, how does the enactment of 1910 deal with the subject? The declaration of section 2 seems, when the circumstances just mentioned are considered, to be too explicit for misapprehension. The exemption intended to be created is to be the exemption specified in section 18 of the \"Railway Taxation Act,\" that is to say, of ch. 57 of the statutes of 1900, and it is further declared that the exemption is\nunaffected by any amending Act or Acts passed concurrently therewith or subsequently thereto.\nComment would appear to be superfluous. The dispute being whether or not for the purpose of ascertaining the scope and character of the exemption, section 18 of ch. 57 of 1900 and section 22 introduced by ch. 58 of 1900 are to be read together or section 18 is to be read alone and ch. 58 disregarded\u2014such being the nature of the controversy\u2014can there be any doubt about the effect of this language of section 2 of the Act of 1910? Ch. 58 beyond question is an Act \"amending this Act\" (ch. 57) passed concurrently with or subsequently to it. Ch. 58 is therefore to be excluded from our purview when considering the effect of section 18.\nIt is argued on behalf of the respondent that \"Railway Taxation Act\" must be taken to have been the \"Railway Taxation Act\" of Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1902, which, it is said, was passed in 1902. The answer to that is that the \"Railway Taxation Act,\" ch. 166, R.S.M. 1902, was in truth passed in the year 1900, and was not repealed and re-enacted in 1902, as sufficiently appears from section 1, sub-secs. 1, 6, 7, 8, of the statutes of 1902, ch. 41, the \"Act Relating to the Revised Statutes.\" But there is the additional reason that the construction proposed derives the intention of the Act of 1901 and the agreement confirmed by it from the provisions of a statute passed a year later; and the still further reason that it deprives the governing words of section 2, those relating to amendments, of all effect, and instead of removing doubts leaves the dispute exactly where it was; in other words it makes the statute nugatory as regards its declared object, the \"removal of doubt.\"\nA much more difficult question arises on the cross-appeal. It is difficult to believe that the legislature had in contemplation such charges as those provided for by ch. 182 R.S.M., 1913. On the other hand much may be said for the view that these charges are within the same category for the purposes of deciding this question as charges for local improvements. The point is a disputable one, but on the whole my conclusion is this: The amount chargeable (if not the question whether any amount at all shall be charged) against a specific property included in the survey is an amount not fixed by the reference to any rule prescribed by law but rests in the discretion of a public officer; and I think the charge falls rather within the class of imposts which would include the costs of works required by a Board of Railway or Municipal Commissioners assessed against a municipality or a railway company, which class of imposts would not according to the common notions of Canadian mankind come under the description \"taxes;\" and I think common usage should be a guide in construing such agreements as that before us.\nSuch expressions as that quoted from Strong J. (St Sulpice v. City of Montreal[11], by the Chief Justice of Manitoba\u2014\nevery contribution to a public purpose imposed by superior authority is a \"tax\" and nothing less\n\u2014must not, I think be taken too absolutely; they are not intended as definitions but as descriptions emphasizing the characteristic brought into relief by the controversy in relation to which they are employed.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014By an agreement made in 1901 with the Government of Manitoba, confirmed by statute, the Canadian Northern Railway Company was granted an exemption during the currency of certain bonds from the taxation dealt with by section 18 of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" of 1900, ch. 57. That section exempted railway companies and all their property, except the Dominion Government land subsidy and land held for sale, from \"all assessments and taxation of every nature and kind\" except such as are made and imposed under the provisions of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" itself or any amending Acts. By an Act also passed during the session of 1900, but as a separate statute (ch. 58), there was added to the \"Railway Taxation Act,\" as section 22, a declaratory clause providing that nothing therein contained should take away from any incorporated city the right to assess and levy taxes for improvements on real property of any railway company fronting or abutting on any street or place in, under or upon which such improvements should be done. In 1902 there was a revision of the statutes of Manitoba. In the \"Railway Taxation Act\" in that revision (ch. 166) section 18 is reproduced as it was in the Act of 1900 and the amending declaratory provision above referred to appears as section 19. A statute was passed in 1910, as ch. 74, in the following terms:\u2014\n1. Section 18 of ch. 166 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1902, being the \"Railway Taxation Act,\" is hereby further amended by adding at the end thereof the following words, \"and except all lands and property held by the company not in actual use in the operation of the railway.\"\n2. For the removal of doubt respecting the exemption from taxation granted under clause 16 of the Agreement dated the eleventh day of February, 1901, set out in schedule \"A\" to ch. 59 of the statutes passed in the year 1901, it is declared that the exemption so granted was and is the exemption specified in section 18 of the said \"Railway Taxation Act\" as existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act, and is unaffected by any amending Act or Acts passed concurrently therewith or subsequently thereto.\nNotwithstanding the reference to ch. 166 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1902; in sec. 1 of this enactment, it seems to me reasonably clear that by section 18 of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" mentioned in section 2 was meant section 18 of the original Act of 1900, and that by the words\nunaffected by any amending Act or Acts passed concurrently therewith or subsequently thereto,\nit was intended to exclude the amendment of 1900 which afterwards became sec. 19 of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" of 1902. By sec. 7 of the Act respecting the Revised Statutes (3 Edw. VII., ch. 41), to which Mr. Tilley directed our attention, it is enacted that the provisions of the Revised Statutes of 1902 corresponding to and substituted for provisions of repealed Acts, where they are the same as those of the Act so repealed, shall be held to have been passed on the days respectively upon which the Acts so repealed came into effect. By\nthe date of the passage of such last mentioned Act\n(i.e., the \"Railway Taxation Act\") in section 2 of ch. 74 of the statutes of 1910 above quoted, is therefore meant not the date of the coming into effect of the Revised Statutes of 1902 but that at which ch. 57 of the statutes of 1900 (the repealed Act) came into force; and\nthe exemption specified in section 18\nas contained in that Act, \"unaffected by the amendment passed concurrently,\" and found in ch. 58, is the exemption to which section 2 of the Act of 1910 declares the appellant company entitled. Of course this might readily have been made clearer and this litigation avoided had the Act of 1910, passed \"for the removal of doubt\"(!) referred directly to \"the exemption specified in section 18 of ch. 57, 63 & 64 Vict., unaffected by section 1 of ch. 58, 63 & 64 Vict., instead of to that\nspecified in section 18 of the said \"Railway Taxation Act\" (i.e., ch. 166 of the R.S.M., 1902). But if it had been intended to declare the right of exemption to be that provided by section 18 of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" as found in the Revised Statutes (i.e., subject to the declaratory provision of sec. 19) the addition of the words\nas existing at the date of the passage of such last mentioned Act\nwould have been superfluous. The only conceivable purpose of their insertion in sec. 2 of the Act of 1910 was to make clear the application to it of section 7 of the \"Act Respecting the Revised Statutes.\" Moreover, as applied to the Revised Statutes of 1902, the words\nunaffected by any amending Act * * passed concurrently there with\nwould have no point. There was no amendment to the \"Railway Taxation Act\" in 1902 or 1903. They were obviously and aptly used in reference to the legislation of 1900, ch. 58. Notwithstanding the unhappy phraseology of section 2 of the Act of 1910, on a careful consideration of all this legislation it appears to me to express with sufficient certainty the intention of the legislature to exempt the Canadian Northern Railway from \u2014 to use the language of section 18\u2014\nall assessments and taxation of every nature and kind,\nexcept taxation made and imposed under provisions of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" and amending Acts.\nCounsel for the respondents sought to bring local improvement rates within this exception by treating the declaratory clause, added by amendment as section 22, as an amending Act by which assessments and taxation were made and imposed. I am unable to accept that view of the scope and effect of section 22. Its provisions are negative. They do not provide for the making or imposition of any tax but merely declare that other provisions of the \"Railway Taxation Act\" shall not take away a right or power to assess and levy taxes for local improvement rates conferred by other legislation. It is by, or by virtue of such other legislation that local improvement taxation is imposed. I would therefore allow the appeal of the Canadian Northern Railway Company.\nAs to the cross-appeal, I am of the opinion that the cost of surveys authorized by the legislature to be assessed upon the property affected is assessment or taxation within the meaning of the exemption provided for by section 18 of the \"Railway Taxation Act,\" provincial and not municipal taxation it may be, but nevertheless taxation: City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works, Ltd.[12] , at page 998\u2014\"a demand of sovereignty,\" State Freight Tax Case[13], at page 278. As to the percentage added to the taxes and the cost of making title which the appellants were obliged to pay in order to redeem their property and prevent the issue of a certificate of title to it to the tax sale purchaser, cancellation of which they might have been unable afterwards to procure, I see no reason why these should not be refunded to them as well as the taxes themselves to which they were incidental. In view of the terms in which the special case has been submitted the plaintiffs are, in my opinion, entitled to a judgment against the defendant municipal corporation for the refund by it of the whole amount paid to it to prevent certificates of title for the lands wrongfully sold being issued, with interest thereon from the date of such payment. They should also have their costs of this litigation throughout.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clark & Jackson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Theodore A.

The defendant started proceedings for arbitration under section 20 of \"The Patent Act\" and the plaintiffs took action in the Exchequer Court.\nTo the said action defendant pleaded, inter alia, want of jurisdiction which plea was overruled and judgment was given on the merits for the plaintiffs. Defendant appealed and plaintiffs moved to quash on the grounds that the exercise of the power conferred on the Court below by section 23(a) was only in substitution of that given to arbitrators by \"The Patent Act,\" and the judgment of the court was final and not susceptible of appeal just as that of the arbitrators would be; that the appeal to the Supreme Court allowed by \"The Exchequer Court Act\" lies only in cases where a sum of money is demanded; and that it was not shewn that the sum of $500 was in controversy and no leave to appeal had been obtained. As to the last ground the court held that affidavits filed established the value of the patent in dispute at more than $500.\nR. C. H. Cassels for the motion.\nMcMaster K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014Two grounds are presented by Mr. Cassels in support of his motion to quash the above appeal for want of jurisdiction. The first one, as I understand it, is that this court has no jurisdiction because the Exchequer Court has exclusive jurisdiction without appeal. Section 20 of \"The Patents Act,\" ch. 69 R.S.C., 1906, in cases of conflicting applications for patents provides that the matter in dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and no provision is made for an appeal. This section of the Act comes from the R.S.C. 1886, ch. 61, sec. 19 The present \"Exchequer Court Act\" came into force in 1887 (50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16) and by a later amendment in 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 26, jurisdiction is conferred on the court in all cases of conflicting applications for any patent of invention.\nThe contention of Mr. Cassels is that the Exchequer Court has at most concurrent jurisdiction but without appeal as in the case of an application made under section 20, \"Patent Act.\" He then urges that the court is curia designata.\nSection 82 of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" R.S.C. ch. 140, provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court by any party dissatisfied with any final judgment of the Exchequer Court where the amount in controversy exceeds $500. In other words, this provides for a review by the Supreme Court of all decisions of the Exchequer Court whatever-may be the grounds of such decisions and I see no distinction between the case where the Exchequer Court assumes jurisdiction where it has none, and the case where the Exchequer Court has erred in its appreciation of any matter of law or fact.\nThe point has come up before this court where the court below has denied its own jurisdiction and a party dissatisfied with such judgment has appealed to the Supreme Court to reverse this view of the court below and to declare that such lower court had jurisdiction. In the case of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde v. Gougeon[1], an appeal had been taken from the Superior Court to the Court of Queen's Bench, and the plaintiff moved to have this appeal quashed for want of jurisdiction, and his motion was granted. The municipality then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada whereupon plaintiff moved in this court to have the appeal quashed on the ground that there was no judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and therefore no appeal lay to the Supreme Court. Sir Henry Strong, who gave the judgment of the Supreme Court, there says that as the Court of Queen's Bench properly refused to entertain jurisdiction, it followed that no appeal would lie to the Supreme Court. It is clear therefore that this court quashed the appeal because it was of the opinion that the Court of Queen's Bench was correct in holding that it had no jurisdiction and therefore the merits of the appeal could not be considered by the Supreme Court.\nIn the case of Beck v. Valin[2], there was an appeal to this court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of the Divisional Court which sustained the refusal of a judge in chambers to issue a writ of mandamus. In that case Mr. Justice Idington says:\u2014\nThe right to assert an appeal against a court asserting jurisdiction where it has none, is a very common case and I have not the slightest doubt of the right to appeal on the converse ground of failure to assert jurisdiction.\nIn Hull Electric Co. v. Clement[3], a motion was made to affirm the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to entertain an appeal from the judgment of the King's Bench, which quashed an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court on the ground that the appeal was incompetent and that it (Court of King's Bench) had no jurisdiction to hear such an appeal. The motion therefore to the Supreme Court raised the question whether this court could review a judgment of the Court of King's Bench where the latter court had held it had no jurisdiction. The court in that case disposed of the appeal by reviewing the propriety of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in holding it was without jurisdiction. The Chief Justice, concluding his judgment said there:\u2014\nI would follow City of Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde v. Gougeon[4], et al where it was held that the Court of Queen's Bench having properly declined to exercise jurisdiction, no appeal lies to this court. In short, my view is that under the general power of appeal given from a lower court to the Supreme Court, if the court below has quashed an appeal to itself on the ground that is has no jurisdiction and the party dissatisfied with this judgment appeals to the Supreme Court, this court, on a motion to quash, may affirm the judgment below by granting the order. If the court below holds it has jurisdiction and proceeds to dispose of the case on its merits, this court has jurisdiction to review on appeal the decision below and if it is of opinion that the court below was without jurisdiction, it can so determine without considering anything with respect to the merits of the case.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that there is an appeal from a judgment rendered in a patent case where the court exercises the jurisdiction conferred by section 23. The appeal is given by section 82\nto any party to any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding.\nThese words are broad enough to cover a case of conflicting applications for a patent of invention like this.\nThe other ground presented by Mr. Cassels is that the amount involved was not shewn to be over $500.00.\nThe practice is well settled that in patent cases the value of the patent can be established by affidavit and where the appellant neglects to have this shewn in chambers, he may be penalized by way of costs. This was done in the case of Dreschel v. Auer Light Co.,[5].\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the motion to quash should be refused, but without costs.\nDavies J.\u2014Two objections were raised on this motion to our jurisdiction to hear this appeal from the Exchequer Court and, in my opinion, they must both fail.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court proceeds on the ground that jurisdiction to hear and determine the action was vested in that court. Whether such jurisdiction exists or not can more properly be decided when the merits of the appeal come to be considered. Certainly an appeal lies to this court from any judgment of the Exchequer Court otherwise appealable under the statute which court has either improperly assumed jurisdiction or, improperly, expressly decided that such jurisdiction exists.\nOn the second point, I am of opinion that section 82 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" gives a right of appeal to this court in cases such as the present. The words of the section \"sum or value\" clearly indicate that an appeal lies as well from a. judgment in an action brought to recover a sum of money as from one brought to establish a claim to property or rights. In the latter cases the \"value\" of such property or rights claimed and in controversy may be established by affidavits and need not necessarily appear in the record.\nI would dismiss the motion with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I think the motion to quash the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This is a motion to quash an appeal from a judgment delivered by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court dismissing an action brought by one of two applicants for a patent. Steps had been taken by one of the applicants to have the controversy determined by resort to the procedure provided by section 20 of the \"Patent Act,\" when an action was brought by the other applicant in the Exchequer Court under section 23a of the \"Exchequer Court Act. Among other pleas the defendants (the appellants) denied the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to deal with a controversy in respect of which the procedure prescribed by section 20 of the \"Patent Act\" is available. The application to the learned judge of the Exchequer Court to dismiss the action as brought without jurisdiction was at the suggestion of the learned judge turned into an application for a stay of proceedings and this application was eventually dismissed. At the trial judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe first objection which is now raised is that the jurisdiction of the \"Exchequer Court\" in cases of conflicting applications for patents is an exclusive jurisdiction; this is to say, that a judgment of the Exchequer Court given in exercise of this jurisdiction is not appealable.\nI do not find it necessary for the purposes of the present motion to consider whether or not in respect of some matters the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court in an action such as that out of which this appeal arises is final in the sense of being non-appealable; that is a question which may be much more conveniently dealt with when the appeal comes on for hearing on the merits. It is sufficient to say in regard to the matter I am now considering that the appellants having denied the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to entertain the action and the learned judge of the Exchequer Court having by entertaining the action and giving judgment affirmed judicially that such jurisdiction exists, his decision as a decision on the point of jurisdiction or no jurisdiction is appealable to this court provided the other conditions of appealability indicated by secs. 82 and 83 are present. In re Padstow Total Loss and Collision Assur Assoc.[6]; Cornwall v. Ottawa and New York Railway Co.[7].\nThe next objection is that the condition laid down in sec. 82 in the words \"action, * * * matter or other judicial proceeding in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds $500 is not fulfilled because, first, the action raises no question with regard to any pecuniary demand by either plaintiff or defendant, and, secondly, it is not satisfactorily shewn that the value of the thing in controversy, the right to receive a patent, reaches the sum of $500.\nAs to the second of these grounds, it is unnecessary to say more than that the affidavits filed taken together with the agreement which is in evidence in the cause are sufficient to dispose of it.\nAs to the first ground the words \"amount in controversy exceeds $500\" do undoubtedly point to a controversy in relation to a pecuniary demand or in relation to a sum of money as being the kind of controversy contemplated by sec. 82, s.s. 1. I am satisfied, however, that this is not the necessary meaning of these words. The first of the meanings attributable to the word \"amount\" in the Oxford dictionary is \"The sum total to which anything mounts up or reaches\" and to construe these words one must ask the question: \"Amount of what?\" Amount exceeding $500 of course does pointedly indicate that the answer to the question must be amount of money. But the words are not altogether intractable; \"exceeding $500\" may be read as exceeding $500 in value, in other words, the phrase undoubtedly is susceptible of being paraphrased thus: \"in which the sum total of the thing in controversy exceeds the value of $500.\" That, I say, is a possible construction; and I am far from satisfied that if I had to pass upon this section standing alone this construction ought not to be preferred to that advanced on behalf of the respondent in order to avoid the quite absurd result that the Legislature, in conferring jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court with respect to various matters enumerated in sections 19 to 24, provided that it is only in respect of matters mentioned in sec. 83 that an appeal lies to this court as of right. There is no doubt that the exceptional class of cases intended to be described by the clause \"actual amount * * or value of $500\" is co-extensive with the class of cases described in the words of sec. 82,\nin which the actual amount in controversy exceeds $500,\nand by this legislative interpretation supplied by sec. 83 all doubt and difficulty are removed.\nSince writing the above I have considered the point and have concluded that there is no solid reason for holding that a judgment pronounced in an action brought under sec. 23a is excluded from the operation of sec. 82.\nThe motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am of the opinion that in exercising the jurisdiction conferred by sec. 23(a) of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" the Exchequer Court acts not a mere locum tenens or substitute for the arbitrators under sec. 20 of the \"Patent Act,\" but in the discharge of its ordinary curial functions and that a proceeding under sec. 23(a) is a judicial proceeding in which its judgment is appealable to this court under ss. 82 et seq. of the Exchequer Court Act. Mr. Cassels's forceful argument failed to raise any doubt in my mind on this point.\nI am equally clearly of the opinion that the fact that the learned judge of the Exchequer Court affirmed his own jurisdiction to deal with the matter in controversy, which was challenged, far from casting doubt on the appealability of his judgment only serves to make it more certain.\nAs to the value of the matter in controversy the affidavits and the agreement in evidence sufficiently establish that it exceeds the requisite $500.\nA construction of section 83 which would confine the right of appeal to proceedings in which there is an actual pecuniary demand before the court, thus excluding most important cases in which the right asserted or the matter in controversy, though not presented in the form of a claim to recover money, far exceeds in value $500 would, in my opinion, be too narrow and would frustrate the purpose of Parliament. Section 83 is not happily phrased. \"Amount in controversy\" is, no doubt, an ill-chosen expression calculated to lend colour to the contention of the respondent. But the use of the words by which it is followed, \"sum or value,\" makes it reasonably certain that it is not intended to restrict the right of appeal to cases in which the controversy is as to the right to recover a sum of money. If so, the addition of the words \"or value\" would be meaningless.\nI would dismiss the motion.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 25 Can. S.C.R. 78.\n[2] 40 Can. S.C.R. 523.\n[3] 41 Can.

Co. v. Loach [1916] 1 A.C. 719, followed. The act of the respondent in coming out with defective brakes,though antecedent to the appellant's negligence really prevented him from stopping his car in time to avoid the collision.\nIt is unlawful for the driver of a car on a tram\u2014line operated under the Dominion Railway Act to approach an unprotected highway level crossing at such speed that his car is not under reasonable control.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (23 B.C. Rep. 160), reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Murphy J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe appellant's servant (one Hall) was driving a team of horses and a wagon, the property of the appellant, along a road, known as Townsend Road, which was crossed by the company respondent. On the way, one Sands got up from the road and sat beside the driver. On nearing the track, which was approached by an up grade, the two men were engaged in conversation and took no precautions. When the horses were partially across the track, they were struck by a tramcar of the company respondent. Sands and the two horses were killed, Hall was thrown from the wagon and the wagon was damaged. The tramcar at the time was coming down grade at about 40 miles an hour. There was evidence that the brakes on the tramcar were defective.\nThe issues raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nArmour K.C. for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. for the respondent THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin with this addition.\nThe general proposition that \"statutory powers may not be exercised with reckless disregard for the common law rights of others\" cannot be open to objection. A statement of the contrary would seem sufficient to refute it. Adopting the language of Lord Sumner in Great Central Railway Co. v. Hewlett[2], I would say that however general the terms used by the legislature in authorizing for the company's benefit what would otherwise be a nuisance the authority conferred must be exercised with reasonable care and not without it.\nThe application of the rule to the particular case, however, presents some difficulty. It is not suggested that railway trains can never pass over a public crossing except at such speed that in case of necessity they can be stopped before reaching it. If it were, that would seem to be a proposition that one might have much hesitation in accepting although at first sight it seems reasonable.\nIn British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Loach[3], the Privy Council held that it was the negligence of the respondent in coming out with defective brakes which though antecedent to the appellant's negligence did not come into effect until afterwards and therefore was the cause of the accident. It may perhaps be suggested that the point of the decision was a fine one and that if the respondent had previously tied its hands so that it could not help coming too fast the appellant had also previ- ously tied his hands so that he arrived at the crossing too slow to be able to clear.\nHowever, the judgment of the Privy Council must be accepted as the law not only as to 'the abstract principle which is clear but as applicable to this particular case; and as Mr. Justice Archer Martin said in the Court of Appeal,\non the inferences to be drawn from facts about which there is no real dispute * * * the accident could * * * have been avoided if the brake had been in good order.\nThis conclusion clearly brings the case within the decision of the Privy Council in Loach v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co.[4], and the appeal must be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment of the trial judge must be restored.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The case between the British Columbia Electric Rly. Co. v. Loach, reported[5], was one arising out of the same accident and on the same facts and circumstances as this action was brought on. The only difference is in the person who brought the action; but it is contended there exists a difference between the findings of the jury in the former case and the findings of facts or inferences from the evidence made by the learned trial judge in the present action. The record of the Loach case is not before us and it may be that some of the evidence in that case as to the power of the motorman to have stopped the car before reaching the team crossing the track at the rate of speed the car was running with a defective brake, such as there was on the car, was not precisely the same as in this case. However, in the Loach case their Lordships cite the finding of the jury that while both parties were guilty of negligence, nevertheless\nthe motorman could have stopped the car if the brake had been in an effective condition;\nand Lord Sumner, who delivered the judgment, says:\u2014\nIf the brake had been in good order, it should have stopped the car in 300 feet.\nIn so far as the general principle is concerned I take it we are bound by the law laid down in the Loach case by the Judicial Committee.\nIn the headnote to that case it is stated that their Lordships held:\u2014\nThe principle that the contributory negligence of a plaintiff will not disentitle him to recover damages if the defendant, by the exercise of care, might have avoided the result of that negligence, applies where the defendant, although not committing any negligent act subsequently to the plaintiff's negligence, has incapacitated himself by his previous negligence from exercising such care as would have avoided the result of the plaintiff's negligence.\nSeveral questions were raised and argued at bar as to whether the rate of speed at which the car was running when the motorman first saw the plaintiff's servant man driving his team and cart to cross the car track, was not in itself negligence, and whether the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" on the subject of the rate at which cars might run, extend to electric cars. In the view I take of the facts I think the appeal must be decided by determining whether there was evidence from which the proper inference should be drawn that if the car had been equipped with an adequate and efficient brake instead of an admittedly defective and inefficient one, it could, if promptly applied at the proper moment by the motorman, have stopped the car and avoided the accident. If such an inference is the proper one to draw, the defendants (respondents) under the authority of the Loach case must be held liable. The learned trial judge thought himself bound by the decision of the Judicial Committee in the Loach case, and his finding on the fact whether efficient brakes would, if applied, have stopped the car in time, is as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiffs desire me to find that had the brakes been efficient and applied as soon as the motorman saw the team, the car'would have been slowed down sufficiently to allow time enough for the team to have cleared the tracks. It is possible the horses might have got over, but I do not think I can hold it proven that the wagon would also be across, and if not the horses would probably have been killed and certainly the wagon would have been damaged.\nAfter careful consideration of the evidence, I am of opinion that the proper inference to be drawn from it is that had the car been equipped with proper and efficient brakes the motorman would have stopped it when he applied the brakes in time to have avoided the accident.\nThe evidence of Andrews is not as clear and satisfactory on the point as one could desire; but in answer to the learned judge who said to him: \"Well if you are going 40 miles, you couldn't get down to 10 miles in a hundred feet?\" he answered: \"Oh! no Sir, about 200 feet in 40 miles an hour.\"\nThat 200 feet was 100 feet less than in the Loach case Lord Sumner thought it could be stopped altogether and would bring the car running at the reduced rate of 10 miles an hour within 200 feet of the horses and truck crossing the track and still allow 200 within which the car might have been stopped altogether before it reached the team. I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs here and in the Court of Appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014 I do not see enough in the facts presented herein whereby it is fairly possible to distinguish this case from that of the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Loach[6], arising out of same accident as in question herein, and am therefore of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014The accident out of which the litigation arose occurred in Townsend Avenue in the municipality of Point Grey, a suburb of Vancouver, where that street is crossed by the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway the appellant company's horses and wagon being run down by a car of the respondent company.\nPursuant to a contract with the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the lessee of the railway, the respondent company, some years ago, equipped the railway as an electric railway and were working it under the terms of the contract by authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada (ch. 66, 6 & 7 Edw. VII.). The agreement requires the respondent company to provide an \"electric car service\" between Granville Street in the City of Vancouver and Steveston on the Fraser Delta (a distance of about 15 miles) in part over the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway and in part over a track owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company which, it may be assumed, was constructed under statutory authority as part of that company's system. The Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway though originally constructed under the authority of Provincial legislation was afterwards declared to be a work \"for the general advantage of Canada\" and thereupon became and is a Dominion Railway. The respondent company was incorporated under the \"English Companies' Act,\" acquired the property and rights of the Consolidated Railway Company, a British Columbia corporation, and own and operate lines of electric railway and other works in Vancouver and the suburbs of Vancouver and in other places in British Columbia under the authority of the Consolidated Company's special Act (B.C. Statutes, 1896, ch. 55), all these works being local works under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Provincial Legislature. It may be a question whether the intention of the legislation authorising the agreement above mentioned (ch. 66, 6 & 7 Edw. VII.) was to give the respondent company the status of a Dominion Railway Company vis \u00e0 vis the enactments of the \"Dominion Railway Act,\" or whether the company is merely authorized to exercise, as contractor with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway Company, powers which are directly conferred upon and are the powers of the last mentioned companies which they are permitted to execute by the respondent company as their instrumentality. The point is not material to any question arising now and I mention it to make it clear that nothing said in relation to this appeal should be treated as affecting any question which may hereafter arise concerning the status of the respondent company or the responsibility of either of the railway companies mentioned.\nThe line operated by the respondent company for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway Company crosses numerous streets within the territorial boundaries of Vancouver which occur at the usual intervals and after passing the southern limit of the municipality (about a mile from the Granville Street terminus) in the municipality of Point Grey until the north arm of the Fraser is reached.\nThe respondent company contends that it is not judicially amenable in respect of harm caused to persons and things lawfully passing on a public highway across the line it operates by reason merely of the fact that such harm is ascribable to the unusual and dangerous speed of the car causing it; in short operating the railway, as it contends under the provisions of the \"Dominion Railway Act\" the matter of the speed of its cars (it is argued) rests in its own uncontrolled discretion, save in cases in which that discretion is affected by the express provisions of the \"Railway Act\" or by some regulation on the subject by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nIt has often been laid down as a general proposition that the grantee of statutory powers is not in general responsible for harm resulting from that which the legislature has authorized provided it is done in the manner authorized and without negligence; but that an obligation rests upon persons exercising such powers not only to exercise them with reasonable care but in such a manner as to avoid unnecessary harm to the persons or property of others: Geddis v. Bonn Reservoir[7], at p. 438; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy [8], at p. 231; East Fremantle v. Annois[9], at p. 218; Hewlett v. Grand Central[10]. The principle has often been applied and has been always considered to impose upon street railway companies an obligation to regulate the speed of their cars in and upon the public streets in such a way as not unduly to endanger the safety of the public.\nAll such general rules and principles are, however, in the last analysis rules of construction, and must give way to an express or implied contrary intention. \"Obviously,\" said Bowen L.J., in Truman v. London Brighton and South Coast Railway Company[11], at p. 108, \"the question in each case turns on the construction of the Act of Parliament.\"\nIn East Fremantle v. Annois[12], at p. 217, referring to a remark of Abbott C.J., in Boulton v. Crowther[13], at p. 707, that if the donee of a statutory power act \"arbitrarily, carelessly or oppressively\" the law has provided a remedy. Lord Macnaghten observed that such expressions, although as applied to the circumstances of a particular case they probably create no difficulty, are nevertheless when used generally and at large neither precise nor exact as to scope or meaning. In a word, his Lordship said \"the only question is, has the power been exceeded? Abuse is only another form of excess.\"There is,\" said Lord Selburne in Truman v. London, Brighton and Coast Railway Company[14], at p. 53,\nno cause of action on the ground of negligence in the manner of doing what is authorized if that * * * is in fact authorized;\nthat is to say has been declared to be lawful. If the particular thing\ncomplained of is done in the place and by the means contemplated by the legislation\nit is not an actionable wrong: Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[15], at p. 227; Hamilton St. Rly. v. Weir[16], at p. 506; Hewlett v. Grand Central[17]. An electric railway company having authority by statute to place its transmission wires above the streets on poles or under ground was held not to be answerable in negligence for the consequences of not adopting the plan less dangerous to the public; the exercise of this discretion vested in the company was not reviewable by a jury: Dumphy v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[18].\nThe question whether a railway company whose railway is being worked under the authority of the \"Dominion Railway Act\" is answerable in negligence for running its trains over a highway crossing at a speed which makes it impossible for the locomotive engineer with the appliances at his command, or with due regard to the safety of his passengers to exercise any effective control over the train with a view to the safety of persons crossing the track on the highway is therefore reducible to the question: Is such man- agement of the trains legalized? And the answer to the question must, to repeat the remark of Bowen L.J., turn upon the construction of the enactments from which the authority to work the railway is derived.\nThe difficulty of holding railway companies to be under the duty generally to regulate the speed of their trains at highway crossings in accordance with some standard of reasonableness to be determined and applied by a jury is obvious. Decisions upon questions of speed, it may be assumed, affect more radically the management of a railway line than decisions upon questions of what may be called collateral precautions, in providing, for example, signalling devices or gates and watchmen at highway crossings. Reasonableness means, of course, reasonableness in all the circumstances. Is it for a jury to say whether a fast service between Montreal and Toronto or Montreal and Ottawa, for example, necessitating the passing of numbers of highway crossings at a rate of speed precluding the possibility of exercising in most cases control over the trains sufficient in itself to afford any safeguard for persons using the highway\u2014is the reasonableness of such a service entailing such consequences to be left to a jury to determine? Is the fetter upon the railway company's discretion involved in such a rule within the contemplation of the \"Railway Act?\" I think the decision of this court in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[19], may be taken broadly to establish the proposition that the discretion of the railway company exercised bon\u00e2 fide with regard to the speed of trains on a Dominion rail- way worked in the usual way by steam is not as a general rule amenable to judicial review with reference to some standard of reasonableness to be determined by a judicial tribunal.\nIt does not follow that in no circumstances does a legal obligation rest upon a company operating a railway under the \"Dominion Railway Act\" in relation to the speed of its trains in approaching or crossing a highway. For example, the Act provides for certain precautions with the object of warning the public of the approach of trains and the enactments prescribing these precautions presuppose that railway trains are not run at a speed which makes theso warnings useless; and I am not prepared to say that for harm caused by a train running across a highway at such a speed as to nullify the utility of the prescribed statutory signals, other efficacious signals not being provided, the railway company could not be made answerable as for negligence. And the circumstances of a particular emergency may obviously cast a duty upon the servants in charge of the train to moderate its speed or bring it to a stop; so also the permanent conditions of a particular crossing or the practice of the railway in relation to it (a point to which I must again advert) may give rise to a duty to take extraordinary measures there for the protection of the public by controlling train speed where other effective measures are impossible or neglected: Rex v. Broad[20].\nIn addition to the general considerations above alluded to there is another consideration which applies with some force to railway works under the \"Dominion Railway Act.\" The jurisdiction of the Dominion with regard to railways is limited to what may be called through railways, that is to say, railways passing beyond the limits of a province or connecting two provinces, and local railways declared by the Dominion Parliament to be works for the general advantage of Canada. Down to the time when the \"Railway Act\" received its present general form in the year 1888, the practice of making such declarations on grounds and for reasons having no kind of relevancy to the substance of the declaration itself had not come into vogue. Generally speaking such declarations were reserved for undertakings connected organically with through railways. The responsibilities of the Dominion railway companies with regard to through traffic should not be lost sight of in considering the effect of the \"Dominion Railway Act\" in this regard.\nThe considerations, however, ordinarily relevant where the question concerns the management of a Dominion railway worked by steam, are largely without application to the undertakings operated by the respondent company under the authority of 6 & 7 Edw. VII. ch. 66. To make this clear it is necessary to refer to the specific provisions of the agreement of 1905 between the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway Company and the British Columbia Electric Company ratified by that statute.\nThe agreement requires the respondent company to maintain a\ngood, proper and efficient electric car service equipped with modern cars and supplied with the latest appliances;\nand it prescribes that the service shall be equal in every respect to the service now in effect on the lines owned and operated by the party of the second part between Vancouver and New Westminster.\nBy section 16 of the agreement it is stipulated that the respondent company shall protect and indemnify the Canadian Pacific Railway Company against all loss, damage or claims which may arise in consequence of the working of the railway under the agreement and\nwill bear and pay all expenses incurred in doing all acts, matters and things as they are now or may hereafter be required for the maintenance and operation of the said railway in conformity with the laws of the Dominion of Canada\n\u2014meaning of course the Dominion law as affecting the undertaking in question. By another clause, inspection by the Superintendent of the Pacific Division of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company is provided for and the respondent company undertakes to remedy any defects in the service of equipment of the railway to the satisfaction of the superintendent or any official appointed by him to make such inspection. It is quite evident that all the parties to these agreements have assumed\u2014and carried the assumption into effect in practice\u2014that important provisions of the \"Dominion Railway Act\" enacted for the protection of the public at highway crossings had no application to the railway when worked under the provisions of this agreement. The cars in use are of a type familiar in this country as the interurban trolley car worked by electric motor, equipped with compressed air whistle and foot gong, brakes and reversing apparatus, having neither steam whistle nor bell weighing \"at least 30 pounds\" as prescribed for \"engines\" or \"locomotives\" by the \"Dominion Railway Act.\" The photographs in evidence indicate, and we may assume cor- rectly, that at Townsend Avenue the sign \"Railway Crossing\" prescribed by that statute does not appear.\nIn this, no doubt, the purpose of the agreement as touching the character of the cars was faithfully carried out. The cars contemplated by the agreement are certainly not \"locomotives\" or \"engines\" within the meaning of the \"Dominion Railway Act.\" The intention of the parties was to establish a service which should be remunerative, and within the city limits, at all events, the agreement must be taken to have contemplated stopping at street intersections as in the working of a street railway service, for taking up and setting down passengers, and this would necessarily involve the use of such cars and appliances as would enable the cars to be easily started and readily brought to a stop. With such cars the working of a \"proper and efficient\" service as regards measures required for the safety of the public on the highways (by regulation of speed and otherwise) as well as in the interest of the patrons of the railway\u2014would in the case of a short railway of 12 or 15 miles in length, having no through connections, present no greater difficulty than the working of an ordinary street car system in a large city.\nBy the special Act, ch. 66, 6 & 7 Edw. VII., it is declared that \"subject to the provisions of the 'Railway Act' \" the agreement referred to and another to which a brief reference will be necessary set forth in the schedule to the statute, shall be legal and binding upon the parties thereto and it is enacted that\nsuch respective parties may do whatever is necessary in order to give effect to the substance and intention to the said agreements.\nLight is thrown upon the effect of the words \"substance and intention\" in the ratify- ing statute by a reference to the agreement of 1904 between the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the respondent company which the statute also authorizes the respondent company to carry out. This agreement requires the company to establish an \"electric street car\" service between the corner of Robson street and Granville street (one of the principal thoroughfares in Vancouver) and Kitsilano, a route lying entirely within the municipal boundaries (except where it passes over the Canadian Pacific Railway Bridge at False Creek) crossing on the way numerous city streets. The operation of this service required the running of the cars on Granville street between Robson street and the northern terminus of the railway bridge over the respondent company's tracks and this part of the service being operated over the respondent company's own street railway in Vancouver, a provincial undertaking, neither in whole or in part declared to be \"a work for the general advantage of Canada,\" it follows that the parties must have had in view the use of cars of a character conforming to the provisions of the provincial law and to the arrangements between the respondent company and the municipality with respect to its street car service in Vancouver; and by the very terms of the agreement itself, the service provided is to be an extension of that street car service and is to be a continuous service from the corner of Robson and Granville streets to Kitsilano and back.\nAs regards this agreement there could be no manner of doubt that what was contemplated was \"a street car service\" in the strict sense \"proper and efficient\" as the agreement requires.\nIt follows from what I have said that the \"sub- stance and intention\" of the ratified agreements was that a \"street car service\" and an \"electric car service\" should be provided by means of cars not equipped with steam whistle and bell in compliance with the requirements in respect of locomotives, of the \"Railway Act,\" but of the kind used by the respondent company in its already established electric car services. The agreements contemplated, I repeat, as protection of the public at highway crossings and on the highway generally against the dangers incidental to the working of the service not the specific precautions prescribed by the \"Railway Act\" when such precautions would be unusual and impracticable but such precautions as would properly be taken in the operation of \"proper and efficient\" services of the character authorized; the \"law of the Dominion of Canada\" as pointed out above, in section 16 of the agreement means the law as it affects the particular undertaking.\nThat such cars should be equipped with efficient brakes is obviously contemplated\u2014brakes, that is to say, efficient for use in such a service; but unqualified license as to the speed of cars might reduce this requirement to an idle formality.\nThe public would be entitled to expect the observance in both these services of the safeguards and precautions commonly observed in the operation of services of the same character for the protection of persons using the streets. That is what the agreements contemplate and that therefore is what the statute contemplates and that is undoubtedly what the respondent company professed, and no doubt quite honestly attempted to carry out. Such being the effect of the special Act it is proper to note that by section 3 of the \"Railway Act\" the provisions of the special Act in so far as it is necessary to give effect to them shall be taken to override the provisions of the general Act.\nConformably to the spirit of that provision it is, 1 think, to the character of the service established and authorized (which excludes the use of most important special precautions for the safety of the public at highway crossings prescribed by the \"General Railway Act\") that we must look for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the general rule against negligent execution of the statutory powers applies in the matter of the speed of cars at such crossings. It results, I think, from what I have said, that the proper answer to the question is, yes.\nAs regards the crossing and the car in question there are, however, two reasons which put the question of the duty of the appellant company in relation to speed beyond question. First, as to the crossing\u2014 there was a stopping-place there and in the ordinary course of operation the car would be brought under control to enable the motorman to stop for passengers; and there could consequently be no general overriding necessity or convenience to prevent the taking of proper measures for the safety of the public on the highway; as to the car, the fact alone that it was not equipped with proper brakes was sufficient to limit in the special circumstances any otherwise uncontrolled discretion as to speed, assuming such discretion as a general rule to exist.\nTwo further questions arise: First, was the learned trial judge right in finding as a fact that had the car been equipped with a proper brake Hayes, the motorman, would nevertheless have been unable to stop it or to check its speed sufficiently to avoid a collision or to make it harmless if one had occurred? My view is that the finding cannot now be interfered with in this court, first, because it was concurred in by the majority of the Court of Appeal and it is at least quite impossible to treat the conclusion that the plaintiff had not adequately established the affirmative of this issue as clearly erroneous. And secondly, I agree fully with the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in his opinion that on the evidence presented, Mr. Justice Murphy could not properly have reached any other conclusion and that the testimony on which the appellant relies for impeaching the finding of the trial judge is quite worthless. The evidence relied upon is that of one Andrews who says that he was acquainted with the car that caused the injury and that going at a rate of 35 to 40 miles an hour at the place where the accident occurred he could with the brake in proper order have brought the car to rest, to use his own language, in \"about 12 poles\" that is to say within a space of 1,200 feet. He is then asked to say within what distance he could reduce the speed from 40 miles an hour to 10 miles an hour assuming the appliances to be in perfect order. His testimony given in answer to that question, put by Mr. Justice Murphy himself, was that he thought he could effect such a reduction while the car was traversing a space of about 200 feet. I agree with the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal that the learned trial judge was entitled to disregard this evidence.\nIt is too obvious for argument that both state- ments of the witness cannot stand; which is to be accepted? It is evident that Mr. Justice Murphy did not consider he had evidence before him justifying the conclusion that with perfect appliances the speed of the car could be reduced from 40 to 10 miles an hour in less than 400 feet; and this view cannot be satisfactorily explained away on the assumption that the trial judge misunderstood the answer to a pointed question asked by himself.\nThe next question is: Does the principle in Loach v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co.[21], apply in view of this finding of the learned trial judge? Mr. Tilley relies upon the following passage in the judgment of Lord Sumner, speaking for the Judicial Committee, at p. 725:\u2014\nHere lies the ambiguity. If the \"primary\" negligent act is done and over, if it is separated from the injury by the intervention of the plaintiff's own negligence, then no doubt it is not the \"ultimate\" negligence in the sense of directly causing the injury. If, however, the same conduct which constituted the primary negligence is repeated or continued, and is the reason why the defendant does not avoid the consequence of the plaintiff's negligence at and after the time when the duty to do so arises, why should it not be also the \"ultimate\" neglgence which makes the defendant liable?\nMr. Tilley argues that Hayes' negligence really came to an end when he put the emergency appliances into operation on seeing the horses approaching the railway tracks about 16 or 18 feet west of the west rail, although the effect, he admits, of his negligent conduct did not; and this, he argues, distinguishes Hayes' personal negligence from the negligence of the company in not providing the car with a proper brake, while (he argued) Hall's negligence in going on to the track after Hayes had done every- thing he could to stop the car, intervened between the negligence of Hayes and the final catastrophe. The acceptance of this argument seems to lead to the rather embarrassing position that if the rate of speed had been such that the car (equipped with a proper brake) could have been stopped in time to avert the accident the company might have been responsible; while given the higher rate of speed at which a proper brake would be ineffective the company would escape responsibility.\nBut assuming that in such a case as this it is posible to separate the negligence of the official responsible for default in failing to provide a proper brake from the negligence of the motorman who runs at a speed which is excessive not only in view of the fact that the brake is defective, but would have been excessive, that is to say, unreasonably excessive, even if the car had been equipped with proper appliances\u2014assuming that the negligence of Hayes and that of this official can be considered as distinct negligences and that the two together ought not to be regarded as constituting one negligence, (see the judgment of Lord Watson in Smith v. Baker[22], at p. 352), I think the judgment in Loach's case, when due effect is given to the whole of it, requires us to hold that the trial judge was entitled to find Hayes' negligence to have been the sole cause of the injury of which the appellant company complains.\nI think this conclusion follows from the observations upon Brenner v. Toronto Railway Co.[23]. To make this clear it will be necessary very briefly to indicate what was involved in that case. The plaintiff, a girl of 18, being on the south side of Queen street in Toronto and having to cross the street saw a car coming towards her from the east, and assuming that she had time to cross before the car would reach her line of advance, she proceeded, and arriving at the car track, stepped on to the track in front of this car without having taken any precaution to ascertain its position before doing so and without having given the motorman any warning of her intention. She was immediately struck down and terribly injured.\nThe plaintiff's case at the trial was that the car, when she saw it, was at a considerable distance from her and that she was reasonably entitled to assume, if it was proceeding at the usual speed, that she could cross the track before it came up to her; that it was due to the motorman's negligence in driving the car at an excessively high rate of speed that this reasonable expectation was unfulfilled; and that this negligence of the motorman was the sole cause of the accident. The defendant's case was that when the plaintiff left the sidewalk after seeing the car approaching it was only a short distance east of her with power thrown off and running at about 6 miles an hour; and that the motorman reasonably assumed that she had no intention of crossing in front of the car until as she approached the rail her seeming want of attention to the noise of the gong which he was sounding excited his apprehensions and he applied first the brake and afterwards the reversing apparatus; but that after he had done this she stepped in front of the car and was knocked down. The plaintiff alleged also that assuming the car was mov- ing at a moderate rate of speed, as the defendants alleged, the motorman was negligent in not stopping sooner. The jury rejected the plaintiff's case in its entirety finding the plaintiff's negligence to be the sole cause of her injury. Their findings acquitted the motorman of negligence in the matter of speed involving, in view of the judge's charge, a finding that the motorman if he had more swiftly divined the plaintiff's intention to cross the track, could have stopped the car in time to avoid a collision, but negativing the charge of negligence in failing to do so.\nOn appeal to the Divisional Court the charge of the learned trial judge was attacked in this way. The scene of the accident was immediately opposite the terminus of University Avenue, a street which runs north from the northerly boundary of Queen street. A few feet east of University avenue, another street, University street, runs in the same direction from the northerly limit of the street also without crossing it. One of the rules of the company required the motorman on approaching a \"crossing\" to throw off the power or reduce the speed of his car so as to get it under control with a view to emergencies. The Divisional Court held that in approaching the easterly limit of University street the car was approaching a \"crossing\" and that this rule applied. The motorman in fact did not throw off his power or reduce his speed until he reached the easterly limit of University avenue. The plaintiff impeached the direction of the learned judge and asked for a new trial on the ground that under a proper direction they might have found that the motorman was negligent in not throwing off power or reducing speed on approaching University street and that they might moreover have found that if he had done so the motorman might in consequence of the reduced momentum, thereby occasioned, more effectually have checked his car on the application of the emergency apparatus and thus left the plaintiff a fraction of time more to escape. The Divisional Court gave effect to this contention. On appeal to the Court of Appeal it was held that there was no misdirection, that the rule in question had been sufficiently brought to the attention of the jury. In this court the defendant company contended that supposing the rule might more pointedly have been brought to the attention of the jury on the issue of the motorman's negligence, a new trial ought nevertheless to be refused because when the admitted facts were considered with the conclusions of fact necessarily involved in the findings of the jury, it was clear that the plaintiff must fail because, assuming the motorman had been negligent in failing to observe the rule and that this negligence was one cause of the accident, still the plaintiff's negligent conduct was such that consistently with the conclusions involved in the verdict which were not affected by the alleged misdirection and the admitted facts the jury could only have found that this conduct was a \"direct and effective cause\" of the mishap. In other words, assuming the mishap to have been due in part to the negligence of the motorman and in part to the negligence of the plaintiff, then under the undisputed principles of the law of negligence the plaintiff could not in such circumstances recover. This contention prevailed with Girouard J. and myself.\nThe effect of their Lordships' observations at pp. 725 and 726 appears to be that their Lordships disapprove of this view of Brenner's case.\nThe broad principle is, of course, undisputed (it is distinctly recognized in the last paragraph of their Lordships' judgment in Loach's Case) that a plaintiff whose negligence is a direct cause of the injury complained of cannot recover even though the accident would not have occurred but for the defendant's own negligence; in other words, where the injury complained of is \"directly\" caused by the negligence of the plaintiff and the defendant. (See Lord Esher in The Bernina[24], at p. 61, and Lindley L.J. in the same case at pp. 88 and 89, and Mr. Justice Willes in Walton v. The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co.[25]. That is to say if the injury is not only the actual consequence but the consequence which any reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, knowing what the plaintiff knew, must have seen to be the probable consequence of his negligence and the chain of causality is not interrupted by the negligence of the defendant, then it is settled law that the plaintiff cannot recover. The effect of their Lordships' disapproval of the judgment mentioned seems to be that on the facts, undisputed or involved in the findings in Brenner's case which were unaffected by the misdirection, if there was any, the jury would have been entitled to find that the plaintiff's negligence was not a \"direct\" cause of the accident in the sense above indicated if they had found that the motorman was negligent in not observing the rule and that this negligence was one of the causes of the accident. There was in fact, it may be noted, nothing in the judgment referred to at p. 725 expressed or intended as a \"comment\" on any of the judgments in the Divisional Court; and one must, I think, assume especially in view of the sentence at the top of p. 726 that the observation on p. 725 was not intended as obiter and was not directed to any single sentence detached from its context or considered apart from the concrete issues raised by the Brenner appeal.\nThe plaintiff in Brenner's Case had deliberately, knowing the car to be near and approaching her, stepped on the track in front of it without looking to see exactly where it was until, as she said, the catastrophe was \"upon her\" and, as the jury found, with out any reasonable excuse for doing so; and after the motorman divining her intention, had made every proper effort to avoid a collision by trying to stop the car with his emergency apparatus, which he could have done had she given any reasonable warning of her intention to cross the track.\nThe effect of the approval of the judgment in the Divisional Court in Brenner's case seems to be that the negligence of the motorman, in the case before us, notwithstanding his efforts to stop the car, must be regarded as continuing in the sense of being operative down to the moment of impact, while their Lordships expressly declare in Loach's case that the negligence of the teamster is to be considered to have ceased to operate when looking up on Sands' exclamation he, for the first time, became aware that a car was approaching but too late to enable him to escape.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In the same accident in which the horses were killed and the wagon wrecked for loss of which the present plaintiff sues, one Sands, who accompanied the driver, also lost his life. In an action brought by his administrator against the present defendants, although the jury had found contributory negligence by Sands, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held them answerable for his death, (Loach v. B.C. Electric Rly. Co.[26], on the ground that they\ncould and ought to have avoided the consequences of that negligence and failed to do so, not by any combination of negligence on the part of Sands with their own, but solely by the negligence of their servants in sending out the car with a brake whose inefficiency operated to cause the collision at the last moment, and in running the car at an excessive speed, which required a perfectly efficient brake to arrest it.\nIn that decision their Lordships have authoritatively determined, as stated in the head\u2014note to the report, that:\u2014\nThe principle that the contributory negligence of a plaintiff will not disentitle him to recover damages, if the defendant, by the exercise of care, might have avoided the result of that negligence, applies where the defendant, although not committing any negligent act subsequently to the plaintiff's negligence, has incapacitated himself by his previous negligence from exercising such care as would have avoided the result of the plaintiff's negligence.\nLord Sumner answered the contention that the contributory negligence of Sands (which was the same as that found by the learned trial judge against the present plaintiff) had continued up to the moment of the collision by stating that \"it does not correspond with the fact;\" and his Lordship adverted to the distinction between negligence and its consequences. These observations are directly applicable to the facts as disclosed by the evidence and found in the present case. The difference between Loach's case and the case at bar on which respondents rely is that, whereas in the former the jury had found that\nthe motorman could have stopped the car if the brake had been in effective condition,\nin the case now before us the trial judge, though he held the brake was defective, and thought that, had it been efficient, the horses might have got over the crossing, did\nnot think (he could) hold it proven that the wagon would also be across, and, if not, the horses would probably have been killed and certainly the wagon would have been damaged.\nNevertheless,\napplying the law as laid down in Loach v. B.C. Electric Rly. Co., in reference to this same accident to the facts as found at the conclusion of the trial,\nthe learned judge held the defendants liable on the ground that by running at a reckless rate of speed in approaching a dangerous crossing the motorman had disabled himself from preventing the collision, which he might otherwise have avoided, If the rate of speed under the circumstances amounted to negligence, and disability to avoid the collision resulted from it, it was just as truly \" 'ultimate' negligence which makes the defendant liable\" as was the sending out of the car with a defective brake, which their Lordships so characterized in Loach's case because of the motorman's consequent incapacity to avoid killing the unfortunate Sands.\nThat it would be negligent, without the warrant of statutory authority, to drive a railway train or a tramcar when nearly approaching an unprotected highway level crossing at a speed approximating 40 miles an hour (as was done in this case) is indisputable. Under some circumstances it might be more than merely negligent; it might be criminal.\nThe defendants are a Dominion railway company. They seek to justify the otherwise indefensible conduct of their motorman by invoking the \"Dominion Railway Act;\" and they cite the decision of this court in Grand Trunk Railway Company v. McKay[27].\nIt was determined in that case that the speed of a train passing through a thickly peopled portion of a city, town or village, unless so restricted by a special order of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council (now the Railway Board), need not be limited to six (now ten) miles an hour, under section 8 of 55 & 56 Vict, ch 27 (now section 275 (1) of the \"Railway Act\"), when the fences on both sides of the track are maintained and turned into cattle guards at highway crossings as prescribed by section 6 (now section 254 (2)) of that Act. (But see subsection 3 of section 275, as enacted by 7 & 8 Edw. VII., ch. 32, sec. 13.) The decision in the McKay case is also authority for the proposition that, at all events in the case of a steam railway, such as was there under consideration, if the requirements of the statute and of any orders or regulations duly made thereunder as to the protection of a highway level crossing are complied with, there is no legal limitation which would make approaching and running over it at any rate of speed practically necessitated by the exigencies of rapid transit per se illegal or negligent quoad the public using such highway. That was merely an application of the rule that an action will not lie for the doing of that which is authorized by statute. What is necessary for accomplishing the purpose of a legalized undertaking will be deemed within the purview of the powers conferred for carrying it out.\nNo doubt the presence in it of subsection 1 of section 275, already adverted to, and of subsection 4 of the same section (as enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., ch. 32, sec. 13), which limits the speed at crossings where there has been an accident, and of section 30 (g) and sections 237 and 238 (8 & 9 Edw. VII., ch. 32, sections 4 & 5) affords strong ground for the contention that in the case of steam railways, with which it is chiefly concerned, the \"Railway Act\" impliedly sanctions trains approaching and passing over the ordinary rural highway level crossing at a rate of speed limited only by the duty of not unnecessarily imperilling the safety of the trains and of passengers and employees. The chief purpose of authorizing the establishment of steam railways\u2014rapid transit between widely separated points\u2014 (Wakelin v. London and South Western Rly. Co.[28], would be frustrated in Canada if the trains run upon them were obliged to reduce speed on approaching every unprotected rural highway which they cross at grade level.\nI do not understand, however, that Grand Trunk Railway Company v. McKay[29], or any other decision is authority for the proposition that statutory powers may be exercised with reckless disregard for the common law rights of others. Even in cases where the Act, speaking generally, authorizes the running of trains at a high rate of speed and the Board of Railway Commissioners has not made an order for special protection under section 237 or section 238 (8 & 9 Edw. VII., ch. 32, sections 4 and 5) or, in the case of urban crossings, an order regulating speed under section 275(3), circumstances may exist at particular level crossings which involve peril from running at high speed obviously exceptionally great. Failure to have a train under such control that it can be stopped, or its speed sufficiently reduced to avoid injury at such a crossing, when there would be a reasonable opportunity to do so if the speed were moderate, would amount to reckless disregard of the rights of others. As put in the very recent case of Hewlett v. Great Central Railway Co.[30], by the Lord Chief Justice of England, presiding in the Court of Appeal,\nThe common law said that when statutory powers were conferred in the absence of special provision to the contrary, those powers must be exercised with reasonable care.\nAlthough the House of Lords (1916, 2 A.C. 511), applying the principle of the decision in Moore v. Lambeth Waterworks Co.[31], reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeal because the danger had been created not by the doing of that which the statute specifically authorized, but by a subsequent diminution of light owing to the exigencies of the war, for which the company was not responsible and against the consequences of which it was under no obligation to provide, Lord Sumner took occasion to state the principle of law which governs the operation of railways in these terms:\u2014\nIn such cases the authority in question is given in general terms; it is, for example, authority to work railways and to run railway trains in the undertakers' discretion; ihence it is reasonable to infer that the Legislature, in using such general terms, and in authorizing for the undertakers' benefit what would otherwise be a nuisance, meant them to exercise their authority with reasonable care, and not without it.\nWhere statutory rights infringe upon what but for the statute would be the rights of other persons, they must be exercised reasonably, so as to do as little mischief as possible. The public are not compelled to suffer inconvenience which is not reasonably incident to the exercise of statutory powers: Southwark & Vauxhall Water Co. v Wandsworth Board of Works [32].\nThe common law rights of persons using highways are abrogated or subordinated only to the extent necessary to enable railway companies given crossing rights to exercise their statutory powers in a reasonable manner having regard to the purpose for which such powers are conferred : Roberts v. Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Rly. Co.[33].\nThe photographs in evidence and the testimony as to the motorman being unable, owing to the station built in the angle between the railway track and the highway and close to both, intercepting his view, to see approaching vehicular traffic on the highway until it was almost on the railway (the driver of the wagon probably could not see the coming car until his horses were actually on the rails) afford ground for thinking that the danger at the crossing now under consideration was exceptionally great. But this aspect of the case was not dwelt upon below and I allude to it chiefly to preclude the misapprehension that this judgment proceeds on the assumption that the \"Railway Act\" authorizes the running of trains at very high speed over every unprotected rural highway crossing, however exceptional the danger due to the surroundings. As Mr. Justice Sedgwick and Mr. Justice Davies both pointed out in the McKay case, at pp. 89 and 98, the provision made in Great Britain for the maintenance and operation of gates wherever a railway crosses a highway at the level is economically impracticable in Canada. In lieu of it Parliament has enacted that certain signals and warnings\u2014the blowing of a steam whistle and the ringing of a bell (\"Railway Act,\" section 274), and the erection of a painted signboard (section 243)\u2014should be substituted. The statutory authorization of running trains at a high and undoubtedly dangerous rate of speed when approaching and passing over highway level crossings, which would at common law be illegal and would render the company answerable for resultant injuries, must, I think, be taken to be conditional upon the company providing and utilizing the means of danger-warning substituted by the \"Railway Act\" for the impracticable gates, and also upon their complying with the explicit provisions of section 264 as to equipment with efficient brakes, which, of course, implies maintaining them in good working order. (No doubt for the protection of passengers and employees it is also a pre-requisite that the roadbed should be properly constructed and maintained.) Unless these requirements of the statute intended to lessen the danger inseparable from the running over unguarded highway level crossings at a high rate of speed are complied with, the statutory sanction, in my opinion, cannot be invoked, the common law standard of reasonableness applies, and running at a speed which, under all the circumstances, is unreasonable is unwarranted and amounts to negligence towards the public lawfully using such highways. For the safety of that public the statute prescribes that\nEvery locomotive shall be equipped and maintained with a bell of at least thirty pounds in weight and with a steam whistle (section 267),\nand that\nWhen any train is approaching a highway crossing at rail level, the engine whistle shall be sounded at least eighty rods before reaching such crossing, and the bell shall be rung continuously from the time of the sounding of the whistle until the engine has crossed such highway (274 (1)).\nAt every highway level crossing the company is required to maintain a sign-board with the words \"railway crossing\" printed on each side thereof in letters at least six inches high (section 243). This latter precaution is no doubt quite practicable in the case of electric tramlines or railways operating on private rights of way through rural districts. That it was not taken in the present case, as the photographs of the locus in evidence shew, affords an indication that the defendants did not consider the section prescribing it applicable to an electric tramway such as that which they operated. That is a more reasonable presumption than that they deliberately violated the statute. I am not, however, to be taken as holding that section 243 was not applicable. On the contrary I incline to think it was and that failure to comply with it would probably, without more, suffice to render the running of the tramcar at a dangerously high rate of speed when approaching and passing over the highway crossing, if otherwise justifiable, unlawful.\nBut an electric tramcar is neither a \"locomotive\" nor an \"engine\" within the meaning of sections 267 and 274 of the \"Railway Act.\" It is not equipped with the appliances for giving warning prescribed by section 267. Evidence to that effect was not given, it is true, but it is a matter of such common knowledge that it is a proper subject of judicial notice that the electric tramcar carries neither a steam whistle nor a \"bell of at least thirty pounds in weight,\" nor indeed any bell which can be \"rung;\" and it would indeed be startling to tramway companies were it held that the \"Railway Act\" imposes such an obligation. The compressed air whistle sometimes supplied and the ordinary foot-gong operated by the motorman, while reasonably sufficient as substitutes for giving warning at shorter distances of the approach of comparatively slow-moving tramcars, do not serve the same purpose as the steam whistle and the heavy locomotive bell; and it is scarcely practicable for a motorman, if properly attending to his other duties, to keep the footgong continuously sounding while traversing eighty rods before passing over every highway crossing. The sections of the \"Railway Act\" which prescribe these safeguards in lieu of the impracticable gates, equipment with and use of which are made conditions of the implied authorization to run at a high rate of speed over level highway crossings, were clearly not meant to apply to electric tramcars. The special provisions made for electric cars by secs. 277, 278 and 393(2) of the \"Railway Act\" tend to confirm this view. Moreover, the practical necessity, on which the implication of the right to run trains on steam railways over unprotected highway level crossings (where the statute or an order made under it has not prescribed a reduced speed) at the same high rate of speed as that maintained on the company's private right of way chiefly rests, does not exist in the operation of the ordinary electric tramcar, whose speed can be so readily reduced and so rapidly increased that it is quite practicable to exact that it shall approach and pass over these crossings at such moderate rate of speed as should commend itself to a court or jury as reasonable under all the circumstances. It follows that the \"Railway Act\" does not authorize the running of tramcars when approaching and passing over unprotected highway level crossings at a dangerously high rate of speed. In the absence of any maximum speed otherwise fixed by law for the operation of a tramcar when approaching and passing over such crossings the standard of reasonableness must govern, and any speed so great that the car is not under reasonable control, having regard to the circumstances, must be deemed unlawful.\nThe learned trial judge found\u2014in my opinion properly\u2014that the defendants' tramcar was running at an excessive rate of speed in approaching the crossing. He also found that there had been contributory negligence by the plaintiff's driver. He further found upon sufficient evidence that but for the disability created by the excessive and unreasonable rate of speed the motorman could have avoided the collision notwithstanding such contributory negligence. I am, with great respect, of the opinion that on these findings his conclusion that the defendant company was liable under the law as laid down in Loach v. B.C. Electric Railway Co. was sound and should not have been disturbed.\nBut I am also of the opinion that the learned judge's finding that it was not proved that an effect- tive brake would have enabled the motorman to avoid the collision cannot be sustained. This court is, no doubt, extremely loath to disturb such a finding when it has been affirmed by a provincial appellate court. In the present case, however, it seems to be quite clear that in the Court of Appeal there was a misapprehension of the evidence by the two learned judges who upheld this finding. Macdonald C.J.A. (with whom McPhillips J.A. concurred), assumed that the witness Andrews had said that with an efficient brake the motorman could have reduced the speed of the car to ten miles an hour \"at the time of impact.\" Now when the motorman saw the horses upon, or about to enter upon, the crossing, he was still 400 feet away. He says he immediately applied his brakes. His car was then running from 35 to 40 miles an hour. Andrews' testimony was that if going 40 miles an hour he could with brakes in good condition reduce the speed to 10 miles an hour within 200 feet. If so it would seem reasonable to infer that he could stop the car in the remaining 200 feet. The affirmance of the trial judge's finding in the Court of Appeal is therefore not entitled to the weight which must otherwise have been given to it. Indeed it would appear that the trial judge himself was probably under a similar misapprehension as to the effect of Andrews' testimony. Presumably referring to it, he says:\u2014\nI would not care to be in a wreck that was struck with a street car that size with the momentum it would have of a forty mile speed, and then getting down to ten miles. Surely it would kill your horses just the same.\nThere is no question of credibility involved. Under these circumstances I think we may treat the finding that an effective brake would not have enabled the motorman to avoid the collision, as open to review.\nHaving regard to the admittedly defective condition of the brake, to the fact that the point of impact of the car was between the horses and the wagon, to the evidence of the motorman that he \"did not want to bring the car up with a jar,\" that he \"could have stopped it in a shorter distance by throwing people off their seats,\" that \"after (he) hit\" he \"released the brakes to a certain extent to prevent a jar\nthrew off the reverse and eased off the brakes,\" and to the fact that even under these conditions the car stopped about 500 feet beyond the crossing, I think it is a reasonable and proper inference that had the brakes been in good condition and effectively applied the car would either have been stopped before reaching the crossing, or its speed would have been so reduced that the horses and wagon would have had time to clear it. An additional moment or two would have sufficed. It is not wholly without significance that in the Loach case\u2014of course it may have been on evidence somewhat different\u2014Lord Sumner said:\u2014\nif the brake had been in good order it should have stopped the car in 300 feet.\nMr. Justice Martin in the Court of Appeal has dealt satisfactorily with this aspect of the case and I agree with him that:\u2014\nOn the inference to be drawn from facts about which there is no real dispute the accident could have been avoided if the brake had been in good order.\nIf this conclusion be correct the present case falls directly within the decision in Loach's case. For the foregoing reasons I am with respect of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and that the judgment of the trial court should be restored.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below, and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.

The facts and the issues raised on the present appeal are fully stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. H. Ross K.C. for the appellant.\nClinton J. Ford for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur somewhat reluctantly in the conclusion reached by Sir L. Davies, and by my brother Anglin. My inclination would have been to include in the exemption the tracks running to the roundhouse and the other sidings used for ordinary terminal purposes. I defer, however, to what must be the better opinion of my brethren.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the District Court judge confirming the assessment made upon the lands of the appellant in the City of Calgary and occupied and used by them as terminals and station grounds.\nThe parcel of land in question consists of a large block situate almost in the heart of the city, and in near proximity to its business centre. It contains in all 25.5 acres of which quantity 3.64 acres are comprised in what was assessed as the \"roadway\" of the railway crossing, through this block or parcel of terminal lands.\nThis \"roadway\" was assessed separately at $1,000 per mile under section 3 of ch. 71 Consolidated Ordinances of the North West Territories, 1898.\nThis part of the assessment is not appealed against, the appeal being only as to the assessment of the remaining portion of the Terminal Block comprising 21.86 at $8,000 per acre.\nThe facts agreed to by the parties to the appeal were as follows:\u2014 1. The property which forms the subject matter of this appeal is the same property as is specified in the Order-in-Council dated the 27th day of January, 1914, which is, by agreement, made part of the record on appeal herein.\n2. The appellant purchased the land in pursuance of the Order-in-Council and has paid $125,000 on account thereof, being one-half the purchase price. The other half of the purchase price should have been paid in June, 1914, but by arrangement with the Dominion Government has been deferred upon the appellant paying interest on the unpaid balance.\nThe ordinance in question, upon the construction of which this appeal depends, is as follows:\u2014\n1. Every railway company whose railway is not exempt from taxation shall annually transmit on or before the first day of February to the secretary-treasurer of every municipality, and to the secretary or other officer of every public school district through which the company's railway may run, a statement to be signed by some authorized official of a company shewing:\u2014\n(1) The quantity of land other than the roadway owned or occupied by the company, which is liable to assessment.\n(2) The quantity of land occupied by the roadway.\n(3) Whether such statement on sec. 1 of this ordinance is placed in the hands of the assessor of any such municipality or school district or not, the assessor of every municipality or school district, as the case may be, shall assess the lands of such railway company and the roadway thereof, and the superstructure of such roadway, and give such notice as is required by sec. 2 hereof:\u2014Provided that the roadway and superstructure thereon shall not be assessed at a greater value than $1,000 per mile.\nThe evidence shewed that the assessor did not ascertain the number of miles of trackage laid down upon the terminal grounds, and the area of land necessary for the proper usage of such trackage lines to roundhouses, warehouses, etc., and assess such area on the basis of $1,000 per mile of trackage or other mileage rate, but that he assessed a 100-foot strip as shewn on the location plan and that strip only on the basis of $1,000 per mile. That strip contained 3.64 acres. Another 100-foot strip, running from the eastern boundary of the terminals property to the turntable, comprises an area of 3.64 acres, and is in actual use and still another strip running from the eastern boundary of the property to the station comprises an area of 4,08 acres.\nThe whole block of 25.5 acres had been purchased from the Crown in right of the Dominion for the sum of $250,000. of which $125,000 had been paid, and the remainder was still unpaid. The legal title still remains in the Crown, but the Grand Trunk Pacific Company is the equitable owner and the actual occupant.\nIts liability, therefore; to be assessed as such equitable owner and actual occupant is under the decisions of this Court unquestionable. See Calgary and Edmonton Land Co. v. Attorney-General, of Alberta[1]; Smith v. Vermillion Hills[2], affirmed on appeal to Privy Council[3]; and Southern Alberta Land Co. v. McLean[4].\nThe contention therefore of the appellant that the assessment is void, because it does not assess the interest of the railway company apart from that of the Crown, and that the two interests cannot be separated must fail. The company is properly assessed as the equitable owner and the actual occupant of the land, and there is nothing to warrant a suggestion that any interest of the Crown has been assessed.\nThe other contention of the appellant that none of the land in question should be assessed as acreage, but only on a mileage basis reckoned, \"(a) on the distance across the property from east to west; or (b) on the number of miles of trackage laid on the land; or (c) on the number of miles of trackage laid or proposed to be laid on the land\" need, in my judgment, only be mentioned to be dismissed. They practically amount to total exemption of the whole block of 25.5 acres, from the assessment on an acreage basis, and affirm that it all should be assessed on the mileage basis reckoned on one or more of the three plans or bases above mentioned.\nThe appellants also contended that if the above contentions were rejected, the 4.08 acres comprised in a 100 foot strip of the rail track, running from the eastern extremity of the property to the station, and the 3.64 acres on which the track to the turntable runs, should not be assessed as acreage but only on a mileage basis.\nThere is much to be said for each and both of these contentions. I have considered carefully alike the English and American cases on this important question of railway taxation which were called to our attention. They are, in a sense, valuable as shewing the view the respective courts took upon the particular statutes authorizing the assessments they were dealing with.\nThe divergent views expressed in several of the American cases are not surprising when the different language of the statutes is considered.\nWe must, of course, be guided by the language of the North West Territories Ordinance above quoted, and the question in this appeal in the last analysis is reduced to this: What is the meaning and extent of the words used in that ordinance\u2014\"The roadway thereof and the superstructure thereon?\"\nI agree with the meaning put upon the word \"superstructure\" by. Mr. Justice Scott in In re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and Town of Macleod[5], where, at p. 197, he says:\u2014\nI am of the opinion that the word \"superstructure\" as it is used therein is intended to mean and include only the superstructure constituting the line of railway, and that it is not intended to include, and does not include, any buildings or structures upon or adjoining the line of railway which, though used for railway purposes alone, form no part of that line of railway. In this view the term would include the ties, rails, turntables, bridges, culverts, etc., and (following the principle laid down in South Wales Rly. Co. v. Swansea Local Board[6], it would also include railway platforms, but it would not include station or office buildings, warehouses, storehouses, or dwellings or lodging houses for employees of the railway. Neither would it, in my opinion, include roundhouses.\nI do not wish to be understood in adopting this meaning of the word \"superstructure\" to include turntables, and confess I cannot understand why the learned judge did include them.\nI will not attempt any definition of the word \"roadway\" or what it comprises. I think to a large extent it is a question of fact to be decided in each case.\nIn the case before us the line of railway track forks as it enters the block of 25 acres of land in question, one fork running to the general station at the southwestern corner of the block of land, and the other fork continuing on in a westerly direction through the city.\nI am of the opinion that the contention of the appellant is right as to this track to the station being part of the \"roadway\" and not being assessable as acreage, but on a mileage basis. I cannot see on what reasonable ground it can be excluded, and held not to be part of the roadway. It is the track which conveys all passenger traffic to and from Calgary. I would accept the evidence of Graves, the engineer of the Grand Trunk Pacific Company, as to the necessary width of the roadway. He says:\u2014\nThe necessary area you have to have each side of your lead track or your yard tracks, whichever it is, I have figured it here about twenty feet outside of the track.\nI understand the acreage comprised in that strip would amount to 4.08 acres, which, in my opinion, has been wrongly assessed on the acreage basis. I do not accept the contention of the appellant as to the tracks running to the roundhouse being similarly treated, or the other sidings on this block of land which are being used for ordinary railway terminal purposes.\nThe result, in my opinion, is that the judgment below should be varied by substituting the assessed value of the roadway or line to the station upon a mileage basis of $1,000 a mile, instead of an acreage basis of $8,000 an acre at which it has been assessed, and that such judgment should otherwise be confirmed; the Registrar will make the necessary calculations.\nAs the area of this part of the roadway comprises 4.08 acres, and the plans filed shew its mileage, there should be no difficulty in making the necessary variation in the judgment by substituting the mileage assessment under the ordinance for the acreage assessment adopted by the judgment appealed from of this line to the station.\nThere should be no costs, as the appellant, in my view, obtains a small, though a material, modification of the judgment appealed from.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal raises the puzzling question of what is the meaning of that part of the provision in ch. 71, C.O. of the Territories, 1898, intituled \"An Ordinance respecting the Assessment of Railways,\" which reads as follows:\u2014\nProvided that the roadway and superstructure thereon shall not be assessed at a greater value than $1,000 per mile, C.O.C. 71, s. 3.\nThe appellant has been assessed for some 25.5 acres of land in Calgary, of which a strip of a hundred feet wide has been assessed on the basis of $1,000 a mile, and the remainder at $8,000 an acre.\nThe strip of a hundred feet wide is supposed to represent the roadway within the meaning of the words of the provision just quoted.\nThe Railway Act of Canada then in force, which would seem to be the only one the North West Council could have had in view in enacting as above, provided for railway companies taking for use of railways a width of thirty-three yards, which at stations could be increased to one hundred yards for the length of six hundred and fifty yards. And I imagine such spaces were what the legislation in question probably had in view.\nI further imagine they had a wider vision of things than the view which the assessor stands for in his long narrow strip of unvarying width, and that the valuation of $1,000 a mile was intended to cover the varying or various widths so used for the railway.\nThe nearest I can approach that which was intended to be thus comprehended seems to be to allow the acreage of trackage and superstructure of any kind in use for actual running of the railway, at the point now in question as covered by this low but fixed value, to be applied for assessment purposes.\nI would exclude from the benefit thereof, land not in use, but held for prospective use.\nThere is no principle to guide us in the interpretation of this Act.\nA mere arbitrary value is fixed for what common knowledge tells us is probably worth ten times the value fixed.\nRoughly speaking the land taken is possibly now, in fact, of the value which was then arbitrarily or as matter of expediency, universally fixed for each twelve acres, yet I imagine far beyond what it was generally speaking likely to be worth at the time of the enactment. I cannot hold roadbed and roadway as interchangeable terms in this connection. Nobody ever dreamt of assessing the land alongside the actual roadbed within the lines of the right of way.\nNor can I adopt the words \"right of way\" as convertible into the word \"roadway.\"\nNor can I imagine that the universal exemption of highways from taxation, as we find them now without private ownership, is to be taken as a guide.\nThe most ardent advocate of the single tax principle, which is possibly right, would not think of taxing such a highway. Then why a railway should be taxed no doubt puzzled some people, and why it should be exempt puzzled more, and hence a mere arbitrary expedient or compromise was resorted to and we have to make the best of the curiosity.\nI understood in argument ten acres would cover what I indicate as reasonable interpretation of what is presented.\nIn other words, seven acres more than the assessor allowed should come under the statutory valuation.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed by the reduction of the assessment by $56,000. I doubt if costs should be allowed either party.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have not been able to arrive at a conclusion entirety satisfactory to my own mind in this appeal, but on the whole I think the balance of argument inclines in favour of the view that \"roadway\" means the continuous strip commonly known as the \"right of way.\"\nIn this view the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Davies. BRODEUR J.\u2014The questions at issue in this appeal are:\u2014(1) Whether the yards of the appellant company in the limits of the city of Calgary are liable to taxation; (2) If they are liable to taxation, whether they should be assessed on the mileage or acreage basis.\nOn the first point, the appellant claims that the property belongs to the Crown in right of the Dominion, and that under the provisions of the \"B.N.A. Act\" those lands cannot be taxed.\nThe appellant has purchased from the Dominion Government the lands in question and, as the purchase price has not been entirely paid, the legal title is still in the Crown; but the property has been occupied by the appellant company, which has in the lands such interest, as may be assessed, and taxed. It does not appear that any attempt has been made to assess the interest of the Crown in respect of those lands, and it has been decided by this Court in the following cases: Calgary and Edmonton Land Co. v. Attorney-General of Alberta[7], Smith v. Vermillion Hills[8], affirmed on appeal to the Privy Council[9], and in McLean v. South Alberta Land Co.[10], that the provincial legislature could authorize the assessment of a person in respect of his occupation of lands of which the bare legal estate is vested in the Crown.\nApplying those decisions to the present case, I see that we have nothing before us to shew that the appellant is assessed for the interest of the Crown in the said land; but that assessment simply covers the interest which the appellant company possesses.\nOn the second point raised by the appellant, viz., that the assessment should be made on the mileage basis, we have to examine and to construe the provisions of the Ordinance respecting the assessment of railways, ch. 71, \"Territories' Act, 1898.\"\nBy the provisions of that Act, the railway companies are bound to give to every municipality an annual statement shewing\u2014\n1st, the quantity of land other than roadway owned or occupied by the company which is liable to assessment, and 2nd, the quantity of land occupied by the roadway;\nand then the assessor of the municipality assesses the lands of those railway companies, and the roadway and the superstructure; and the Ordinance contains a proviso that\nthe roadway and superstructure thereon shall not be assessed at greater value than $1,000 per mile.\nAs we see, there is a distinction between the assessment to be placed on the land of a railway company and on its roadbed.\nThe appellant contends that the roadway would include, not only the one hundred feet right of way mentioned in the \"Railway Act,\" sec. 177, but would include also the land used for sidings, station grounds, yards, freight tracks, freight sheds, turntables, etc., in other words, everything that goes to make up what is strictly railway property.\nOn the other hand, the City of Calgary contends that the property of a railway company to be assessed on a mileage basis should include simply the right of way.\nThe word \"roadway\" in the North West Territories Ordinance is not defined, and it is not defined either in the \"Railway Act.\" Section 177, however, of the \"Railway Act\" determines what constitutes the right of way, and what property could be acquired by a railway for works, for stations, yards, warehouses, etc. For the right of way proper, 100 feet in breadth is generally allowed to be taken by the railway company, In cases, however, where land should be required for stations, depots and yards, one mile in length by 500 in breadth, including the width of the right of way, could be taken.\nThese provisions of the \"Railway Act,\" and that determination of what is the right of way should help us in determining what the North West Legislature intended when it spoke of the roadway.\nI think that the term \"roadway\" should be applied to that part of the railway leading from one place to another, and should include the whole right of way where it is used for no other purpose than as a right of way for the railway track. It would not include the yards and the stations, and when the statute speaks of superstructure, it refers, in my opinion, not to the buildings which could be erected, but to the ties and the rails which constitute the railway property.\nBouvier in his dictionary says that the roadway is the right of way which has been held to be the property liable to taxation. That is the interpretation which has been generally accepted in the North West, and which was made the subject of several decisions, viz., in the cases of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and MacLeod[11], at p. 197; In re Edmonton and Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[12], Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. City of Edmonton.[13].\nI would therefore consider that the assessment made upon the property occupied by the appellant was a proper assessment and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\n[1] 45 Can.

S. MacDonald K.C. for the appellant.\nSampson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellant was not charged with having, when examined as a witness before the Commission appointed by the Legislative Assembly, denied the receipt by him of a cheque for $4,000 signed by one Brunner. The charge in the indictment is that Clayton Peterson swore he \"did not get from Frank Brunner a cheque for four thousand dollars.\" Examined as a witness at the trial, the appellant maintained his position. Brunner, on the other hand, swore that he did give the accused the cheque. In these circumstances, one Smith, a bank manager, was examined to prove that he cashed for Peterson a cheque of Brunner for $4,000. That evidence was clearly admissible to prove the possession by Peterson of the cheque in question, which was a fact tending to corroborate in a material particular the actual delivery of the cheque by Brunner to Peterson and that is the gravamen of the perjury charge. Corroboration may result from any evidence which tends to give certainty to the contention in support of which it is advanced. Although the fact that A. is found in possession of B's cheque may not be absolute corroboration of the statement that B. gave A. the cheque, that possession being consistent with the possession obtained otherwise than through B., considered in connection with all the other evidence, the fact of possession may help the jury to come to a conclusion as to the truth or falsity of the statement. I am disposed to think that, although the judge's charge might have been more explicit, the jury could reasonably come to the conclusion they reached and there was no mistrial.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The sole question in this criminal appeal is whether the evidence of Frank Brunner, who testified that he had given to the appellant a cheque for $4,000 for or upon account of the Licensed Victuallers Association, was\ncorroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused\nas required by section 1002 of the Criminal Code. The case reserved for the opinion of the court by the trial judge states that\nThe accused was convicted of perjury for swearing that \"he did not get from Frank Brunner a cheque for four thousand dollars upon the Licensed Victuallers Association.\"\nBrunner swore that he gave the cheque in question to the accused. The only corroborative evidence was that of Smith, the manager of the Bank of Ottawa, who swore that he cashed the cheque for Peterson.\nThe cheque in question was not Brunner's cheque, but the cheque of the Licensed Victuallers Association, and was signed by Brunner, as treasurer, and one Wilson, the secretary of that Association. Under these circumstances, is the fact that Peterson had this cheque in his possession corroborative evidence that it was given to him by Brunner?\nA majority of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan held that it was, and I agree with them.\nIn his evidence, Peterson testified, not only that he did not get the $4,000 cheque from Brunner, but that he did not get such a cheque at all or any money, except about $200.\nI agree with Chief Justice Haultain that this clear and unequivocal statement by Peterson excludes the theory or inference advanced in argument that he might have got the cheque from some one else than Brunner.\nThis being so, Smith the bank manager's evidence must be held to be corroborative of Brunner's statement that he gave the cheque in question to Peterson.\nSmith swears he received the $4,000 cheque of the Licensed Victuallers Association from Peterson on the 13th December, 1913 (the day Brunner says he gave it to Peterson), and cashed it for him.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the evidence of Brunner that he gave appellant the cheque in question was, in the language of section 1002 of the Criminal Code, \"corroborated in some material particular * * * implicating the accused\" by the evidence of Smith, the manager of the bank, that on the same day on which the cheque was dated and alleged to have been given, the appellant was in possession thereof and that it was cashed by him.\nI therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014The question presented by this appeal as argued before us is really an academic question, because the argument very largely proceeded upon an abstract from the facts, not by any means presenting the full force of the case made by the Crown. The facts I am about to state in themselves shew the contention of the appellant to be beyond the pale of argument.\nAt a meeting of the executive committee of the Licensed Victuallers' Association in Regina, it was arranged that the appellant Peterson was to use money in connection with the Association's opposition to a bill then before the legislature of Saskatchewan, and the appellant and one Brunner, who was the treasurer of the Association, were authorized to employ the funds of the Association for that purpose. The occurrences at this meeting were proved by the evidence of the witness, George Sharpe. Brunner's evidence is explicit to the effect that on December 13th, 1913, he gave Peterson a cheque for $4,000, a cheque of the Licensed Victuallers' Association, signed by Brunner as treasurer, and by another officer of the Association; and Smith, the bank manager, proves by his evidence that on the same day a cheque answering the description of that which Brunner says he gave the appellant was cashed by the appellant. The evidence of the appellant, upon which the charge is based, was to the effect that he \"did not get from Frank Brunner a cheque for $4,000 upon the account of the Licensed Victuallers' Association.\" The ground of appeal is alleged non-compliance with the condition of section 1002 of the Criminal Code, which prescribes that upon a charge of perjury, the accused shall not be convicted on the evidence of one witness\nunless such witness is corroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused.\nIt appears to me, as I have already said, that in view of the evidence of Sharp and Smith the contention is not seriously arguable. The principle to be applied is stated by Mr. Justice Wightman in Reg. v. Boyes[1], at p. 320.\nIt is not necessary that there should be corroborative evidence as to the very fact, it is enough that there should be such as would confirm the jury in the belief that the accomplice is speaking the truth.\nIn the circumstances mentioned, Brunner's official position as treasurer of the Association, the authority given by the Association to Peterson and Brunner jointly to employ the funds of the Association, the fact relied upon as corroborative evidence that on the very day on which Brunner says he gave the cheque to Peterson, Peterson had such a cheque and cashed it affords, it appears to me, superabundant corroboration within the requirements of section 1002.\nAnglin J.\u2014The question on this appeal is whether there was any evidence proper to be submitted to a jury as corroboration of the testimony of Frank Brunner that he had given to the appellant Peterson a cheque for $4,000 upon the account of the Licensed Victuallers Association. Section 1002 of the Criminal Code prescribes that upon an accusation for perjury the accused shall not be convicted upon the evidence of one witness unless such witness is corroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused.\nThe appellant was charged with having committed perjury in swearing that he\ndid not get from Frank Brunner a cheque for $4,000 upon the account of the Licensed Victuallers Association.\nThe corroboration relied on by the Crown was the testimony of Mr. Smith, manager of the Bank of Ottawa, that the appellant had brought to his bank, on the same day on which Brunner swore that he had given it to him, a cheque for $4,000 on the account of the Licensed Victuallers Association, and that this cheque was cashed and its proceeds handed to the appellant. In my opinion, the facts deposed to by Smith, that on the very day on which Brunner swore he had given Peterson the cheque, the latter was in possession of it and cashed it, was evidence implicating the accused, which the learned trial judge could not properly have withdrawn from the jury as corroborative in material particulars of the testimony of Brunner, within the meaning of section 1002 of the Code. The weight to be attached to it was, of course, entirely for the jury to determine. But that it might confirm the jury in the belief that Brunner was speaking the truth, seems to me not to admit of question; Reg. v. Boyes[2]; Rex. v. Daun[3]; Rex v. Scheller[4]; Radford v. Macdonald[5].\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 1 B. & S. 311.\n[2] 1 B. & S. 311, 320.\n[3] 12 Ont. L.R. 227.\n[4] 23 Can. Cr. C. 1; 16 D.L.R. 462.\n[5] 18 Ont. App. R. 167.\n"

The circumstances in which the action was instituted and the questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nN. K. Laflamme K.C. and A. Lefebvre for the appellant.\nJ. L. Perron K.C. and Paul St. Germain K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice. (dissenting)\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014The facts, found by the learned trial judge that appellant suffered very serious injuries from an electric current conveyed from an electric lighting plant in respondent town, by means of and by reason of another electric plant's wires unused and out of order having been long tolerated by the respondent on the streets of said town, are not seriously denied.\nThe first named plant was used for lighting the town and had been erected pursuant to a franchise granted by respondent.\nThe owners of the secondly named plant had never got authority from any one entitled to give it, but by dint of sheer audacity against which the respondent had formally protested, proceeded to erect poles and wires upon the streets of the town where, connected with the former plant, there had already been erected poles and wires.\nThe two sets of wires came dangerously close together from the time the second was erected, and as the result of neglect the latter got out of order and in places somewhat delapidated, and very obviously a serious source of danger to those using the highway, as well as others who might be placed near thereto, as appellant was, when he came in contact with something liable to conduct the current of electricity in use by those operating the first named plant.\nThis constituted in my opinion a public nuisance upon the highway, which was, as such, under the usual jurisdiction of respondent. But the respondent actually owned the road allowance over which, at that part in question, the highway ran.\nMuch elaboration in argument is submitted to support the propositions that the toleration of such a public nuisance by respondent was legal, or at least not a breach of duty, and in any event that its failure to use such powers as it had for the abatement thereof, was a mere omission of the observance of duty and hence not actionable.\nIf the like accident to that in question had happened, as it well might have done, to a traveller on the highway, could respondent have set up the answer put forward herein of the breach of duty being an omission and not a commission?\nThe duty imposed to maintain the highway in a travellable condition would have been the answer.\nThe appellant cannot avail himself of that, I imagine, in respect of the lane.\nThe very undesirable distinction that has grown up in our English law between nonfeasance and malfeasance, on the part of municipal corporations, when it comes to deciding a question of their legal responsibility to those suffering injury, as the result of either, does not seem to me to have so much room for expansion in Quebec if due heed is had to article 1053 and following of the Code.\nBe that as it may, I cannot think that under either system of law the owner of any property\u2014as respondent was of that in question\u2014can legally tolerate upon his premises a nuisance obviously liable to produce injury to the person or property of another in the vicinity.\nThat is what respondent clearly was guilty of in relation to the secondly named electric plant being, without the first vestige of legal right, allowed so long to continue in the condition it was and constitute such a nuisance.\nI suppose if the same audacious and venturesome spirit as had conceived this enterprise had discovered in the road allowance, owned by the respondent, an excellent specimen of stone and proceeded to quarry it and blasted therein, as a free miner might, from day to day and been enabled by smooth talk to set the council and others to sleep, we would be told, if some neighbour got injured by the flying rocks and sought a remedy against the respondent, that the sleeping officials had never authorized it and hence it was all a matter of omission and the law had no remedy to apply.\nI do not think that is the law. I doubt if any one would contend in such a case, that it is. That thing would be too noisy. Electricity moving silently and unobtrusively does not seem to be so effective in rousing the average sleepy official.\nEach operation under the circumstances would constitute a nuisance. I cannot in principle distinguish the two cases. The one man would suffer from a shower of flying rocks, and the appellant did suffer from a current of two thousand volts of electricity producing disastrous results.\nThe article 5641 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, referred in argument, standing by itself might not avail much; behind that there is a legal principle which is represented by the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas.\nThat article and others gave ample powers to the respondent, if it had seen fit, to use them to have put an end to the wretched condition of things that existed upon property it owned.\nIndeed the lawlessness was tolerated when those daring to enter and dig up the streets for their own purposes ought to have been promptly suppressed by an able-bodied constable when mild and courteous protests were of no avail.\nDr. Ricard as a private citizen, owning a franchise, had no other resort than tedious litigation. It was otherwise with respondent that was liable to have been indicted for the continuance of such a nuisance.\nThe gist of the whole matter is that the respondent alone could have suppressed or abated the nuisance, though a private citizen could not unless he chose to prefer an indictment.\nIt was just as much at fault as the owner of a falling house and for the like reason as prevails in law in the case of such a house out of repair falling on the neighbour or his property when he, owning such a nuisance, who alone could have averted the loss caused by its fall is held liable.\nI am sorry to hear it said that people using the protest form of expressing resentment had no means of knowledge of what they were about. It was an obvious duty under such circumstances as evoked the protest and mild submissions to justice in years of continuous litigation about the very thing that is now in question to have known a great deal more than the respondent pretends to have known and the law will impute that knowledge to it.\nAs to the want of notice of action, I think it was sufficient and the judge's discretion as to its not having been served within the delay mentioned in the statute was properly exercised under the circumstances.\nThe entire object of such a notice being required by the statute is to avoid stale demands being put forward and to enable the corporation blamed to investigate whilst the facts are present to the minds of those concerned or likely to know the facts.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Brodeur.\nAnglin J.\u2014On the facts in evidence I should certainly not be prepared to find that there had been any negligence on the part of the unfortunate plaintiff. Neither do I think that the learned trial judge erroneously exercised in his favour the discretion conferred by Art. 5864 R.S.Q. to excuse the giving of the notice which it prescribed when it is proved that the giving of it was prevented\nby irresistible force or for any other reason deemed valid by the court or a judge.\nThe narrow construction which has been put upon a corresponding clause of the Ontario municipal law does not commend itself to me as so satisfactory that I would hold that the application of the exonerating provision of the Quebec statute, different in its terms and somewhat more elastic, should be equally restricted.\nAlthough convinced that the plaintiff is deserving of sympathy, I know of no legal duty owed to him which the defendant municipality has failed to discharge, breach of which would amount to actionable fault. The granting of a municipal franchise to Dr. Ricard to construct and operate an electric lighting system in the town and to use its highways for that purpose and the recognition of the Phoenix Syndicate as transferee of his rights were admittedly within the statutory powers of the respondent corporation. Its position in regard to third parties injured in the course of the construction or operation of the system for which the franchise was so given was at least as favourable as it would have been had the works been constructed and operated for it by an independent contractor. Whatever its liability might be for injury caused by a danger inherent in the undertaking made the subject of such a contract, as owner it would not be answerable for the effects of collateral negligence on the part of its contractor. The injury sustained by the plaintiff was clearly due to negligence of that kind.\nThe granting of a franchise, such as was given to Dr. Ricard, does not entail upon a municipal corporation granting it a duty of supervision of the construction or the operation of the works authorized by the franchise. The powers conferred by paragraphs 11, 12 and 16 of Art. 5641 R.S.Q. are clearly legislative or governmental and injury resulting from a failure to exercise them does not give rise to a right of action except where specifically so provided. The liability of the municipality for the bad state of roads, streets, avenues, etc., declared by clause 11, does not cover such a case as this. Clause 16 is more directly applicable, if the Phoenix Syndicate's installation is not taken out of its operation by the saving of existing rights in clause 12. Clause 12 was enacted only in 1903 and was probably inapplicable to the exercise of the franchise powers conferred on Dr. Ricard in 1901 and by him transferred to the Phoenix Syndicate. If applicable, the power conferred by clause 16 is a governmental power to pass by-laws and failure to exercise it, in the absence of specific provision to that effect, cannot form the basis of a right of action.\nBut it is said that liability of the municipality to the plaintiff arose from a failure to fulfil the duty of keeping its highways free from nuisances and from the presence thereon of things which from their nature or their situation or both were a source of danger. This duty is said to exist both at common law and by virtue of the statutory provision of Art. 5641 R.S.Q., s. 11, already referred to. Any such duty, in my opinion, however, is owed only to persons using the highways\u2014 not to ratepayers or others upon or in occupation of private properties. Had the plaintiff been injured while travelling upon or otherwise lawfully using the highway, it is quite possible that he would have had a good cause of action either under the statute or at common law. But I know of no principle of law upon which a municipal corporation, because it grants a franchise authorized by statute, can be held answerable in damages for an injury sustained by an individual on his own property ascribable to negligence in the carrying out of the undertaking for which such franchise has been given. I do not wish to be understood as expressing the opinion that an injury so sustained would give a cause of action against the municipality if ascribable not to negligence in carrying on the undertaking but to danger inherent therein. That question is not before us and there would seem to be not a little to be said for the view that the statutory authorization of the grant of the franchise implies immunity of the municipal corporation from liability even for injury attributable to a danger inseparable from the undertaking. Brodeur J.\u2014 Nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider en cette cause si la municipalit\u00e9 intim\u00e9e est responsable de l'accident dont le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. Le question pr\u00e9sente beaucoup d'int\u00e9r\u00eat au point de vue de la responsabilit\u00e9 des municipalit\u00e9s. Voici, en deux mots, les faits de la cause:\nEn 1901, la ville de Grand 'M\u00eare a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 Ricard le privil\u00e8ge de fournir l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 aux contribuables et \u00e0 cette fin d'\u00e9riger des poteaux dans les rues et d'y poser des fils \u00e9lectriques.\nPlus tard, savoir le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1905, le gouvernement provincial a accord\u00e9 une charte \u00e0 une compagnie appel\u00e9e \"La Compagnie Electrique de Grand'M\u00eare\" et lui a donn\u00e9 le pouvoir de fournir l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 dans diff\u00e9rentes municipalit\u00e9s, y compris celle de Grand' M\u00eare. Mais, en outre, de cela, il lui a donn\u00e9 le pouvoir, en autant que la ville de Grand'M\u00eare \u00e9tait concern\u00e9e,\nde passer partout ou il sera n\u00e9cessaire et sans autre autorisation que celle r\u00e9sultant des lettres patentes de la dite compagnie dans les, sous les, et au-dessus des chemins et places publiques, rues et ruelles de la dite ville de Grand' M\u00eare.\nArm\u00e9e de cette charte, la Compagnie Electrique de Grand'M\u00eare est venue poser des poteaux dans les rues de la ville et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 y installer ses fils \u00e9lectriques. La municipalit\u00e9 protesta contre cette action de la compagnie; mais celle ci se r\u00e9clame d'y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par le gouvernement provincial. Une action est prise par le concessionnaire du privil\u00e8ge exclusif, Ricard, pour faire enlever les poteaux et les fils de la Compagnie Electrique de Grand'M\u00eare et la corporation de la ville est mise en cause dans cette poursuite.\nParmi les questions qui one \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans cette action \u00e9tait celle de savoir si la charte du gouvernement provincial donnait \u00e0 la compagnie \u00e9lectrique le droit d'installer son syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectrique dans la ville de Grand'M\u00eare \u00e9tait valable. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a, par une injonction interlocutoire, d\u00e9fendu \u00e0 la Compagnie Electrique de Grand'M\u00eare de continuer ses op\u00e9rations dans la ville; et la proc\u00e8s s'est continu\u00e9 pour faire d\u00e9cider d\u00e9finitivement cette question.\nPendant que le proc\u00e8s se faisait, les fils \u00e9lectriques des deux compagnies sont venus un jour en contact et le demandeur, qui se trouvait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 d'un fil de La Compagnie Electrique de Grand'M\u00eare, fut frapp\u00e9 et bless\u00e9. De l\u00e0 action contre les deux compagnies \u00e9lectriques et contre la municipalit\u00e9.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a donn\u00e9 gain de cause au demandeur contre la municipalit\u00e9; mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9, en tant que le municipalit\u00e9 \u00e9tait concern\u00e9e, par la Cour d'Appel.\nIl s'agit de savoir si la municipalit\u00e9 est responsable.\nPar l'article 1053 du Code Civil, on peut \u00eatre tenu responsable du dommage qu'on cause par sa faute \u00e0 autrui, soit par son fait, soit par n\u00e9gligence, imprudence ou inhabilit\u00e9.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que la corporation municipale de Grand'M\u00eare a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligente parce qu'\u00e9tant propri\u00e9taire des rues, elle devait voir \u00e0 ce qu'il ne s'y fit pas de nuisances ou \u00e0 les en faire dispara\u00eetre. On pr\u00e9tend qu'elle aurait d\u00fb faire enlever les fils de la compagnie \u00e9lectrique qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s l\u00e0 ill\u00e9galement.\nIl me para\u00eet bien certain\u2014et c'est admis aujourd'hui par les parties en cause\u2014que le gouvernement provincial avait le droit de permettre \u00e0 une compagnie d'aller poser ses fils \u00e9lectriques dans les rues de la ville. Il n'aurait, tout de m\u00eame, peut \u00eatre pas \u00eat\u00e9 sage pour la corporation de faire enlever ces fils \u00e9lectriques par ses propres officiers sans autorit\u00e9 de justice. La question est alors soumise aux tribunaux par une poursuite dirig\u00e9e par Ricard. La corporation est mise en cause ensuite au proc\u00e8s. Il est bien vrai qu'elle ne prend pas de conclusions elle-m\u00eame et qu'elle s'en rapporte \u00e0 la justice. Mais \u00e0 quoi bon multiplier les frais en soulevant elle-m\u00eame le point lorsque l'une des parties dans la cause all\u00e8gue que ce privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 par le gouvernement provincial \u00e9tait absolument nul? On ne peut done pas, suivant moi, pr\u00e9tendre qu'il y a eu l\u00e0 n\u00e9gligence de la part de le corporation, n\u00e9gligence telle que sa responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00fbt en \u00eatre affect\u00e9e.\nMaintenant, quelle est la responsabilit\u00e9 d'une corporation municipale de ville au sujet des rues? Cette responsabilit\u00e9 est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par l'article 5641, sous-section 11, des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec 1909. Cet article donne au conseil le droit de\nfaire, amender et abroger des r\u00e8glements :\n11. Pour r\u00e9glementer l'usage des rues, all\u00e9es, avenues, ponts, ponceaux, terrains publics, places publiques, pavages, trottoirs, traverses, gouttieres, eaux et cours d'eau municipaux, et pour emp\u00eacher et faire cesser tout empi\u00e8tement dans les, sur les, et au-dessus des rues, all\u00e9es, avenues, terrains publics, places publiques et cours d'eau municipaux, et pour emp\u00eacher aussi qu'ils ne soient endommag\u00e9s ou que Ton en fasse un mauvais usage;\u2014la municipalit\u00e9 \u00e9tant responsable du mauvais \u00e9tat de ces rues, all\u00e9es, avenues, ponts, ponceaux, terrains publics et places publiques, pavages, trottoirs, traverses, gouttieres, eaux et cours d'eaux municipaux;\nLa derni\u00e8re partie de cette sous-section d\u00e9clare donc que la municipalit\u00e9 sera responsable du bon entretien des chemins.\nQuelle est l'\u00e9tendue de cette responsabilit\u00e9? C'est qu'elle doit voir \u00e0 ce que les chemins soient toujours dans un \u00e9tat qui puisse permettre au public de circular sans danger.\nIl n'y avait, dans le cas actuel, aucun obstacle dans le chemin lui-m\u00eame qui pouvait affecter la circulation du public; mais les deux compagnies \u00e9lectriques avaient plac\u00e9 des poteaux et des fils. L'une avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par la municipalit\u00e9, l'autre par le gouvernement provincial.\nCes deux compagnies \u00e9taient \u00e0 se battre devant les tribunaux pour faire d\u00e9cider de leurs droits respectifs et notamment pour faire d\u00e9cider si le gouvernement pouvait accorder les pouvoirs qu'il avait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie. Le proc\u00e8s s'instruit. Pendant ce temps-l\u00e0, est-ce que la corporation aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 justifiable d'enlever les poteaux de la Compagnie Electrique de Grand'M\u00eare? Evidemment non.\nIl est possible que les fils de ces deux compagnies fussent plac\u00e9s trop pr\u00e8s l'un de l'autre. Mais comment la corporation pouvait-elle \u00eatre responsable de cela sous les dispositions de la sous-section 11? Je ne crois pas que la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e par le loi couvre un cas comme celui que nous avons \u00e0 examiner dans cette cause-ci.\nJe consid\u00e8re donc que la corporation municipale n'\u00e9tait pas en faute et qu'elle n'a pas engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9. Une municipalit\u00e9, qui a le droit d'adopter des r\u00e8glements, n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement responsable, si elle n'adopte pas ces r\u00e8glements-l\u00e0. Ce sont des questions de discr\u00e9tion qui ne sauraient engager sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nTiedeman on municipal corporations dit (p.328):\nNot only are municipal corporations exempt from liability for the non-performance of public, or discretionary duties; but they are likewise exempt from liability from consequences, when they in good faith exercise such powers.\nLe jugement de la Cour d'appel doit \u00eatre confirn\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Arthur Lefebvre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: St. Germain, Guerin & Raymond.\n[1] Q.R. 25 K.B. 124.\n"

[1906] c. 155, s. 32. B. was extradited to Canada from the United States on a charge of fraud by instigating the publication in a newspaper, the News-Telegram, of a false statement that oil had been struck in a well in which he was interested. He was convicted in Canada of the offence of fraud in concurring in the publication of the same false statement in another newspaper no mention of which was made in the proceedings before the Extradition Commissioner.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that B. was convicted for an offence other than the one on which the warrant for extradition issued and the conviction should be quashed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], confirming, by an equal division of opinion, the conviction of the appellant by the trial judge.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nA. A. McGillivray for the appellant.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and G. G. Hyde for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts of this case are fully set out by my brothers Duff and Anglin. To avoid a wearisome repetition, I refer to their opinions. There can, of course, be no doubt, that, under the Treaty with the United States, a fugitive criminal may not be committed for extradition,\nexcept upon such evidence of criminality as according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offence had been there committed.\nIt is equally certain that the person surrendered shall not be triable for any offence other than the offence for which he was surrendered, until he shall have an opportunity of returning to the country by which he was surrendered.\nThe nature of the offence for which the accused was extradited must therefore be gathered from the warrant and the depositions filed before the extradition commissioner, and those depositions must disclose the facts which, according to the laws of the place where the person charged is found, amount to the crime for which he is subsequently tried. I was at first disposed to hold that the indictment on which the accused was tried, being drafted in the very terms of the information upon which he had been committed by the police magistrate and subsequently held for extradition, it was impossible to say that he was tried for an offence different from that for which he was extradited. But, having looked at the case of Reg. v. Balfour, which is unfortunately very imperfectly reported in 30 L.J. News, p. 615, I have come to a different conclusion. In that case certain counts which were challenged as not warranted by the extradition papers were withdrawn by the Crown and the trial and conviction proceeded on the counts not open to this challenge. The inference would appear to be that there is no jurisdiction to try a fugitive criminal in England for any offence not disclosed by the depositions, &c, on which his extradition was obtained. Reference was made, at the argument, to United States v. Rauscher[2], but there the prisoner was extradited on a charge of murder and tried for a lesser offence, which was not included in the treaty. The opinion expressed, however, by Mr. Justice Miller, as speaking for the full court, seems to support the contention that the person surrendered may not be prosecuted for an offence which is not mentioned in the demand, that is, in the warrant or depositions. The reason for this rule would seem to be that the demand for extradition is a criminal proceeding and the accused has a right, not only to cross-examine, but to adduce evidence before the magistrate, and in order to enable him to do this effectively he is entitled to be informed of the specific offence with which he is charged. The publication of a statement on one day in a newspaper cannot be said to constitute the same offence as the publication in another newspaper on another day of a statement which may, or may not be to the same effect or identical with the first. On the extradition proceedings, the only statement proved was the one published by Tyron in the News-Telegram. At the trial the statement relied upon, which was said to be the subject of the charge, was that published by Creely in the Albertan, which was not before the extradition commissioner, and it cannot, therefore, be said that he was extradited for having concurred in the publication of that statement.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal on the short ground, that in view of the fact that the particulars furnished at the trial for the purpose of describing the means by which the offence charged in the indictment was committed, refer to a statement different from the one mentioned in the depositions before the extradition commissioner, it cannot be said that this indictment corresponds as it should with the depositions and information used for the application for extradition.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014The claim that the appellant was tried for some offence for which he was not surrendered by the United States is, in my opinion, unfounded.\nWe have not, as perhaps we should have, before us the information laid before the United States Commissioner, and therefore, are left to inference regarding its contents.\nThat I submit is a difficulty in the way of appellant, who has been convicted in a prosecution under and pursuant to the terms of a warrant of surrender which appears to be as follows:\u2014\nDepartment of State.\nTo all to whom these Presents shall come,\nGreetings:\nWhereas, His Excellency Sir Cecil Arthur Spring-Rice, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Great Britain,\nAccredited to this Government, has made requisition in conformity with the provisions of existing treaty stipulations between the United States of America and Great Britain for the mutual delivery of criminals, fugitives from justice in certain cases, for the delivery up of George E. Buck, charged with the crime of fraud by a director and officer of a company, committed within the jurisdiction of the British Government;\nAnd whereas, the said George E. Buck has been found within the jurisdiction of the United States, and has, by proper authority and due form of law, been brought before Paul J. Wall, Commissioner in Extradition for the District of Kansas, for examination upon said charge of fraud by a director and officer of a company;\nAnd whereas, the said Commissioner has found and adjudged that the evidence produced against the said George E. Buck is sufficient in law to justify his commitment upon the said charge, and has, therefore, ordered that the said George E. Buck be committed pursuant to the provisions of said treaty stipulations.\nNow, therefore, pursuant to the provisions of section 5272 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, these presents are to require the United States Marshal for the District of Kansas, or any other public officer or person having charge or custody of the aforesaid George E. Buck, to surrender and deliver him up to such person or persons as may be duly authorized by the Government of Great Britain to receive the said George E. Buck to be tried for the crime of which he is so accused.\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto signed my name and caused the Seal of the Department of State to be affixed.\nDone at the City of Washington, this 3rd day of July, 1916, and of the Independence of the United States the 140th.\nROBERT LANSING,\nSecretary of State.\nJames Short,\nAgent of the Attorney-General.\nSurely the fair inference is that the warrant is founded upon and follows in its terms the charge as laid before the Commissioner, and that we have not the right to impute to the Commissioner a neglect of duty in that regard.\nThen we have the evidence, put before the Commissioner, of a number of witnesses. That given by Fletcher, proving an admission of the appellant relative to the publication in the Albertan, is in general terms and seems wide enough to cover any statement put forth by that newspaper at or about the time in question such as testified by Cheely.\nThere does not seem to have been anything specifically limiting the inquiry before the Commissioner in the United States who had to consider the demand for the extradition of appellant.\nMoreover, the trip of Mr. Cheely to the well in question was testified to by at least one witness whose evidence as well as that of Fletcher appears in the deposition submitted to that officer. And the witness so testifying remarks gravely, when pressed as to the nature of the business in hand on that occasion and the purpose of taking Cheely with others concerned, he did not think Cheely had gone merely for the ride. I agree. There was clearly evidence before the Commissioner bearing upon the offence of which appellant is convicted, such as, if nothing else in the case before the Commissioner, would have entitled him to have certified as required by the statute and the Department of State, which had thereby, before it, a copy of the entire evidence, to have acted in issuing said warrant.\nWhat is a fair presumption, seeing accused was surrendered upon such a warrant?\nIs it not that for anything pointed to in the evidence likely to justify a prosecution for the offence set forth it was intended to be covered and he to be tried therefor?\nThe fact that there were several other charges of a like kind alleged to have taken place about the same time by another issue of falsehood does not help the accused, it seems to me, but rather tends to justify the surrender as related to any or all of them.\nMuch has been made of an error in relation to these other charges which seems beside what is, in law, involved herein.\nIt is not such informations, as laid before magistrates in this country, that is the test, but that which appears on the whole case before the Commissioner as containing evidence upon which such a warrant could issue.\nThe informations laid in this country are but a means for getting evidence in a judicial proceeding which can be said to have been taken under the sanction of an oath and when presented to a foreign Commissioner may, as happened herein, constitute but a part of the entire evidence upon which the Commissioner may act.\nI have no manner of doubt, the surrender was intended to cover, and did cover, any of the numerous offences made to appear in the evidence before him, in such manner as would justify one of our own magistrates committing for trial.\nI think, therefore he was convicted of an offence within the grounds upon which he was surrendered, and upon evidence thereof disclosed in the material laid before the Commissioner as expressive of the purposes of those demanding his surrender, and assented to thereby.\nThe case as presented to us involves no other question within our jurisdiction and hence the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The defendant was convicted after a trial at Calgary under section 414 of the Criminal Code of the offence of concurring, as director of a public company, in making, circulating or publishing a statement which he knew to be false in a material particular, with the intent described in the section. The sole ground of appeal which I propose to consider (because, I think, on that ground the appellant is entitled to succeed) consists in the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant that he, the appellant, having been surrendered by a foreign state, the United States of America, in pursuance of article three of the Extradition Convention of 1889 with that State, has in the proceedings out of which the appeal arises, been convicted of an offence, other than the offence for which he was surrendered in contravention of that article and of section 32 of the \"Extradition Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 155.\nThe substance of the conviction is stated in the judgment of the trial judge in the following words:\u2014\nThat between the 7th and 9th of May, George E. Buck was guilty of the charge as laid, and that he did, in the City of Calgary, concur in publishing a statement, which statement was known to him to be false in a material particular, with intent to induce persons to become shareholders of the Black Diamond Oil Fields, Ltd.\nThe prosecution of the appellant was commenced on the fifteenth of October, 1915, when three informations were laid against him before the Police Magistrate at Calgary. By two of these informations, charges of conspiracy were preferred and by the third, a charge that the appellant at the City of Calgary, on or about the 7th of May, 1914, concurred in making a false statement within the meaning of section 414 of the Criminal Code, with the intent there mentioned. In May, 1916, the appellant having been found in the State of Kansas, extradition proceedings were commenced against him on the complaint of the Province of Alberta and by this complaint the appellant was charged with the offences set forth in the three informations already referred to and with nothing else. The appellant was delivered over to the Province of Alberta on the authority of a warrant of the Secretary of State of the United States of America on the third of July, 1916, for trial upon the third of the above-mentioned charges, the charge under section 414 of the Criminal Code, his surrender upon the charge of conspiracy being refused; and the warrant recited that requisition had been made for the delivery of the appellant \"charged with the crime of fraud by a director and officer of a company\" and required the officer having custody of the appellant, to surrender him \"to-be tried for the crime of which he is so accused.\"\nThe appellant's attack upon the proceedings is this. The substance of the charge against him both before the Magistrate in Calgary and before the Extradition Commissioner under section 414 of the Criminal Code was, he avers, that he concurred in the publication on the 7th of May, of a certain \"statement\" which was put in evidence consisting of an article in a newspaper published in Calgary, the News-Telegram. This, he says, was really the \"charge\" made against him before the Extradition Commissioner; and the crime so imputed to him, concurring in the publication of the \"statement\" mentioned on the information, was the crime referred to in the warrant of the Secretary of State as that with which he is there said to be \"charged\" or \"accused\" and for trial upon which he was surrendered.\nIt is not disputed that if the appellant is right in this, the appeal ought to succeed; for it is quite apparent that the learned trial judge acquitted the appellant of any criminal offence in the publication of the 7th of May, in the News-Telegram and that the judgment against him in general terms that he concurred in the publication of a false statement between the \"7th and 9th of May\" is when translated into concrete terms, neither more nor less than judgment against him for the offence of concurring in the publication of a false statement on the 9th of May, having reference to a \"statement\" published in another newspaper through the instrumentality of other persons and differing in most material particulars from that published on the 7th.\nWithout attempting to express any general opinion as to the effect of the words \"prospectus, statement or account\" in section 414 of the Criminal Code, there can, I think, be very little doubt (assuming an offence was committed under that section by publishing or by concurring in publishing the \"statement\" which appeared in the Albertan on the 9th) that this offence was a distinct offence from any committed (if one had been committed) in publishing or concurring in publishing the earlier statement in the News-Telegram on the 7th of May. The two statements, as I have mentioned, differ in most material respects, so much so indeed, that the learned trial judge has held that while the publication of the second statement was an offence, the publication of the first statement was not an offence; and it could not plausibly be contended that what was done on the 9th or on the 8th, in procuring the publication of the second statement on the 9th, was only the culminating step in a single offence which originated in the steps taken to procure the publication of the article which had appeared on the 7th.\nAnd it is closely ad rem to observe that a charge of publishing the statement which appeared on the 7th, is obviously and admittedly a very different accusation from the charge of publishing the statement which appeared on the 9th; admittedly I say, because of the fact just alluded to, namely that the second was held to be criminal and the first comparatively innocuous.\nThe appellant then having been convicted of the offence of concurring in the publication of the \"statement\" which appeared on the 9th, in the. Albertan, does it appear that he was not surrendered to be tried for that offence? The answer to that question, as the observations already made imply, turns upon the answer to the question, was that the offence or one of the offences with which he was \"charged\" or \"accused\" within the meaning of the warrant of surrender? The direction in the extradition warrant is broad enough no doubt, to cover the charge of criminality in the publication of either \"statement\"; and it would be no valid objection, assuming two offences to have been charged, that they should be both dealt with in one commital, Re Meunier[3],.and there was, in my judgment, in the depositions before the Extradition Commissioner evidence which would have justified a commital upon a \"charge\" in respect of the publication of the second \"statement\" if such a charge had been preferred.\nBut, was such a \"charge\" before the Extradition Commissioner? I have already mentioned the fact that the \"statement\" which appeared in the News-Telegram was actually put in evidence in support of the information laid before the Magistrate in Calgary. This was the only \"statement\" shewn to be false in any particular, of which evidence was offered by the prosecution before the Magistrate. It is quite true that counsel for the defence brought out in cross-examination of one of the witnesses a reference to a remark alleged to have been made by the appellant, which I think the Magistrate might have held amounted to sufficient evidence of an admission that a \"statement\" had been published in the Albertan which was false in a material particular and a criminal statement within section 414. But this isolated passage in the cross-examination of one of the witnesses was not followed up; no fresh information was laid, the existing information was not amended, the article in the Albertan was not produced; and when the complaint was made before the Extradition Commissioner, based entirely upon the evidence taken in Calgary, it was laid in terms identical, as regards the charge under section 414, with the terms of the information. When to these circumstances we add the fact that the article published on the 9th, was offered in evidence at the trial, not in proof of the publication of it or the concurring of the publication of it as a substantive offence, but as evidence of acts similar to the acts charged and pointing to the fraudulent intent of the appellant in relation to those acts, the inference seems to be that no \"charge\" was intended to be laid in relation to the publication of the 9th, until the trial stage, at least, was reached.\nBy article, 10 of the Treaty of 1842, \"all persons who being charged with\" crimes of the kinds specified, \"committed within the jurisdiction\" of either of the contracting powers \"found within the territories of the other\" are, on requisition, to be delivered up,\nprovided that this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offence had been there committed.\nA surrender under the treaty presupposes a charge within the meaning of this article and although it is perhaps unnecessary to cite authority I refer to pp. 422 & 423 of Moore on Extradition, paragraph 288, in which it is pointed out that it is essential that the offence \"charged\" should be averred in a manner sufficiently explicit to enable the party accused to understand precisely what he is \"charged\" with. That was laid, down in the case of Farez[4], and it is, I think, indisputably correct. It must be assumed that the Extradition Commisioner acted in the spirit of this principle and that the appellant was committed under that \"charge\" which was clearly laid and in respect of which it is not disputed that there was evidence sufficient to justify a commital and not in respect of something which, it must be inferred, was not intended to be and was not in fact \"charged\" although suggested with more or less distinctness in the evidence; we must in a word, assume that the Commissioner acted in accordance with the fundamental principle of sound legal procedure, which requires that an accused person shall have notice, not only of the evidence against him, but of the nature of the \" charge \" supposed to be established by the evidence.\nIn my opinion the appeal ought to succeed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The substantial question on this appeal, on which the learned judges of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta were equally divided in opinion, is whether the charge on which the accused was convicted is \"the offence (the extradition crime) for which he was surrendered\" within the meaning of article three of the Extradition Treaty between Great Britain and the United States and within section 32 of \"The Extradition Act,\" R.S.C. [1906], ch. 155.\nIt is, in my opinion, incontrovertible that \"the offence for which (the accused) was surrendered\" means the specific offence with the commission of which he was charged before the Extradition Commissioner and in respect of which that official held that a prima facie case had been established and ordered his extradition, and not another offence or crime, though of identical legal character and committed about the same time and under similar circumstances. The Supreme Court of the United States so held in Re Rauscher[5]. In delivering the judgment of the court Mr. Justice Miller said, at p. 424:\u2014\nThat right (of an extradited person), as we understand it, is that he shall be tried for only the offence with which he is charged in the extradition proceedings and for which he was delivered up.\nI do not entertain the slightest doubt that this is a correct statement of the law under the present treaty and the Canadian statute, the former of which, in terms restricts the right of trying an extradited person to \"the offence for which he was surrendered\" while the latter prohibits his prosecution or punishment in Canada, \"in contravention of any of the terms of the (extradition) arrangement * * * for any other offence\" than the extradition crime of which he was accused or convicted and in respect of which he was surrendered.\nIt is perhaps worth noting that the stipulation in the Ashburton Treaty of 1842, construed in the Rauscher Case[6], was wider than that now in force. It provided against detainer or trial of the person surrendered for any offence committed prior to his surrender, other than the extradition crime proved by the facts on which the surrender is grounded.\nThe defendant has been convicted of an offence against section 414 of the Criminal Code, in having, while president and manager of the Black Diamond Oil Fields Ltd., concurred in the circulation or publication of a statement known to him to be false in a material particular, with intent to induce persons to become shareholders in that corporation.\nNow it appears in evidence that an article was published in a Calgary newspaper (the News-Telegram) on the 7th May, 1914, in which it was falsely stated that the Black Diamond Oil Fields Ltd. had struck oil at their well near Black Diamond, and that the defendant had procured the publication of this article through one Tyron, a reporter on the staff of that newspaper. This was the only \"statement\" proved on the preliminary investigation before the Police Magistrate into the charges against the defendant.\nOn the 8th of May, 1914, as appears from the evidence given at the trial, one Cheely, a reporter on the Albertan, another Calgary newspaper, was taken by the defendant to the Black Diamond Oil Fields and was there imposed upon by a fraudulent demonstration and given false information which led to his writing and publishing in the Albertan on the 9th of May, an article containing a similar false statement.\nAssuming both these statements to be within the purview of section 414 of the Criminal Code, there is no room to doubt that the defendant's concurrence in the publication of each of them constituted a distinct crime or offence and that proof of conviction or acquittal after trial on a charge in respect of one of them would not support a plea of autrefois convict or autrefois acquit, as the case might be, to a like charge in respect of the other.\nThe Cheely article was not before the Magistrate on the preliminary investigation and no proof was made either of its contents or of its publication. The only allusions in the evidence before the Magistrate to an article in the Albertan were these incidental statements made by one of the witnesses, Fletcher, which I copy from the factum filed on behalf of the Crown:\u2014\nA. He said Tyron of the News-Telegram was taken out, but they did not take the matter seriously and they had to get the Albertan and he had got a good write up for them, but they had not obtained the monetary results they expected.\nQ. From the talking? A. From putting the oil in.\nQ. Was there a big strike of oil there? A. According to the Albertan.\nQ. The Albertan is a pretty reliable journal? A. They are when they get reliable information.\nQ. Were you present when the Albertan ever got any information? A. No, sir.\nQ. You don't know anything about it? A. I know Mr. Buck told me he put (it?) over them; that is all I know; and could not over the News-Telegram.\nQ. When did Mr. Buck tell you that? A. In Medicine Hat, on the 12th of May.\nQ. And where were you when he told you? A. I don't know which street. Q. What day was the big strike? A. The 7th May was the supposed strike.\nIt will be noticed that this evidence gives no date of publication and, as the appellant's counsel said, it may refer to any one of several articles commendatory of the company's undertaking which the evidence shews appeared in the Albertan.\nAt the trial, counsel for the defendant objected to the admission of evidence relating to the circumstances which led up to the publication of the Cheely article of the 9th May, on the ground that the offence of having concurred in that publication had not been the subject matter of any charge before the Extradition Commissioner. In support of his objection he referred to an affidavit of the Crown prosecutor in which he deposed that the Cheely article had been called to his attention in September, 1916, and that a copy of it was procured for him on the 4th October, 1916, which, he says, \"was the first time I have ever seen the article in question in connection with the charge herein.\" The defendant's extradition had been ordered in July.\nCounsel for the Crown met this objection by claiming the right to prove a \"similar act\" as evidence having \"a bearing on the offence for which he (the defendant) was extradited\"; and it was in this way, as \"additional evidence pertaining to the same charge\"\u2014 no doubt relevant on the question of intent\u2014that the proof of publication of the Cheely article and of the defendant's concurrence therein was admitted by the trial judge.\nYet it was for his concurrence in the publication of the Cheely article in the Albertan that the appellant has been convicted. The trial judge so states, and counsel for the. Crown so admits. The learned judge had already intimated that he considered that the charge, so far as it rested on the Tyron article, had not been proved.\nThat, apart from evidence of identity and proof of the Canadian law, the only evidence before the Extradition Commissioner was that taken on the preliminary investigation before the Police Magistrate, is also distinctly stated in the factum filed' on behalf of the Crown. The only charge under section 414 of the Code investigated by the Police Magistrate, was concurrence in the publication of the Tyron article in the News-Telegram, and it was on that charge that extradition was ordered. The Cheely article was unknown to the Crown prosecutor in connection with the charge against Buck, until long after the preliminary investigation and extradition proceedings had been concluded. It had not been proved before the Magistrate and consequently its contents and publication were unknown to the Extradition Commissioner. It is therefore impossible that he should have ordered extradition in respect of the offence committed by the defendant in concurring in that publication. It is only for the offence for which he was surrendered, and not for some other offence, casually and imperfectly disclosed in the evidence which was before the Commissioner, that the person surrendered can be lawfully tried and convicted.\nBecause the conviction is contrary to the terms of the treaty and contravenes section 32 of the \"Extradition Act,\" I think it cannot be sustained. I reach this conclusion somewhat less reluctantly, because I am not altogether satisfied that persuading a reporter to publish in a newspaper an untrue article such as those before us is an offence within section 414 of the Criminal Code. This I understand to be the view expressed by Mr. Justice Stuart at the conclusion of his judgment, probably sufficiently definitely to constitute a ground of dissent of which the appellant can take advantage in this Court.\nThe defendant is certainly not entitled to any sympathy. That he committed a gross criminal fraud was overwhelmingly proved. He fully deserved the term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced. But much as it is to be regretted that such a scoundrel should escape punishment, it is of vastly greater moment that the good faith of this country shall be scrupulously maintained and a strict observance of its treaty obligations insisted upon.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting)\u2014The only point that we have to examine on this appeal, is, whether the offence for which the appellant has been extradited differs from the one for which he has been tried and convicted.\nThe appellant was a director of a company called Black Diamond Oil Fields Ltd., a company formed for the purpose of extracting oil near Calgary, in the Province of Alberta. The operations of the company were not as successful as desired by the appellant, and the wells which were being opened and made, did not produce the oil which was expected. The company was then in a very serious financial embarassment; when in the month of May, 1914, the appellant decided to put some oil in the well, which was being opened, and to arrange to bring newspaper reporters who would, after having inspected the well, publish statements shewing that oil had been struck.\nHe tried that at first with a Mr. Tyron, who was connected with the News-Telegram of Calgary; but the publication was not made to the satisfaction of the appellant.\nThen he tried with another newspaper called the Albertan, and this time was successful. Mr. Cheely, the reporter of that newspaper, was taken to the well in the automobile of the appellant; the derrick was worked in his presence; oil was drawn from the well; and a statement of the appellant that oil had been struck was published in that newspaper, in an article written by Cheely.\nA charge of fraud by a director was made under section 414 of the Criminal Code, against Buck. He was committed to trial on that charge, and among the witnesses examined at the preliminary examination, was a man by the name of Fletcher, to whom the appellant admitted that he was responsible for the statement which had been published in the Albertan.\nThe accused then fled to the United States and he was extradited on the charge of having committed a fraud as a director and manager of a company.\nWhen the trial took place, the charge of fraud was proved mostly by the evidence of Cheely, and by the statements which were made by Buck to the latter.\nIt is claimed now that Cheely had never been mentioned in the proceedings before the Extradition Commissioner, but that the statements which were mentioned against him, though substantially the same, were made to some other person.\nThe offence for which the appellant was extradited and convicted was having concurred in the publication of a statement, that oil had been found in the wells of the company of which Buck was a director. It is true that the statement made to Cheely was not specifically mentioned in the proceedings before the Extradition Commissioner; but the evidence of Fletcher, on which the Extradition Commissioner passed judgment, shews conclusively that the appellant concurred in the publication of the fraudulent statements of the Albertan. The offence and the charge which were preferred against the appellant were general in their character, and it seems to me that the Crown was perfectly well justified in proving by different ways and by different circumstances how the fraud was committed and what statements were published.\nIt was not then a question of a charge being different from the one on which the extradition took place; it was the same offence and the same charge which were considered in both cases, except that on the trial, the evidence was more specific and was proved more efficiently.\nI cannot say then, in those circumstances, that the appellant was tried for a different offence, and I am of the opinion that he was rightly convicted, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 27 Can.

Mun. Act, 1908, s. 437.\nDepreciation in the selling or leasing value of land caused by the construction and maintenance, by the Municipal Corporation in the exercise of its powers, of lavatories on the highway is \u201cinjurious affection\u201d within the meaning of section 437 of \u201cThe Consolidated Municipal Act\u201d of 1908 (Ont.), and the owner is entitled to compensation, though none of his land is taken and no right or privilege attached thereto interfered with. Davies J. dissenting.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (36 Ont. L.R. 189, 29 affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming by an equal division the award of the Official Arbitrator.\nThis is an arbitration brought by the respondent to determine what compensation, if any, was payable to it by the appellant by reason of alleged damage to its property at the south-west corner of Queen and Parliament Streets, Toronto. The respondent owns a parcel of land on this corner having a frontage of 104 feet on Queen Street by a depth of 125 feet on Parlia- ment Street, a street of much less importance than Queen Street. On the easterly 40 feet of the parcel is erected a large three-storey brick store 40 feet by 100 feet wherein tenants of the respondent carry on a weekly payment business in furnishings, clothes, etc. The store\u2019s only business entrance is on Queen Street, in the centre of the building, and there are large show windows on Queen Street and for some distance south on Parliament Street.\nIn the year 1912 the appellant, with a view of providing much-needed lavatory accommodation for the public, constructed a lavatory for men and women at this corner, it being a street car transfer point, and a place of public concourse, and, therefore, a logical situation for such a convenience. The lavatory was constructed underground and about fifty feet apart were stairways leading to the same, with metal hoods over them similar to those over a subway entrance in a large city. These entrances were distant eight feet from the building of the respondent, being midway between the curbing and the street line, which space was completely concreted so as to form an extended sidewalk. Half way between the entrances was a small structure of inconspicuous appearance used as a breather.\nThe claim of the respondent was mainly based upon the circumstance that a structure used as a lavatory had been placed near its property, causing a diminution in value thereof. In addition, however, some evidence was tendered that bad odours arose from the same. The learned arbitrator, however, found against this contention.\nA claim was also made for damage from \u201cseepage\u201d based on a theory that the disturbance of the sub-soil during the construction of the lavatory caused the cellar walls of the respondent\u2019s building to be damp.\nThe learned arbitrator found that the mere presence of a structure used as a lavatory in the vicinity of the respondent\u2019s property was sufficient to depreciate it in value and that the appellant was legally responsible therefor, and awarded the respondent $9,000 in respect of such diminution in value. He found that such damage was confined to the property occupied by the building upon the lands and did not extend south or west thereof.\nHe also accepted the respondents\u2019 theory of \u201cseepage\u201d into the cellar of the building in question and awarded it $1,200 in respect of the same.\nThe appellant appealed to an Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, composed of Chief Justice R.M. Meredith, Mr. Justice Riddell, Mr. Justice Lennox and Mr. Justice Masten, upon the ground that it was not legally liable to pay either amount awarded. The respondent cross-appealed on several questions of fact.\nOn March 17th, 1916, the Appellate Division delivered judgment unanimously dismissing the cross-appeal, but dividing equally upon the main appeal, Chief Justice Meredith and Mr. Justice Riddell being in favour of allowing the same and setting aside the award and Mr. Justice Lennox and Mr. Justice Masten being opposed in opinion. As to the $1,200 item, Mr. Justice Masten thought it was properly awarded, but Mr. Justice Lennox says (p. 214): \u201cIt would better accord with the views I entertain as a matter of technical exactness to reduce the award to $9,000, leaving the company to sue for the $1,200 as damages. Counsel for the City does not ask for this.\u201d The appellant submits that the learned judge misunderstood the position as to this item of its counsel in the lower court.\nThe court being equally divided, the award was confirmed and from this order both parties now appeal to this court.\nHellmuth K.C. and Fairty for the appellant. The respondents\u2019 claim may be actionable, but is not a matter for arbitration. See Mudge v. Penge Urban Council[2].\nThe lavatories do not in themselves constitute a nuisance. British Canadian Securities Co. v. City of Vancouver[3].\nCanadian Northern Ontario Railway Co. v. Holditch[4], Horton v. Colwyn Bay[5]; and Cripps on Compensation (5 ed.) 302, were also referred to.\nTilley K.C. and G.W. Mason for the respondents cited Griffith v. Clay[6], Lingke v. Christchurch[7], and Pastoral Finance Asso. v. The Minister[8].\nDAVIES J. (dissenting)\u2014The respondent in this appeal claimed compensation under the 325th section of \u201cThe Municipal Institutions Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1914, c. 192, for alleged injuries to his premises, located at the southwest corner of Parliament and Queen Streets, caused by the erection and maintenance of public lavatories for men and women by the Corporation of Toronto under Parliament Street, which runs along the side of his shop fronting on Queen Street. The claim came before the Official Arbitrator, who, after hearing a great deal of evidence, awarded the claimant $10,200 in full satis- faction for the injuries complained of. Of this amount the arbitrator allowed $9,000 on account of the lavatories as such, and $1,200 caused by water, or seepage, claimed as having escaped from the lavatories into the cellar of plaintiff\u2019s building.\nThe arbitrator in his written reasons for his award, finds as a fact that\nno land of the claimant was taken\nand that\nhe did not think it could be contended that access is really interfered with.\nHe seems mainly to base his conclusion as to claimants\u2019 right to compensation under the statute upon the fact that a lavatory constructed under the street, and near to claimants\u2019 store and premises, \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d claimants\u2019 premises within the meaning of section 325 of the Act above cited.\nThere was some evidence that bad odours arose from the lavatories, but the arbitrator found against this, and rested his conclusion upon the depreciation of the value of claimants\u2019 shop and premises arising from the use of these lavatories as such.\nHe says:\u2014\nThe outstanding feature of the whole claim is the user of the structures, the fact that they are lavatories. This is particularly emphasized by all the claimants\u2019 witnesses.\nIt is clear, therefore, that the damage, exclusive of the seepage, was not caused by the construction of the lavatories but, if at all, by their subsequent use, and it seems equally clear upon the evidence, and the award, that it was this use which influenced the witnesses in estimating the damages and depreciation of the value of the claimants\u2019 premises and the arbitrator in awarding the damages. The lavatories being under ground, and not interfering with access to claimants\u2019 premises, would not as mere structures depreciate the value of those premises, however much they might injure his trade. The arbitrator did not find that the depreciation he awarded damages for arose apart from any injury to claimants\u2019 trade.\nOn appeal from the award to the Second Division of the Supreme Court, that tribunal was equally divided, Chief Justice R. Meredith and Riddell J. holding that as no land of the plaintiff had been expropriated, and no legal right or easement therein interfered with, he had no claim enforceable by arbitration for injurious affection of his lands under the compensation clauses referred to, while Lennox and Masten JJ. were of a contrary opinion and sustained the award.\nThe Chief Justice and Riddell J. were both of the opinion that as under section 433 of the said \u201cMunicipal Institutions Act\u201d\nthe soil and freehold of every highway were vested in the Corporation of the Municipality\nsuch corporation had a common law right as owner to construct such lavatories in such places under the streets as they determined were necessary in the public interest, subject of course to the paramount rights of the public over the highway.\nChief Justice Meredith says:\u2014\nIs the injury, if any, made lawful only by the enactment which provides for compensation? My unhesitating answer is:\u2014No. The construction of such conveniences would be lawful and proper under the rights and duties of municipal corporations respecting highways and traffic. The wide character of those rights and duties is not everywhere understood. In this Province not only does the duty to keep all highways in repair devolve upon the municipal corporation; and not only are they made answerable in damages for neglect of such duty; but they have complete jurisdiction over them and even the soil and freehold of them is vested in such corporations and they may sell for their own benefit the timber and minerals in them. They have these rights, subject of course to the paramount purposes of highways, as their duties respecting the repair of them make plain; but it would be idle to say that as conservators of such public ways their powers are not very extensive; that they may not do largely as they deem best with them as long as there is no curtailment of the right of way over them. No one will deny their right to turn a mud road into a paved street with sidewalks, kerbs and gutters, street lights and other needs and conveniences for traffic; can any one with any more reason deny their right to build in the soil under the highway, closets and urinals, such as the needs of man imperatively demand? Provided, of course, that there is no substantial obstruction of the rights of traffic which there need never be. The need of such conveniences is in a way greater than the need of raised sidewalks. No case has been referred to that conflicts with this view of the rights and duties of municipal corporations under the laws of this Province.\nI must say that I am strongly inclined to take the same view of the corporation rights in the streets of which the soil and freehold is vested in them with respect to the construction of lavatories and urinals as expressed by the Chief Justice, and more shortly by Riddell J.\nBut I prefer to assume that these lavatories were constructed, and are used under the statutory powers of the corporation contained in the \u201cMunicipal Institutions Act,\u201d and to deal with the award on that assumption.\nIn the last analysis it seems to me that the question of the claimants\u2019 right to recover damages depends upon the true construction of section 325 (1) before referred to. It reads as follows:\u2014\nWhere the land is expropriated for the purposes of a corporation, or is injuriously affected by the exercise of any of the powers of a corporation or of the council thereof, under the authority of this Act or under the authority of any general or special Act, unless it is otherwise expressly provided by such general or special Act, the corporation shall make due compensation to the owner for the land expropriated or, where it is injuriously affected by the exercise of such powers, for the damages necessarily resulting therefrom, beyond any advantage which the owner may derive from any work, for the purposes of, or in connection with which the land is injuriously affected.\nThese compensation clauses for land taken and injuriously affected have been present in many statutes passed by the Parliament of Great Britain, and very many decisions of the courts have been given as to their true meaning and extent. There is some difference in the language used in the different Acts, but I think after reading all of those referred to in the argument, and the cases cited at bar, and in the judgments below as to their proper construction, I am justified in saying that while there were at first great differences of judicial opinion even in the cases carried to the House of Lords as to what damages could be awarded under the compensatory clauses for \u201cinjurious affection\u201d only, where no land was taken and no legal right, or easement appurtenant to the land was interfered with or obstructed, these differences were finally set at rest. It was held as the recognized rule of law applicable to compensation sections such as that now before us that such compensation can only be awarded where some physical interference is caused to the lands of the claimant or to some legal right or attribute attaching to these lands such as access or ancient lights, etc. Where no lands have been taken and no such legal rights or attributes or easement attached to land interfered with, no compensation can be given even though a man\u2019s property may be greatly depreciated in value by the exercise of the statutory rights granted to a company or a corporation. If part of an owner\u2019s lands have been taken, however, an entirely different result follows and damages are allowed not only for the lands taken, but for the remainder of claimant\u2019s lands connected with or belonging to the lands actually taken and for injuries thereto. The taking of any part of claimant\u2019s lands opens the door for the right to claim all damages actually sustained by the owner for the lands taken, and also for all his other lands connected with those taken. It has, for instance, long been settled by the decision of the House of Lords in Hammersmith v. Brand, 1869[9], that an owner of land, no part of which has been taken by a railway company and no right connected with which interfered with, cannot recover damages for \u201cvibration\u201d arising from the running of the railway without negligence, no matter what extent such damages may extend to. The headnote reads:\u2014\nThe \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d and the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d do not contain any provisions under which a person, whose land has not-been taken for the purposes of a railway, can recover statutory compensation from the railway company in respect of damage or annoyance arising from vibration occasioned (without negligence) by the passing of trains, after the railway is brought into use, even though the value of the property has been actually depreciated thereby. (Diss. Lord Cairns.)\nThe right of action for such damage is taken away.\nRex v. Pease[10], and Vaughan v. The Taff Vale Railway Co[11], approved.\nWhen I speak of damages I do so, however, with the well understood limitation that they must be an injury to lands and not a personal injury or an injury to trade, and also that they must be occasioned by the construction of the authorized works and not by their user, and must be of such a character as would have made them actionable, but for the statutory power.\nWherever a legal right has been interfered with by the exercise of statutory powers, all the damages done to the owner as a consequence of that interference is the subject of compensation. Cripps on Compensation, (5th ed.) p. 140, and the cases there cited.\nIn the present case it appears to me that the finding of the arbitrator, that there has been no physical interference with the claimants\u2019 property or with the access to and from their premises, is conclusive. It is the use of the structure as a lavatory that causes damage in the opinion of the arbitrator, based upon the evidence given before him, in which I fully concur, and statutory compensation cannot be awarded for damages caused him by the use of works constructed in accordance with statutory powers, and without negligence, unless expressly given by statute.\nIf the works are not so constructed, then the injured party may have an action for damages caused either by reason of excess beyond the powers, or from bad or improper construction of the works, but has no right of compensation under the compensating clause.\nNothing of the kind is suggested here except with regard to seepage damages with respect to which, if any, (on which I express no opinion) are the subject matter of an action, and not damages under the compensation clause for injurious affection. They are caused, if at all, by the improper or negligent exercise of the statutory powers, and do not necessarily result from their proper exercise.\nThe expression \u201cinjuriously affected by the exercise of the powers\u201d given by the Act now under discussion or of any general or special Act, is copied from the English Acts to which reference has been made. They are technical words to which a legal meaning has been attached by the courts, and when used by the legislature as in this compensation section, should have that meaning given them by our courts.\nI need hardly say that if any more extensive meaning was intended to be given to them when used in this \u201cMunicipal Institutions Act,\u201d one would have found language expressive of that intention. I fail to find any such language.\nIn the absence of any such words shewing a different meaning, I feel myself compelled to follow the English authorities, and I may say that I do so without any reluctance, because I share with Chief Justice Meredith the feeling that any such extension or enlargement might, and probably would, have results which would prevent the construction of these necessary public utilities altogether. If the claimants in this case can recover $9,000 or $10,000 damages because a urinal for men and women is placed beneath the surface of the street on which their business premises abuts where no part of their land is taken, and no easement or right in or attached to it is affected, then it follows that every other land owner in the vicinity would have a similar right to damages, greater or lesser than the amount awarded in this case, depending upon the facts of each case with the further result that the exercise of these powers would have to be discontinued because of the excessive cost of their exercise.\nIt cannot be contended that because the other land owners have not plate glass windows in their buildings fronting on the street, and because their business or trade is not injured by the turning away of the tide of customers, which might flow to them, but for the construction and maintenance of the lavatories, that their claims would be different.\nThe loss of trade is not a damage which can be allowed under the compensation clause, and it appears to me that is just what has been allowed in this case.\nThe principle that the use of the lavatory causes depreciation in the value of the adjoining lands is applicable in a more or less degree to all neighbouring land owners, and they certainly would all make claims. As was said in Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[12], at page 199, by Lord Cranworth:\u2014 The loss occasioned by the obstruction now under consideration may be greater to the plaintiff than to others, but if it affects more or less all the neighbourhood. He has no ground of complaint differing, save in degree, from that which might be made by all the inhabitants of houses in the part of the town where the works for forming the railway were carried on.\nThe cases of Corporation of Parkdale v. West[13], and North Shore Railway Co. v. Pion[14], were relied upon in the Court of Appeal largely by Mr. Justice Masten. I cannot see what application these cases can have to the one before us. In each of them the owner\u2019s right of access to and from their land, to the street in the Parkdale Case13 and to a navigable river in the Pion Case13 was obstructed and interfered with, and \u201cin both cases alike,\u201d as the Lord Chancellor said, p. 626 of the report of the Pion Case13:\nthe damage to the plaintiff\u2019s property was a necessary, patent and obvious consequence of the execution of the work.\nThe actions were held properly brought to recover damages on the ground that the company in the one case, and the corporation in the other, did not take the steps necessary under the respective statutes under which they professed to act to\nvest in them the power to exercise the right or do the thing\nfor which if those steps had been duly taken compensation would have been due to the respondents (owners) under the Act.\nBut the thing done which in each of these cases made the works of the company and the corporation actionable was the depriving of the owners of their right of access to and from their lands.\nBoth of the learned judges who decided the case in the Divisional Appeal Court quoted at length from the judgment of the learned judge who decided the cases of Vernon v. Vestry of St. James[15], and Cowper-Essex v. Local Board for Acton[16], and speak of them as \u201cilluminative\u201d and \u201cinstructive\u201d and no doubt they are with respect to facts at all similar to those dealt with in those cases. I fail, however, to find that they afford any assistance to such cases as we have now before us. The Court of Appeal in the Vernon Case15 simply held that as the erection of an urinal was not necessarily a nuisance, the statute authorizing its erection did not empower the Vestry to erect one where it would be a nuisance to the owners of adjoining property and that on the facts of that case the Vestry had exceeded their powers in placing the urinal where they did and the court granted the injunction asked for accordingly.\nNo contention is made here, or could be made, of any excess in the exercise of the powers of the Corporation of Toronto in placing the lavatory and urinal where they did. On the contrary, the claimants\u2019 submission in the appeal is based entirely upon the exercise by the Corporation of its legal right under the statute, and the claimed correlative right of the claimants to damages under the 325th section of the Act because their lands were \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d by the exercise of the Corporation\u2019s statutory powers.\nThe Cowper-Essex Case17 decided that part of the plaintiff\u2019s land having been taken for sewage works compensation might be awarded for damage by reason of it injuriously affecting his \u201cother lands\u201d connected with those taken not only by the construction of the sewage works but by their use.\nThese \u201cother lands\u201d of the plaintiffs were divided from the lands taken by a railway, but the court held that notwithstanding the division they were \u201cother lands\u201d within the meaning of the compensation clause of the statute they were considering, the \u201c Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845.\u201d\nIn that Cowper-Essex Case[17], the Lord Chancellor Halsbury said, with reference to the different principles of compensation applicable, where part of the owner\u2019s land has been taken from cases where no part has been taken, but where it is claimed the lands have nevertheless been \u201cinjuriously affected:\u201d\nWith reference to the main question I have had less difficulty since I take it that two propositions have now been conclusively established. One is, that land taken under the powers of the \u201cLands Clauses Act\u201d and applied to any use authorized by the statute, cannot by its mere use, as distinguished from the construction of works upon it, give rise to a claim for compensation. But a second proposition is, it appears to me, not less conclusively established, and that is that where part of a proprietor\u2019s land is taken from him, and the future use of the part so taken may damage the remainder of the proprietor\u2019s land, then such damage may be an injurious affecting of the proprietor\u2019s other lands, though it would not be an injurious affecting of the land of neighbouring proprietors from whom nothing had been taken for the purpose of the intended works.\nIt may seem at first sight a little strange that what is injurious affecting in one should not be in the other. But it is possible to explain that apparent contradiction by the consideration that the injurious affecting by the use, as distinguished from the construction, is a particular injury suffered by the proprietor from whom some portion of his land is taken different in kind from that which is suffered by the rest of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects.\nAnd Lord Watson said (p. 164):\u2014\nIn the case of a proprietor from whom nothing has been taken by the promoters, it has been settled by a series of decisions in this House, that, although his lands in the vicinity will necessarily be injured by the use of their works, yet it is not thereby \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d within the meaning of the Act of 1845; and that he is not entitled to statutory compensation for injury so occasioned,\nand on p. 165 His Lordship goes on to point out the distinction between cases where \u201cland has been taken\u201d and those where it has not, but is claimed as having been injuriously affected. He says:\u2014\nIn Buccleuch v. Metropolitan Board of Works[18], Lord Chelmsford, in whose judgment Lord Colonsay concurred, said[19], with reference to Brand\u2019s Case[20], and the subsequent case of City of Glasgow Union Railway Co. v. Hunter[21]: \u201cIn neither of these cases was any land taken by the railway company connected with the lands which were alleged to have been so injured, and the claim for compensation was for damage caused by the use, and not by the construction of the railway. But if, in each of the cases, lands of the parties had been taken for the railway, I do not see why a claim for compensation in respect of injury to adjoining premises might not have been successfully made on account of their probable depreciation by reason of vibration, or smoke, or noise, occasioned by passing trains.\u201d\nAfter citing other cases he says:\u2014\nIt appears to me to be the result of these authorities, which are binding upon this House, that a proprietor is entitled to compensation for depreciation of the value of his other lands, in so far as such depreciation is due to the anticipated legal use of works to be constructed upon the land which has been taken from him under compulsory powers.\nI am quite unable to see how the judgment in this case appealed from can in any way be sustained by the Cowper-Essex Case[22] or by the reasons given therefor by their Lordships. The principle laid down in that case as having been \u201cfinally settled\u201d respecting the broad distinction between the compensation which can be awarded for injurious affection in cases where part of an owner\u2019s land has been taken and cases where no part has been taken seems to me strongly against the judgment now in appeal.\nMetropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[23], is an authority referred to in many cases not only because of its peculiar facts but because of the adoption by the House of Lords of that test submitted by Mr. Thesiger, as one which would explain and reconcile apparently conflicting cases, viz.:\u2014 That where by the construction of works there is a physical interference with any right, public or private, which an owner is entitled to use in connection with his property, he is entitled to compensation if, by reason of such interference, his own property is injured.\nIn that case there was a \u201cspecial case\u201d submitted to the court in which it was stated:\u2014\nThat by reason of the dock adjoining the River Thames, and the destruction thereby of the access to, and from the Thames, the plaintiff\u2019s premises became and were as premises either to sell or occupy permanently damaged and diminished in value.\nTheir Lordships held that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation because his right of access to his premises to and from the River Thames had been destroyed, and his lands consequently depreciated in value, but that the damage or injury which is to be the subject of compensation must not be of a personal character, but must be a damage or injury to the land of the claimant considered independently of any particular trade that the claimant may have carried on upon it.\nThe recent case of Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co. v. Fort William Land Co.[24], determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the proper construction of the \u201cDominion Railway Act, 1906,\u201d secs. 47, 15 and 237(3), seems to me to apply the same principles to the construction of our Railway Act as have been applied by the House of Lords to the various English Acts as to lands taken or injuriously affected under statutory powers. That case should go a long way to govern the one before us. In delivering the judgment of their Lordships, Lord Shaw says:\u2014\nThese respondents are frontagers, that is to say, owners of properties in the streets named, and it is not difficult to understand how they are, and possibly also how the municipality itself is, seriously affected by the location of the railway as proposed and sanctioned. It appears, however, that many of the properties in question are neither taken or injuriously affected in the sense of the English railway law as interpreted by The Hammersmith, etc., Ry. Co. v. Brand, 1869[25], a decision which has been followed in Canada in Re Devlin and the Hamilton and Lake Erie Ry. Co. 1876[26]. It is in no way surprising to find that the Board, giving a sanction for the construction of a railway through the municipality, should make the condition that the compensation to be paid for that privilege should fully equate with the injury done \u201cto all persons interested\u2019\u2019; that is to say, that the compensation should be recoverable in respect not only of the construction of the railway as settled by Brand\u2019s Case[27], but also for all damage sustained in respect of its \u201clocation.\u201d\nThe pith of the judgment, as I understand it, is that the power given by the statute to award damages was in respect of construction only, and not to damages arising from location, and that the power to award compensation is limited to matters specifically referred to in the statute, and could not be extended by the Board of Railway Commissioners as was attempted to be done in their order approving the location of the railway conditionally on the company\nmaking full compensation to all parties interested for all damage sustained by reason thereof.\nIn other words, the Board could not by an order authorizing the location of the road along certain streets in the City of Fort William extend the compensation clauses beyond the matters specifically referred to in the statute, and that the \u201clocation\u201d of the road was not one of those matters.\nThe case of The King v. McArthur[28], decided by this court in 1904, appears to me applicable in principle to the one now before us. I was one of the judges by whom that case was decided, and I know it received, owing to the apparent conflict between several of the English cases, a great deal of consideration. The conclusions there reached unanimously by this court apply with great force to the one now before us.\nI have compared carefully the compensation clause 325 of the Act, respecting municipal institutions, with those in the English Acts on which the decisions I have above referred to in the courts were given. I am not able to find any substantial differences between this clause (325) and the compensation clauses of the \u201cLands Clauses Act, 1845,\u201d sec. 68; the \u201cRailway Clauses Act, 1845,\u201d secs. 6 and 16; the \u201cWaterworks Clauses Act, 1847,\u201d secs. 6-12, and the \u201cPublic Health Act, 1875,\u201d sec. 308. I say substantial differences, because, of course, there are verbal ones, but for all purposes of this appeal I construe the compensation clause of the \u201cMunicipal Institutions Act\u201d now before us as having the same meaning and object as the compensation clauses in the various English Acts I have referred to. These decisions in the House of Lords are, of course, binding upon us and with great respect I cannot see the use of quoting from the judgments of the dissenting law lords, however distinguished, as to this meaning and object, as has been done by the learned judges who gave the judgment in the courts below.\nThese decisions lay down a clear and definite rule with respect to the damages allowable for injurious affection where no land of the claimants or right or interest therein has been taken or obstructed. Being unable to distinguish between the section we are dealing with and those of the English Acts referred to, I feel bound to apply that rule to this case, and doing so, have reached the conclusion that the damages awarded cannot be sustained and that the appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts, including the arbitrator\u2019s, and the claim of the respondents dismissed. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant in 1912 erected two lavatories, urinals and water-closets on Parliament Street, Toronto, in the exercise of the powers conferred by sec. 552, sub-sec. 1, of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act,\u201d 3 Ed. VII., ch. 18, which is as follows:\u2014\n552 (1) The Councils of cities or towns may provide and maintain lavatories, urinals and water-closets, and like conveniences, in situations where they deem such accommodation to be required, either upon the public streets or elsewhere, and may supply the same with water, and may defray the expenses thereof, and of keeping the same in repair and good order.\nThe respondent then owned a parcel of land on the north-west corner of Queen and Parliament Streets, on which was erected a large building suitable and used for carrying on therein the business of dealing in furniture and house furnishings, and also clothing, millinery and furs.\nThese urinals and a separate structure called a breather, occupied a considerable part of the side of Parliament Street, next to said building and about only seven feet distant therefrom.\nThey were separated from each other so that the entire space so occupied was not continuous, but permitted public travel between them.\nI assume that no allowance could be made for damage to the business, as such, and it is only the depreciation in the market value of this property of the respondent for which he can claim compensation under sec. 437 of said Act, which is as follows:\u2014\nEvery Council shall make to the owners or occupiers of, or other persons interested in, real property entered upon, taken or used by the corporation in the exercise of any of its powers or injuriously affected by the exercise of its powers, due compensation for any damages (including cost of fencing when required) necessarily resulting from the exercise of such powers, beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work; and any claim for such compensation, if not mutually agreed upon, shall be determined by arbitration under this Act. This section being that in force when proceedings began, must be held to govern what is here in dispute.\nAnd let us clear our minds by realizing that the construction put upon another Act, less simple than this, and very differently worded, in any single section, and conceived in another atmosphere, when modern England had got born again, as it were, and was grappling with new problems, may not fit the situation confronting our legislatures. I submit that we better eliminate from the section all that is superfluous in relation to the facts and claims in question herein and read the section as follows:\u2014\nEvery Council shall make to the owners * * * of * * * real property * * * injuriously affected by the exercise of its powers, due compensation for any damages * * * necessarily resulting from the exercise of such powers.\nWe have long been told by eminent judges and others, that when the language used by the legislature is precise and unambiguous, a court of law at the present day has only to expound the words in their natural and ordinary sense.\nThere is no ambiguity about this legislative expression.\nNor is there any ambiguity in the language of the power I have quoted above, which enabled the appellant\u2019s council\nto provide and maintain lavatories, urinals and water-closets,\netc., on Parliament Street alongside respondent\u2019s building.\nNor do I feel that there is the slightest doubt as to the probable conception which the average business man seeking a corner such as the one in question, would have, relative to the market value of such a property, before and after the exercise of power, that provided and maintained such conveniences. The plain ordinary meaning of the language used seems to me expressly to require that the owner should be compensated according to the conception of such business men relative to such values before and after the execution of the power.\nThen comes the difficulty and to my mind the only difficulty in the problem presented to those concerned.\nBut the solution of that problem is by the statute dealing therewith, expressly relegated to the judgment of an officer with which, unless he clearly has proceeded upon an erroneous apprehension of the principles which should have governed him, we have no right to interfere, or upon the evidence properly adduced his allowance has been so grossly excessive or inadequate as to call for a review thereof.\nExcess of damages is not made a ground of this appeal and hence we are relieved from an analysis of the evidence and careful consideration of the results derivable therefrom.\nAssuming he proceeded upon the plain unambiguous nature of the language used in the statute, I see no ground for interference.\nAll that has been urged as to the cases decided in England under the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d and the cases resting thereon, so much relied upon, seems to me beside the question.\nThat Act is so entirely different from the Act upon which we must proceed, that it seems a waste of time to dwell thereon.\nThe decision in Brand v. Hammersmith[29], needed the consideration of four clauses of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d together with two of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d to be expressly linked up with it, and the frame of the former Act, in order to be able to arrive at it.\nAnd the substance of the whole matter turned upon the supposed necessity of shewing that some part of the owner\u2019s land had been taken in order to permit of injurious affection being considered at all, despite the weighty opinions to the contrary effect of Lord Cairns and three of the four judges to whom the question had been submitted.\nThat mode of thought dominated many later cases even under other statutes, when the condition precedent thus established as necessary to relief under that particular statute existed no longer as a barrier. Thus, indirectly, it seems to have come about that in later times some imagined the word \u201cinjuriously\u201d must be held to import something technical as injuria as a condition precedent to the allowance of damages for injurious affection.\nLater than the Hammersmith Case[30], Lord Blackburn, the dissenting judge of the four to whom the question had been submitted in that case, saw his way in the case of Buccleuch v. Metropolitan Board of Works[31], 1870, at page 244, to hold that\na part of the premises being taken it let in the claimant to have damages assessed for everything.\nWe have no such condition imposed in the Act now in question, and I see no reason why we should engraft upon the ordinary meaning of the words used something that is not there, and can only be imported there by giving to the word \u201cinjuriously\u201d a highly technical meaning which Lord Blackburn, and others, including Lord Cairns in the case lastly cited, did not find. Nor did Lord Selborne in the case of Brierley Hill Local Board v. Pearsall[32], which turned upon sec. 308 of the \u201cPublic Health Act, 1875,\u201d where the expression used is \u201cdamages\u201d seem to imagine it was necessary to prove a right of action for the wrong done but treats the language in its plain ordinary sense.\nNor did we, or any one else concerned in the recent case of Vancouver West v. Ramsay[33], imagine that it was necessary to enable a plaintiff suing on an award for damages caused to his property by narrowing the street to shew that independently of the provision for compensation he would have had a right of action.\nWhy should we? It is answered some other Acts having used the word \u201cinjuriously\u201d cases decided thereon should be followed.\nBut the case of Horton v. Colwyn Bay[34], so much relied upon in argument of counsel for appellant, turned upon a section of the \u201cPublic Health Act,\u201d which did not use the word \u201cinjuriously\u201d at all.\nThat brings us back to the proposition that legal damages are implied in such legislation, though I think the case is distinguishable on other grounds upon which I need not enlarge.\nIt is exceedingly difficult to reconcile all the numerous cases bearing more or less upon the question. I doubt if everything decided in England upon merely analogous statutes and cases binds us.\nWe, of course, receive such decisions with the greatest respect, but when it comes to a question of the construction of one of our own statutes, neither identical in language nor even fitted to the like conditions, we must give our statute the meaning probably attached to it by the legislature enacting it. But even if we are bound to apply the word \u201cinjuriously\u201d in the technical sense that there has been something done for, or in respect of, which an action would lie, I see no difficulty in this case.\nLet us assume for a moment that without legal authority, the appellant had, or to put it more broadly, some one else had, presumed to erect and maintain such structures, either for such uses or not, on such a street in such close proximity to the respondent\u2019s premises as appears in the case presented, I have no manner of doubt the respondent would have had a right of action as one suffering beyond the general public by reason thereof, and could have successfully maintained a claim for injunction or damages.\nEverything in such a case must depend upon the surrounding circumstances, and the use, or possible use a proprietor may be making, or desire to make, of his premises.\nFor example, a farmer might not be able to maintain such an action arising from the erection of such a structure on a country road alongside his farm, so long as his entrance, or probable entrance, to his premises was not obstructed or otherwise interfered with.\nBut here the proprietor not only for the present uses he is putting his property to, but the evident possible use he might find it advantageous to put his property to by making entrance thereto from Parliament Street, does suffer loss and injury beyond the rest of the public.\nIn short, as one of the appellant\u2019s own witnesses puts it, he is deprived of the value inherent in a corner lot.\nThere are some reasons why, apart from the technical reasons which rest upon the right to bring an action for the nuisance, the adoption of such a test may be of value in guiding an arbitrator who has to solve the problem of diminution of value.\nIf the proprietor suffers no such damage as would entitle him to bring an action, then, roughly speaking, the probability may be that he suffers no damages, or at least such as he should trouble any one about. And again there are conceivable cases where the institution of some establishment might tend to lessen the value of property in a whole town or district thereof, and for practical purposes a proprietor might be suffering no more than the rest of the public and hence any assessment of damages would be but taking it out of one pocket to put it into another by reason of his having to pay in his rates a share of what each similarly situate might be awarded.\nHence, in either way we look at the construction of the statute, I think the appellant fails.\nA question is raised as to an item of $1,200 of damages caused by the erection being only matter of the negligent exercise of the power and hence possibly not within the reference.\nI cannot, however, see the clear evidence of negligence, nor does it seem to me the case was fought out on that line before the arbitrator. It was separated from the total merely upon the point being taken accidentally in argument.\nAs to the cross-appeal, I think the damages allowed ample compensation even if the whole of the respondent\u2019s property is to be considered instead of merely one shop at the corner as possibly a correct view to take, and therefore the cross-appeal should also be dismissed.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The authority for the construction of lavatories under which the appellant municipality acted is that given by sec. 552, sub-sec. 1, of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act, 1903,\u201d and the compensation clause applicable is sec. 437 of that Act. Some doubt was expressed on the argument on this point, the suggestion being that the rights of the parties were perhaps governed by the provisions of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act of 1913.\u201d But it seems to be undisputed that before that Act came in force, on the first day of July, 1913, the lavatories had been provided. It appears to be a case in which sec. 14, sub-sec. c., ch. 1, R.S.O. 1914, of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d applies; and that the change in the law, if there was any, could not affect any \u201cright, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred\u201d under the Act of 1903.\nCompensation for \u201cdamages\u201d caused by the exercise of the powers of the municipality is provided for by sec. 437 as follows:\u2014\nEvery Council shall make to the owners or occupiers of, or other persons interested in, real property entered upon, taken or used, by the corporation in the exercise of any of its powers, or injuriously affected by the exercise of its powers, due compensation for any damages (including cost of fencing when required) necessarily resulting from the exercise of such powers, beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work; and any claim for such compensation, if not mutually agreed upon, shall be determined by arbitration under this Act.\nIt is conceded that the necessary result of the construction and maintenance of the lavatories is to diminish the value for selling and letting of the respondent company\u2019s property. An essential condition, however, of the company\u2019s right to recover compensation under the enactment above quoted is that its property is \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d by this \u201cexercise of the powers\u201d of the municipality; and, on behalf of the municipality, it is contended that the property has not been \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d within the meaning of this section.\nThe phrase \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d was a subject of much controversy, but more than 50 years ago it was settled that as used in sec. 6 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d (1845) and in sec. 68 of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d (1845) the phrase imports something which if done without the authority of the legislature, would have given rise to a cause of action. Ricket v. The Directors of the Metropolitan Ry. Co.[35], The Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[36], Caledonian Ry. Co. v. Walker\u2019s Trustees[37]. It has, moreover, been settled that since a condition of the right to compensation is that the claimant\u2019s property has been \u201cinjuriously affected,\u201d it is incumbent upon him to establish that the injury he complains of was an injury to his estate and not a mere obstruction or inconvenience to him personally or to his trade; Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co.35; and further that the damage complained of must be in respect of the property itself (in its existing state or otherwise) and not in respect of some particular use to which it may from time to time be put: Beckett v. Midland Rly. Co.[38], at pages 94 and 95.\nIt is undeniable and admitted in fact that the learned arbitrator in assessing the compensation has limited his attention to depreciation in value of the building and depreciation in value of the land.\nThe appellant municipality\u2019s contentions are, first, that the compensation clause above quoted gives a right to compensation only for damages caused by the construction as distinguished from the maintenance of the conveniences in use, that is to say, the damages occasioned by the structural form of the works without reference to the use to which they are put, or to the concomitants of them as public lavatories; secondly, that the first condition of the claimant\u2019s right is unfulfilled, namely, that the injury suffered by him should be one for which an action could be maintained in the absence of statutory authority for what the municipality has done; and thirdly, if such an action could have been maintained, another condition, namely, that the damage complained of should have been the necessary result of the exercise of the lawful statutory powers of the municipality, is absent because the section under which the municipality professed to act (sec. 552, s.s. 1) does not authorize the creation of a nuisance.\nIt should first be noted that section 437 provides for the payment of compensation in respect of harm done through the exercise of a great variety of powers; and that its language, when read without reference to judicial decision in relation to other statutes or to practice under other statutes and without preconception originating in familiarity with some such course of decision or practice, does not justify any restriction upon the scope of the remedy given; there being nothing here which even remotely suggests that for the purpose of determining what is due compensation to the sufferer from the exercise of a municipal power to \u201cprovide and maintain lavatories,\u201d a lavatory provided under that power to be maintained under that power is to be regarded only as a physical construction interrupting the continuity of the surface of a public street. \u201cTo provide and maintain public lavatories\u201d involves the provision of conveniences which the public are invited and expected to use and the \u201cdamages\u201d resulting therefrom are, if the words are to be given their natural and ordinary meaning, damages arising from the execution of the powers to \u201cprovide and maintain.\u201d\nIt is contended that the language of section 437 closely resembles the language of section 68 of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d and of sections 6 and 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d and that a long series of decisions in the English courts by which the rule has been developed that the right of compensation given by these sections and like enactments has been held to be limited to loss arising from the construction as distinct from the the subsequent user of the works, has been applied in this country to Canadian enactments which differ from those enactments as much as section 437 does, and that in view of this course of decision something more explicit than anything to be found in section 437 is required to shew that the legislature intended \u201cdamages\u201d for \u201cinjurious affection\u201d to be awarded under that section on any other principle.\nIn examining this argument, the first point to consider is; are the decisions of the English courts under the two Acts specifically mentioned decisions which ought to govern the construction of the statute we have to construe? Sections 6 and 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d were authoritatively interpreted and applied in Hammersmith v. Brand[39], and it was there held that the proviso of the last mentioned section requiring \u201csatisfaction\u201d to be made to all\nparties interested * * * for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers\nmust be read with reference to the initial words of the section, which were held to shew that all the powers specifically conferred by that section were to be exer- cised exclusively for the \u201cpurpose of constructing the railway\u201d (see judgment of Lord Chelmsford at page 205); and that the proviso must be limited to \u201cdamage sustained\u201d through the exercise of the powers conferred by that section; and consequently that the proviso had no relation to \u201cdamage\u201d sustained by reason of the exercise of the authority given by the 86th section of the Act to \u201cuse and employ locomotive engines\u201d upon the railway. As regards the somewhat similar words used in the 6th section, it was held that the generality of the terms must be restricted by reference to the \u201cheading\u201d of a group of clauses in which that section, as well as the 16th section occurs, and this \u201cheading\u201d was considered to manifest that the legislature was dealing with the subject, in that group of sections, of the construction of the railway alone.\nIn Brand\u2019s Case[40] their Lordships rejected the view pressed by Lord Cairns, that when compensation is to be awarded for damage caused by the construction of a railway, regard must be had to the character of the thing authorized as it was contemplated by the legisation, not a physical thing made once for all, but a railway in operation. Similar reasoning led to the same result in the interpretation of section 68 of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d by which compensation in respect of \u201cinjurious affection\u201d is to be given where lands are \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d by the \u201cexecution of the work.\u201d\nThis reasoning, which proceeds upon the particular words of these enactments, and upon a very strict view of the words \u201cconstruction\u201d and \u201cexecution\u201d as applied to works of the description authorized, has obviously no kind of relevancy in itself to the question of the effect of the broad language of section 437. So much for the decisions on these specific sections. There are authorities upon the effect of sections 49 and 63 of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d however, that may usefully be referred to as emphasizing the inutility of the decisions on the sections first mentioned as precedents in questions involving interpretation of statutes couched in such general terms as those of section 437. Sections 49 and 63 of the \u201cLands Clauses Act,\u201d deal with the case of \u201cseverance\u201d and in that case the owner is to be paid not only the value of that part of his land which has been taken, but he is also to receive compensation for damage sustained by him by \u201cseverance\u201d or by \u201cotherwise injuriously affecting such other lands by reason of the exercise of the powers of this or the special Act.\u201d\nDamage * * * by otherwise injuriously affecting such other lands by reason of the exercise of the powers of this or the special Act\nare words not in themselves distinguishable in effect from those employed in section 437, so far at least as affects the question now before us; and the law is very clearly settled that in cases governed by sections 49 and 63 compensation is assessable in respect of damage caused by subsequent user. Duke of Buccleuch v. Metropolitan[41]. The effect of section 63 is fully discussed in the judgment of Montague Smith J. speaking for Willes and Brett JJ. as well as himself[42], at page 252 et seq., and by the law Lords in Essex v. Local Board for Acton[43], at pages 162, 165, 166 and 167. There are some observations of Lord Macnaghten at pages 177 and 178, illustrating the view their Lordships held of the effect of the general language of sections 49 and 63:\u2014 Where land is required for public purposes, the injury, if any, to the owner\u2019s adjoining property depends mainly on the character of the undertaking. There are various purposes for which local boards may be authorized to take land. They may take land for pleasure grounds. They may take land for sewage purposes. But before putting in force any of the powers of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d a local board is bound to publish the nature of the proposed undertaking, to define the lands required, and to collect, as far as possible, the views of all persons interested in those lands. Then comes a public inquiry, to be followed in due course by a provisional order, and an Act confirming it. These elaborate provisions, designed apparently for the protection of private, as well as public interests, would be something of a mockery if a person from whom land is taken is to be told, when he asks for compensation, that at that stage of the proceedings it is all one whether his land be required for a public garden or for a sewage farm.\nIt was said that the objection to a sewage farm comes from an unfounded apprehension of possible mischief. Does that matter? Call it what you will: ignorance or prejudice or fancy; the loss to the owner who may want to sell is not the less real. In such a case apprehension of mischief is damage of itself. And the depreciation in value must be the measure of compensation if the owner is to be compensated fairly.\nThe promoters of an undertaking can only take lands for the purpose authorized by their Act. When the lands are taken, the promoters can only use them for that purpose. It is the purpose of the undertaking and that alone, which justifies its existence, and directs and controls the exercise of its powers. And yet it is said that on a question of disputed compensation the arbitrators or the jury, as the case may be, are to shut their eyes to the purpose of the undertaking, and to make believe that the intended works are some innocent and meaningless folly.\nThe decisions upon sections 49 and 63 of the \u201cLands Clauses Act\u201d negative conclusively the theory that some general principle of construction has been established applicable to compensation statutes by which the effect of general words such as those of section 437 (not distinguishable, as I have said, from those of sections 49 and 63) can, in the absence of some qualifying context, be restricted in the way suggested.\nThis is aptly illustrated by an authority referred to on the argument, Fletcher v. Birkenhead[44]. The controversy there related to the right to compensation under certain clauses of the \u201cWaterworks Clauses Act, 1847,\u201d compensation being demanded for what was conceded for the purposes of the decision to be maintenance or user as distinguished from construction of the works. The defence relied upon Brand\u2019s Case[45], and I quote the observation of Bray J. at page 611:\u2014\nIt seems to me quite sufficient to say that the sections are not similar, and that it is wholly misleading to try and construe one Act by another Act, and on the ground that the differences between the two are small. The safest course is to construe the Act by its own language.\nIn the Court of Appeal[46], the provisions of the \u201cWaterworks Clauses Act\u201d were compared and contrasted elaborately with those of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d by the Master of the Rolls, who, pointed out what has already been indicated above as touching the grounds of that decision. The Lords Justices (Cozens-Hardy and Farwell L.JJ.) emphasized the distinction between a railway as conceived by the majority of their Lordships in Brand\u2019s Case45\na causeway or embankment with rails laid upon it, and nothing more, a thing which was made once for all,\nand the subject matter of the Act they had to construe works which are described as waterworks\nconsisting of a well and pumping station by which water is obtained a reservoir in which it is stored, and pipes by which it is carried to and from that reservoir;\nand Farwell L.J. says at page 217:\u2014\nIt must be remembered that the case of Hammersmith & City Ry. Co. v. Brand[47], determined no question of principle. It dealt merely with the construction of a particular Act and not with the Act with which we are dealing. Moreover, the Act upon which that decision turned dealt with a subject-matter so different from that with which the Act now in question deals, that it is obvious that the construction of one statute can be little or no guide to the construction of the other.\nIt is quite true that the \u201cWaterworks Clauses Act\u201d in express words gives a right to compensation for damages arising from \u201cconstruction and maintenance\u201d; but the observations of their Lordships afford strong confirmation of the conclusion above indicated that no such general principle as that contended for is established by the English decisions on the two Acts referred to.\nA brief reference to the decisions under section 308 of the \u201cPublic Health Act\u201d is perhaps not out of place. The enactment provides that\nwhere any person sustains any damage by reason of the exercise of any of the powers of this Act * * * full compensation shall be made to such person by the local authority exercising such powers.\nIt was long ago settled that the right given by this section is available only where the act giving rise to the damage in respect of which compensation is claimed would be actionable in the absence of statutory authority. Lingke v. Christchurch[48]. But subject to that it has been broadly held, to quote the language of Lord Esher in Re Bater and Birkenhead[49], at page 79, that\nthe words * * * must include any pecuniary loss which a man suffers when he is not himself in default.\nHobbs v. Winchester[50], Walshaw v. Brighouse[51], In re Dairies and Rhondda Urban Council[52]; and accordingly compensation has been held to be awardable under them for damages suffered by reason of user as distinguished from the construction of the sewage works. Durrant v. Banksome[53], at pages 298, 300, 304 and 305; Uttley v. Local Board of Health of Todmorden[54], at page 23. Horton v. Colwyn Bay[55], which was pressed upon us by the appellant municipality is also a decision under section 308 of the \u201cPublic Health Act,\u201d and it is sufficiently evident when the case is understood, that it has very little relevancy to any question before us. The defendants there acting under the \u201cPublic Health Act,\u201d had constructed a sewer, pumping station and sewage reservoir, forming one scheme of sewerage. The sewers were in part constructed on the property of the claimant; the pumping station and the reservoir on the property of other persons. The present value of part of the claimant\u2019s lands was depreciated by reason of the contemplated user of these works for sewage purposes and in respect of this depreciation he claimed compensation.\nThe decisive consideration rested upon the fact stated at page 342 in the judgment of Buckley L.J. that the erection and user of the pumping station and reservoir would be no actionable wrong as against the claimant; of this there seems to have been no dispute and prim\u00e2 facie, therefore, section 308 of the \u201cPublic Health Act\u201d had no application.\nAn ingenious attempt to get over the difficulty by appealing to some rather sweeping observations made in In re London, Tilbury, etc. Railway Co. and Gowers Walk Schools[56], and applying them to the fact that the system was a system in part constructed on the claimant\u2019s land failed; it would serve no useful purpose to follow the discussion on this last mentioned point.\nWe have now to consider the decisions upon the Canadian statutes. First, there is a series of authorities in the Ontario courts on the \u201cDominion Railway Act\u201d in which it was held that the effect of the compensation clauses of that Act as touching the point now in question was the same as that attributed to secs. 6 and 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d in Brand\u2019s Case[57] and these decisions of the Ontario Courts were assumed in the Fort William Case[58], to have settled the law under the \u201cDominion Railway Act.\u201d In Holditch v. Canadian Northern Ry. Co.[59], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, as I read the judgment, held (see p. 554) that no importance can be attached to any difference in language between section 155 of the \u201cDominion Railway Act\u201d and the proviso to section 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d of 1845, and their Lordships\u2019 language seems to imply that they approve of the view that the construction of section 155 as regards the point now in question is governed by the decision in Brand\u2019s Case.57\nNow it is too clear for dispute that if section 155 of the \u201cDominion Railway Act\u201d was to be construed apart from its context, it could be given no narrower effect than the language of section 437 of the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d On the other hand, section 155 is found in a group of sections, which, like the group of sections in which section 16 of the \u201cRailway Consolidation Clauses Act\u201d occurs, has the heading \u201cconstruction\u201d and (although sub-section (f) of section 151 in that same group of sections deals with the manner of operation as regards motive power and otherwise) it is, I think, a proper conclusion from the whole tenor of their Lordships\u2019 remarks at page 554 in the Holditch Case59 that the foundation of their Lordships\u2019 view was that the language of section 155 when read with the context in which that section is found, sufficiently evidences an intention to adopt the law of Brand\u2019s Case.57 The other Canadian decisions to which I shall refer concern the effect of section 47 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d and of provisions of the Dominion Government Railways Act of 1881.\nThe King v. McArthur[60], a decision of this court at first sight is a formidable obstacle for the respondent company.\nThe court was there governed by the provisions of the Dominion statutes, the \u201cExpropriation Act,\u201d and section 47 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act.\u201d There is in these enactments no explicit statement of any specific rule or principle upon which compensation is to be awarded, although some light to compensation (when property is taken or injured) is necessarily implied.\nThe court in the case just mentioned appears to have assumed, without argument on the point, that the rules developed by the English courts in compensation cases under the \u201cRailway Clauses Act\u201d and the \u201cLands Clauses Act,\u201d were proper guides for the interpretation of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d and the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d The decision can therefore have no weight as an authority on the construction of section 437. If the court had been dealing with section 437 of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d another question might have arisen; although in view of the course of this court in its decisions upon article 1054 C.C., see Vandry v. Quebec Light, Heat and Power Co.[61], of Lord Blackburn\u2019s observations in Brand\u2019s Case[62], and of the decision of the Privy Council in The Queen v. Hughes[63], I should not have felt myself constrained to do violence to the language of the statute by a decision in which the point in question had passed sub silentio. The statute in question in that case was, however, another statute, and as the decision cannot be said to establish any principle, we are not bound to give effect to everything which may appear to be a logical consequence of it. Ex parte Blaiberg[64], at page 258; Spencer v. Metropolitan[65], at page 157; Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. America[66], at pages 42 and 43.\nIn Paradis v. The Queen[67] Taschereau J. observed at page 193 that \u201cour statute,\u201d meaning the Government Railways Act of 1881, was but a re-enactment of the \u201cImperial Statutes\u201d on the subject of compensation and it followed, of course, that the decisions on the English statutes were considered to be authoritative. The particular clauses of the \u201cGovernment Railways Act,\u201d to which Taschereau J. referred, have since disappeared from the statute, but I am afraid I am unable to agree with the assumption that they were a mere reproduction of the \u201cImperial Statutes.\u201d\nOn the whole my conclusion is that there is nothing in the decisions of this court on the Dominion statutes, which constrains us to give section 437 an effect not justified by the words themselves which the legislature has selected for the expression of its intention.\nThe point being settled that the right of compensation given by section 437 extends to cases where property is \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d by the exercise of powers of maintenance and user of works as distinct from the power to construct works, in the narrower sense of those words, the next question to be considered is whether the first of the conditions above mentioned has been satisfied, namely, that the depreciation in value of the respondent\u2019s property which admittedly has taken place is the result of acts which in the absence of statutory authority would have been wrongful and actionable.\nI shall not repeat the reasons given by Mr. Justice Masten in which I concur for thinking that the openings and the railings about them constitute illegal and indictable obstructions to the public right of passage in the highway. The general principle that an illegal and indictable act is wrongful as against an individual and actionable at his suit if it has occasioned to him some particular loss more than that sustained by the rest of the public, has been applied frequently in compensation cases: Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[68], at pages 263 and 266; Chamberlain v. West End of London[69]: and especially in the exposition of Mr. Justice Willes in Beckett v. The Midland Railway Co.[70], beginning at page 97. There is a distinction, however, between this case as regards the relation between the obstruction and the loss suffered by the respondent company, and all the other compensation cases in which, as far as I have seen, the principle has been held to be operative. As I view the facts there is no warrant for holding that any loss has fallen upon the respondent company through any direct effect upon the value of its property of these obstructions as obstructions, because, in other words, of any interference with the public right of passage occasioned by them; and it may be added that the learned arbitrator has in substance found, I think, and I should find without hesitation that there is no invasion of the respondent company\u2019s right of access, the private right that is to say incidental to its ownership.\nThe depreciation in value for which compensation is awarded is occasioned by the fact that the presence of such conveniences makes the property less desirable from the point of view of possible purchasers and lessees, and therefore diminishes its selling and letting value. Does the circumstance that the loss is not due to the obstructions as such affect the application of the principle? If an illegal act causes damage to an individual, which is particular damage, that is to say, which affects him particularly over and above any harm it may cause to the public generally, and that damage is the natural and probable consequence of the act, reparation for such damage is, I think, recoverable, and I do not see why the law breaker should escape this consequence because of the fact that the injurious results (the natural and probable results) of his concrete illegal act are not connected by any causal relation with the particular circumstances giving the act its specific illegal character. The point has been dealt with in Campbell v. Paddington[71], in which it was held that an erection in a highway, unlawful as an obstruction to the public right of passage which also interfered with the view from the plaintiff\u2019s windows and thus deprived her of the opportunity of letting some rooms for the purpose of viewing a procession, was actionable at her suit although she was not specially affected by the obstruction as an obstruction to the right of passage. See also Griffith v. Clay.[72]\nBut the question arises, is it sufficient that the depreciation should have been the result of something which would have been an actionable public nuisance, but for the statutory authority? That it should be actionable is a condition, but is it sufficient? Lord Cairns\u2019 words in McCarthy\u2019s Case[73], at page 252, have frequently been quoted:\u2014 In the observations I am about to make to your Lordships, I propose entirely to accept the test which has been applied both in this House and elsewhere, as to the proper meaning of those words as giving a right to compensation, namely, that the proper test is to consider whether the act done in carrying out the works in question is an act which would have given a right of action if the work had not been authorized by Act of Parliament.\nLord Hatherly\u2019s language is to the same effect at page 260 and in McCarthy\u2019s Case[74], the decision of the Exchequer Chamber in Chamberlain\u2019s Case[75], at page 605, and the decision of the Court of Common Pleas in Beckett v. Midland Railway Co.[76], at page 82, are explicitly approved in which it was held that depreciation in value caused by an obstruction giving a right of action by reason of such depreciation would afford a sufficient ground for compensation. Certain earlier cases, notably Caledonian Railway Co. v. Ogilvy[77], in which a claim for damages occasioned by a railway crossing at highway level was disallowed, are explained on the ground that no depreciation of value or other injurious effects upon the claimant\u2019s property was shewn.\nA difficulty, however, may seem to arise from the language of the Lord Chancellor (Lord Cairns) and of Lord Chelmsford in McCarthy\u2019s Case74, and the application made of that language by this court in The King v. McArthur.[78] Lord Cairns appears to have accepted, although it may be doubted whether he intended to lay it down finally as a \u201cdefinition,\u201d the test proposed in the form of a \u201cdefinition\u201d by Mr. Thesiger in argument. Lord Cairns formulates that test at page 253 in these words:\u2014\nMr. Thesiger stated that the test which he would submit as one which he thought would explain and reconcile the various cases upon this subject, was this, that where by the construction of works there is physical interference with any right, public or private, which the owners or occupiers of property are by right entitled to make use of, in connection with such property, and which right gives an additional value to such property, apart from the uses to which any particular owner or occupier might put it, there is a title to compensation, if, by reason of such interference, the property, as a property, is lessened in value.\nLord Chelmsford restates the \u2018\u2018test\u201d in slightly different language at page 256. Now there is a fallacy in applying this \u201ctest\u201d where the claim is for damages caused by maintenance and user as distinguished from construction simply. In McCarthy\u2019s Case74 their Lordships were applying the 68th section of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d which comes into operation only where property is injuriously affected by the \u201cexecution of the works.\u201d And in view of the decision of the House in Brand\u2019s Case[79], all their observations were, of course, directed to a discussion of the point raised by a claim for the injurious affecting of property as the result of the physical construction. It is too obvious for argument that a claim for compensation for damages caused by vibration, in the working of a railway for example, is not within the purview of the language quoted. This being the proper construction of the language, it may no doubt have been rightly applied by this court in McArthur\u2019s Case[80], on the assumption upon which that decision proceeded, namely, that the statute under which compensation was claimed, had no application to the injurious consequences of user as distinguished from construction.\nIt is proper at this stage to notice an argument of Mr. Tilley, which was to the following effect. Assuming section 437 to have no application to cases in which no property is taken, and no property is injuriously affected by construction, the depreciation in value ought, nevertheless, in part, on the evidence to be attributed to the existence of the obstruction to the right of passage occasioned by the openings in the surface of the highway independently of their connection with the conveniences; and that the compensation clause having once \u201cattached,\u201d even though no land was taken, compensation must be assessed for the whole of the resulting damage arising from use as well as from construction.\nI have already said that in my view the premises fail on the facts; but assuming the premises the conclusion is, I think, to say the very least, extremely doubtful. Section 437 gives compensation for\nany damage necessarily resulting from the exercise of such powers.\n\u201csuch powers\u201d being those in the exercise of which land has been \u201centered upon, taken or used,\u201d or by the exercise of which land has been \u201cinjuriously affected. If \u201cinjuriously affected by the exercise of any of its powers\u201d contemplates powers of construction only, then it must follow that where compensation is claimed for injuriously affecting lands it must be shewn that this results from construction. That seems necessarily involved in the acceptance of the interpretation of the statute put forward on behalf of the respondent. That interpretation given, there is no foothold for a claim in respect of damages occasioned by user.\nMr. Tilley\u2019s contention, moreover, is founded on certain English decisions, which, when closely examined, are seen to be non ad rem. I have already mentioned that in the Cowper-Essex Case[81], their Lordships had to apply sections 49 and 63 of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act.\u2019\u2019 The language of those clauses is discussed above and the effect of them noted in their application to circumstances such as those their Lordships had before them in the Cowper-Essex Case81, where part of a landowner\u2019s property is severed from the rest. Their Lordships followed the decision in the Duke of Buccleuch\u2019s Case[82] where the majority of the law Lords proceeded on the ground that land had been taken. The right of access to the river, moreover, along the whole of the river front, was invaded and access destroyed, and I should not be disposed to think that this was distinguishable from the taking of land, the right of access being not an easement, but one of the rights jure natur\u0153 incidental to ownership. Lyon v. Fishmonger\u2019s Co.[83]; Kensit v. Great Eastern Ry. Co.[84]; North Shore Ry. Co. v. Pion[85], at page 621. See Lord Cairn\u2019s judgment in the Duke of Buccleuch\u2019s Case82, at page 462. In re Tilbury[86], at page 326, is a case which seemed at first sight to support the contention, and the language used by the Lords Justices is very broad. At page 333, for example, Lopes L.J., says:\u2014\nThat principle I understand to be, that when the compensation clauses of the statute attach, the party who is injuriously affected is to be entitled to recover full compensation for all damage in respect of the determination in value of his property.\nWhen, however, one considers what their Lordships had to decide, and what their Lordships did decide, one sees that they were only dealing with the case in which property is injuriously affected by construction. The ground of the claim was that certain buildings constructed by the railway company injuriously affected the claimant\u2019s property in the obstruction of certain ancient lights, and that this obstruction, which, but for the statutory powers of the railway company, would have been unlawful and actionable, at the same time had the effect of interrupting the access of light to windows in respect of which the claimant had acquired no easement of light. Their Lordships applied and construed section 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845,\u201d in relation to these facts. I have already pointed out that under the decision in Brand\u2019s Case[87] the proviso to that section requiring the promoters\nto make full satisfaction * * * for all damage * * * sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers\napplies only where the damage is sustained in consequence of construction as distinguished from user, and this is the section which their Lordships applied. The damage for which compensation was claimed was in its entirety attributable to construction.\nThere is, I think, no decision under the \u201cRailway Clauses Act,\u201d or under the \u201cLands Clauses Act\u201d in which it is held, or in which it is laid down that where land is not taken compensation can be recovered for damages arising from the injurious affecting of it by subsequent user as distinguished from construction; that no doubt is because there is nothing in the provisions of those Acts to give support to such a claim. There is one circumstance, moreover, which tells very powerfully against any such view. In Brand\u2019s Case87 a claim was made, and allowed for damages for interrupting the access of light and air, and if the contention I am considering were sound, that would have afforded a basis for a claim to compensation for damage caused by vibration, which was disallowed. The point was not discussed by the law Lords, and not referred to in argument, but attention had been called to it in the judgment of Montague Smith J.[88], and though perhaps as Lord Blackburn afterwards observed, the decision of the law Lords cannot be regarded as concluding the point, it is at least clear that Sir Roundell Palmer who appeared unsuccessfully for the respondent (and probably Lord Cairns, who thought the respondent ought to succeed), regarded the point as of no consequence.\nI now come to the last point upon which Mr. Hellmuth, I think, chiefly relies, and that is that on the hypothesis upon which the respondent\u2019s case rests, the action of the municipality in providing and maintaining the conveniences exceeded any authority conferred by the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d and that consequently no right to compensation arises. I concur with the view advanced by Mr. Hellmuth, that if the municipal by-law was beyond the powers of the council no right to compensation under the statute would arise; but I have not sufficiently considered the provisions of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d in relation to the procedure in compensation cases to enable me to form an opinion whether such an objection (postulating as this does an abuse of the powers of the council) could properly be taken as this objection was taken for the first time after the evidence had all been heard.\nI am satisfied that there is nothing before us to justify the conclusion that the council exceeded their powers. Mr. Hellmuth\u2019s point is that the appellant municipality could not validly exercise its authority in relation to the providing of public lavatories in such a way as to create a nuisance prejudicially affecting private property.\nNow there is a sense in which that proposition is perfectly sound. The municipality must exercise this power in a proper manner, that is to say, it must not by acts of collateral negligence by improper construction, for example, create a nuisance, and for a nuisance occasioned by such negligence, the municipality is undoubtedly responsible in an action for damages and that is the proper remedy. But the respondent company does not claim compensation for anything of the kind. It claims compensation for damages arising from the existence of these conveniences, and from concomitants of them which are inevitable, and from the harmful consequences necessarily resulting from the lavatories being where they are placed. It is argued that the municipality can have no authority under the statute to place such a convenience in such a situation as to produce such injurious consequences to a private individual. I think that proposition is not well founded. The authorities relied upon are Vernon v. St. James[89], Metropolitan Asylum Dist. v. Hill.[90] These cases have been fully dealt with in a judgment of Lord Macnaghten, speaking for the Judicial Committee in East Fremantle v. Annois[91], which enunciates clearly and succinctly the principle upon which such questions must be decided, namely, by ascertaining the answer to the question: What is the proper construction of the statute from which the power is derived? I limit myself to quoting the most directly relevant passages:\u2014\nThe law has been settled for the last hundred years. If persons in the position of the appellants, acting in the execution of a public trust and for the public benefit, do an act which they are authorized by law to do, and do it in a proper manner, though the act so done works a special injury to a particular individual, the individual injured cannot maintain an action. He is without remedy unless a remedy is provided by the statute * * *\nIn a word the only question is, has the power been exceeded? Abuse is only one form of excess. Their Lordships are of opinion that the principles laid down by Lord Kenyon and Abbott C.J. have not been in the slightest degree modified by the more recent cases referred to by Hensman J. They were all cases where, upon the true construction of the particular statute under consideration, the Court held that there was no intention of authorizing interference with private rights * * *\nIn Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[92], the remarks of Lord Watson must be taken in connection with the circumstances of the case with which his Lordship was then dealing. As his Lordship observes: \u201cWhat was the intention of the Legislature in any particular Act is a question in the construction of the Act?\u201d There it was held, as Lord Selborne pointed out, that there was no statutory right to commit a nuisance, and that no use of any land which must necessarily be a nuisance at common law was authorized. As Lord Blackburn observed in a later case, Truman v. London, Brighton and South Coast Rly. Co.[93], quoting Bowen L.J., there was not to be found in the Act under consideration in Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill92 \u201cany element of compulsion, or any indication of an intention to interfere with private rights.\u201d\nIn Vernon v. Vestry of St James[94], in the very sentence quoted by Hensman J., James L.J. went on to say that he was of opinion that there was no legislation in the case authorizing the vestry to interfere with private rights. In an earlier part of his judgment, the Lord Justice had observed, \u201cthere are no words here that authorize the vestry to commit a nuisance.\u201d\nThe question is then\u2014Has the legislature endowed the council with authority to select a site for such conveniences, subject to the obligation to pay compensation where private rights of property are injuriously affected? Municipal councils invested with very large powers must be presumed to act not only with due regard to the public interest, but with due consideration for individual rights and interests in such matters. But the question is: Is a discretion committed to the council which enables it to select a site where private property will inevitably be damaged when it deems the public interest so to require?\n\u201cAn Act of Parliament,\u201d said Bowen L.J., in Truman v. London, Brighton and South Coast Rly. Co.[95], at page 108,\nmay authorize a nuisance, and if it does so, then the nuisance which it authorizes may be lawfully committed. But the authority given by the Act may be an authority which falls short of authorizing a nuisance.\nIt may be an authority to do certain works provided that they can be done without causing a nuisance, and whether the authority falls within that category is again a question of construction. Again the authority given by Parliament may be to carry out the works without a nuisance, if they can be so carried out, but in the last resort to authorize a nuisance if it is necessary for the construction of the works.\nNobody would deny that the municipality has authority to expropriate land for the purpose of establishing lavatories; therefore the scheme of the Act is certainly not to require the municipality, in the exercise of this power, to refrain from interfering with private rights; it contemplates, on the contrary, interference with private rights, subject, of course, to paying compensation. But in my judgment, to accept the view advanced by the municipality would nullify the utility of this power.\nI will not elaborate the point; my conclusion is that where private rights are affected the compensation clause attaches. This is not to say that the municipal council may act in a wholly fantastic manner passing, for example, a by-law which\nreasonable persons, acting in good faith, could not sanction.\nSlattery v. Naylor[96]. For such conduct the law affords ample remedy.\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the conditions of the claimant\u2019s right to compensation under the compensation clause of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d construed by the light of the relevant judicial decisions, are fulfilled, and that the main appeal should therefore be dismissed. As to the cross-appeal, it involves questions of fact only, and upon these questions the arbitrator\u2019s findings have been affirmed by the Appellate Division, and ought not therefore to be disturbed in this court unless it is quite clear that they are founded upon some specific mistake. That has not been shewn.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The facts are so fully set out, and the authorities so thoroughly discussed in the judgment of my brothers, Davies and Duff, which I have had the advantage of reading, and in those of the learned judges of the Appellate Division[97], that it seems quite unnecessary to do more than state the conclusions I have reached, and to indicate the grounds on which they are based.\nThe crucial questions appear to me to be these:\u2014\n1. Is the construction and maintenance of a public lavatory, which would otherwise be within the authorization of section 552 (1) of the \u201cMunicipal Act, 1903,\u201d or section 406(8) of the \u201cMunicipal Act, 1913,\u201d (identical provisions) excluded therefrom because it entails conditions which, if not so authorized, would amount to a nuisance?\n2. Are the lands of the respondent company \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d by the exercise of the powers conferred on the appellant municipality within the meaning of section 437 of the \u201cMunicipal Act, 1903,\u201d or section 325 of the Municipal Act, 1913?\u201d I regard both these provisions as substantially the same, but I agree with my brother Duff that the Act of 1903 governs, the works having been constructed before the 1st of July, 1913.\n3. Do the powers, for damages occasioned by the exercise of which compensation is thereby provided, include the maintenance, in the sense of carrying on or conducting public lavatories, or are they confined to the original providing (i.e., the construction) of them and subsequent maintenance merely in the sense of repairs or betterments?\n(1) I entertain no doubt whatever that the fact that the existence of a public lavatory causes conditions which would at common law amount to a nuisance, if those conditions are a necessary concomitant of its erection and maintenance, whether it is constructed on expropriated lands or on the city streets, does not exclude it from the authorization of the statute. In specifically authorizing the construction and maintenance of public lavatories, and providing for compensation for resultant injury the legislature contemplated that such conditions, productive of damage to adjacent private properties, might ensue. The city is entrusted with a discretion as to the location of such lavatories, and its judgment, honestly exercised, is not subject to curial control or review. The causing of damage which is not a necessary result of the exercise of the statutory power\u2014which due care in its exercise would avoid\u2014is not within the statutory authority. It is an excess or abuse of the power; and damage so caused is not a subject for compensation, but for action. But the construction and maintenance of a lavatory, with all proper precautions to avoid unnecessary injury is authorized by the statute, even though it should entail conditions which would, if not so authorized, amount to an indictable or actionable nuisance. The statute substitutes money compensation for some of the benefits and advantages of and incidental to ownership of property, in so far as it is \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d by the exercise of the corporate powers.\n(2) The construction of the words \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d as applied to lands in compensation Acts, is too well established to admit of controversy. It imports an affection of the lands themselves (apart from any particular use to which they may be put or any personal inconvenience suffered by the owner) entailing appreciable damage. It also implies an injuria known to the law, i.e., the doing of an act which, if not authorized by the statute, would be actionable\u2014that the loss sustained must not be damnum absque injuria. Once an actionable injury is established, however, all the damage sustained in consequence of the exercise of the statutory power is to be compensated for. Thus, if the injuria consists in the blocking of lights to the enjoyment of which the land-owner has a legal right, prescriptive or contractual, he is entitled to compensation for interference with other existing lights to the enjoyment of which he has hot a legal title. The Tilbury Case[98]; Horton v. Colwyn Bay[99] at page 341; Griffiths v. Clay[100].\nMoreover, if the act done be illegal (as Mr. Justice Masten has, to me at least, satisfactorily demonstrated the erection of the lavatory in question, but for the statutory authorization, would have been, because of the partial obstruction of the highway involved) damages which are its natural and probable consequences, may be recovered, although no actual damage can be shewn attributable to the feature of the act which renders it illegal, or, but for the statutory authorization, would have made it so. Campbell v. Paddington[101], cited by my brother Duff, illustrates this phase of the law. I agree that the affirmance of the judgment in appeal involves the acceptance of the principle of the Paddington Case.101. (3) I have no doubt that the word \u201cmaintain\u201d in section 552(1) of the Act of 1903, is used in the sense of \u201ccarry on\u201d and that the power conferred was not merely to erect lavatories, and keep them in repair, but to conduct and operate them as municipal enterprises, Fletcher v. Birkenhead[102], at pages 610-11;[103], at pages 213, 216-17, 218, seems to me to be very much in point.\nIn dealing with section 437 of the \u201cMunicipal Act, 1903,\u201d we are not embarrassed by the restrictive effect of a heading of a fasciculus of sections such as led to the decisions in Brand\u2019s Case[104] and the series of English cases following it. The language of section 437 is obviously wide enough to cover compensation for injury due to user as well as to erection, once it is established that carrying on or conducting the lavatory is an exercise of the statutory power conferred by the word \u201cmaintain,\u201d as I have no doubt that it is. My brother Duff has clearly pointed out the distinction between the construction placed by the English courts on section 68 of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d and sections 6 and 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d and that given to sections 49 and 63 of the former Act, and the grounds on which that distinction rests. I agree in his conclusion that the construction of section 552(1) and section 437 of the \u201cOntario Municipal Act, 1903,\u201d is governed by the decisions on sections 49 and 63 of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act.\u201d There is nothing in the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d which requires a more restricted application of section 437 than its language ex facie calls for. Compensation for damages due to user having been expressly provided for by the statute, and injurious affection, resulting from an act illegal but for statutory authorization, having been shewn, nothing more, in my opinion, is required to establish the claimant\u2019s right to recover.\nI have not overlooked the argument made on behalf of the appellant, based on the fact that title to the land occupied by the highway is now vested in the city under the \u201cMunicipal Act, 1913.\u201d When the lavatory was built, however, and the respondent\u2019s right to compensation accrued, the title was in the Crown, and the appellant cannot invoke the Act of 1913, which is not made retrospective. But, although the title to the soil under Parliament Street is now vested in the City, having regard to the trust upon which it is held, it cannot, in my opinion, be lawfully used without statutory authority as a site for a lavatory. The lavatory was not erected, and is not maintained, under any such pretended common law right of proprietorship, but in the exercise of the powers conferred by the statute; and for injury to land sustained as the result of the exercise of those powers, the legislature has given the right to compensation.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the award as to the item of $9,000, no complaint having been made as to the quantum, should be sustained.\nAs to the item of $1,200 allowed for damage due to seepage, I find no evidence in the record of any negligence in the planning or construction of the works, such as would be an abuse of the statutory powers or without the protection they afford. It may be that by additional works (Mr. Justice Riddell suggests a coat of waterproof cement on the walls of the claimant\u2019s shop) the seepage complained of could have been prevented. But the municipality\u2019s failure to undertake such additional works did not render it liable to an action for damages. The injury caused by the seepage seems to have \u201cnecessarily resulted\u201d from the exercise of the statutory powers of the municipal corporation within the meaning of section 437. On this branch of the case I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Masten.\nNo case was made for increasing the amount of the award as claimed by the cross-appeal. Indeed any error in the assessment of compensation would seem to me to be clearly in favour of the claimant. A more moderate award might have been accepted without appeal. The allowance of excessive compensation in cases such as this is calculated to discourage the undertaking of important public improvements.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor of the appellant: William Johnston.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Macdonald, Shepley, Donald & Mason.\n[1] 36 Ont.

W., liquidator of the company, brought action against B. for the value of said bricks.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (35 Ont. L.R. 402,) that the manufactured bricks were the property of the Company and B. was liable to account for their value.\nHeld, also, that B. was not entitled to set-off against the liquidator\u2019s claim the amount of the debentures of the company transferred to him as part of the price of the property.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], varying the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. Chrysler K.C. and McClemont for the appellant.\nA.C. McMaster for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I take no part in this judgment having been absent from court during a great portion of the argument.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the reasons of Mr. Justice Anglin for dismissing this appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The correct construction of the agreement in question, whether considered as an option or actual purchase, seems to me to fail to give the appellant, on its termination, any title to the bricks manufactured by the respondent company.\nThe appellant in taking possession of the lands upon which these bricks were situated was doing what he was rightly entitled to do, and his merely doing so did not assert, and I am by no means certain that in anything else he did relevant thereto he asserted, such dominion over the bricks in question as to be liable in trover.\nHis acts in completing the burning of such bricks as were being burnt in the kilns may have been of such a character as consistent with another view than that arising from such an assertion of dominion over them as to render him liable in trover.\nEven if he might be found so liable it would not render the property his until the respondent liquidator had assented thereto as the correct interpretation of what had transpired.\nThe liquidator served a demand for the possession of property which as such he was entitled to, and failed to receive a delivery pursuant thereto by appellant. At least such I take to be the facts, though strangely enough counsel for the appellant has alleged in his factum that there was no evidence of service of the demand, yet inconsistently in a previous part of the same factum, at page 6 thereof, the statement of events appears in which I find the following:\u2014\nOn or about the 25th day of April, the plaintiff Wade, hereinafter referred to as the liquidator, served upon the defendant a demand of possession of all the assets belonging to the estate of the Excelsior Brick Company.\nI have no doubt that at the trial when counsel for respondent stated the fact of service and filed notice everyone concerned proceeded upon the assumption that it had been served as stated. It is now rather late to start the inquiry anew for express proof.\nI am of the opinion that an action so founded and established, resulting in an assessment of damages and judgment therefor in favour of a liquidator, under the \u201cWinding-Up Act,\u201d does not in its result constitute a debt which may, under section 71 of said Act, be held one for the recovery of that which was \u201cdue at the commencement of the winding-up.\u201d\nThe claim to set off in respect thereof seems therefore, as does also that in respect of the notes for machinery, to be clearly untenable under said section.\nThe fact that under the \u201cJudicature Act\u201d a counterclaim, when established, may be set off against something allowed a plaintiff in same action, does not help appellant herein when the liquidator as trustee is limited to, and bound by, the express provision of the said section 71 to observe only such rules of set off as usually understood arising from the mutual relations of the company and its creditors or debtors as existent at the commencement of the winding-up proceedings.\nIt might, at the option of the company before that event, have been quite competent for it to have waived the tort if committed as urged in March, and sued for goods sold and delivered, but it was not compellable to adopt that course, and could have sued in tort when set off, as usually understood, would have been as to damages recovered in such a suit, out of the question.\nIn any way I can look at the matter there is no room for the application \u201cof the law of set off as administered by the courts\u201d of Ontario within the meaning of the said section 71.\nAs to the other clauses incidentally, as it were, set up in regard to a number of items, I see no reason for interfering therewith as finally disposed of by the courts below.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I see no reason to doubt that the substance of the brick, whether manufactured, or in the course of manufacture, had become so completely separated from the soil, and had been dealt with in such a manner as to give them the character of personal property, and the consequence follows, I think, that they were the property of the Excelsior Brick Co. The agreement of sale imposed upon the company the duty of carrying on the business which comprised, not only the manufacture, but the selling of brick; and it must have been contemplated that the purchasers should be entitled to deal with the brick once they had assumed that character as their own. Indeed, putting out of view any question as to other rights, and without attempting precisely to characterize the right of the company in the land derived from the agreement, it is perfectly clear that the company at least was entitled to possession, and to take clay for the purpose of making brick, and to manufacture it into brick. Putting this right at the lowest, treating it as mere profit \u00e0 prendre, it would confer upon the company a title to what was taken as soon, at least, as that was devoted to the purpose to which the company was entitled to apply it after actual separation from the soil. It would not follow that an amorphous heap of clay lying on the surface would become the property of the company, but to clay shaped into the form of bricks, and actually in process of manufacture, as such, the company would have a title. That being so, Mr. McMaster\u2019s argument convinces me that there was no error in Mr. Justice Middleton\u2019s estimate of the amount of damages to which the liquidator is entitled for conversion.\nThe important question in controversy is whether section 71 of the \u201cWinding-Up Act\u201d entitled the appellant to set off as against the liquidator\u2019s claim for conversion moneys due to him in respect of his debentures. Section 71 is in the following words:\u2014\nThe law of set-off, as administered by the courts, whether of law or equity, shall apply to all claims upon the estate of the company, and to all proceedings for the recovery of debts due or accruing due to the company at the commencement of the winding-up, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the business of the company was not being wound up under this Act. R.S., ch. 129, sec. 57.\nThe first condition which the appellant\u2019s claim must satisfy is that the claim the liquidator seeks to enforce was a claim due or accruing due at the commencement of the winding-up proceedings. I have come to the conclusion that this condition is fulfilled. The decision of the point turns on the question whether the evidence establishes wrongful conversion of the company\u2019s chattels before the commencement of the winding-up by the appellant. The appellant, acting within his rights under the agreement, by virtue of which the Excelsior Brick Co. occupied the premises on which the bricks were made, and from which the material was taken for making them, rightfully took possession of those premises, and was in possession of them when the winding-up proceedings began. It is an undisputed fact that when the appellant assumed possession of the premises, the chattel property in respect of the conversion of which the liquidator has recovered judgment for damages against him, passed into his physical control, indeed in a qualified sense passed into his possession.\nThat, I say, is indubitable. But here the critical point is, did he take possession of the chattels in this sense that the control he exercised over them was a control excluding recognition of the true owner\u2019s rights? It is obvious enough that complete possession of the premises might very well involve control over the chattels as against persons having no rightful authority to interfere with them without creating any impediment in the way of the owner in exercising his rights or involving any denial of those rights because the right of Crain to assume possession of the premises on default of payment of the purchase money would in the ordinary course lead, in the exercise of it, to such control over the chattels as would exclude trespassers from interfering with them until the company (the owner) should remove them. Repossessing himself therefore of the premises on which the chattels were, and thereby acquiring detentio in respect of the chattels is in itself, for our present purpose, a neutral circumstance.\nIf, however, with this circumstance there are coupled circumstances shewing an intention on Crain\u2019s part to reduce the chattels into his possession and to exclude the true owner therefrom existing at the time he repossessed himself of the land on which they were, then all the elements of the wrong of conversion are present; because every person is guilty of a conversion who, without lawful justification, takes a chattel out of the possession of any one else, and the act of assuming physical control, if done with the object of assuming possession as against persons rightfully entitled to possession and having possession in fact, is a taking within the meaning of the rule: Wilbraham v. Snow[2]; and it makes no difference, I think, whether the conduct of the taker relied upon to establish the existence at the critical moment of the animus possidendi is contemporaneous or subsequent conduct.\nThe conduct of the appellant disclosed by the evidence in the present case manifests very clearly an intention on his part to take possession, not merely of the land, but of the chattels as well, under a belief and a claim that they belonged to him and a cause of action for conversion thereupon immediately accrued to the company, although at the moment, the available evidence in support of it may have been scanty or insufficient.\nIt is, moreover, I think, immaterial that the claim is made and properly enough made by the liquidator in his own name. The liquidator sues in a fiduciary capacity. As Mr. Chrysler pointed out in his very able and most valuable argument, the persona of the company does not disappear upon the granting of the winding-up order or on the appointment of a liquidator (sec. 20 \u201cWinding-Up Act\u201d), and the liquidator sues as trustee for the company.\nI have been forced to the conclusion, however, that under a proper application of the provisions of the \u201cOntario Judicature Act,\u201d and Rules relating to set off and counterclaim, this case is not within section 71. I agree that there is much to be said in favour of the view that the substantial difference between the right of set off and the right of counterclaim has been greatly reduced by the Ontario rules. Where the object of both the action and the counterclaim is to enforce a pecuniary demand, and both are tried at the same time or proceedings either in the action or on the counteraction, there being no defence, are stayed until after the trial of the other, judgment is eventually given in favour of the plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, for the difference between the sums severally recovered. On the other hand, claims which might be the subject matter of counterclaim cannot be set up by way of defence, unless they fall also within the scope of the classes of claims which may be the subject of set off by force of the provisions of the \u201cJudicature Act\u201d (secs. 126-128). Still an undefended action where a counterclaim is set up may in the discretion of the court be stayed until the trial of the counterclaim. The authority of the court to stay is, of course, like every judicial authority to be exercised on principle, and it may therefore be said that in such cases the defendant has a right if in the circumstances it is, in the judgment of the court, just and convenient to have the undefended action stayed until the counterclaim is disposed of; and that being done he is entitled as of right to have the amount recovered on the counterclaim deducted, if it be the lesser sum, from the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled in the action.\nIt is nevertheless true that under the Ontario rules a defendant is not entitled ex debito justiti\u0153 to set up either in form or in substance by way of defence claims which, though proper subjects for counterclaim, are not permitted to be made subjects of set off. The right as regards the latter, on the other hand, does not rest in discretion of the court, but is ex debito justiti\u0153. It is no answer, I think, to this to say that the court has inherently and by express enactment in the \u201cJudicature Act\u201d and Rules power to strike out and otherwise deal with pleadings and issues as justice and convenience dictate. Set off in this regard seems to be upon the same footing as any other defence; and under the Ontario procedure the court would have no authority to strike out a defence set up by the pleadings or to postpone the consideration of such a defence until after judgment, except on the ground that the defence had no foundation in law or that the defendant was by the operation of some legal rule or principle precluded from relying upon it or on the ground that it was frivolous or vexatious. I think that cannot be affirmed of counterclaim without qualification.\nTurning now to section 71, I think the use of the word \u201cdebts\u201d is not without significance. It rather points, I think, to the strict sense of the word \u201cset off\u201d as fixing the scope of the section.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant, appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Division (unanimously affirming the judgment of Middleton J.) on two chief grounds: (1) that he is not liable for the sum of $6,300 awarded as damages for wrongful conversion of a quantity of brick, wrongfully held, he contends, to have been the property of the plaintiff company; and (2) that, if he is, he is entitled to set off against such liability the indebtedness to him of the plaintiff company in respect of $24,000 worth of debentures held by him and for a sum of $546.05 for which that company has been held liable to him in respect of certain other claims.\nIn view of the position taken throughout the trial by counsel representing him, viz., that he was liable to account to the plaintiffs or to pay damages for the bricks as having been admittedly wrongfully taken by him, I think the first ground of appeal is not open to the appellant. If it were, on the true construction of the agreement between him and Major Vane, I incline to the view that the manufactured brick on the premises belonged to the plaintiff company, and was not subject to the right of repossession which the defendant had in respect of the realty and other property.\nFor the appellant it was contended subsidiarily that he had been charged with damages for taking brick in course of manufacture whereas, according to his pretension, only brick of which the manufacture had been completed belonged to the plaintiff company, and brick in process of manufacture, at whatever stage, remained the property of the defendant and liable to seizure and re-possession by him under the terms of the Vane agreement. But it is abundantly clear that no allowance was in fact made to the plaintiffs for brick in process of manufacture because, although the total quantity of brick manufactured, and in course of manufacture, at the time of the seizure was shewn to be 691,000, the plaintiffs recovered only for 600,000 brick which was less than the quantity fully manufactured.\nThe right of set off asserted by the defendant in my opinion does not exist, both because the claim for damages for the conversion arose after the liquidation began, and therefore accrued to the liquidator, and also because, if it should be regarded as having arisen earlier in favour of the company, it and the defendant\u2019s claims against the company did not constitute \u201cmutual debts\u201d within the right of set off under secs. 126 and 127 of the \u201cJudicature Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1914, ch. 56. Notwithstanding the freedom allowed by the Ontario Rules of Practice in regard to matters of set-off and counterclaim, they remain in their essential nature different in that province, as is pointed out by Mr. Justice Osler in a very valuable judgment in Gates v. Seagram[3]; In Ontario, as elsewhere, only \u201cmutual debts\u201d which are properly the subject of set-off as distinguished from counterclaim fall within sec. 71 of the Dominion \u201cWinding-Up Act.\u201d\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the appeal fails on both grounds and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.M.

The title of the above property for which this note is given is not to pass, but to remain in the payee of this note until the note is paid, and in case of default in payment the payee shall be at liberty, without process of law, to take possession of and sell the said property and apply the proceeds upon this note, after deducting all costs of taking possession and sale.\nThe respondent had agreed to sell a brickyard plant, machinery, &c., to the Excelsior Company on certain terms and under those terms had some months after the company had taken possession and operated the brick works under the agreement, dispossessed them for default in payment of some of the instalments of the purchase money and re-entered into possession.\nThe brick press for which the note in question was given had been installed by the company as part of its plant and was at the time of plaintiff\u2019s re-entry being used by the company on the premises as part of its plant in the manufacture of brick.\nThe plaintiff having dispossessed the company and entered into possession continued operating the brick works and the brick press for which the note in question was given as part of his plant and property. The title or property in this \u201cpress\u201d had never passed from him.\nHe then, having both the title and the possession of the press, sued the surety as guarantor of the note claiming to have entered and possessed himself of the brick press not by virtue of the terms of sale under which he had sold it to the Excelsior Brick Company but under and by virtue of the terms of the agreement of sale of the brick works and premises made to that company, and having done so continued to use the four mould Boyd brick press in operating the brickyard.\nHis claim, as I understand it, is that having so re-entered and repossessed himself of the brickyard and plant including the brick press he became its possessor, not by virtue of any act by him under the terms of the sale of the brick press, but by virtue of the terms of the sale of the brickyard and plant to the company and that the terms of the sale of the brick press had no application to the property which he took possession of under his agreement with the Excelsior Company. In this way he seeks to avoid the terms of the defendant\u2019s guarantee which was expressly limited to the terms of the sale of the brick press.\nBy one of such terms plaintiff was entitled without process of law to \u201ctake possession of and sell\u201d the brick press in case of default in payment and apply the proceeds upon the note.\nThe defendant\u2019s contention is shortly that the plaintiff Crain has, by his conduct, after repossessing himself of the brick press, released him as surety from his liability on his guarantee and that Crain cannot under the circumstances hold the title and possession of the brick press and use and dispose of it as he pleases, while at the same time enforcing from him as surety the payment of its price.\nHe contends that, when Crain dispossessed the Excelsior Company and assumed the exclusive possession of the brick works, including the press, it became his duty under his contract with the defendant surety, not to continue the user of the brick press as part of the plant of the brick works, but as between him as vendor and defendant as guarantor to comply with the specific terms of the sale of the brick press as guaranteed and having repossessed himself either to hold it intact for the surety on payment of his obligation as surety or to sell it and apply the proceeds upon the note guaranteed.\nIn other words, that if Crain intended to look to the surety for the payment of the price of the press which he had guaranteed, he was bound to conform to the terms of the surety\u2019s contract guaranteeing the payment of the price and so bound to give the surety the \u201cpress\u201d which he had repossessed or to sell it and apply the proceeds upon the note.\nI do not see how Crain can successfully deprive the surety of one of the most important terms on which he became surety by saying: I did not repossess myself of the press the price of which you guaranteed by virtue of any of the terms of that guarantee but under my rights under another contract I had with the Excelsior Company to whom I had sold the press.\nWhen he had repossessed himself of the machine it does seem to me that before he can successfully sue the surety for the price he must shew compliance with the express terms of the surety\u2019s contract, which was a conditional one.\nInstead of doing so, he continued to use the press machine as part of his plant and thus while repossessing and enjoying the machine at the same time seeks to compel the surety to pay the price for which he sold it and payment of which the surety had conditionally guaranteed.\nHis conduct in continuing to use the press machine after he had repossessed himself of it instead of either holding it ready to hand over to the surety on payment of the price he had guaranteed or reselling it and crediting the proceeds upon the note guaranteed, operated as a substantial impairment of the sureties\u2019 rights, and being, as it seems to me, against equity and good conscience, discharged the surety from further liability.\nCosts should, of course, follow the result.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This case presents some novel features in its relevant facts, but it seems to me that having due regard to well recognized principles governing the rights of a surety and the relations between him and the creditor to whom he has guaranteed payment, the problem presented is not difficult of solution.\nIt is elementary law that one guaranteed is bound in law upon payment of the debt to transfer to the surety all the securities he may have ever held for the payment of the debt. If he has lost through neglect, or destroyed, any such security, he has lost thereby, pro tanto at least, his right to look to the surety.\nThe appellant here sold, conditionally, to a company of which the respondent was a director, a machine which he was, upon default of the terms of sale being complied with, entitled to repossess himself of and resell. Instead of holding himself in readiness to transfer this right to the surety and deliver up the machine to him on payment, he stoutly refuses to recognize this plain right of subrogation and insists upon the surety paying the debt and foregoing his right of subrogation.\nThat right of subrogation would carry with it the right of respondent on payment to remove the machine.\nThe matter would perhaps have been made clearer if the surety had tendered the money and demanded the delivery of the machine which had been in possession of the appellant for ten months before this action, and continued so thereafter.\nThe appellant\u2019s action in using the machine and attitude of claiming throughout that he had become the owner thereof by virtue of some bargain he had made with a company cognizant of all the facts, I must hold to constitute a waiver of his right to a tender of the money.\nThe respondent pleads this conduct and assertion of ownership, and appellant takes issue thereon. The learned trial judge has found these facts against him.\nHad appellant replied and proved that he was ready and willing to hand over the machine in as good state as it was at the time he became repossessed of it and insisted by such reply upon payment, I think he might have been entitled to succeed.\nHe neither pleaded nor proved such a state of facts; indeed proof had become impossible by reason of the continuous use of the machine by appellant meantime.\nThe respondent was not entitled to complain of the result of the company\u2019s use of the machine, or even its impairment by such use, for the respondent had full knowledge of the purpose for which it was bought and must have contemplated the probable consequences attendant upon such use. Had it even been accidentally destroyed by fire for example, in course of such use by the company, the respondent probably could not have been heard to complain or set up such fact in defence. It is only in relation to such use and its consequences that the fact of the respondent having been a director of the company is of the slighest importance in the case.\nThe questions involved herein have been needlessly confused by introducing the obligation of the company to the appellant as if the respondent and the company were identical parties, which in law they were not.\nIf the appellant had called upon the respondent at any time during the use of the machine by the company and he had chosen to pay them he would have been fully entitled to insist upon the transfer of the appellant\u2019s rights to remove it and getting that would have been entitled to remove the machine and have it sold as agreed.\nNo bargain between the corporate company and appellant could have been set up in answer to the exercise of such right.\nThe same result would have flowed from such a conditional bargain at common law when all concerned had full knowledge as here of the whole business and all relating thereto.\nThe only bearing of the \u201cConditional Sales Act\u201d in such matters is to make clear that such rights existed whether those affixing such a machine to the real estate had such notice and knowledge or not as that Act imputes to parties so acting under such circumstances as attendant upon a sale within the meaning and operation of the Act.\nThe appellant claims he had in his agreement which passed to the company a provision for the premises being kept up and if default made to be so returned in good condition and hence as it needs this machine to complete that condition and fulfil the terms nominated; in the bond it must be held by him on the premises so as to preserve him from suffering, no matter who is hurt.\nIf that was his purpose he should not have made a conditional, but an absolute, sale of the machine and then there might have ensued in law exactly what he contends for.\nBut, if he had tried that, the respondent, who is described as being a barrister, probably would have had enough knowledge of law to have refused to guarantee the notes in question under any such circumstances.\nThe appellant cannot have everything his own way and hope to succeed by binding separate parties by, means of conflicting agreements or what in law applicable to the resultant facts should constitute them conflicting agreements.\nOther people must be supposed to have some rights as well as those who want to have everything work out only their way.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014It will simplify the explanation of my view of this appeal to state, first, my opinion that the appellant had by force of the agreement of March, 1913, the right in taking possession of the plant and premises of the Excelsior Brick Co. Ltd. to take and retain as against the company the brick press for the price of which the promissory notes sued upon were given. Nor can there be any doubt that Crain, in retaining possession of this machine did so in professed and intended exercise of his rights under that agree- ment and not in professed or intended exercise of any rights given by the agreement under which the brick press was sold and delivered to the Excelsior Company.\nThe next point to be emphasized is this: In putting into effect his rights under the agreement of March, by retaining and using the machine as part of the plant of which he entered into possession, Crain was doing nothing inconsistent with any rights of the Excelsior Company created by the agreement under which the machine was sold or with the continued subsistence of the obligations of the company under that agreement.\nAll the parties to the last mentioned agreement including the sureties were, of course, aware of the agreement of March, and the provisions of it. Hoffman and Vane were both directors of the company. Crain had stipulated according to a common practice for the personal guarantee of these two directors and it was, of course, quite well understood that the machine was to be affixed to the premises in substitution for another machine, part of the plant which had become delapidated. The obligation of the company under the agreement of March, to maintain the plant and the right of Crain to take over the plant on default in its condition when default should occur were well understood by everybody. In these circumstances the machine was delivered by Crain to the company, under an agreement that the property was to remain his, until full payment of the purchase price, and that in default in payment of any instalment, he was to be entitled to resume possession and to sell the machine and to apply the proceeds on the unpaid balance. In all this there is implied a right on the part of the purchaser to retain possession of the machine until Crain takes possession pursuant to right expressly stipulated for in the contract or until the contract is, for some just cause, rescinded: so long as the contract remains on foot the company continues to be liable for the purchase price and has a right to retain possession until the contractual power of sale is put into operation. That, I think, is the effect of the contract: it is enough for our present purpose, however, to notice that, at all events, the contract contemplates possession of the machine on part of the purchaser and the right to use it so long as it remains in his possession and I am inclined to think there is nothing in the contract inconsistent with the transfer by the purchaser to a sub-purchaser of possession, subject to the rights of the seller and that such sub-purchaser would, so long as he remained in undisturbed possession, be acting within his rights in making use of the machine in the ordinary way. It is clear, at all events, that all parties intended that this machine should become part of the plant and that, as such, it should be affected by the agreement of March subject to any special rights of the sureties. The user by Crain, therefore, after taking over the plant in no way infringed as between himself and the company the rights of the company under the agreement for the sale of the machine, or impaired his own right to payment by the company of the price of it.\nThis being so, the respondent Hoffman, is not entitled to relief from the obligation of his contract of suretyship on the ground that the principal contract has been altered either explicitly or by the conduct of the parties or that it has ceased to be operative; and my conclusion is therefore that the judgment of the court below, by which the action was dismissed, cannot be sustained.\nIt does not follow, however, that the respondent surety is not entitled to some relief. I think it is very clear that he is entitled to relief on the principle of Pearl v. Deacon[2], as stated in the judgment of Turner L.J. at p. 463. The surety was, of course, prim\u00e2 facie, entitled to the benefit of the security provided by the contractual right of sale which Crain had reserved and that being so \u201cit is clear\u201d to use the language of Turner L.J. that the appellant\ncould not have released the property comprised in that security without losing his remedy against the surety, and if he could not have released it, could he by the exercise of a paramount right destroy the benefit of it?\nThere is nothing in the circumstances above mentioned in view of which all the parties must be supposed to have contracted and no doubt, in fact, did contract implying any abandonment on the part of the surety of his right to the benefit of the seller\u2019s power of sale or implying any subordination of the surety\u2019s rights (as distinguished from the company\u2019s) to rain\u2019s rights under the agreement of March. The result is that Crain is under an obligation to account to the surety for the value of the machine (Taylor v. Bank of New South Wales[3]), at pp. 602-603, in the condition in which it was at the time he first asserted his right to appropriate it as part of his plant freed from the rights created by the agreement of sale; the date, that is to say, when possession of the plant was taken under the agreement of March.\nANGLIN J.\u2014When the plaintiff took possession of the Boyd press machine for the payment of the price of which the defendant was a guarantor, he merely exercised an undoubted right either under his contract with the Excelsior Brick Company in respect of the machine itself or under his contract with Major Vane (transferred to that company) for the sale of the brick- yard, plant and premises. Had he done nothing more the defendant would have remained liable on his guarantee. Neither do I think it material under which contract possession was taken, because the liability of the defendant must in either case be determined by the terms of the only contract to which he was a party\u2014the contract of guarantee itself.\nThe defendant guaranteed payment of the sale note \u201cin accordance with the terms thereof,\u201d which I deem the equivalent of \u201con the faith of\u201d the principal contract or an express embodiment of its terms in the contract of suretyship. Where a surety so contracts all the terms of the principal contract become material as between him and the creditor, and any departure therefrom will discharge the surety without proof that his position has been thereby materially prejudiced or impaired, unless indeed it be self-evident without inquiry that the departure has been actually beneficial to him or at least immaterial. Holme v. Bronskill[4], at pages 504-5. Now a term of the contract guaranteed was that on default the vendor (plaintiff) should have the right\nto take possession of and sell the said property and apply the proceeds upon this note.\nHe could undoubtedly have done so and looked to the surety to pay any balance unsatisfied by such application. But when he proceeded instead of selling to make use of the machine as part of his own plant, he probably elected to disaffirm the contract of sale, and he certainly did something inconsistent with the rights of the defendant as a surety. Either because he should be deemed to have then intentionally elected to abandon his claim against the defendant for pay- ment of the price of the machine, or because, though not so intending, he unwarrantably interfered with the right of the defendant as surety, the latter, in my opinion, has been released. His right was to have the machine sold and the proceeds applied in reduction of the amount due on the guaranteed note. He was entitled to insist that the course prescribed by the contract should not be departed from without his consent. It cannot be suggested that the departure was to his advantage and it is not self-evident that it in nowise impaired his position. On the contrary, use of the machine would probably entail deterioration in its saleable value.\nMoreover, I am by no means satisfied that the user of the machine by the plaintiff and the assumption of the rights of unqualified ownership involved therein did not release the Excelsior Brick Company from liability on the note and preclude the plaintiff from ranking on its estate in liquidation,\u2014a right to which the defendant on payment would be entitled to be subrogated. If that was its effect the release of the surety would follow as a matter of course. Hewison v.

The contract entered into by a man whilst in a state of drunkenness is not void but only voidable., and is therefore capable of ratification by him, when he becomes sober; and the failure to repudiate such contract within a reasonable time, where the circumstances are such that in justice the right of option should be exercised with promptness, should be deemed tantamount to an express ratification. Duff J. dissented.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe issues raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nSymington K.C. for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014There appears to have been considerable divergence of opinion in the courts at different times as to the validity of a contract entered into by a man whilst in a state of intoxication. This is pointed out in a note to the case in the House of Lords of Butler v. Mulvihill[1]. The law as laid down in the Co. Litt. 247a is that\nas to a person who, by his own. vicious act, depriveth himself of his memory and understanding, as he that is drunk,\u2014that kind of non compos mentis shall give no privilege or benefit to him or his heirs.\nBut in Cooke & Clayworth[2], the Master of the Rolls said, he apprehended that a deed obtained from a man in such extreme state of intoxication as to deprive him of his reason would be invalid at law. This was followed in other cases.\nHowever, I think the law must be taken now to be as laid down in Matthews v. Baxter[3], that the contract of a drunken man is not void but voidable only.\nWhat is only voidable and not void cannot be held as invalid until it has been rescinded. It is not enough to avoid the contract, that nothing is done to affirm it, it must be disaffirmed. In Deposit Life Assurance Co. v. Ayscough[4], the defence was that the contract was induced by fraud and Lord Campbell C.J. said:\u2014\nIt is now well settled that a contract tainted by fraud is not void, but only voidable at the election of the party defrauded. There is nothing on this record to shew that the defendant has avoided the contract by which he became a shareholder. He had a right, if he pleased, notwithstanding the fraud, to keep the shares and receive the dividends: and he may have intended to do so. The plea, therefore, should go further and shew, not only that he was induced to become a shareholder through fraud, but that on discovering the fraud he disaffirmed the transfer of the shares to him. In Newry and Enniskillen Railway Co. v. Coombe[5], the plea was infancy, and that the defendant, whilst an infant, disaffirmed the transfer. It was held that, if the defendant, after coming of age, affirmed the transfer, that would be a matter for replication, and need not be negatived in the plea; but there, the plea shewed the transfer void, unless an affirmative act were done to render it valid; here it shews the transfer valid, unless an act was done to avoid it.\"\nIn Oakes v. Turquand[6], which was also a case of fraud, it was held that a party defrauded may rescind the contract, but he must do so within a reasonable time.\nThe courts can look with no favour on the defence of incapacity through drunkenness, and will certainly extend to the defendant in such case no greater privilege than to one induced to enter into the contract through fraud.\nThe respondent, if he meant to avail himself of the privilege allowed him by the law of avoiding the contract by pleading \"his own vicious act,\" was bound to disaffirm and to do so promptly. The fact is that he did nothing for more than a month. He was not entitled to wait and see whether the price of wheat went up or down, and disaffirm or affirm the contract accordingly.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014Ever since the case of Matthews v. Baxter[7], in 1873 was decided, the law has been settled that the contract of a man too drunk to know what he was about when entering into it, is voidable and not void, and therefore capable of ratification by him when he becomes sober.\nSuch a contract is on the same footing as a contract made by a person of unsound mind, whose mental incapacity, in order to avoid the contract, must be known to the other of the contracting parties. Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone[8].\nIn the case before us the respondent entered into a contract with the appellants for the sale to them of a quantity of wheat for future delivery at a certain price, and it was found by the trial judge as a fact that, when he did so, he was drunk to the knowledge of the agent with whom he made the contract in the sense of not being capable of fully appreciating the transaction.\nThe question on this appeal therefore was whether he had elected not to repudiate the contract within a reasonable time after he became sober and had full knowledge of his contract.\nThe contract being voidable only and full knowledge of its nature and terms, and that he had entered into it being brought home to him the day after he entered into it when he was perfectly sober, he was bound, in my opinion, within a reasonable time thereafter to repudiate it if he desired to do so, or at any rate if he delayed making any election with regard to it to do so at his peril if such delay causes loss or damage to the other party.\nThe contract was one relating to the sale of grain, a commodity varying in price from day to day, and this necessarily constitutes an important element in determining what would be an unreasonable time for him to wait before attempting to repudiate. He had knowledge on the third or fourth of October, some days after he entered into the contract, that the plaintiffs considered the contract a good and binding one. He knew all about wheat, its varying price in the market, and what a speculative contract he had entered into.\nLater in the month of October he was again advised by the plaintiffs as to the shipment of the grain he had agreed to sell. He took no action for delivery, evidently awaiting to see what the market price would be. If the price of grain fell, he stood to win by holding to the contract. If it rose in price he stood to lose. He waited till the sixth of November, when the price had gone up substantially, and then he took his first step towards repudiating.\nIn my opinion, looking to the speculative character of the article he had agreed to sell and deliver at a future date, he was then too late. By his continued silence during the whole month of October, and up to the sixth of November, he must, in my opinion, under the facts as proved, be taken to have affirmed the contract originally voidable.\nIf the market had fallen I cannot entertain a doubt that he would have elected to affirm and claim the price his contract called for.\nHe waited an unreasonable time under the circumstances before repudiating, and will be held therefore to have affirmed.\nBut it is contended that the defendant, having been found to have entered into the contract while drunk, with the knowledge of the plaintiffs' agent, the contract must be held to have been obtained by fraud and had not been affirmed.\nIn cases of contracts obtained by fraud it was held by the Exchequer Chamber in Clough v. London and North Western Railway Co.[9], at p. 35, that:\u2014\nthe question is, has the person on whom the fraud was practised, having notice of the fraud, elected not to avoid the contract? or has he elected to avoid it? or has he made no election?\nThey go on to say:\u2014\u2014\nWe think that so long as he has made no election he retains the right to determine it either way, subject to this, that if in the interval, whilst he is deliberating, an innocent third party has acquired an interest in the property, or if in consequence of his delay the position even of the wrongdoer is affected, it will preclude him from exercising his right to rescind.\nNow I cannot doubt in this case that even if it was held that defendant's conduct up to the time of the sale by the plaintiffs did not amount to an election one way or the other the consequence of his delay seriously affected and prejudiced the plaintiffs, who, in the ordinary course of business, sold the grain which the defendant had agreed to sell, and deliver to them, at a loss which they now seek to recover, and that this consequence of defendant's delay precluded him from afterwards exercising his right to rescind.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here, and in the court appealed from, and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nThe condition of the respondent, when he signed the agreement of the 30th of September, to sell appellant his wheat, was such (to the knowledge of the latter's agent) as to entitle him upon the receipt of the appellant's confirmation thereof, to repudiate the contract.\nThe contract bound appellant from the moment respondent received that confirmation and he alone having the option, could not hold the other an unreasonable length of time in such suspensory condition.\nThere is ample authority that lapse of time with full knowledge of the facts such as the learned trial judge has found herein that the respondent had, may furnish such evidence of acquiescence on the part of him entitled to repudiate a voidable contract as an election not to exercise his option and deprive him thereof.\nEach case must be determined upon a due consideration, of what is reasonable in the circumstances.\nThe argument that there must be some affirmation or ratification communicated to the other party by him having such an option, seems to be quite untenable. If the surrounding facts and circumstances are such as render prompt repudiation a duty resting upon him who desires to exercise his option in such a case then an unreasonable length of time taken to communicate his decision when there is nothing in the case excusing him from doing so, binds the court, I think, in law, to hold him to have determined to abide by his contract.\nI think, in this case, no fair minded man could have refrained from responding to the confirmation received, and read when sober, unless upon the hypothesis that he had decided not to exercise his option.\nA month's consideration was far more than necessary, and but for the rising market, I suspect the respondent never would have had any hesitation, and would not have needed the appellant's letter of the 20th October, reminding him of his duty.\nWhy did he not answer that communication? Was it because he felt he could sell for a higher price? Possibly in fact he did and realized a handsome profit exceeding appellant's loss.\nFair dealing between men is what I think the law aims at in such cases as this.\nTo infer acquiescence from respondent's failure early in October, upon reading the communication of appellant, to exercise his option, proceeds upon that view.\nUnfortunately the development of the law upon the subject has been of that misleading character, that though great lawyers held that a contract by a man so drunk as to be incapable of understanding what he was about was void, as shewn (in 1845) by Gore v. Gibson[10], and earlier cases yet in Molton v. Camrbux[11], the results of a contract with a lunatic were treated differ- ently and then (1873) in Matthews v. Baxter[12], on a demurrer to a replication which affirmed that after the defendant became sober, and able to transact business, he ratified and confirmed the contract, the replication was held good and the learned judges tried to explain away the prior judicial expressions relative to the like contract, and held it was only voidable at the option of the drunken man.\nI have assumed this latter decision to express the law as existing now, but that is very far from supporting the proposition, seemingly assumed below, that some overt act of ratification communicating to the other party to the contract the decision or election of the drunken man is necessary.\nAll that was decided in Matthews v. Baxter12 was that actual ratification as pleaded was a good answer. It did not decide the converse that ratification was necessary.\nIt simply implies that as you cannot ratify a void contract, it must be now held as result of the decision that the contract of a drunken man is not void, but merely voidable. And to avoid it repudiation is necessary.\nAnd hence it must be treated as other voidable contracts of a like nature in law. The cases of fraud which enable one party to a contract to repudiate it are analogous, and in such cases the necessity for exercising the right of repudiation within a reasonable time after discovery of the fraud has been many times affirmed.\nThere so frequently occur circumstances excusing delay that no other rule can be laid down than to insist upon a reasonable course of conduct and that implies regard for the rights of others. To maintain the judgment appealed from herein, would enable the drunken man to practise in such like cases the grossest fraud with impunity.\nTo bind him, as I submit the law requires, to repudiate if he desire within a reasonable time on discovery-protects both and promotes fair dealing.\nA due observance of such principles requires the allowance of this appeal.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014After a good deal of doubt on the question whether the respondent is entitled to succeed for the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice McCarthy, with which Mr. Justice Stuart concurred, I have come to the conclusion that those reasons ought to be given effect to, and, although I think the appeal fails on other grounds which do not depend upon those reasons, I think it is right to state the fact of my concurrence in them. Voidable, as applied to contracts, is not unambiguous. Among common lawyers it is used indifferently to express the fact that a contract or transaction ex facie valid, which somebody, nevertheless, is entitled, at his option, to treat as not binding, is in truth valid until the person so entitled has done what amounts in law to an election to treat it as null; and to express the fact that a contract or transaction ex facie subsisting is, vis \u00e0 vis one of the apparent parties to it, of no legal effect until he does something which amounts to an election on his part to adopt it as binding upon him or to enforce it against somebody else.\nAnd, therefore, when it is said that a contract between a person of unsound mind or drunk and being in such a condition as not to appreciate what he is doing, and another who knows his condition, is voidable at the option of the former, the statement is ambiguous. The rule of the Roman law appears to have been that where incapacity arising from infancy or unsoundness of mind existed, there was no contract of which the law could take notice because of the absence of assensus.\nThe course of development in the English law of the rule governing the rights of a person entering into a contract or going through the form of entering into a contract while insane is very clearly traced in the judgment of Fry L.J. in The Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone[13]. Under the old rule the incapable person was by law precluded from setting up his incapacity in answer to an action on the so-called contract. Under the modern rule this disability is removed where it is shewn that the other party had at the time of the transaction knowledge of the incapacity of the other.\nThe rule thus stated is consistent with two diverse theories concerning the true juridical character of the act or acts upon which the action is based. The law may regard the seeming contract as having no legal effect as against the party having the right to deny its validity until such party ratifies it, but as becoming, on such ratification, a binding contract. On the other hand, what occurred may be treated as a contract capable of being invalidated at the option of the person entitled to dispute it, but valid unless and until rescinded by him.\nThere is no decision which authoritatively sanctions either of these two conflicting theories to the exclusion of the other. The more logical view would appear to be, however, that, there being an absence of capacity to assent and consequently no assent, there is no contract at all until assent is supplied by something amounting to ratification. This view is not inconsistent with that branch of the rule which enables the temporarily incapable person, once he has recovered his capacity, to hold the other party to the apparent bargain, because this may be regarded as a just consequence of the unconsciencious conduct of the latter in attempting to bring about a contract with a person knowing him to be incapable of understanding what he was doing, and indeed this is the plight in which, as a general rule, a person contracting with an infant finds himself or may find himself, though ignorant of the fact of non-age and having no reason to suspect it. The language of the judges who decided Matthews v. Baxter[14], as well as the language of text writers (see, e.g., Anson on Contracts, p. 151), points to this as the more generally held theory.\nThe distinction is plain, of course, between cases where there is no consent because of no capacity to consent and cases in which there is true consent, but consent brought about by such means or arising under such circumstances as to entitle one of the parties to disaffirm the transaction; and in the case, it may be observed, of the temporary lunatic or the drunkard, the above-mentioned considerations have even greater force than in the case of the infant, for in the former cases absence of assent is a fact, the incapacity is an incapacity in fact, while in the case of the infant there may be and in most instances there is, no doubt, a real assent in fact. In Oakes v. Turquand[15], sit p. 375, the judgment of Lord Colonsay points to the distinction existing between the force of the word voidable as applied to contracts entered into by a person sui juris but procured by fraud and as applied, on the other hand, to the contracts of incapable persons. I quote the passage:\u2014\nA contract obtained by fraud is voidable, but not void; does it mean void till ratified, or valid till rescinded? The latter is the rule where the rights of a third party intervene. That I hold to be clearly the import of the doctrine that a contract induced by fraud is not void but voidable. I hold that the appellant did agree to become a member of the company. He may not have been induced to agree by fraud, but, having regard to the language of the statute, what we have to look to is this, whether he has agreed to become a member or not. It might be a different case, and would be a different case, in regard to a party who had no power, no will, to give an assent, such as an insane person or a pupil.\nIt is no answer to this to say that the law regards as actual fraud the conduct of a person who procures a seeming contract from a drunken person or a person temporarily insane, to such a degree as not to know the nature or effect of the transaction he is purporting to take part in. It has been held, and, in my judgment, rightly held, that conduct such as that of the agent of the appellant company disclosed by the evidence before us is fraud in fact\u2014and fraud indeed of a very odious kind\u2014not in contemplation of law merely. The argument presented on behalf of the appellant company is that because the conduct of the other party in acting with knowledge of the incapacity of the person sought to be charged is an essential element in the latter's defence, therefore the transaction, which in fact never was a contract, because the hypothesis is that there never was any assent in fact, must be treated in law as belonging to the class of true contracts resting upon an actual assensus ad idem, but capable of disaffirmance by reason of fraud. But what justification can there be for erecting this fiction of assent? I can see no reason for it and there is certainly no authority for it. On the other hand, the view which has found acceptance in the court below can be rested on grounds which are simplicity itself\u2014 the knowledge possessed by the capable person of the other's incapacity entitles the temporarily incapable person to set up the temporary incapacity and at the same time precludes the capable party from denying that there was a contract in fact if the other, after he has recovered his capacity, chooses to affirm it. That is a view which appears to be consonant not only with sound theory but with justice and convenience as well.\nBut I propose to consider the appellant company's rights upon the hypothesis also that the so-called contract of the drunkard or of the person temporarily insane falls within the other class of voidable contracts, namely, contracts which are capable of being disaffirmed by one of the parties, but until disaffirmed are valid. On behalf of the appellant company it is contended that the so-called contract of a drunkard, the other party having knowledge of his condition, are binding upon the drunkard unless disaffirmed by him, and that the rules governing this right of disaffirmance are the same as those which govern the right to rescind a contract on the ground that it was obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation, and I shall consider the grounds upon which the appeal is based on that hypothesis.\n- The respondent, it is said, first in fact elected to affirm the contract, and secondly, by his conduct, precluded himself from disaffirming the contract, because (a) he delayed his disaffirmance for an unreasonable time, (b) by his conduct he led the appellant company reasonably to believe that he intended to affirm the contract, upon which belief they acted to their prejudice, (c) by reason of his delay the position of the appellant company was prejudicially affected in a substantial degree.\nThese contentions raise questions of law and of fact. First, as to the law. The common law doctrine on the subject is explained and discussed in several cases. I shall refer in particular to the judgments of the Exchequer Chamber in Clough v. London and Northwestern Railway Co.[16]; Morrison v. The Universal Marine Ins. Co.[17], which must be read with the judgment of Lord Blackburn in Scarf v. Jardine[18], at page 361; the judgment of the Privy Council in The United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Brunet[19]; and the judgments of the Law Lords in Aaron's Reefs v. Twiss[20]. I shall deal first with the contention that the proper conclusion from the evidence is that the respondent, before the action was brought, elected to affirm the so-called contract.\nElection is something more than the mere mental operation; choice in itself is not sufficient, as Lord Blackburn said in Scarf v. Jardine18, at pp. 360 and 361,\nwhere a party in his own mind had thought that he would choose one of two remedies, even though he has written it down on a memorandum or has indicated it in some other way, that alone will not bind him.\nThe choice must be expressed by words or by unequivocal act.\nThe determination of a man's election shall be by express words or by act:\nClough v. London and North-Western Railway Co.16, at p. 34; \"act\" is explained in the same judgment to mean unequivocal act, and in Scarf v. Jardine18, at p. 361, Lord Blackburn explains unequivocal act to mean\nAn act which would be justifiable if he had elected one way and would not be justfiable if he had elected the other way.\nElection, therefore, involves the determination to adopt a given course and the manifestation of that determination by words or by act \"under circumstances which bind\" the person alleged to have made his election (Clough v. London and North-Western Railway Co.[21], at p. 35). Lord Blackburn does indeed say, in his judgment in Scarf v. Jardine[22], at p. 361, that,\nwhether he intended it or not if he has done an unequivocal act * * * the fact of his having done the unequivocal act to the knowledge of the persons concerned is an election.\nOn the other hand, the Court of Exchequer Chamber, in Morrison v. Universal Marine Ins. Co.[23], at page 207, held that\nif there really was no election, it is wholly immaterial whether the plaintiff understood or had a right to understand the conduct of the defendant as amounting to an election unless under that belief he altered his position.\nIt appears that this was not the view of Bramwell B., see Croft v. Lumley[24], at page 705, and Morrison's Case23, at page 206, or, as already intimated, of Lord Blackburn. In the view I take of this appeal it will not be necessary to consider whether the opinion expressed by the Exchequer Chamber in Morrison's Case23 on this point is part of the ratio decidendi and binding upon us because the appellant company has quite failed to shew either words or anything which in any view could be described as an unequivocal act evidencing the existence of a determination on part of the respondent to affirm the contract. The conduct of the respondent relevant to the point now under discussion\u2014was there in fact an election to affirm\u2014may be briefly described: The so-called contract is found in a document signed by the respondent and witnessed by the appellant company's agent Simpson, on the 30th September, by which the respondent undertook to sell certain wheat to the appellant company. The document was signed in duplicate, one of the duplicates being handed to the respondent by the agent and afterwards discovered by himself or his wife in his pockets. The document does not in itself evidence a contract because it contains no evidence of assent on part of the appellant company; that, how ever, was supplied some days after the appellant had recovered from his spree by a letter from the appellant company, which in fact was the first communication to the respondent, so far as the evidence shews, of any declaration on behalf of the appellant company that they were contracting with him to purchase what he was promising to sell. The respondent took no steps to carry out the contract. On the 20th October (the wheat had been sold for October delivery) the appellant company wrote him saying that he was probably too late for October delivery, and was too late in fact unless the cars were already en route, and suggested that the sale should be transferred to November delivery. The respondent made no reply. In the meantime the respondent had learned of the fact that he had signed some paper while he was in a state of drunkenness, but there is no evidence to shew when he learned (and there was no cross-examination on the point) that his state of drunkenness was of such a character as to make it apparent to the appellant company's agent that he was unable to understand what he was about. I pause here to point out that the appellant company down to the conclusion of the trial insisted, in the first place, that the respondent was capable of understanding what he was about, and, in the second place, if he was not, that the agent Simpson believed and properly believed that he was not incapable of transacting business. In these circumstances it was strictly incumbent upon the appellant company to ascertain by cross-examination of the respondent when he became aware of the fact essential to his right of rescission that Simpson, the appellant's agent, knew he was unfit to transact business; for the appellant company's plea of election cannot succeed unless it is at least shewn and affirmatively shewn that the conduct relied upon as constituting election or evidencing election was pursued in light of precise cognizance by the respondent of the material facts entitling him to disaffirm. Wilson v. Thornbury[25]; Jarrett v. Kennedy[26]; Lachlan v. Reynolds[27]. I am assuming that knowledge of facts being proved a knowledge of the right to rescind resting on the common law rule above-mentioned may be presumed, but knowledge of all the essential facts is necessary, and, in view of the position taken by the appellant company, it was incumbent, as I have said, upon them to shew this essential fact by cross-examination if necessary: see Lord Davy's judgment in Aaron's Reefs v. Twiss[28], at page 295.\nIs there, then, evidence of an actual determination by the respondent not to exercise his right of rescission? This is a question of fact. What must be proved is conduct which clearly establishes that the respondent did in fact determine to affirm the contract after he had learned the material facts entitling him to disaffirm it. The evidence to the effect that he had casually remarked that he had sold his wheat may be rejected (if for no other reason) because it is altogether too vague to be of any value. I shall have something to say presently as to the legal effect of such a casual remark made to a stranger. Nothing remains but delay. Upon that a certain amount of precision is necessary in justice to the respondent. It is quite plain that some time before the 20th October, that is to say, within three weeks after the signing of the so-called contract and probably within two weeks after the receipt of the so-called confirmation, and one may reasonably surmise not more than a week or ten days after the respondent had obtained any kind of definite information as to the circumstances of the signing of the document relied upon by the appellant company (one must at least presume this against the appellant company, on whom the onus of proof lay, and whose counsel deliberately refrained from cross-examining on the point) the respondent had decided not to carry the so-called contract into execution. The appellant company has refrained from giving evidence on the point, although their agent Simpson was called, and it is impossible to suppose that he was not aware of the facts, but the company's own letter of the 20th October is sufficient evidence that, in order to fulfil the terms of the contract (time was, of course, of the essence of it), it was necessary that the respondent should begin his preparatory steps some days, at all events, anterior to that date. \"Of course,\" they say, \"you will not be able to make October delivery unless you have the cars on the road now.\" The tenor of the letter makes it quite plain that the appellant company had no doubt whatever that October delivery would not be made, that is to say, delivery in execution of the contract and, in the absence of evidence ]to the contrary, it must be assumed against them that they, through their agent, were perfectly aware that the cars were not en route and that the respondent had taken no steps to that end.\nIn these circumstances it seems to be idle to suggest that there is any proof of an actual determination by the respondent not to rescind. Such period as elapsed from the time when the respondent became aware, on the receipt of the so-called letter of confirmation, that the appellant company were treating this piece of trickery as a matter of serious business down to the time when he must have known that failure to make preparations would involve default on his part if he was under a binding contract to deliver in October is reasonably accounted for by assuming that his attention was engaged during that period, first, in discovering the facts or endeavouring to discover them and the evidence available to prove them; secondly, in ascertaining what his rights were; and, again, in deciding, once having arrived at the conclusion that he could treat the document signed by him as a nullity, whether it would be more favourable to his interests to treat the transaction as binding on him or not.\nThat he was in fact waiting, before committing himself to affirm or disaffirm, to ascertain the course of the market is one of the contentions put forward on behalf of the appellant company. If he did so, that is, of course, conclusive against anything like election in fact to affirm.\nIndeed, where a contract has been procured by fraud and the wrongdoer seeks to fasten the liability upon the person wronged on the ground that he has elected against rescission and where the contract has remained executory, that is to say, where nothing has passed to the person defrauded which it would be his duty to give up on the exercise of his right to rescind, where nothing has been done by the wrongdoer in the execution of the contract, that is to say, nothing which he was bound by the terms of the contract to do, where these conditions are present the instances must be rare in which lapse of time per se, however great, would constitute sufficient evidence of an election not to rescind. What is there, in such circumstances, in the conduct of the defrauded person inconsistent with the exercise of his right (when the defrauder seeks the aid of the court to profit by his wrong) to declare that the contract is not binding because it was procured by fraud? Ex hypothesi, the defrauder knows that he is not entitled to enforce the contract, and that repudiation is one of the risks he must face. The victim of the fraud is assumed to know that also. Why should the victim not sit down and await attack? Why should it be inferred, from the fact that he has done so, that he has given up his right to repudiate?\nThe statement in the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Clough v. London and North-Western Rly. Co.[29], that lapse of time without rescinding will furnish evidence that the victim has determined to affirm the contract was used with reference to the case of a contract in part executed by the delivery of the goods on the one hand and by the payment in part of the price on the other, and I have found no case where it was a question of rescission on the ground of fraud of a contract which has remained wholly executory in which lapse of time alone has actually been held to amount to such evidence of the determination to affirm. I am inclined to think that the law is correctly stated in Mr. Spencer Bower's Actionable Misrepresentation, at p. 282, paragraph 321, in the following terms:\u2014\nDelay, laches, and acquiescence are constantly referred to in connection with proceedings for rescission as if, of themselves, they constituted affirmative defences thereto. This is quite a mistake. And it is a still greater error to use these expressions (as the term \"laches\" in particular is frequently used) with an underlying suggestion that the representee owes a duty to the representor in the matter, the failure to discharge which renders him \"guilty\" of conduct which, of itself, raises a personal equity against him in favour of the representor. The only legal consequence of the representee's inaction is either to furnish some evidence, with other facts, in support of a plea of knowledge, or affirmation, against himself, or to give scope for the intervention of the jus tertii, or of the plea of inability to make specific restitution to the representor; but where the inaction, for however long a period it extends, is not sufficient to constitute such evidence, or where, notwithstanding the lapse of time, no innocent person has in fact acquired rights or interests under the contracts sought to be set aside, and the property to be restored to the representor, as the condition of rescission, can be so restored in the same plight as that in which it was received, the delay, laches, or so-called \"acquiescence\" goes for nothing\u2014which is tantamount to saying that, per se, these matters constitute no defence.\nIt is true that in the treatise on Misrepresentation and Fraud, in Lord Halsbury's collection, of which Mr. Spencer Bower is the author, published in 1911, paragraph 1771, vol. 20, p. 752, it is stated that, with other facts or \"even without them, delay, if very great, may constitute evidence of affirmation,\" but the authorities cited for the proposition are Clough's Case[30], Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd[31], and Aaron's Reefs Case[32], in every one of which the contract had at least in part been executed; and the observations of the law Lords in the last-mentioned case, and especially the observations of Lord Macnaghten and Lord Davey, seem to indicate that in their opinion where the obligation sued upon had assumed the form of a debt simpliciter, the supposed debtor intending to rescind on the ground of fraud was entitled, in the absence of special circumstances, to sit down and await attack, and that consequently no inference could arise against him from failure to take active steps towards repudiation.\nIt is argued, however, that there are special circumstances here which, added to the respondent's inaction, support the suggested inference. It is said, first, that the respondent must have been aware of the practice of the appellant company making sales against their purchases as soon as the purchases were made and relying upon the purchases to enable them to fulfil their contracts of sale; and, moreover, that the letter of confirmation received a few days after the date of the so-called contract must have apprised the respondent of the fact that the appellant company were in this particular case relying upon the transaction as a genuine purchase. There is no evidence as to the respondent's knowledge, since counsel for the appellant company did not venture to cross-examine him on the point, and it seems an extraordinary thing to ask this court to presume such knowledge in the absence of any suggestion in the evidence. As to the letter of confirmation, here again the cross-examiner was too timid. Counsel for the appellant company suggests in his factum that the respondent must have known, when he received that letter, that the Winnipeg officials of the company were unaware of the trick that had been played upon him. That is a contention which, if it was to be insisted upon, should have been raised at the trial and pressed in cross-examination.\nBut it is surely extravagant to suggest that any inference can be founded upon the silence of such a man as this respondent in these circumstances, even granting the assumptions upon which the appellant company's counsel asks us to proceed. The respondent was at least aware of this, that the one person who was acquainted with the material facts was the appellant company's agent Simpson, the material facts, that is to say, not only of the impugned transaction itself, but touching the appellant company's business practice and the risks, if any, they were taking in treating this contract as an enforceable sale, and if we are to speculate as to what was passing in the respondent's mind, without the benefit of his own explanations, why should we suppose him to have assumed that their agent would not protect the appellant company by giving them full information?\nThe next subdivision of this topic concerns the question whether, assuming there is some evidence of a determination not to rescind, there is any evidence of expression by word or by act of that intention in such a way as to constitute an election within the meaning of the law. Expression by word there was none, since the casual conversation already referred to cannot be brought within that category. There was no communication to the other party concerned, and it is impossible to affirm that such a vague casual expression uttered in such circumstances was uttered, to use the language of Bramwell B, in Croft v. Lumley[33], \"under circumstances which bind him.\" I have already said sufficient to shew that the respondent's inaction did not fall within Lord Blackburn's definition of unequivocal act in Scarf v. Jardine[34], at page 361, \"An act which would be justifiable if he had elected one way and would not be justifiable if he had elected the other way,\" or within Baron Bramwell's language in the passage quoted in the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Clough's Case[35], with approval: \"Act inconsistent with his avoiding.\"\nThis much the law makes clear, that the determination of the victim's choice alone does not in itself constitute election. The law does not, as I have already said, take note of subjective events in the stream of consciousness save in relation to or as manifested by some external word or deed. See Clough's Case35, at pages 34 and 35; Morrison's Case[36], at pages 203, 204, 205 and 206. In what circumstances the expression of an actual intention to take one course or the other, adequate in itself, but not communicated to the other party concerned, is sufficient to constitute an election in such case as this does not concern us here. Nor are we concerned with the question suggested by a comparison of the judgment of Lord Blackburn in Scarf v. Jardine[37], with the judgment of the Court in the Exchequer Chamber in Morrison's Case36, whether (there having been no intention in fact to elect) an election is constituted by an act unequivocal in the sense in which Lord Blackburn used the word in Scarf v. Jardine37, at page 361, knowledge of which has been communicated to the wrongdoer; or whether, in addition to that, the wrongdoer must be shewn to have changed his position in consequence of the defrauded party's act, and to have done so reasonably on the faith of the victim having made an election in fact. (See Morrison's Case(2).)\nI come now to consider whether, under the three alternatives above mentioned, the appellant company have shewn that the respondent has precluded himself from disaffirming. First, then, has he so precluded himself because he delayed his disaffirmance for an unreasonable time?\nThe conclusion I come to is that there is no absolute rule of law that a party to a voidable contract entitled to avoid it on the ground that it was procured by fraud will be held to have elected not to do so by reason solely of the lapse of time without disaffirmance so long as the contract remains wholly executory.\nI emphasize the fact that I am discussing only those cases where no property has passed, where possession of nothing has been obtained, that is to say, where the party seeking to avoid the contract has acquired nothing which it would be his duty to give up and where the party guilty of the fraud has done nothing in performance of the contract which the contract required him to do. Such cases must, of course, be distinguished from cases where the party defrauded has received some benefit under the contract which it would be his duty to give up on disaffirmance, or where, as in the case of an allotment of shares in a joint stock company, the party defrauded has, by acquiring the shares, at the same time acquired a status involving obligations or potential obligations to third persons.\nI ought perhaps to mention that in Aaron's Reefs Case[38], Lord Watson and Lord Herschell pointed out that the defrauded person was not seeking the aid of the court to rescind the contract; \"he is merely resisting its enforcement by the party guilty of the fraud\"; and even in cases in which the actual interference of a court of equity is sought, as was laid down in Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co.[39] (I refer to the judgment of Lord Penzance at page 1231), delay is only material, first, as affording evidence of waiver of the right to rescind because in the circumstances it may imply acquiescence or seem as making it practically unjust to give a remedy.\nIn the elaborate discussion in Clough's Case[40], by Lord Blackburn, then Blackburn J., there is no suggestion of the existence of any such rule; and in Morrison v. Universal Marine Ins. Co. [41], in the Exchequer Chamber (Mr. Justice Blackburn, being one of the court), it is said, at page 205:\u2014\nThe learned judge further told the jury that they were to consider whether the election was exercised within a reasonable time, telling them that the party to elect must do so within a reasonable time. It is not necessary to consider whether this direction is correct or whether the party entitled to elect may not do so at any time, unless in the meantime he has elected to affirm the contract, or unless the rights of third parties have intervened, or the other party to the contract has altered his position, under the belief that the contract was a subsisting one; for, if the latter be the correct view, the direction of the learned judge was too favourable to the plaintiff, and of course he cannot complain of it.\nIf, indeed, it had appeared that, in consequence of the delay and of the absence of protest by the defendants, the plaintiff's position had been altered, and he had thereby been induced to believe that the defendants intended to waive their right to avoid the contract of insurance, and had consequently abstained from effecting insurance elsewhere, we should probably have thought that, though there had been in fact no exercise by the defendants of their right of election, the case fell within the view taken in Clough v. L. & N.W. Rly. Co.(1), and that this question ought to have been submitted to the jury. But, in truth, although the plaintiff was examined as a witness on his own behalf, he did not assert that he was induced by the defendants' conduct to think the policy a binding one, and consequently abstained from effecting a fresh policy.\nOne must not overlook the fact that in Morrison's Case41, as well as in Clough's Case40, the Exchequer Chamber was dealing with a contract which had been in part executed. In Morrison's Case41, indeed, not only had the insurance company received the premium, but, after knowledge of the misrepresentation giving them the right to avoid the contract of insurance, they had actually delivered the policy to the plaintiff and in fact took no step to rescind the contract until after they learned of the loss of the risk.\nIn Aaron's Reefs v. Twiss[42], Lord Watson, at page 291, Lord Herschell, at page 291, Lord Macnaghten, at page 293, Lord Davey, at page 295, all expressed themselves in a manner which seems hardly consistent with the view that as applicable to executory contracts there is any such rule of law.\nAlthough I think it very doubtful indeed whether cases of equitable election for or against an instrument under which a person is entitled to a benefit, but in circumstances in which the law requires him, if he accepts the benefit, to submit to some disadvantage in order that the instrument may take effect as a whole\u2014 although I think it very doubtful whether such cases and the principles governing them can usefully be applied except with a good deal of circumspection to cases involving the right to rescind a contract on the ground of fraud, still it may be worth while to point out that in such cases neither the right to elect nor the right to put another person to election is forfeited merely by delay in enforcing the right. (Brice v. Brice[43]; Butricke v. Broadhurst[44]; Lord Beaulieu v. Lord Cardigan[45]; Spread v. Morgan[46]; Padbury v. Clark[47].)\nI have said sufficient to shew that, assuming there is such a general rule as that contended for, there was no delay which, according to any standard of reasonableness that could fairly be suggested, could be described as unreasonable. The next ground upon which it is argued that the respondent is precluded from disaffirming the so-called contract is that by his conduct he led the appellant company reasonably to believe that he intended to affirm the contract and that upon this belief they acted to their prejudice.\nI am unable to find any reason for thinking that the appellant company were in any way influenced by what the respondent did. Knowledge of Simpson's fraud must be imputed to the appellant company, or, to put it in another way, the respondent cannot be put in a worse position in relation to the appellant company than he would have been in if the Winnipeg employees of the company had been instantly informed by Simpson of the trick he had played on the respondent. On this assumption the sale which the appellant made against the respondent's purchase in consequence of Simpson's telegram of the 30th must either be regarded as a speculation upon the respondent's probable attitude with reference to the contract or as evidencing a determination to take the risk of fastening the transaction upon the respondent notwithstanding what occurred; and indeed it is sufficiently evident that this latter is the explanation in fact of their conduct after they became aware that Simpson was not shipping his wheat for October delivery.\nBut a fatal objection to this contention is that in order to maintain that it was incumbent upon the appellant company to shew affirmatively that the respondent's conduct had led them to act in a manner prejudicial to their interests; but their representative who gave evidence was not asked by the counsel for the appellant a single question upon the subject. The passage quoted above from the judgment in the Ex- chequer Chamber in Morrison's Case [48] plainly indicates the course the appellant's counsel should have taken.\nBut that is by no means all. It is abundantly evident that there was a considerable correspondence between Simpson and the Winnipeg office. This correspondence is not produced, and we may only guess of the light it would have thrown upon the motives and reasons which actuated the appellant company in not buying again to protect themselves at a time when prices may have been favourable to them; the onus being upon them, they cannot with any shew of plausibility, while withholding these communications, ask a court of justice to infer that what they did was the result of any belief upon the point whether the respondent was likely to affirm or disaffirm the sale which Simpson was trying to fasten upon him.\nThe next contention is that the respondent by his delay prejudiced the interests of the appellant company.\nOn the point of fact it seems reasonably clear that the appellant company, if prejudiced at all, was prejudiced by the failure on the part of Simpson to inform them of the real circumstances in which the alleged contract was procured.\nThe argument is, moreover, demurrable in point of law. It is quite true that in the judgment in Clough's Case[49], an expression is used which seems to indicate that prejudice owing to delay suffered by the wrongdoer may be a reason for disabling the defrauded person from setting up the fraud. But the expression is obiter, and when read in connection with the judgment in Morrison's Case48 (the passage is quoted above) it is clear that the cases contemplated are those in which the conduct of the defrauded party constitutes an estoppel and those mentioned by Mr. Spencer Bower in the treatise on misrepresentation and fraud in Lord Halsbury's collection, namely, those cases in which some property has passed into the hands of the wronged person, some property, that is to say, which could have been restored in specie at the moment it was received, that had been lost, destroyed or affected in such a way as to make specific restitution on part of the victim impossible.\nSir Edward Fry (Specific Performance, page 369) points out that there is some ground for thinking that even in such cases the plea may be effective unless the destruction or deterioration of the property is caused by the conduct of the person wronged; and there is some support for this in the observations of the law Lords in Adam v. Newbigging[50].\nThere is, at all events, so far as I can see, neither authority nor principle in favour of the suggestion that in the case of such a contract as this the defrauded party may lose his right of rescission because the other wrongdoer chooses to make collateral arrangements on the chance that the former will uncomplainingly submit to be victimized.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I doubt whether, upon the evidence in this case, I should have held that the defendant was so drunk when he signed the agreement in question that he was incapable of making a binding contract. But the learned trial judge has found that he was, and that his condition was known to the plaintiffs' representative who procured his signature and we must accept these findings. It follows that the contract so executed was, according to English law, not void, but voidable at the defendant's option. The question presented on this appeal is whether explicit affirmative ratification is necessary to render such a voidable contract unassailable or whether by standing by for an unreasonable length of time, with full knowledge of what he has done, and that the other party assumes the contract to be valid and binding, the erstwhile drunken man does not forego his right to elect to avoid it. The learned trial judge took the latter view; the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, the former.\nSince the voidability of the contract depends not merely upon the intoxication of the party entitled to avoid it, but upon the knowledge of his condition by the other party, who is presumed to have taken advantage of it, the position and the respective rights of the parties are, in my opinion, the same as in the case of a contract procured by fraud. The duty of a person entitled to rescind for fraud is to exercise his option to do so promptly when he becomes aware of the circumstances which entitled him to repudiate liability. He cannot with knowledge stand by indefinitely until he has satisfied himself whether it will be to his advantage to repudiate rather than affirm the contract. Especially is this the case where the subject matter is of a highly speculative nature.\nWhat is a reasonable time must always depend on the circumstances. Here the defendant on the following day acquired full knowledge of the contract which he had executed on the 30th of September. He knew on the third or fourth of October that the plaintiff regarded that contract as subsisting and binding. He knew that wheat was an extremely speculative commodity, its market price varying from day to day On the 20th of October, he was written to by the plaintiff as to the shipment of his grain, and thus again had express notice that they were relying upon his making delivery according to his contract. Yet it was not until the 6th of November, when the price of wheat had greatly advanced, that he took the first step towards repudiating liability. In my opinion this was entirely too late. By his conduct he had led the plaintiffs to believe that he did not intend to rescind and they had acted on that belief. I think he thus waived his original right to elect to avoid the contract and must be taken to have elected to affirm it, as he undoubtedly would have done had the market price declined instead of advancing. I find nothing in the decision in Matthews v. Baxter[51], at all inconsistent with the view that failure to repudiate within a reasonable time, where the circumstances are such that, in justice, the right of election should be exercised with promptness, should be deemed tantamount to an express ratification.\nI am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored. The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 1 Bligh 137.\n[2] 18 Ves. 12 at page 16.\n[3] L.R. 8 Ex. 132.\n[4] 6 E. & B. 761.\n[5] 3 Ex. 565.\n[6] L.

In three years thereafter the company went into liquidation and he was unemployed for the balance of the term. Shortly after the liquidation of the company he and an associate purchased most of its assets by the sale of which he made a profit of $11,000. In an action on the guarantee for $9,000, salary for the two years of his engagement with the company,\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (38 Ont. L.R. 396, which reversed that at the trial (37 Ont. L.R. 488, that the action taken by C. which realized a profit exceeding the amount he is claiming arose out of his relations with his employers and the diminution of his loss thereby must be taken into account though he was under no obligation to take it. British Westinghouse Electric and Mfg. Co. v. Underground Electric Railways Co. ([1912] A.C. 673) applied.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe appellant (plaintiff) was employed by the Dominion Linen Mfg. Co., as sales manager, under a contract for five years at a salary of $5,000 a year; payment of which was guaranteed by one Kloepfer, a director of the company. The action in this case was brought against the administrator of Kloepfer\u2019s Estate (the respondent) to recover two years\u2019 salary the company having gone into liquidation after three years of the term had passed. The appellant purchased the assets of the insolvent company and made a profit of $11,000 by their sale. The only question on the appeal was whether or not he could recover from the guarantor the amount claimed without regard to this profit.\nHamilton Cassels K.C. for the appellant referred to Sedgwick on Damages (9 ed.) vol. 2, par. 667 et seq.\nSir George Gibbons K.C. and Boland for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014It is claimed by the respondent that it was merely a surety. I have had some doubts whether this was really so, but the case has proceeded on this assumption and if it is so I suppose, according to the usual rule, the measure of the respondent\u2019s liability as a surety is the loss of the appellant under his contract of employment.\nIf the contract had been carried out and the appellant, continuing his employment, had been paid his salary of $5,000 a year for two years it is clear he could not have earned the $11,000 which he did from other sources. He has therefore not only sustained no loss, but is better off than if the contract had been fulfilled. I think this consideration of whether he could have made his profit from other sources if the contract had been fulfilled may be some test of whether such profits are to be taken into account in ascertaining the loss sustained by the breach of the contract. The judgment of the Divisional Court gives as instances of what cannot be taken into account:\u2014\nIf, for instance, immediately after dismissal, the appellant had fallen heir to an estate producing $5,000 a year or had by a lucky chance speculated in stocks and made a large amount or if he spent the time which was not previously occupied in his employment so profitably as to bring him a good income.\nIn each of these three examples the gain to the appellant would have equally accrued if he had not lost his employment, it would therefore have nothing to do with his loss through the breach of the contract. In the actual case, however, the gain is directly dependent on the breach of the contract and would not have been made if it had not occurred. I do not suggest that this is an absolute test of what ought to be taken into account but I think it is sufficient to dispose of the claim in the present case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Without committing myself to the entire reasoning adopted in support of the judgment appealed from herein I think the conclusion reached is right and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The point presented for consideration in this appeal is by no means free from difficulty, but I am convinced that the actual decision of the First Appellate Division is right and that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe principle upon which the appeal ought to be decided is expounded at length in the judgment of Lord Haldane in British Westinghouse Electric Co. v. Under- ground Electric Railways Co.[3], at pp. 689 and 690. After stating the general principle that when a contract is broken the injured party is entitled generally to receive such a sum by way of damages, as will, so far as possible, put him in the same position as if the contract had been performed\u2014the damages being limited to those that are the natural and direct consequences of the breach\u2014his Lordship proceeded as follows:\u2014\nBut this first principle is qualified by a second, which imposes on the plaintiff the duty of taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the breach, and debars him from claiming any part of the damage which is due to his neglect to take such steps. In the words of James L.J. in Dunkirk Colliery Co. v. Lever[4], at p. 25: \u201cThe person who has broken the contract is not to be exposed to additional cost by reason of the plaintiffs not doing what they ought to have done as reasonable men, and the plaintiffs not being under any obligation to do anything otherwise than in the ordinary course of business.\u201d\nAs James L.J. indicates, this second principle does not impose on the plaintiff an obligation to take any step which a reasonable and prudent man would not ordinarily take in the course of his business. But when in the course of his business he has taken action arising out of the transaction which action has diminished his loss, the effect in actual diminution of the loss he has suffered may be taken into account even though there was no duty on him to act.\nIllustrating this last observation, his Lordship refers to Staniforth v. Lyall[5], and commenting upon that decision, he proceeds:\u2014\nI think that this decision illustrates a principle which has been recognized in other cases, that, provided the course taken to protect himself by the plaintiff in such an action was one which a reasonable and prudent person might in the ordinary conduct of business properly have taken, and in fact did take whether bound to or not, a jury or an arbitrator may properly look at the whole of the facts and ascertain the result in estimating the quantum of damages.\nA little further on, he adds:\u2014\nThe subsequent transaction, if to be taken into account, must be one arising out of the consequences of the breach and in the ordinary course of business. I do not entertain the slightest doubt that the appellant\u2019s dealings were not dealings which he was under any obligation to engage in for the purpose of mitigating damages, but that, as Lord Haldane points out, is not necessarily decisive. Even though the course taken by him was not one which would ordinarily be taken in the course of business by a reasonable and prudent man in his circumstances, still, having done what he did, the whole of the facts may properly be looked at for the purpose of estimating damages provided that what he did was what a reasonable and prudent person might do properly \u201cin the ordinary course of business.\u201d\nWhether what the appellant did falls within this description is strictly a question of fact, and I have come to the conclusion that it does.\nI have not felt it necessary to pass upon the question whether or not, consistently with this view, some allowance could properly be made to the appellant as compensation for the use of his capital and for the risk. I find it unnecessary to do so because the argument of Sir George Gibbons convinces me that any reasonable allowance on that footing would be overtopped by the allowance which strictissimo jure should be made to the respondents in respect of probable gains by way of salary, the opportunity for earning which the appellant deliberately decided to forego.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The facts of this case are fully stated in the report of it in the provincial courts[6].\nThe fundamental basis of the assessment of damages for breach of contract\u2014compensation for pecuniary loss naturally flowing from the breach\u2014and its quali- fication\u2014that the plaintiff cannot recover any part of the damages due to his own failure to take all reasonable steps to mitigate his loss\u2014are too well settled to admit of controversy. The application of this qualified rule, however, sometimes presents difficulty. The qualification does not impose on the plaintiff claiming damages for the breach\nan obligation to take any steps which a reasonable and prudent man would not ordinarily take in the course of his business:\nnevertheless,\nwhen in the course of his business he has taken action arising out of the transaction, which action has diminished his loss, the effect in actual diminution of the loss he has suffered may be taken into account even though there was no duty on him to act.\nThe applicability of the principles expressed in these passages from the judgment of Lord Chancellor Haldane in British Westinghouse Elec. & Manufacturing Co. v. Underground Elec. Rlys. Co. of London[7], at p. 689, to breaches of contracts for personal services is shewn by the authorities cited by Mr. Justice Hodgins in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division\u2014notably in Beckman v. Drake[8].\nThe action of the appellant in acquiring and disposing at a profit of a considerable part of the manufactured stock of his former employers arose out of his relations with them. It involved the employment by him of time, labour and ability which he had engaged to give to them. For his loss of an opportunity to use these in earning a salary from those employers he is now asking that the respondent shall be compelled to pay by way of damages. It would seem to be manifestly unfair that, if the appellant is thus to be remunerated on a contractual basis by way of damages, he should not be held accountable in mitigation for money made by using for his own purposes the time, labour and ability so to be paid for. The $11,000 profit which he made, although the making of it required some assumption of risk and responsibility and also an expenditure clearly beyond anything involved in his engagement by his former employers, and likewise beyond anything which it was his duty to them, or to the respondent, to undertake, is within the rule of accountability stated by Lord Haldane. The action which produced it arose out of his former employment in the sense in which the Lord Chancellor uses the phrase \u201carising out of the transaction,\u201d as is shewn by his illustration from Staniforth v. Lyall[9]. Again to quote his Lordship (p. 691):\nThe transaction was * * * one in which the person whose contract was broken took a reasonable and prudent course quite naturally arising out of the circumstances in which he was placed by the breach.\nBy devoting his time, energy and skill for two years to the service of his former employers the appellant would have earned $10,000. A breakdown in his health, or other unforseen contingencies might have prevented his doing so. Excused from that service, he was enabled by a happy combination of making use of the time, labour and ability thus set free and taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by his employers\u2019 misfortune within 66 days to make a clear profit of $11,000\u2014and he still had at his disposal, in which to add to his earnings, if so inclined, or to amuse himself if he preferred doing so, the remaining year and 299 days. Were he to be now awarded not the $10,000 claimed in his action but the $4,000 allowed him by the learned trial judge, he would, as a result of his employers\u2019 disaster, be better off by at least $5,000 than he would have been had he put in his two years of service\u2014\u201ca somewhat grotesque result,\u201d as Lord Atkinson put it in Erie County Natural Gas and Fuel Co. v. Carroll[10]. Making due allowance for extra time and trouble expended and all other elements proper to be considered involved in the efforts which resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s securing the profit of $11,000, and taking into account the year and 299 days left at his disposal after that was accomplished, it seems reasonably clear that he did not sustain any actual damage as a result of losing his position. He was probably, on the whole, better off.\nUpon the facts, when \u201callowed to speak for themselves,\u201d not only is the conclusion reached by the Appellate Division in conformity with legal principles and the authorities but any other would shock the common sense of justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cassels, Brock, Kelley & Falconbridge.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Macdonell & Boland.\n[1] 38 Ont.

Davies, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. \u2014 The revocation of the charter operated as a mere-suspension of the powers and functions of the company and the order-in-council reviving the letters patent of incorporation restored the company to its legal position at the time of the revocation as to the proceedings instituted between such revocation and the re-instatement of the company for an order allowing the present appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Without deciding whether acts of the officers of the company during the interregnum are in all respects to be deemed acts of the company, it is clear that the company, by virtue of the statute, is to be deemed to have been in possession of its powers during that period, and the act of its officers in applying for the order allowing the appeal, done in the name of the company, could be and has been ratified.\nSo long as there is no Dominion legislation inconsistent therewith, the capacity of a provincial corporation, as a legal persona to initiate and carry on an appeal in this court, is determined by the provincial law.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of Mathers C.J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, dismissing the appeal of the present appellant, was rendered on the 17th of May, 1915. The appellant company, having failed to make the annual summary showing the lands it possessed as required by section 77 of the Manitoba \"Companies Act,\" the letters patent evidencing its incorporation were duly cancelled by Order-in-Council on the 14th day of July,\n1915. During the time the charter of the company appellant was so revoked, the solicitors for the appellant obtained from Mr. Justice Richards, on the 6th of August, 1915, an order allowing the present appeal to the Supreme Court. But, on the 18th of October,\n1916, the disability of the appellant company was removed, under the provisions of section 130 of the Manitoba \"Companies Act,\" which declares that the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may order that the charter of a company \"be revived and the company restored to its legal position as at the time of such revocation, cancellation or surrender in the same manner and to the same extent as if there had been no such revocation, cancellation or surrender.\"\nThe respondents moved to quash on the ground that the company appellant had virtually ceased to exist when the appeal to the Supreme Court has been instituted.\nThe motion to quash the appeal and the merits of the case were argued at the same time.\nTilley K.C. for the appellant.\nFullerton K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014As to the question of jurisdiction I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin. The order- in-council reviving the letters patent of incorporation restored the company to its legal position as at the time of the revocation in the same manner and to the same extent as if there had been no such revocation.\nOn the merits I agree, with some hesitation, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe evidence does not support the defence originally set up, and, in my opinion, it is not very satisfactorily established that all the respondents were induced to enter into the agreement in question exclusively by the representations made by Batters and Baldwin. Some of them on their own evidence were certainly guilty of gross neglect and would appear to me to have been willing to take considerable risks. Little or no inquiry was made as to the site or possibilities of the property. The only consideration with the purchasers apparently was the possibility of a quick turnover in a rising real estate market. For instance, respondent Irwin says that had he known that Batters was getting a commission on the sale of the property that fact would not have affected his mind and there are others who testify to the same effect. Men who are so regardless of the ordinary rules of caution do not deserve much consideration, but the transaction was certainly not an honest one and the presumption is that the company must have known of the relations existing between the secretary-treasurer Hansen, and Baldwin and Batters.\nI defer to the better opinion of my colleagues and of the judges in the courts below and am content to let the tree lie where it has fallen.\nDavies J. concurred with Anglin J.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal by a company incorporated under \"The Companies Act\" of Manitoba in an action in which the learned trial judge had maintained charges of fraud set up by way of defence and counterclaim against the company's action and therefore dismissed, on the 27th February, 1915, the action and gave effect to the prayer of those respondents who had counterclaimed. Thereupon the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and its appeal was unanimously dismissed on the 17th May, 1915.\nOn the fourteenth day of July, 1915, the letters patent evidencing the incorporation of the appellant were duly cancelled by order-in-council and such company had not been reinstated at least until after the 18th October, 1916.\nIndeed we have no evidence before or beyond the oral admission of counsel that in fact there ever was a re-instatement and nobody seems to know the precise terms thereof.\nThe case has been hanging before us a long time and something desperate seems to have been done at the last moment.\nAn affidavit filed on this application to quash (which has been pending for a year or more) suggests, and it is not denied, that the proceedings to revoke the incorporating letters patent were taken under section 77 of the \"Companies Act,\" which reads as follows:\u2014\n77. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may, at any time, revoke any letters patent of incorporation granted under this part or under \"The Manitoba Joint Stock Companies Act,\" or under any other Act or Acts for which the said Act was substituted, on account of the violation, by any such company, of any of the provisions hereinafter contained respecting the annual summary to be verified, deposited and posted up, in so far as it is required to show the number of acres of land held by the company, and when they were purchased. Any such letters patent of incorporation so revoked shall be null and void as to any matter occurring subsequent to such revocation. R.S.M. c. 30, s. 67. The notice of said order of rescission was advertised in the Manitoba Gazette on the 31st July, 1915, as required by the Act.\nThe \"Companies Act\" was amended on the 20th February, 1914, by the following:\u2014\n1. \"The Companies Act,\" being chapter 35 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1913, is hereby amended by adding thereto the following sections:\n130. In any case where, by virtue of section 86 of this Act, any charter or letters patent of incorporation of any company has become revoked and cancelled, or where any such charter or letters patent of incorporation has been revoked by order-in-council under section 76 of \"The Manitoba Joint Stock Companies Act,\" being chapter 30 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1902, as amended by section 3 of chapter 13 of 5 & 6 Edward VII., or where any charter or letters patent of incorporation have been surrendered under the provisions contained in sections 78 and 79 of this Act, if it is made to appear to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, on the application of any person, that the acts or neglects of the company or corporation which led to such revocation or surrender were due to inadvertence, accident or neglect of the officers or servants of the company, and that such cancellation, revocation or surrender of the charter or letters patent of incorporation will result in loss or serious inconvenience to the company or the applicant, and that the required returns have been filed with the Provincial Secretary and fees paid and all other defaults of such company remedied, then the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may order that the charter or letters patent of incorporation of the company be revived and the company restored to its legal position as at the time of such revocation, cancellation or surrender in the same manner and to the same extent as if there had been no such revocation, cancellation \u2022 or surrender, and the same shall thereupon be revived and restored accordingly.\nDuring the time the company was dead and its incorporation absolutely null in the language first quoted, the solicitors for the appellant had the temerity, on the 6th of August, 1915, to approach Mr. Justice Richards and obtain from him an order allowing this appeal to be made.\nMr. Fullerton in his affidavit, upon which (amongst other things) this notice to quash is founded, denies any knowledge at that time on his part of the revocation of appellant's charter. I have not the slightest doubt that Mr. Justice Richards was equally ignorant of the fact and was improperly imposed upon, and that if the facts had been disclosed he would have refused to make said order and we would never have heard of this appeal.\nThe sixty days for an applicant to move had long expired before the appellant could get into any such position as entitled it to make the application.\nThere is no material filed on behalf of the appellant explaining anything, or excusing anything, and possibly the solicitor in this case was imposed upon; yet even so one cannot help regretting his failure to have ventured upon some explanation for having made an application so unjustifiable under the circumstances. The matter touched his honour as a professional man in a way not to be so lightly passed by.\nThe proceeding was null and void and the learned judge was entitled to have been frankly treated instead of being imposed upon. The successful despatch of an immense volume of business daily depends upon the most rigid care on the part of the solicitor that he never misleads the judge as to the facts to be considered by him.\nIn any way I can look at the matter I can find nothing to give vitality to that order so improperly got, or anything pertaining to this appeal founded thereon. And without that where is this appeal landed? The motion to quash was without any question entitled, upon any facts existent for nearly a year after it was launched, to prevail.\nThe words at the end of the amended section 130, in section 1 of the Act of 1914, do not seem to me to help the appellant.\nThe company's legal position is not improved by the literal terms of that section restoring it as at the time of such revocation, cancellation or surrender in the same manner and to the same extent as if there had been no such revocation, cancellation or surrender, and the same shall thereupon be revived and restored accordingly.\nThese words do not touch or help an order absolutely void.\nAnd the section 122 evidently refers to steps taken in the course of proceedings in Manitoba by virtue of its legislation and not by virtue of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe legislature had no power over the subject matter of the appeal to this court and could not, even if it intended so by anything it could enact, affect our right to hear an appeal so launched. I do not think any such thing was ever intended or the words bear any such meaning.\nMoreover section 122 of the Manitoba Act may not be applicable to this which is a case of revocation of a charter and not the mere revocation of the licence which it must obtain and lose by revocation of its charter.\nThe motion to quash should prevail with costs.\nNotwithstanding this being my decided opinion at the hearing I listened attentively to the argument and am yet unable to dissent from the holdings below and hence on the ground of any such merits as the case may have, I think it should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014First, as to jurisdiction. The judgment appealed from was pronounced on the 17th day of May, 1915. On July 14th, 1915, the letters patent of incorporation of the appellant company were cancelled by order-in-council under the authority of section 77 of the \"Manitoba Companies Act.\" On the 6th August, 1915, an order was made on the application of persons professing to act on behalf of the appellant company whose letters patent had been cancelled in the previous month and Mr. Justice Richards made an order allowing the appeal under the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" In October, 1916, an order was made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council reviving and restoring the letters patent. The objection to be considered is whether or not the order made by Mr. Justice Richards was a valid order.\nThe decision depends on the effect of the statutory provisions under which, first, the order was cancelled, and secondly, the order of revivor was made, section 77 of the \"Companies Act\"[2], and section 130 introduced into the Act by an amendment passed in 1914. The effect of the order for revivor is declared by the last mentioned enactment in these words:\u2014\nThe Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may order that the charter or letters patent of incorporation of the company be revived and the company restored to its legal position as at the time of such revocation, cancellation or surrender, in the same manner and to the same extent as if there had been no such revocation, cancellation or surrender, and the same shall thereupon be revived and restored accordingly.\nWhen, therefore, an order for revivor has been made under the authority of this enactment the company is deemed in point of law to have retained its corporate character and its corporate capacities and powers without interruption notwithstanding the order of cancellation. The enactment does not explicitly declare that acts done by officers of the corporation are to take effect as if no cancellation had taken place; and whether that is or is not involved in the provision that the company is to be\nrestored to its legal position as at the time of cancellation\nis a point upon which it is unnecessary to pass and upon which I desire to say nothing. It is now in point of law deemed to have been in possession of its corporate powers at the time the order of Mr. Justice Richards was made and the act of its agents in applying for the order in the name and on behalf of the corporation is an act which could be and which has been ratified.\nI am not losing sight of the fact that an appeal to this court is an independent proceeding which can only be instituted by a competent legal persona and that the right to institute it is a right enjoyed in virtue of a Dominion statute. In the absence of some federal enactment relating to the subject, the capacity of a provincial company in this respect is determined by provincial law and we must consequently give effect to the order of revivor in conformity with section 130.\nAs to the merits, the Chief Justice, who tried the action, in effect found as a fact that Batters was the agent of the company, and that finding was concurred in unanimously by the Court of Appeal. This finding, it is true, rested to a considerable degree upon inference, but this does not detract from the weight of the consideration that two courts have concurred in it. Johnston v. O'Neil[3]. Batters' agency established, there is nothing more to be said.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The effect of section 130 of ch 35 of the R.S.M. 1913, as enacted by the Manitoba Legislature in the session of 1913-14 (ch. 22, s. 1), is, in my opinion, that, in cases where revivor under its provisions subsequently takes place, any revocation, cancellation or surrender of a charter therein dealt with operates as a mere suspension of the powers and functions of the company so that upon such revivor the status and rights of the company are in all respects\nas if there had been no such revocation, cancellation or surrender.\nThus, for instance, no reconveyance to it or revesting in it of its real or personal property is required. After revivor it is seized and possessed of such property as it was before the revocation, cancellation or surrender and as if the latter had never taken place. All acts done in its name, which would have been lawful and effective had there been no revocation, cancellation or surrender, are after revivor to be deemed acts of the company and of the same efficacy and force and entailing the same consequences\nas if there had been no such revocation, cancellation or surrender.\nThat, I take it, was the purpose of the legislature in enacting section 130, and that purpose would be defeated in this case were we to quash the present appeal because it was instituted and perfected during the period of suspension, i.e., in the interval between the revocation or cancellation of the appellant company's charter under section 86 of the \"Companies' Act\"[4], and its revivor under section 130.\nOn the merits, however, the appeal, in my opinion, fails. The facts found and the inferences of fact drawn by the learned Chief Justice who presided at the trial established the agency of Batters for the appellant company. Its responsibility for his misrepresentations follows. That such misrepresentations were made and were material is sufficiently proved by the evidence. I have not been convinced that the findings made and the inferences drawn by the Chief Justice are so clearly wrong that we should reverse them, after they have been unanimously affirmed by the provincial Court of Appeal, the judgment of the trial court having been in its opinion apparently so clearly right that it was unnecessary to state any reasons for dismissing the appeal from it.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The first question on this appeal is whether we have jurisdiction.\nThe appellant company having failed to make the annual summary shewing the lands it possessed as required by law (Manitoba Company Law, ch. 35, R.S.M. 1913, s. 77), the charter was revoked, and when the security on this appeal was received the letters patent as a result of that revocation were null as to any matter occurring afterwards. But the parties admit that the disability has since been removed under the provisions of ch. 22 of 1914, sec. 1, which declares that the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may order that the charter\nbe revived and the company restored to its legal position as at the time of such revocation, cancellation or surrender in the same manner and to the same extent as if there had been no such revocation, cancellation or surrender.\nThe respondents contend that the company having virtually ceased to exist when the appeal had been instituted the appeal should be quashed and they move accordingly.\nThe provisions of the Act just quoted are wide enough to lead me to the conclusion that the company has always subsisted and if at one time the company was under some disabilities they have been removed by the action of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council with a retroactive effect.\nIn general principle a statute is not to be construed so as to have retrospective operation unless there is something in its language and contents indicating a contrary intention, but in looking to the general scope and purview of the statute and at the remedy sought to be applied, it seems to me that the provisions of the statute of 1914 must be considered as having a retrospective effect since the company is not only restored to its legal position and has the right to exercise the same corporate powers, but the cancellation is declared as never having existed.\nThe motion to quash should be dismissed.\nOn the merits of the case I find that the consent of the plaintiffs on the counterclaim to the sale of the lots of land in question was obtained by fraud and misrepresentation.\nThe selling agent of the appellant company retained the services of one Batters to carry out negotiations with the plaintiffs in order to induce the latter to purchase those lots. Batters had lived in their locality for a great number of years and was carrying on an agricultural implement business which put him in the best of relations with those people who were farmers. Though he was to have a commission from the selling agent of the company, appellant, he represented to the defendants, respondents, that he was taking some shares in the purchase.\nFalse representations were made to the farmers by Batters and the other agent, Baldwin, as to the vicinity of the lots to the street car lines and as to the erection of valuable houses across the street from those lots and as to their value.\nThe courts below found against the appellant company on these representations. Their findings should not be disturbed. But the appellant contends that Batters was not its agent.\nThe general selling agent of the company, Skuli Hannson, was at the same time the secretary of the company.\nA real estate agent named Baldwin had for some years occupied desk room in Hannson's office and he had undertaken to sell the lots in question. He put himself in relation with Batters to the knowledge of Hannson. Remittances were made direct to Hannson by Batters and as the latter was indebted to Hannson his commission was to be credited on his indebtedness with Hannson.\nHe did not pay anything on his share of the purchase price but that share was to be paid by way of commission, as he says himself.\nI concur in the view expressed by the trial judge that it was intended and agreed between the company and their selling agent, Hannson, that the latter should appoint sub-agents for the purpose of disposing of those lots.\nBatters and Baldwin were both sub-agents of the company. The latter recognized Batters as its agent since he was not required to pay any part of the cash payment provided in the contract, but was given credit thereon for his share of the commission he was entitled to.\nI may add that it was the duty of the Company on becoming aware that Batters was a co-purchaser with the plaintiffs respondents to satisfy itself that they were aware of the agency of Batters.

The respondent, being indebted to the appellant for the purchase of the materials required for the work, assigned to the appellant, before the expiration of the twelve months, the monies so conditionally retained by the city. The respondent went afterwards into liquidation.\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. (dissenting), that such assignment, while in form absolute, constituted a \"mortgage or charge,\" within the meaning of section 102, chapter 39, R.S.B.C. 1911, requiring registration as against the liquidator of the insolvent company.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Clement J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head\u2014note.\nArmour K.C. for the appellant.\nStuart Livingston for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014 I am disposed to think that the judgment on the trial was right and that this appeal should be allowed. The assignments are absolute in form and must be held to be so in effect unless we can find some ground for supposing that they were only made as security to the appellant for payment on the goods sold by it to the respondent.\nCounsel for the appellant endeavoured to show at the trial that the retention moneys under the respondent's contracts with the City of Vancouver which were assigned were payments in discharge of the balance due to the appellant on their accounts with the respondent. If the decision of the case depended on this question I should have no hesitation in finding for the respondent. Until the expiration of the period of retention it was impossible to say that monies would be payable to the respondent by the City of Vancouver. In the first case, the contract having been completed when the assignment was made and the amount of the retention money being known, this exact amount was assigned; the City, however, incurred expenses for maintenance in accordance with the terms of the contract and accordingly deducted the amount of these from the retention monies, paying only the balance into court. The amount of these deductions the appellant admits it cannot recover. I cannot think that the amounts of the retention monies which would eventually be payable by the City of Vancouver being thus uncertain, the appellant could have ever intended to accept the assignments of them in full discharge of the respondent's indebtedness to it. Again, the retention monies under the first contract were payable by the City after twelve months which expired on the 17th September, 1913. There is no explanation why the appellant after having stipulated for a bonus equivalent to 10% interest should have allowed payment to stand over until the respondent went into liquidation more than a year after unless they were looking to a future general settlement of accounts with the respondent.\nHowever, the amount of the retention monies eventually to become payable could not have exceeded the appellant's claim though it might have been less and I cannot under these circumstances see any reason why the appellant should not have accepted absolute assignments of the retention monies as payments protanto of the debts due to it.\nThe amount assigned was calculated to cover interest at 10% and the agreement was therefore equivalent to an undertaking not to pay off the debt until the expiration of the retention period. The appellant was entitled to this interest and it is not to be supposed that the respondent even if the assignment had been only a security would have paid it before it was due. It is absurd to suppose that the respondent would have had any object in paying a charge off at the expiration of the retention period for it would have been paying a sum in cash to obtain an exactly equal amount of cash.\nThe record is a very embarrassed one but so far as I can ascertain the facts, I think there is no reason why the assignments should be held to be other than absolute as they purport to be. I have, of course, less hesitation in so holding as the trial judge gave no reasons for judgment and the Chief Justice delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal only says that he thinks there is sufficient evidence to shew that the assignments were given as security falling within section 102 of the statute. DAVIES J.\u2014After much consideration and not without some doubts, I have reached the same conclusion as that reached by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nThe question to be determined is whether the assignments to the appellant company by the respondent company now in liquidation of certain moneys to become due under certain contingencies to them under contracts the latter company had with the City of Vancouver, for the paving of its streets, were absolute assignments of such moneys or were mortgages or charges on such moneys within the meaning of section 102, chapter 39, R.S.B.C. 1911, requiring registration as against the liquidator of the assignor company and others.\nI have reached the conclusion that they were such mortgages or charges within the meaning of that section and therefore void as against the liquidator by reason of want of registration.\nThe assignments though in form absolute shew on their face that they were intended as a security to the assignee for the payment of its debt.\nIn determining whether they were absolute assignments or mortgages or charges merely regard must be had to the nature of the transaction and the real facts and intentions of the parties.\nThe broad facts were that the Nickson Company, respondent, having obtained from the Creosoting Company, the appellant, supplies to enable them to carry out their contracts with the City of Vancouver, for the laying of creosoted block pavement in the city \"for the purpose of securing the payment\" of the cost of such supplies gave the assignments in question.\nThe moneys proposed to be assigned were 10% of the contract price retained in its hands by the City for twelve months after the contracts were severally completed in accordance with the specifications. If during that period the work was found to be defective the contract with the City provided that its officers might remedy and repair the defects and that the cost of doing so should be paid out of the moneys so retained.\nThe moneys so assigned were not payable till the period of 12 months from the completion of the contract had expired; they might never become payable at all as they might be used for the purposes for which they were retained or they might only be payable in part.\nThe stipulations of the appellants' several contracts with the city provided that the moneys so retained by the City might be used if necessary not only in making good defects in the work done under the particular contract under which it was retained but also defects or faults in the work of any other similar contract the party had at the time with the City.\nAt the time the assignments were lodged with the City by way of notice there was no fund in the hands of the City to which they or any of them attached but merely the retention moneys under the contracts which might be exhausted in whole or in part in maintenance and repairs on any or all of the respondents' contracts with the City.\nLooking at the nature of these transactions as detailed in the evidence, the fact that the assignments though absolute in form profess to be taken as security for the moneys due the assignee, the further fact that no moneys were really payable under them until the period of maintenance had expired and then only such of these moneys as were not used in remedying defects or faults, which during that period had been found in the work done, I have reached the conclusion that the assignments while in form absolute were in reality and in substance equitable assignments only and constituted mortgages or charges within the meaning of the Act upon the disputed moneys which to be effective against the liquidator required registration.\nIn Gorringe v. Irwell India Rubber Co. [2], at p. 134, Cotton L.J. uses the following words which I think applicable to this case:\nWhen there is a contract for value between the owner of a chose in action and another person which shews that such person is to have the benefit of the chose in action that constitutes a good charge on the chose in action. The form of words is immaterial so long as they shew an intention that he is to have such benefit.\nAnd Chitty L. J. in the case of Durham Brothers v. Robertson [3], at p. 772, says:\n\"Where there is an absolute assignment of the debt but by way of security equity would imply a right to a reassignment on redemption.\nLooking therefore at the purpose and object of the Act requiring registration and at all the facts and circumstances of the case, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nOnce this conclusion is reached, it becomes unnecessary to discuss whether any part of the 10% deposit had become exigible before the insolvency of the company now in liquidation.\nThe point was not referred to in the factums of either party on this appeal or in the argument at bar, nor does it appear to have been raised in the Court of Appeal.\nThe single question argued and determined was whether the assignments were or were not mortgages or charges requiring registration within the meaning of the statute. I mention it because of the reference made to it by my brother Anglin in his reasons for the conclusion he has reached, which opinion I have had an opportunity of reading.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The legislature of British Columbia enacted by the Revised Statutes of that province of 1911, ch. 39, sec. 102, as follows:\u2014\n102 (1) Every mortgage or charge created by a company after the first day of July, 1910, and being either\u2014\n(a) A mortgage or charge for the purpose of securing any issue of debentures: or\n(b) A mortgage or charge on uncalled share capital by the company; or\n(c) A mortgage or charge created or evidenced by an instrument which, if executed by an individual, would require registration as a bill of sale; or\n(d) A mortgage or charge on any land, wherever situate, or any interest therein; or\n(e) A mortgage or charge on any book debts of the company; or\n(f) A floating charge on the undertaking or property of the company,\u2014\nshall, so far as any security on the company's property or undertaking is thereby conferred, be void against bon\u00e2 fide purchasers and mortgagees for valuable consideration, and the liquidator and any creditor of the company, unless the instrument, or a true copy thereof, by which the mortgage or charge is created or evidenced, is delivered to and filed with the Registrar for registration within twenty-one days after the date of its creation, but without prejudice to any contract or obligation for repayment of the money thereby secured; and when a mortgage or charge becomes void under this section the money secured thereby shall immediately become payable.\nThe question to be determined in this appeal is whether or not three several assignments made by the respondent to appellant, the Dominion Creosoting Company, fall within the provisions of the said enactment.\nThe respondent company, which admittedly was a company within the meaning of the section, was engaged under a contract it had with the City of Vancouver to pave parts of streets in said city with creosoted blocks manufactured by the appellant, and sold by it to the respondent company for the execution of that work.\nThe work of paving was supposed to be completed in the end of August, 1912, and the respondent company then owed the appellant on account of creosoted blocks purchased by it from appellant and used in connection with said contract.\nOne of the assignments now in question was made on the 3rd of September, 1912. It recited the foregoing facts and then as follows:\u2014\nAnd whereas for the purpose of securing to the said Assignee payment for the cost of the said creosoted blocks, the Assignor has agreed with the Assignee in manner hereinafter appearing.\nThen follows the operative part of it assigning to appellant in consideration of the premises and the sum of one dollar, the final payment of $2,084.75 to become payable by the City to the assignor on the 3rd of Sept., 1913. That also provides a power of attorney as follows:\u2014\nTo settle and adjust any or all accounts in connection with the said contract or work which may be necessary to enable the moneys hereby assigned to be paid to the said Assignee and to give perpetual receipts for the moneys hereby assigned which said receipts shall discharge the person paying the same from all liability in respect thereto and the person paying the same shall not be concerned to see to the application thereof, and also, if necessary, to sue for or take such other steps as the Assignee may think advisable for enforcing payment of the moneys hereby assigned or any part thereof and to compromise and settle any such proceedings on such terms as the Assignee may see fit, it being clearly understood that all costs and expenses of recovering the moneys hereby assigned are to be paid by the said Assignor and the said Assignor doth hereby covenant that it will at the request of the said Assignee and at the cost and expense of the said Assignee execute and do all such further acts, deeds, matters and things as the Assignee may reasonably require for giving full effect to the assignment of the said moneys, and it is hereby expressly understood and agreed that the said Assignor shall only receive credit on account of the moneys owing by the Assignor to the Assignee as aforesaid for the sum of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six dollars and twenty-eight cents ($1,876.28) part of the said sum of two thousand and eighty-four dollars and seventy-five cents ($2,084.75) hereby assigned, the difference of two hundred and eight dollars and forty-seven cents ($208.47) being a bonus or discount charged by the aid Assignee for the deferred payment of the said sum of two thousand and eighty-four dollars and seventy-five cents ($2,084.75).\nIt is to be observed that the assignment clearly professes on its face to be a security, and that all costs of recovering the moneys are to be paid by the assignor.\nAt the trial it appeared in evidence that the respondent company continued to give notes for the amount to the appellant company.\nClearly the respondent never was discharged.\nA leading question by its counsel suggests these notes were accommodation notes and an assenting reply is apparently got.\nThe evidence of the secretary-treasurer of the appellant clearly shews that he had the impression that the respondent was not discharged. And again when asked if the City by reason of the contract with it had made and been found entitled to claim further deduction from the amount he thought then that the respondent would be liable.\nIt is absolutely clear I think from the terms of the instrument itself and this evidence and the absence of any release or receipt and the continuation of the notes that neither party considered the transaction closed and this assignment accepted as full satisfaction for the balance of the amount due or any definite sum.\nIt is said the respondent's books shew a credit taken therefor, but Mr. Nickson evidently thought this was conditional as it were, and that another account was kept of the transaction.\nThe character of the instrument itself is against the appellant's contention.\nMuch stress is laid upon the absolute form of its operative part. Any one conversant with the mode of thought and manner of transacting such like dealings amongst business men, I imagine, would attach little importance to such an argument.\nAnd if we would do justice we must try and apprehend and correctly appreciate what men are about.\nIf the assignment had been intended finally to close up between those parties to it all it related to, there would have been no doubt left existent in the minds of any one. There would not have been used eiher the word \"security\" instead of \"payment\" or the provision for the assignor bearing the expenses of recovery of the money.\nI conclude it was exactly what the statute describes as a mortgage or charge on the book debt due by the City to the company.\nThis assignment I have taken up first for consideration because if any of the ingenious suggestions of counsel as to the test to be applied could be given any weight there are some features of that transaction and its surrounding circumstances which might lend a slight colour of reason to the argument.\nThe other two assignments were each made before the delivery of any goods for which they were to secure the price before anything was done to entitle the appellant to look to the City for payment of a dollar. Yet they are given expressly for securing the goods and the moneys are collectable at the expense of the assignor as in the first assignment.\nIf an assignment (framed in that way) of a claim over the future liability of any third party to a contractor when the goods to be delivered pursuant to it and work done therewith under the contractor's agreement with the third party only relates to a part of the total sum to accrue due to the contractor, is not a mortgage or charge, I do not know what could be so.\nThat mortgage or charge, it might have been argued, and I am surprised it was not, was not of the book debts but what led up to same.\nThe result has been the creation of a book debt and it is that which was intended to stand charged.\nIn my opinion any such assignment falls within the mischief which the Act is intended to render harmless.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I proceed upon the assumption that the instruments all came into operation effectively under the statute relating to assignments of choses in action as regards all the debts and sums they profess to transfer to the appellant subject only to the consequences of the imperfection, if it be an imperfection, due to non-registration. I reject Mr. Armour's argument that the statute requiring registration is limited in its application to mortgages and charges for securing the repayment of loans for the reason that such is not the necessary or the more natural construction and that the intention to exclude from the operation of an enactment such as this securities given for debts incurred otherwise than by way of loan, for example, in the purchase of goods or other property, ought not to be attributed to the legislature in the absence of something in the statute pointing to such an intention.\nThe real question is: Are the instruments before us within the words \"mortgage or charge?\" The decisive point is, were the assignments given as security or were they absolute assignments in the sense that the respondent would not be entitled as of right by paying the debt and costs to require a retransfer?\nI think the point must be decided against the appellant. It is evident that the purpose of the arrangements as practical business was to buy and sell blocks and pay and get paid for them. The appellant had no possible interest in the contracts with the municipality except as a cause or occasion for the sale of its blocks and as a source of supply for the respondent of means of paying for them. Whether they were paid by the means made available by the assignments or by any other means was a point which could possess no interest for the appellant. The phrase \"for securing * * * payment\" must be read, I think, when all the circumstances are considered just as if the words were \"as security for the payment;\" and it is almost a universal rule that a transfer of property as security implies a right of redemption.\nIt would not be profitable to consider whether the assignments fall within the category of \"mortgage\" or within that of \"charge;\" or partly in one category and partly in the other; it is enough that they are embraced within the scope of the expression \"mortgage or charge.\"\nSome energy was devoted at the trial to the endeavour to establish by the evidence of Nickson and Company's bookkeeper that the assignment of the deferred residue of 10% under the instrument of the 3rd September, 1912, was actually treated by Nickson and Company as payment. Now it is very difficult when the facts are considered to entertain the suggestion that this assignment was regarded by anybody as in itself, regardless of its fruits, amounting to payment. The respondent company were under an obligation to maintain the street for a year and deliver it up in a condition satisfactory to the municipal engineer. At the expiration of the year the provisional progress certificates were subject to readjustment and the whole of the deferred payments of 10% might conceivably be eaten up by deductions required on various grounds by that official. This, the appellants, of course, knew, and the suggestion lacks plausibility that, with their eyes open to these possibilities, they would release the respondent company before the year of probation had expired.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014By three instruments in the form of absolute assignments the T.R. Nickson Company for valuable consideration purported to transfer to the Dominion Creosoting Company moneys due and to become due from the corporation of the City of Vancouver to the assignors under certain paving contracts between them, existing and prospective.\nThe purpose of the parties was as clear as it was honest. In order to obtain from the Dominion Creosoting Company materials necessary for the performance of these contracts, the Nickson Company agreed to vest in the Creosoting Company its entire right to defined portions of the moneys earned and to be earned under them. The matter for our consideration is whether any legal obstacles exist which prevent that purpose being carried out.\nThe T. R. Nickson Company went into liquidation on the 26th October, 1914. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia has held the instruments in question to be mortgages or charges within sec. 102 of ch. 39 of the R.S.B.C., 1911, and therefore void as against the liquidator because not registered. The respondent supports this view, and also contends that, as against the liquidator, the assignments, although they should be deemed absolute, passed nothing to the assignees, because the debts which they purported to assign did not exist when they were executed and, becoming exigible only after the liquidation began, they were then payable to the liquidator.\nThe utmost amount that could become payable to the assignees under the transfers in question would not exceed the indebtedness to them, present and contemplated, of the assignors in respect of which the assignments were made. Of course the absolute form of the assignments is not conclusive as to their true nature and effect. Upon proof that the real purpose was merely to create a security, equity would imply a right to a re-assignment on redemption, and the instruments would in that case operate only as mortgages or charges. Durham Bros. v. Robertson [4]; Saunderson & Co. v. Clark [5]. Evidence given on discovery, however, by the secretary of the T. R. Nickson Company and by witnesses called by the respondent with a view of shewing that these instruments, notwithstanding their absolute form, were meant to operate only as mortgages or charges makes it abundantly clear that after the execution of them the assignors regarded themselves as having no further interest in, or claim to, or upon the moneys dealt with, and that it was intended that on payment to the assignees (whose right to receive them was meant to be absolute and unqualified) of whatever sums should eventually be payable in respect of the interests assigned, the indebtedness of the assignors to them would be pro tanto discharged. In the moneys so dealt with the assignors intended to retain no right, interest or claim of any nature or kind whatsoever. That they should ever thereafter under any circumstances again have any such right, claim or interest was quite contrary to the purpose of the parties. They meant to transfer the title to the moneys dealt with, and not merely to undertake that their debt to the assignees would be partly discharged out of a particular designated fund. They did not mean to confer on the appellants merely a right to have their claim in respect to the moneys enforced by assignment. They meant to give to the assignees a direct right of action against the debtor municipality, not merely a right to institute proceedings against the assignors. Burlinson v. Hall [6]. The purpose was to confer on the appellants complete control of the part of the debt transferred to them and to put them for all purposes in the position of the T. R. Nickson Company with regard to it. These are the essential features of absolute assignments. William Brandt's Sons & Co. v. Dunlop Rubber Co.[7]; Comfort v. Betts [8]; Hughes v. Pumphouse Hotel Co. [9]. That these cases deal with the construction of s.s. 6 of s. 25 of the \"Judicature Act,\" under which the form and terms of the instrument are of greater moment than under the provision invoked by the respondent, has not been overlooked.\nAlthough such a dealing with part of a larger indebtedness has sometimes in a different sense been spoken of as charging, or giving a charge upon, that indebtedness, and there may be serious difficulties even since the \"Judicature Act,\" in the way of vesting in the assignee of part of a debt a right to sue the debtor without joining the owner of the other part of the debt, Forster v. Baker [10], I confess my inability to understand how instruments such as those here in question designed to effect a complete divestment of property and of every interest therein, legal or equitable, can be regarded as \"mortgages or charges\" within the purview of the statute invoked by the respondents either because they do not deal with the whole amounts to be earned under the several contracts, or because some of the moneys covered by them would only accrue due at a future date and their amount was subject to future ascertainment owing to the fact that certain deductions, contingent, but for defined purposes, might be made therefrom after they had become debts due to the contractors, though not presently exigible. Moreover, we are now dealing with the entire unpaid balance of the debt, Yates v. Terry [11], and all the persons interested in the debt are before the Court. Conlan v. Carlow County Council [12].\nThat the instruments in question were mortgages was scarcely argued. Indeed they lack the essential feature of a mortgage\u2014the right of redemption. The respondent relied rather on the word \"charge\" in the statute. The use of the terms \"mortgage or charge\" in collocation, however, indicates that the word \"charge\" is used in a sense somewhat akin or analogous to that of mortgage, (see authorities collected in Maxwell on Statutes (5 ed.), pp. 529 et seq.,) and was not meant to include anything so utterly foreign to the nature of a mortgage as an out and out transfer. In re Old Bushmills Distillery Co. [13], at pages 504-5,508. The net amounts earned by the T. R. Nickson Company and ultimately to become due from the municipal corporation, whatever they might be, were intended to be assigned absolutely and irrevocably to the appellant. I am, therefore, with respect, of the opinion that the assignments in question were not mortgages or charges within the statutory provision invoked on behalf of the liquidator.\nBut it is also urged that the appellants cannot recover, not because there cannot be a valid equitable assignment of a defined portion of a future debt, the amount of which has not been precisely ascertained, to arise out of a contemplated contract which is a mere expectancy (see Skipper v. Holloway [14]; Forster v. Baker [15], and cases there referred to), but on the ground that at the date when the T. R. Nickson Company went into liquidation the fund claimed was not in existence as a debt which had accrued due; and the principle underlying such cases as Wilmot v. Alton [16], Ex parte Hall [17], and Ex parte Nicholls [18], is invoked. In support of the applicability of that principle to a company in liquidation counsel for the respondent cited Bank of Scotland v. MacLeod [19], at page 317. Without assenting thereto I shall for the purposes of this case assume that a company in liquidation is governed by these authorities. Attention should, however, be directed to the facts that the bankruptcy rules as to reputed ownership do not apply to the winding-up of companies, Gorringe v. Irwell India Rubber & Gutta Percha Works [20], and that in liquidation the company's property remains vested in it and does not pass to the liquidator (who is a mere administrator) as the property of the bankrupt passes to his trustee in bankruptcy.\nUnder the terms of each of the contracts in question the municipal corporation retained 10% of the total amount earned by the contracting company for twelve months after its completion as a guarantee that the company would during that period, known as \"the term of maintenance,\" keep the pavements in good repair at its own expense, replacing any defective materials and remedying all ruts, hollows, depressions, cracks, settlements, unevenness or other defects. Should the contractor make default in fulfilling this obligation the engineer of the municipal corporation had the right, on giving forty-eight hours' notice, to execute all repairs which he should deem necessary and the corporation was entitled to charge the costs of repairs so executed against the moneys retained or any other moneys of the contractor in its hands.\nBy the first assignment\u2014that of the Pender Street contract\u2014nothing but the 10% \"retention money\" was assigned. The two other assignments deal with other moneys to be earned under the contracts as well as the 10% retention moneys. But payment of all except the 10% had been made in respect of them to the assignees before the Nickson Company went into liquidation and the only sums now in question in respect of these contracts are likewise the 10% retention moneys held under them.\nIn the case of the Pender Street contract the construction work had been finished and the retention moneys, ascertained to amount to $2,084.75, were held by the municipal corporation under the guarantee clause before the assignment of them was executed. Before the Nickson Company went into liquidation the \"term of maintenance\" had expired, $1,500 on account of the retention moneys had been paid to the assignees on the 3rd December, 1913, by the municipal corporation (which had full notice of all the assignments), the final certificate had issued on the 15th September, 1914, and after deducting $131.37 expended by it for repairs, the corporation had in hand $458.38 which had become actually payable under the contract. On the 23rd September, 1914, more than a month before the liquidation began, the Nickson Company wrote to the municipal corporation approving of the deduction of the $131.37 and requesting that payment of the balance of the retention moneys held on the Pender Street contract should be made to the appellants. There can therefore be no difficulty either as to the assignability or the absolute assignment of this money. The appeal as to it should be allowed.\nOn the other hand, in the cases of the contract for Hastings Street and that for Fourth Avenue, the \"terms of maintenance\" did not expire until August or September, 1915\u2014nearly a year after the liquidation began. All the moneys to become payable under these two contracts had been earned, however, in August or September, 1914, when the works were completed. The contracts expressly recognize this fact in providing that\na certificate, marked \"completion certificate for payment,\" at the rate of 90% on the whole amount due under the contract\nshould be issued payable to the contractors on completion of the works. These certificates had been duly issued in respect of both contracts before the liquidation. The construction of the pavement was the whole consideration for all the moneys to be paid under each contract. The consideration for the supplementary obligation to repair was the giving of the paving contract. No doubt the right to payment of the 10% retention moneys only arose twelve months afterwards, i.e., on the expiry of the \"term of maintenance.\" These moneys in the interval, however, were (subject to the assignments) the property of the T. R. Nickson Company. They were held for that company by the municipality as debita in presenti, solvenda in futuro, subject only to the fulfilment of the guarantee of maintenance, and to the right on the part of the corporation to deduct therefrom any expense to which it should be put for such maintenance or for maintenance under similar provisions of other contracts of that company. They were precisely in the same position as moneys of the T. R. Nickson Company deposited by it with the municipal corporation as a guarantee for the fulfilment of any contractual obligation would have been. Moneys so deposited remain the property of the depositor subject to the lien or charge in favour of the depositee defined by the terms of the guarantee. There was at that time nothing to prevent the assignment of these moneys by the T. R. Nickson Company to the appellants becoming effective. The assignments as to them had, no doubt, operated at the time they were made only as contracts to give them to the assignees when they should be earned, Thompson v. Cohen [21]; Cole v. Kernot [22], because\na man cannot in equity any more than at law assign what has no existence. But a man can contract to assign property which is to come into existence in the future and when it has come into existence equity, treating that as done which ought to be done, fastens upon that property and the contract to assign thus becomes a complete assignment. Collyer v. Isaacs, [23]; Holroyd v. Marshall [24].\nOn the completion of the works the right to the \"retention moneys,\" which were part of \"the whole amount due under the contract,\" passed to the assignees, subject to the lien or charge thereon of the municipal corporation. The case in respect of these moneys, I think, falls within the principle on which In re Davis [25], Ex parte Moss [26], and Pipe's Case [27], were decided. The moneys assigned had not, it is true, been earned when the assignments were made and could not, therefore, be the subject of common law assignments. But although the contracts themselves should be regarded as having been then mere expectancies and the moneys to arise under them as mere possibilities\u2014future book debts, Tailby v. Official Receiver [28]\u2014in equity, when they had been earned and were \"due,\" the assignment of them for valuable consideration became operative and could no longer be defeated even in bankruptcy. This was the situation when the T. R. Nickson Company went into liquidation. Had the liquidation occurred before the completion of the works, i.e., before the moneys had been earned, the position might have been different, and the principle of the decisions in Wilmot v. Alton [29], and Ex parte Nicholls[30], might have governed, if these bankruptcy decisions are applicable in the liquidation of a company.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that the appeal as to the retention moneys held in respect of the Hastings Street and Fourth Avenue contracts should also be allowed.\nThe appellant is entitled to its costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Senkler & Van Horne.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Livingston & O'Dell.\n[1] 23 B.C.

A writ of prohibition, issued in connection with these proceedings, was maintained by the trial judge, but was discharged by the Court of Appeal.\nBelcourt K.C. for the motion, based largely his argument upon the claim that the action sought to be prohibited was exclusively a criminal matter or in the nature of a criminal proceeding.\nAuguste Lemieux K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion to quash.\nPersonally I am disposed to hold that we are without jurisdiction on the ground that the judgment appealed from was rendered upon a writ of prohibition against proceeding with the hearing of a criminal charge; and, under the jurisprudence of this court and of the Court of Appeal in England, there is no appeal in such cases. Gaynor and Green v. United States of America,[1]; Rex v. Garrett[2]. The appellant was charged before a magistrate with having set fire to the forest in the lower part of the River Brul\u00e9 in the County of St. John without justification or excuse and against the statutes in such case made and provided. The statutes relied upon by the complainant are R.S.Q. (1909) sections 1636-37-39-40-41-55 and article 515 of the Criminal Code which latter makes it an offence to recklessly set fire to any forest in violation of a provincial or municipal law.\nThe writ of prohibition now in question was issued in connection with these proceedings and discharged by the Court of Appeal and this appeal is taken from that judgment.\nIn Rex v. Garrett2, their Lordships say:\u2014\nThe judgment of the Divisional Court in this case, discharging the rule for a prohibition, was a judgment in a criminal cause or matter \u2014namely, the criminal proceedings pending in the Police Court, and this Court was unable to entertain any appeal from that judgment.\nThe majority of the court, however, prefer to grant the motion on the principle laid down in Desormeaux v. Village of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[3], where it was held that no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of a court of the Province of Quebec in case of proceedings for or upon a writ of prohibition unless the matter in controversy falls within some of the classes of cases provided for by section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nDavies J.\u2014The motion to quash this appeal was based by Mr. Belcourt largely upon the claim that the action sought to be prohibited was exclusively a criminal matter or in the nature of a criminal proceeding.\nIt is not necessary for me to deal with this contention because I am of opinion that apart from the question of the proceedings being of a criminal nature no appeal lies.\nThe judgments of this court in Desormeaux v. Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se3, and Olivier v. Jolin[4], decided during this present year, determine respectively, 1st, that the section giving an appeal to this court in cases of prohibition is limited and controlled by the 46th section of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and, secondly, that in sub-section (6) of that section the words \"where future rights may be bound\" control the whole sub-section.\nThese two authorities are conclusive against the right to appeal in this case and the motion to quash should be allowed with costs. It may not and could not be argued successfully that any future rights were bound by the judgment appealed from. Idington J.\u2014The motion to quash should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal is incompetent on Mr. Belcourt's second ground; it is excluded by section 46.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal is not within any of the clauses (a), (b) and (c) of section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and therefore does not lie. Desormeaux v. St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[5], is directly in point. While inclined to think that this is a case of prohibition arising out of a criminal charge and as such likewise not within section 39 (c), I find it unnecessary to rest my judgment on that ground.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Armand Boily.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Ths.

First, was the evidence sufficient to establish that the schooner was fishing within the three mile limit; and, secondly, is the limit to be measured from the mainland or is fishing within three miles from the shore of St. Paul's Island, situate fifteen miles from the mainland of Nova Scotia, illegal under the treaty of 1818?\nR. G. Code K.C. for the appellant. The evidence that the \"Fallon\" was fishing or preparing to fish within the three mile limit was far from convincing. As precise measurements cannot be ascertained distances should be calculated liberally. The \"Twee Gebroeders\"[1]; The \"Kitty D.\" v. The King[2].\nThe marine league must be measured from the coast of the mainland. At all events, if the treaty contemplates the three miles from the coast of an island it must be an island of considerable size and capable of use and cultivation. Ferguson, Manual of International Law, page 399; Twiss, Law of Nations (280), page 292; Pigott's Nationality, Pt. 1, page 40.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondent dealt with the evidence as sufficiently establishing the position of The Fallon within the three mile limit.\nThe term \"coast\" in the treaty means the coast of the mainland and its dependencies, even though the latter are incapable of being inhabited or fortified. Wheaton, International Law (4 ed.), page 277; Halleck, International Law, page 174. Mowat v. North Vancouver[3].\nR. G. Code K.C. for the appellant.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the local Judge in Admiralty decreeing the condemnation and forfeiture of the schooner \"John J. Fallon,\" her tackle, rigging, etc., on the ground that she was fishing or preparing to fish within three marine miles of the \"coasts, bays, creeks, or harbours of Canada,\" namely, St. Paul's Island, N.S.\nThere are two questions presented by the evidence. First, whether the schooner when arrested was within the three mile limit of the coasts of Canada, and, secondly, whether she was fishing at the time. Mr. Justice Drysdale found that the vessel was, at the time of the seizure, within the three mile limit and no other conclusion is reasonably open upon the evidence. The observations taken by Lieutenant McGuirk, checked and found correct by Captain Webb of the \"Hochelaga,\" shew the \"Fallon\" and its dories to have been within the three mile belt off of the shore of St. Paul's Island. Captain Stewart of the Government patrol vessel \"Canada\" also took bearings with an instrument called a pelorus, which measures exact distances, and found that the trawls which had been left in position by the schooner \"Fallon\" were within the three mile limit. But the most conclusive evidence is to be found in the cross-examination of Capt. Oliver, from which I make the following extract:\u2014\nQ. Did you take any bearings? A. No, sir.\nQ. Did the officer? A. He said they took bearings aboard his boat.\nQ. Did he take bearings aboard your ship? A. He looked at the compass.\nQ. Did he take the bearings on board your ship? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Did he shew you you were one and a quarter miles from the shore? A. Two and a quarter, I think he told me. I think he told me we were three-quarters of a mile inside the limits; two and a quarter from shore.\nQ. If that was correct that you were two and a quarter miles from shore, could you not by the use of your own compass and instruments have found out you were within the three mile limit? A. I can see how near we are only by the compass; the only instrument we have.\nQ. If from what the officer said you were only two and a quarter miles from the shore, could you by using your compass or bearings have known you were within the three mile limit? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. The whole trouble arose by not using your compass, if you did, you could have found out? A. Yes, but I thought we were outside the limit. I had no intention of violating the law.\nIt is denied, however, that St. Paul's Island is part of the coast of Nova Scotia, notwithstanding that by the statutes of that Province it is made part of the County of Victoria. But whatever may be the effect of that legislation, it can scarcely be contended that the territorial waters of Canada do not extend three miles seaward from St. Paul's Island. Such a contention would, as pointed out by Mr. Newcombe in his argument, be at variance with the position taken by the State Department at Washington so far as concerns the eastern coast of North America, and with the accepted authorities on international law.\nWharton's International Law Digest, pp. 107-109, quotes from letters from Mr. Bayard to Mr. Manning:\nThe position of the State Department has uniformly been that the sovereignty of the shore does not, so far as territorial authority is concerned, extend beyond three miles from high water mark and that the seaward boundary of this line of territorial waters follows the coast of the mainland, extending where there are islands, so as to place around such islands the same belt.\nThe same view of the extent of territorial jurisdiction is held by the British Government and has been supported on various occasions by the decisions of the British courts. Reg. v. Keyn[4]; The Queen v. Dudley[5], at p. 281; The \"Anna\"[6]; see also The \"Frederick Gerring, Jr.\" v. The Queen[7], per Sedgewick J. at pp. 287 and 288.\nThe title of Great Britain to St. Paul's Island under the treaty of 1763 and by occupation is made abundantly clear in Mr. Newcombe's admirably prepared factum.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Nova Scotia Judge in Admiralty, Mr. Justice Drysdale, condemning the defendant schooner, a United States fishing vessel, as forfeited to the King on the ground that when captured she was fishing within three marine miles of St. Paul's Island, N.S., such island being a part of \"the coast\" of Canada, in contravention of \"The Customs and Fisheries Protection Act,\" R.S.C. ch. 47, and amending Acts.\nTwo questions were raised and argued on this appeal. First, that the proof was insufficient to establish the fact of the vessel having Keen, when captured, \"fishing or preparing to fish\" within three marine miles of the Island of. St. Paul; and; secondly, that even if that fact was proved, the Island of St. Paul, situate some fifteen miles from the mainland, could not be held to be part of the \"coasts\" of Canada within the meaning of that term as used in the renunciatory clause of the Treaty of 1818 between Great Britain and the United States.\nOn the question of fact as to the vessel when captured being actually engaged in fishing within three marine miles of the coast of St. Paul's Island, I cannot think under the evidence there can be any doubt and the learned local Judge in Admiralty so found.\nThe only answer made by the officers of the condemned ship was that they thought they were not within the three mile limit and that they had no intention to break the law. In most of these cases of alleged violation of the treaty of 1818 by fishing vessels, this excuse is generally set up. But even supposing that the excuse of non-intention to fish within the limits was advanced in good faith, the evidence in my judgment places the fact of the vessel being engaged in fishing very much within the limit of three miles beyond any question. The question is one of fact not of intention and dealing with the facts as we find them proved it would require much charity to reach the conclusion that the officers were not aware that they were violating the law, even if such a conclusion was necessary to reach.\nAs to the legal question whether St. Paul's Island is to be held as part of the \"coast\" of Canada within the meaning of that term as used in the renunciation clause of the treaty of 1818, I do not entertain any reasonable doubt.\nThe admissions of facts in the case state\n(a). That St. Paul's Island is an isolated island, covered to some extent by dwarfed spruce and very little of it is fit for cultivation. The island is situate in Cabot Strait 15 miles from Cape North, Nova Scotia, which is the nearest main land. The island is three miles in length and two miles in the widest portion of it. The island consists of gray colored granite.\n(b). That St. Paul's Island has no settlers excepting an occasional fisherman in the summer time. The persons located there are the Dominion Government employees, that is to say:\u2014The Superintendent, the keeper of the lights and a government life-saving crew. And when the ice is packed around the Island and navigation is closed about it the lights are not lit.\n(c). That there are no bays, harbours or creeks in St. Paul's Island and supplies are landed by boats from vessels standing off at sea in fine weather. For Municipal and other purposes St. Paul's Island is deemed part of Victoria County.\nArticle 1 of the treaty of 1818, after providing that the inhabitants of the United States should have \"forever in common with the subjects of His Britannic Majesty the liberty to take fish of every kind\" within certain specified limits, went on to provide as follows:\nAnd the United States hereby renounce forever any liberty heretofore enjoyed or claimed by the inhabitants thereof, to take, dry or cure fish on, or within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, harbours of His Britannic Majesty's Dominions in America not included or within the above mentioned limits.\nThe question therefore resolves itself into one whether St. Paul's Island was a part of His Majesty's Dominions in America not included within the limits provided for common rights of fishing and if so whether its shores were embraced within the words \"any of the coasts, bays, creeks, harbours\" thereof in the renunciation.\nThe island is clearly not within the limits provided for a common right of fishing and in my judgment is embraced within the words of the renunciatory clause \"any of the coasts, etc.\" of His Majesty's Dominions in America not included within the limits providing for a common right of fishing.\nThe argument for the appellant at bar, as I understand it, was an elaboration of that stated in the factum as follows:\u2014\nIt is submitted that the very fact that the treaty of 1818 uses the words \"coasts, bays, harbours and creeks\" together indicates by all the rules of construction, that the land contemplated as that from which the three mile limit extends is such land as has coasts, bays, harbours and creeks, that is, the mainland and such islands as have these characteristics.\nI am not able to accept such an argument. It practically amounts to this, that because in the treaty the word \"coast\" was followed by the words \"bays, harbours and creeks\" the renunciation only extended to such islands off the main coasts as have these latter characteristics.\nWhy such a limitation should be read into the words \"any of the coasts, bays, creeks, harbours, etc.\" I cannot understand.\nIn my judgment, \"any of the coasts\" is large enough and definite enough to embrace such an island lying off the mainland as St. Paul's is admitted to be.\nIt has always been claimed, treated and utilized as part of the King's Dominions in America and so far as I have been able to find no trace exists of any claim to the contrary having been set up since the treaty by any foreign nation.\nLong before the Confederation of the Dominion of Canada, the island was by express legislation of the Province of Nova Scotia made part of the County of Victoria in that Province and has for a great many years been used as a lighthouse and a station for a government life-saving crew.\nIf the argument advanced by the appellant was tenable it would apply to other islands, such as Prince Edward Island, Anticosti, Sable Island, etc., and would practically nullify the renunciatory clauses of the treaty.\nThe terms of the cession of territory made by France to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris, 1763, clearly embrace St. Paul's Island, the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon in the Gulf of St. Lawrence being alone retained by France. The occupation of St. Paul's Island by Great Britain since that treaty has never at any time, so far as I know, been questioned by any foreign power and it must be taken to be part of the Dominion of Canada, and its shores part of the coasts of the Dominion.\nIdington J.\u2014I find no reason in fact or the relevant law for disturbing the judgment appealed from and hence am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014First, as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding of Drysdale J. that the appellant ship was found fishing within three marine miles of the Island of St. Paul's. I see no reason to disturb the finding. I accept the contention of the appellant ship that something more than a mere preponderance of probability is necessary to establish this. (See Carlson v. The King[8].) It cannot be said that the evidence in this \"case is in an uncertain and unsatisfactory state.\" (The Kitty D. v. The King[9].) I proceed to consider the questions of law raised by the appeal. The factum of the Attorney-General contains an argument conclusively shewing that St. Paul's Island is British territory, and that it is de facto and de jure part of Canada, and that being so, the only remaining subjects for consideration are, first: Is St. Paul's Island included within the phrase \"coasts, bays, creeks and harbours of Canada?\" And secondly, whether any treaty or convention is in force permitting the inhabitants of the United States to fish in the locality where the appellant ship was found. To sustain the judgment of the court below it is necessary, by reason of the provisions of the first section of ch. 14 of the Statutes of Canada, 1913, amending ch. 47 R.S.C. 1906, that the first of these questions should be answered in the affirmative and the second in the negative.\nAs to the first question, the argument on behalf of the appellant is expressed thus in his factum: That \"coast\" means the general coast line of the mainland at low water and that by the operation of the rule noscitur a sociis the word \"\"coast\" should be held in this context to have no application to a shore of such limited magnitude as to have no bays, harbours or creeks. I have no hesitation in rejecting this contention. I have no doubt the word \"coasts\" in this statute embraces the coast of any part of the territory of Canada.\nAs to the second question. The principal contention was that by the treaty of 1783, the right was granted to the inhabitants of the United States to fish on the \"coasts, bays and creeks\" of all British Dominions in America, and that the renunciation by the United States expressed in article 1 of the treaty of 1818, by which the United States renounced forever any right enjoyed or claimed by its inhabitants to fish within three marine miles of British coasts in America, with certain exceptions, not at present material, must be restricted in its application to those localities over which, by the accepted doctrines of international law, the British sovereignty prevailed; and it is argued that the extension of territorial sovereignty over the marginal seas (the three mile distance from the shore) is not recognized in the case of small unoccupied and unproductive islands such as St. Paul's Island.\nThis contention is quite without foundation. The international recognition of sovereignty in respect of marginal seas rests upon very easily intelligible and well settled principles. The grounds of the doctrine are very lucidly explained by Mr. Hall (6th ed., pp. 150, 151). Imperium over these waters is necessary for the safety of the state and over them control can be effectively exercised.\nIn the judgments in Reg. v. Keyn[10], \u00e1 vast number of authorities is collected in which this is accepted with unanimity. The passage in Grotius, which is the beginning of them, is cited by Cockburn C.J. at page 176, and is in the following words:\u2014\nVidetur autem imperium in maris portionem eadem ratione acquiri, qua imperia alia; id est, ut supra diximus, ratione personarum et ratione territorii. Ratione personarum, ut si classis, qui maritimus est exercitus, aliquo in loco maris se habeat; ratione territorii, quatenus ex terra cogi possunt qui in proxima maris parte versantur, nec minus quam so in ipsa terra reperirentur.\nA power possessing a barren island is entitled to protect its property; and control over the marginal seas is just as essential for this purpose in the case of a barren island as in the case of a small highly productive one. With regard to the possibility of control, Mr. Westlake, at page 190 of the first part of his book on International Law, discusses the subject in this way:\u2014\nThe area of the land on which a strip of littoral sea is dependent is of no consequence in principle. Guns might be planted on a small island, and we presume that even in practice an island, without reference to its actual means of control over the neighboring water, carries the sovereignty over the same width of the latter all around it as a piece of mainland belonging to the same state would carry. But an extreme case may be put of something which can scarcely be called an island. \"If,\" Sir Charles Russell said when arguing in the Behring Sea arbitration, \"a lighthouse is built upon a rock or upon piles driven into the bed of the sea, it becomes so far as that lighthouse is concerned part of the territory of the nation which has erected it, and as part of the territory of the nation which has erected it, it has incident to it all the rights that belong to the protection of territory\u2014no more and no less.\" It is doubtful from the context whether the eminent advocate meant by this to claim more for the lighthouse in its territorial character than immunity from violation and injury, of course together with the exclusive authority and jurisdiction of its state. It would be difficult to admit that a mere rock and building, incapable of being so armed as really to control the neighbouring sea, could be made the source of a presumed occupation of it converting a large tract into territorial water. It might, however, be fair to claim an exclusive right of fishing so near the spot that, without the light fishing there would have been too dangerous to be practicable.\nFurther discussion seems superfluous. I may add, however, that I prefer to rest my judgment upon grounds of principle independently of Lord Stowell's decision in \"The Anna\"[11], the exact application of which may, I think, be open to argument.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Upon the evidence before him Mr. Justice Drysdale could not, in my opinion, have come to any other conclusion than that the schooner \"Fallon\" was fishing within three miles of the shore of St. Paul's Island when arrested.\nI have heard no good reason advanced in support of the other ground of appeal, that the renunciation by the Government of the United States in the Treaty of 1818 of the liberty of American citizens to fish within three miles of the coasts of British Dominions in America does not apply to a three mile belt around St. Paul's Island because it is comparatively small and lies more than three miles from the mainland. That the island is a British possession and forms part of the Dominion of Canada does not admit of question. Two lighthouses are erected on it which are under the control of the Government of Canada. I can conceive of no reasonable ground on which it could be held that the territorial rights of the Dominion do not extend over the waters lying within three miles of the island. In The King v. Chlopeck Fish Co.[12], cited by counsel for the Attorney-General, it was assumed, I think rightly, that the waters within the three marine miles of the shores of Cox Island, which lies about seven miles off the coast of the mainland, were subject to the prohibition against fishing by Americans within territorial waters of Canada. Authority on such a point seems to be superfluous. Some however may be found in the cases of The \"Anna\"[13], and of The \"Vrow Anna Catharina\"[14], cited in the factum filed on behalf of the Attorney-General.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

Respondents.\n1917: May 21; 1917: June 22.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPEAL DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nWill\u2014Devise of Mortgage\u2014Election\u2014Maintenance.\nW. by his will bequeathed real estate to a trustee the revenue therefrom, so far as necessary, to be applied to the support and maintenance of his son who was in poor health and afterwards became lunatic. He also devised the sum of $12,000 directly to the son and to St. Andrew's Church a mortgage he held on the church property which he had previously assigned to the said son. In an action by the Committee of the latter for a declaration of rights under the will:\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appeal Division (44 N.B. Rep. 153) Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that the Committee must elect between taking the benefits under the will, the provision for maintenance as well as the money devised, and retaining the rights of the son under the mortgage.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. the case was not one for the application of the equitable doctrine of election. The devise of the mortgage must be treated as a legacy to the church of the amount due thereon.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants The facts are not in dispute and are stated in the above head-note.\nPowell K.C. and F. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellants. The devisee can only be compelled to elect if the property devised is free disposable property and the testator plainly intended the contrary. See 13 Halsbury Laws of England, page 123; In re Wintle[2]; In re Sanderson's Trust[3] at page 503; In re Bryant[4].\nThe testator could not dispose of property that did not belong to him and must be considered as having had something in his mind besides the mortgage held by his son when he made the devise to the church. See Dummer v. Pitcher[5]; In re Harris[6].\nPugsley K.C. and Baxter K.C. for the respondents. As to election see Cope v. Wilmot[7], referred to in In re Sanderson's Trust3; Pitman v. Crum Ewing[8]; In re Sefton[9].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The will of the testator contained the following:\u2014\nI give, devise and bequeath to the Trustees of St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, in the City of St. John, the mortgage which I now hold on their property and all principal and interest due or owing thereon at the time of my death.\nPrior to the date of his will the testator had assigned this mortgage, which was for $30,000, to his son absolutely.\nUnder the will the son is entitled to benefits which, I will assume, are of value exceeding $30,000. It is claimed by the respondents that he must elect between taking the benefits under the will and discharging the mortgage, or retaining the mortgage and compensating the respondents for their disappointment. If he is put to his election at all it is perhaps not very material which he does; the amount for which he would be liable to the respondents is really the same in either case. The court below seems to have fallen into the error of supposing that if he elects against the will he must renounce all benefits under the will and that therefore it is more advantageous to him to take under the will. He is, however, only bound if he elects against the will to compensate the respondents to the extent of their disappointment under the will, and that, of course, is the sum of $30,000, which he would have to forego if he elected to take entirely under the will.\nIn my opinion, however, no question of election arises at all. The doctrine of election is purely an equitable one and in equity a mortgage is only a security for the debt. Now the testator mistakenly alleged that the respondents were indebted to him and he forgave the debt. There is no question here of a bequest of the son's property; it is a legacy to the respondents and it makes no difference that the mortgage is vested in the son for the respondents can redeem the mortgage and so the intention of the testator will not be disappointed.\nIn Findlater v. Lowe[10], it was held that:\nIf a testator has had at a time antecedent to the will a certain kind of stock or property, and he has parted with it before the date of the will, and by his will purports to dispose of it in a way which if he had retained it would have been a specific legacy, it will be treated by the court as a general legacy of equivalent amount payable out of the general personal estate. Mrs. Baker, the residuary legatee, is not a party to these proceedings but I observe that at the trial Mr. Teed K.C. who with Mr. Ewing K.C. appeared for the executor, stated that he was instructed more particularly on her behalf.\nThe residuary legatee has, however, no equity to oblige the plaintiff to make an election. I refer to the case of Lady Cavan v. Pulteney[11], at page 561,[12], at page 385, and also to the elaborate judgment in McGinnis v. McGinnis[13].\nThere should be a declaration that the plaintiff is not put to his election in respect of any of the benefits left to him by the will, to the whole of which he is entitled according to their nature and the tenor of the will, and that the respondents, the Trustees of St. Andrew's Church, are entitled to a general legacy of the amount equivalent to the mortgage debt formerly held by the testator and interest due at the time of his death, payable out of the estate of the testator.\nThe executor has pleaded that the estate is not liable to the respondents, the Trustees of St. Andrew's Church, but as they have not advanced any claim against the estate I think they are not entitled to any costs although the result is to give them a right to be paid out of the estate. All parties bear their own costs.\nPowell K.C. and F. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellants.\nPugsley K.C. and Baxter K.C. for the respondents.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the appeal division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick confirming a judgment of the trial judge in equity declaring that the plaintiffs, the Committee of the Estate of John D. Walker, a person of unsound mind and so found, who applied for a declaration as to their rights under the will of the late James Walker, were bound to elect in favour or against the will bequeathing a certain interest in property of his for the maintenance and support of said John D. Walker, and certain other property which did not belong to the testator but did belong to said John D. Walker, to the Trustees of St. Andrew's Church and directing that the committee should elect under and not against the will and making the necessary provisions to have their decree of election carried out.\nThe facts to enable the controversy as to John D. Walker's being compelled to elect under or against the will to be understood are not in dispute.\nShortly they are that some years before his death, James Walker became the assignee and owner of a mortgage on certain real property given by the Trustees of St. Andrew's Church to secure the payment of $30,000 and interest and had assigned the same to his son, John D. Walker.\nSubsequently, and after the latter had become non compos mentis, James Walker made a will by which he bequeathed that mortgage and the moneys secured by it (although they were not then his) to the Trustees of St. Andrew's Church, the mortgagors. In and by the same will he bequeathed certain property to trustees for the support and maintenance in comfort of his insane son, John D. Walker, and by a codicil to the will bequeathed his son $12,600 additional.\nOn his death, the question at once arose whether John D. Walker was entitled to claim his support and maintenance under the will and the $12,600 specifically bequeathed to him and at the same time claim as his own property the mortgage and moneys secured thereby. In other words, could he approbate the will to the full extent of all the benefits it conferred upon him and at the same time reprobate it by refusing to recognize and complete the bequest of the mortgage to the trustees of the church, or was he bound to elect either for or against the will and so in the former case accept all the benefits it conferred upon him adopting the bequest of the mortgage to the trustees, or, in the latter case, of electing against the will, retain his own property, the $30,000 mortgage, and renounce the maintenance and support provided for him in the will as well as the $12,600 specifically bequeathed to him, or could John D. Walker hold that the doctrine of election did not apply at all and that he could claim the mortgage as its owner, and his maintenance and support and the $12,600 under the will?\nThe latter claim was the one advanced on the part of the Committee of John D. Walker, which the courts below had decreed against, and which claim on this appeal it was desired this court should affirm.\nAs to the further bequest by codicil of $12,600 to John D. Walker, the argument was advanced by the appellants, though very weakly, that even with respect to this sum, reading will and codicil together, the doctrine of election was not applicable.\nThe courts below were unanimous, however, in holding that so far as the $12,600 bequest was concerned the Committee of John D. Walker's estate would be obliged to elect and I, concurring with them, do not think the question arguable.\nChief Justice Sir E. Macleod, however, differed from his colleagues in the Appeal Division as to the application of the doctrine of election to the maintenance and support provisions of the will, holding that it was not applicable because, as I understand his argument, these provisions did not vest in John D. Walker any estate or interest which was capable of being disposed of by him or could be used for any other purpose than his maintenance and support; in other words, it was not \"free disposable property\" vested in or given to the legatee which he held was essential in order to put him to his election, and that the terms of these maintenance and support provisions clearly indicated an intention on the part of the testator not to put him to such an election.\nThe learned Chief Justice accepted what he considered to be the law with respect to this subject as laid down in 13 Halsbury, page 123, but I am not able to agree with him in his conclusion that the provisions of the will for the maintenance and support of his son John D. indicated a particular intention inconsistent with the general and presumed intention of the will, or that these provisions did not vest in the son such an interest in and benefit out of the properties devised for him as would entitle the court to lay hold on such interest and benefit and sequestrate them for the purpose of obtaining compensation to the Trustees of St. Andrew's Church in case of an election against the will.\nThe paragraph reads as follows:\u2014\n139. From the principle that election proceeds on the footing of compensation it follows that no case for election will be raised against a person whose property a testator has purported to dispose of, unless he takes under the will a benefit out of property which the testator can actually dispose of. It is only such benefit which gives the necessary fund for compensation. The doctrine of election cannot be applied, except where, if an election is made contrary to the will, the interest that would pass by the will can be laid hold of to compensate the beneficiary who is disappointed by the election. Therefore, in all cases there must be some free disposable property given by the will to the person whom it is sought to put to his election.\nIt is not doubted or questioned, in fact it is conceded, that the testator had a free disposable interest in the property he devised to the Committee of his son John D. Walker and I am quite unable to draw or conclude from the provisions of the will for the maintenance and support of the son and procuring for him \"the necessaries and comforts of life so long as he shall live\" any indication of an intention not to put him to an election under the will as between these provisions and the bequest or gift of the mortgage to the trustees of the church. I cannot doubt that if the son John D. Walker was of sound mind he would be compelled to make such an election. His interest would be disposable by him and available towards making compensation to the disappointed beneficiary in the event of his electing against the will. Its value in such case would be ascertainable, though perhaps with some difficulty, but the mere fact of its being difficult would not alter the duty of the court to have its value ascertained. Of course, if he elected under the will, no compensation would have to be provided because in that case as in the one now before us where the court elected for him he would be directed to cancel and discharge the mortgage.\nThe fact that the son had become and was at the date of the will a lunatic or person of unsound mind does not change the conclusion which I think should be drawn from these maintenance and support provisions.\nThe only difference between the conditions is that in the one case suggested the beneficiary being compos mentis would make his own election, while in the other, the present case, the court makes it for him.\nIf it became necessary in case of an election against the will to put a value upon the interest of the son under these maintenance and support provisions, I would hold that the beneficiary was entitled to the whole of the net proceeds of the properties devised for his benefit. No words of limitation are used to indicate that he was only to get a part of these net proceeds. No person is given the power to determine or to exercise any discretion with respect to the amount he was entitled to. If he was compos mentis, I think he could insist upon all the net \"rents and income\" being paid to him and I cannot see that the fact of his not being of sound mind could prejudice his rights in that regard.\nThis is not like the case of In re Sanderson's Trusts[14], where the gift was to trustees to pay and apply the whole or any part of the rents, issues and property for and towards the maintenance, attendance and comfort of J. Sanderson who was an \"imbecile and not competent to manage his own affairs.\" In that case there was drawn a\ndistinction between a gift, like the above, of \"the whole or any part\" and a gift of an entire fund, or the entire interest of a fund, for a particular purpose assigned; in the latter, although the purpose fails, the court holds the donee entitled to the entire fund or interest (as the case may be), treating the purpose merely as the motive of the gift.\nThis doctrine of election is an equitable one and its foundation and characteristic effect is stated in different language in the text books but there is really no difference between the statements. In Snell's Principles of Equity they are stated thus at page 179:\nElection in equity arises, where there is a duality of gifts or of purported gifts in the same instrument,\u2014one of the gifts being to C. of the donor's own property, and the other being to B. of the property of C.; in the case of such a duality of gifts, there is an intention implied, that the gift to C. shall take effect, only if C: elects to permit the gift to B. also to take effect. This presumed intention is the foundation or principle of the doctrine of election; and the characteristic of that doctrine is, that, by an equitable arrangement, effect is given to the purported gift to B. \"The principle is that there is an implied condition that he who accepts a benefit under an instrument must adopt the whole of it, conforming to all its provisions, and renouncing every right inconsistent with it.\"\nSee also Smith's Equity Jurisprudence in the chapter on Election at page 137 and following pages, and Williams on Executors, 10th ed., page 1030.\nIn the late case of In re Vardon's Trusts[15], relied on at bar, Fry L.J. in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Court consisting of Lord Esher M.R., Bowen L.J. and himself, says at page 279:\u2014\nThat doctrine rests, not on the particular provisions of the instrument which raises the election, but on the presumption of a general intention in the authors of an instrument that effect shall be given to every part of it, \"the ordinary intent,\" to use the words of Lord Hatherley (Cooper v. Cooper[16]), \"implied in every man who effects by a legal instrument to dispose of property, that he intends all that he has expressed.\" This general and presumed intention is not repelled by shewing that the circumstances which in the event gave rise to the election were not in the contemplation of the author of the instrument (Cooper v. Cooper16), but in principle it is evident that it may be repelled by the declaration in the instrument itself of a particular intention inconsistent with the presumed and general intention.\nFor example, if the settlement in question had contained an express declaration that in no case should the doctrine of election be applied to its provisions, there seems to be no reason why such a declaration should not have full effect given to it. The late Mr. Swanston appears to us to have correctly enunciated the law on this point, when he said: \"The rule of not claiming by one part of an instrument in contradiction to another, has exceptions; and the ground of exception seems to be, a particular intention, adopted by the instrument different from the general intention the presumption of which is the foundation of the doctrine of election.\"\nThe court in that case held that the restraint upon alienation in the settlement there in question contained\na declaration of a particular intention inconsistent with the doctrine of election\nand therefore excluded it. But I find nothing of the kind here, nothing equivalent to a restraint upon alienation, nothing inconsistent with the doctrine of election, and no express declaration which the testator might, if he desired, have put in his will that in no case should the doctrine of election be applied to its provisions.\nIn Lord Chesham's case, Cavendish v. Dacre[17], Chitty J. in reviewing the authorities and the law on this doctrine of election, and the principle on which the doctrine is based, says at page 474:\u2014\nIn Wollaston v. King[18], at page 174, Lord Justice James, then Vice-Chancellor, after stating that he had endeavoured to extract from the cases a principle, adopted the rule laid down by the Master of the Rolls in Whistler v. Webster[19], in the following general terms, viz.: \"That no man shall claim any benefit under a will without conforming, as far as he is able, and giving effect to everything contained in it whereby any disposition is made shewing an intention that such a thing shall take place.\"\nIn Cooper v. Cooper[20], Lord Hatherley says (page 69): \"The main principle was never disputed, that there is an obligation on him who takes a benefit under a will or other instrument to give full effect to that instrument under which he takes a benefit; and if it be found that that instrument purports to deal with something which it was beyond the power of the donor or settlor to dispose of, but to which effect can be given by the concurrence of him who receives a benefit under the same instrument, the law will impose on him who takes the benefit the obligation of carrying the instrument into full and complete force and effect.\"\nIn Codrington v. Codrington[21], Lord Cairns states the law thus (page 861): \"By the well settled doctrine which is termed in the Scotch law the doctrine of 'approbate' and 'reprobate,' and in our courts more commonly the doctrine of 'election,' where a deed or will professes to make a general disposition of property for the benefit of a person named in it, such person cannot accept a benefit und\u00e9r the instrument without at the same time conforming to all its provisions, and renouncing every right inconsistent with them.\"\nI would dismiss the appeal; but under the circumstances think that costs of both parties to the appeal should be paid out of the testator James Walker's estate. Idington J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the judgment appealed from should stand. But on the question of costs of appeal here I am in doubt. I imagine there can be no doubt that a case of some difficulty was presented requiring the construction of the will and hence the appellant trustees entitled to their costs out of the estate, yet Mr. Rosborough seems distinguished against by the formal judgment of the court below.\nThe respondents are entitled to their costs and I presume costs of all parties should come out of the estate. But for the not unreasonable division of opinion of the Court of Appeal I think litigation should have ended there.\nThe substantial division of opinion seems to me to entitle all parties to their costs out of the estate.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAnglin J.\u2014In the report of this case in the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[22] the facts are fully presented and the leading cases bearing upon them are discussed. But for the circumstances that the testamentary beneficiary, a portion of whose property the testator has devised to another, is a lunatic and that part of the benefit to which he is entitled under the will in question consists of a provision for his maintenance, there would seem to be no room to question the applicability of the doctrine of election. That the beneficiary is bound to elect between taking a pecuniary legacy of $12,600 given to him by a codicil, and retaining his $30,000 mortgage which his father bequeathed to the respondents, was the unanimous opinion of the learned trial judge and of the three learned judges who composed the appellate court. The contrary view was very faintly urged in this court, and is scarcely arguable.\nBut there was a difference of opinion in the provincial appellate court upon the question whether the provision for payment, out of the revenues of certain properties, of so much thereof as should be required to provide the lunatic with all necessaries and comforts and to give him a decent Christian burial, clearly denotes a particular intention that the right to this benefit should be inalienable, so that it would not be available for application in compensation should election be made against the will.\nIf the beneficiary were compos mentis his interest in this provision for maintenance would undoubtedly be alienable and therefore available towards making compensation in the event of an election against the will. Its value is ascertainable. The fact that the beneficiary is a lunatic does not exempt him from the operation of the doctrine of election in a case which is otherwise a subject for its enforcement. The court protects him by supervising the election.\nWith Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKeown I am of the opinion that in making provision for the maintenance of his lunatic son, the testator has not evinced a particular intention either that that provision should be inalienable or that his son should be entitled to the full benefit of it even though he should refuse to relinquish his own property devised by his father to the church. It would be quite within the power of the court in the interest of the lunatic so to deal with the $30,000 mortgage, should he retain it, that whatever purpose the testator may have had in making the provision for payment of income to his custodians of insuring the permanence and continuance of his maintenance would not be frustrated. With Mr. Justice McKeown I am satisfied that the testator had no actual intention on the subject of election. On the other hand, it is clear that he intended that St. Andrew's Church should be relieved from the $30,000 mortgage which he formerly held and had assigned to his son. He probably forgot that he had parted with this mortgage. The authorities, however, establish that it is immaterial whether the testator knew the property so dealt with not to be his own, or mistakenly conceived it to be his own. Welby v. Welby[23], at page 199.\nFor these reasons, more fully stated by Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKeown, I would affirm the judgment in appeal. On the ground assigned in Singer v. Singer[24], at page 464, I think the appellants should pay the respondents their costs in this court.\nAppeal dismissed. Costs payable out of estate.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Fred. R.

S.C. 1886, c. 32, ss. 157, 158 and 167, now R.S.C. 1906, c. 48, ss. 132, 133 and 264.\nThe appellant company, pursuant to the requirements of section 157 of the \"Customs Act,\" R.S.C. 1886, c. 32 (now R.S.C. 1906, c. 48, s. 132), gave to one Hobbs, customs broker, a power of attorney \"to transact all business which\" the appellant \"may have with the Collector of the Port of Montreal or relating to the Department of Customs of the said Port * * *, ratifying and confirming all that * * * said attorney and agent shall do * * *.\" Cheques to the order of the Collector of Customs were given to Hobbs on his requisition for the payment of duties on goods imported by the appellant, these cheques being made by the latter for fixed amounts corresponding to the invoices. Afterwards, through fraudulent devices, Hobbs, having succeeded in passing entries for much smaller sums than the quantity of goods required, induced the Customs House cashier to take the cheques thus issued by the appellant for a higher amount than the one apparently due and either to apply the surplus in payment of duties owing by third parties or to reimburse him in cash. The frauds having been discovered, the respondent sued the appellant for the amount of duties unpaid through the criminal method of Hobbs.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (14 Ex. C.R. 150), the court being equally divided, that, upon the facts in evidence, the appellant company had failed to prove that the customs duties claimed from it had been paid to or received by the Crown, per Anglin J., the appellant having failed to discharge the burden placed upon it by the \"Customs Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, c. 48, s. 264. Per Fitzpatrick C.J., Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014It was within the scope of the power of attorney given to Hobbs by the appellant company that he should receive for it, in cash. from the Customs officials, balances of cheques delivered by him to them, after deducting the duties payable in respect of entries made by Hobbs on behalf of the company appellant.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J.\u2014It was not within the scope of the power of attorney that he should direct the application of balances of the company's cheques in payment of duties owing by Hobbs' other customers; and such unreturned balances remained in the hands of the Crown the property of the company notwithstanding such direction by Hobbs and the pretended application of the moneys accordingly.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions of law are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and W. R. Tilley K.C. for the the appellant.\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. and A. Wainwright K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J.\u2014I think this appeal must fail.\nThe conclusions of fact I have drawn from reading the evidence after the argument at bar are that the customs duties sought to be recovered by the Crown in this action never were paid to or received by the Crown. The monies to pay them were no doubt paid over by the Railway Company to its agent in good faith for the purpose of paying these duties; but the latter misappropriated the monies and applied them to his own use or to purposes other than those they were entrusted to him for. It may well be that this fraudulent agent was enabled to carry out his fraud alike in obtaining possession of the goods and in misappropriating the monies entrusted to him to pay these duties by some remissness or negligence on the part of some of the Customs officers. It seemed to me not that these officers were partners in the frauds perpetrated by the company's agent but that they too were deceived by him. Be that as it may, I cannot see how the Crown can be held liable for the remissness or neglect of its officers, if any such there was.\nThe controlling fact is that the duties on these goods now sued for have not been paid to the Crown; but were misappropriated and embezzled by the Company's agent, who received them to pay the duties.\nUnder these circumstances, I hold that as between two innocent parties, the Company and the Crown, the former must suffer because the wrongful misappropriation was made by its agent.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent sued in the Exchequer Court and recovered judgment against appellant for alleged unpaid duties on goods imported into Canada between January, 1904, and November, 1905.\nThe parties in the course of the trial by their respective counsel signed the following admission:\u2014\nThe parties admit for the purposes of this case only under reserve of all objections as to the relevancy of the facts submitted, that the defendant issued to its agent Hobbs, cheques payable to the order of the Collector of Customs sufficient to cover all the duties payable by the defendant during the period covered by this action, except as to the amounts which have been paid to plaintiff or into court by the defendant herein. These cheques were deposited to the credit of the Receiver-General and used in the Bank of Montreal with monies received for customs duties to buy drafts for the Receiver-General representing the amounts of customs duties actually received from day to day from all sources according to the entries made at the Montreal Customs House, but certain of the entries made by, or on behalf of defendant at Customs during said period, as a result of manipulation and alteration of documents such as disclosed by the evidence of record, represented the amounts payable for customs duties by defendant during said period to be less in the aggregate than the total amount of said cheques or of said duties actually payable.\nThe further testimony which might be adduced before the referee, if proceeded with, would be similar in character to that which has already been given as to the way in which the entries, cheques and funds and the clearance of the goods were dealt with, prepared, appropriated or affected.\nOttawa, 19th December, 1912.\nThe man Hobbs therein referred to was a customs broker at Montreal to whom the appellant, pursuant to the requirements of section 157 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 32, had given the necessary written authority in the following terms:\u2014\nDominion of Canada.\nAppointment of an Attorney or Agent.\nKnow All Men By These Presents That\nWe have appointed and do hereby appoint David Hobbs, of Montreal, to be our true and lawful attorney and agent for us and in our name, to transact all business which we may have with the Collector of the Port of Montreal or relating to the Department of Customs of the said Port, and to execute, sign, seal and deliver for us and in our name, all bonds., entries and other instruments in writing relating to any such business as aforesaid, hereby ratifying and confirming all that our said attorney and agent shall do in the behalf aforesaid.\nIn witness whereof we have signed these presents and sealed and delivered the same Act and Deed at Montreal in the said Dominion, this eighth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and three.\nSigned and sealed in the presence of\nJ. W. Nicoll.\nB. Barber. John Corbett (Seal).\nForeign Freight Agent for\nCanadian Pacific Railway.\nThe course of business adopted by the appellant for the purpose of passing its importation of goods through the Montreal Customs was of that methodical and rigourous business character which left no loose ends or possible opening for perpetration of the frauds now in question by Hobbs by the means he adopted unless by the connivance of someone in respondent's employment at the Customs House, or such employee being so ignorant and incompetent that he applied appellant's cheques clearly intended to pay the duties claimed in ways quite unjustifiable.\nEach cheque issued by the appellant to the respondent's Collector of Customs to pay duties had thereon when given Hobbs not only the usual numbering of cheques, but a special number thereon by which it was possible to trace the parcel or shipment and invoice referred to in the way that has been done compelling the admission above quoted that in fact the duties thereon had been paid\u2014not to Hobbs, but to the respondent's collector.\nThis is an action to enforce the payment of same duties a second time.\nThe method adopted by Hobbs was to induce the Customs House clerk to take the cheques issued by appellant to the order of the Customs Collector and safeguarded from any such misapplication in every way that long experience had dictated as possible, and to apply them in payment of duties owing by third parties and thereby enable Hobbs to use the moneys or proceeds of cheques given to him by such third parties; or applying part of a cheque to pay appellant's customs duties and handing over balance of the amount of the cheque to Hobbs under the pretence that he was only making change. These third parties probably had not taken the same care as appellant to guard against possible fraud on his part.\nThe observance of common honesty or the slightest business intelligence, or both, on the part of him receiving on respondent's behalf the appellant's cheques, would have frustrated any such practices as these adopted. Indeed the collector had laid down a rule for this man's guidance forbidding the making of change beyond a few cents in any case, yet he repeatedly violated it, and thereby helped the man Hobbs to misappropriate in part as well as misapply entirely such cheques. How could any one imagine that the appellant who had taken such care to reduce Hobbs, so far as his cheques were concerned, to nothing but an errand boy, had become seized with such repeated and unprecedented fits of generosity?\nHow could any one for months and months handle such cheques and having thus an opportunity of comparing appellant's rigorous and guarded business methods with possibly loose methods of others, fail to inquire why it had thus strangely departed from its usual businesslike methods?\nSince when had it dawned upon any one that appellant had suddenly become a distributor of promiscuous charity or bounties for no consideration, and no apparent cause?\nWhether the man employed by respondent, and who overlooked all such curious features presented to him from day to day; was an accomplice of Hobbs, or was merely a misplaced incompetent when trusted by respondent with the duty to avert such possible thefts, does not seem to me to matter.\nThe argument that would relieve the respondent from all responsibility for the consequences of mere stupidity of such a servant in a position of trust needing intelligence to discharge it, would equally relieve respondent in case that servant appointed to receive, and receiving, the cheques was a criminal accomplice of Hobbs.\nI fail to see how any legal distinction can be drawn between these two possible ways of viewing this claim so far as dependent upon palpable misappropriation of appellant's cheques in the way I have referred to. And I submit that the proposition that a debtor of the Crown can, after handing the servant thereof, duly appointed to receive it, a cheque to discharge the debt, be sued for such debt because that servant and someone else stole the cheque, or misappropriated the proceeds, after it was handed in, is untenable.\nYet that seems less flagrant in substance than what is claimed by respondent. For what it claims from appellant was in truth paid by appellant, and all it had to do with the theft was that its cheques, which could not be readily converted, were misplaced in the accounts of an untrustworthy servant of respondent, and put to the credit of someone else.\nIt is said that misplacing was on the suggestion of Hobbs who had acted as I suggest as errand boy to deliver them. It is said that making entries was part of his duties and that in some cases he made false entries. But how did that justify the respondent's servant in misappropriating the appellant's cheques? As appellant well knew, and he was entitled to have the rule observed, if its cheque did not fit the entry it should be returned and no risk was run. The cheques were made to the order of the collector, and appellant left no excuse for any one doing anything with them except to apply them in payment for duties payable by appellant not by someone else, or if in any case an error to return the cheque evidently issued in error.\nI fail to understand how that sort of wrongdoing on the part of the customs clerk can fall within the ambit of the ostensible authority given the customs broker as such, or as presented in the power of attorney above quoted.\nThe section 157 requiring that power of attorney is followed by section 158 which defined in more specific language than section 157, what things the agent so appointed is expected to be able to do in relation to business with respondent, and is as follows:\u2014\n158. Any attorney and agent duly thereunto authorized by a written instrument, which he shall deliver to and leave with the Collector, may, in his said quality, validly make an entry, or execute any bond or other instrument required by this Act, and shall thereby bind his principal as effectually as if such principal had himself made such entry or executed such bond or other instrument, and may take the oath hereby required of a consignee or agent if he is cognizant of the facts therein averred; and any instrument appointing such attorney and agent shall be valid if it is in the form prescribed by the Minister of Customs.\nHow can these things which a broker is expected to be able to do extend to the misapplication of a cheque given for some such purpose limited on its face, to him who chooses to read it inquiringly and understand its contents, to one thing which the appellant was concerned in, and not a multitude of other things which other parties were concerned in.\nI cannot find in the cases, as I read them, cited by respondent's counsel, anything to support such a contention as set up relative to this branch of the case.\nIndeed, the cases so cited in principle render respondent responsible for the misapplication made by its servants of the appellant's cheques entrusted to them for the purposes indicated and nothing else. Not only was appellant's delivery thereof to them within the range of their ostensible but also of their express authority. The authority to make an entry or execute a bond or other instrument required by the \"Customs Act,\" or to take an oath, did not justify anyone in respondent's service in supposing, if he ever did suppose, that the man carrying a cheque made to the order of respondent's collector, could properly hand it over to someone else to pay his customs duties, or cash it and pocket some of the proceeds. So far as the claim depends on any such like dealing, the appeal should be allowed.\nThe schedule \"\u00c1\" I imagine, falls entirely under this.\nThe broker, Hobbs, acting within his apparent authority, seems to have betrayed his trust in other ways.\nHe had occasion to pass material which he represented was either non-dutiable when dutiable, or dutiable at a lower rate than it actually should have borne.\nIn misleading the Customs House officers in any such regard, he was thereby acting in such apparent discharge of his authority as to render appellant liable for his fraudulent conduct. If any goods thereby escaped payment of duty, the appellant is liable.\nWhether the total of these items exceed the amount paid into court, I cannot say.\nThe schedules \"B\" and \"C,\" I imagine, fall within this latter expression of opinion.\nThe appeal should be allowed accordingly. Even if the majority of the court should reach the same conclusion I doubt if it is a case for costs.\nThe agent of appellant seems to have acted improperly in many cases falling within the apparent scope of his authority in dealing with items in schedule \"A.\" Though I cannot find any justification in law for respondent seeking to recover what through its own servant was diverted to other uses than intended by appellant, I doubt if the latter's agent was not the original corrupter of the service. When apparently acting within the scope of his authority, he was playing false to both.\nDuff J.\u2014The decision in this case turns, in my judgment, upon the effect of the power of attorney which is in the following words:\u2014\nKnow All Men By These Presents, That,\nWe have appointed and do hereby appoint David Hobbs, of Montreal, to be our true and lawful attorney and agent for us, and in our name to transact all business which we may have with the Collector of the Port of Montreal, or relating to the Department of Customs of the said Port, and to execute, sign, seal and deliver for us in our name, all bonds, entries, and other instruments in writing relating to any such business as aforesaid, hereby ratifying and confirming all that our said attorney and agent shall do in our behalf aforesaid.\nand of the statute, secs. 157 & 158 Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886, ch. 32.\nSec. 157. Whenever any person makes an application to an officer of the Customs to transact any business on behalf of any other person, such officer may require the person so applying to produce a written authority from the person on whose behalf the application is made, and in default of the production of such authority, may refuse to transact such business; and any act or thing done or performed by such agent, shall be binding upon the person by or on behalf of whom the same is done or performed, to all intents and purposes, as fully as if the act or thing done had been performed by the principal.\nSec. 158. Any attorney or agent duly thereunto authorized by a written instrument, which he shall deliver to and leave with the Collector, may, in his said quality, validly make any entry, or execute any bond or other instrument required by this Act, and shall thereby bind his principal as effectually as if such principal had himself made such entry or executed such bond or other instrument, and may take the oath hereby required of a consignee or agent if he is cognizant of the facts therein averred; and any instrument appointing such attorney and agent shall be valid if it is in the form prescribed by the Minister of Customs. The rule for construing powers of attorney is stated at p. 177 in Bryant v. La Banque du Peuple[2].\nNor was it disputed that powers of attorney were to be construed strictly\u2014that is to say, that where an act purporting to be done under a power of attorney is challenged as being in excess of the authority conferred by that power, it is necessary to shew that on a fair construction of the whole instrument the authority on question is to be found within the four corners of the instrument, either in express terms or by necessary implication. It was pointed out, indeed, that the decisions on which the learned counsel for the appellant mainly relied in support of these propositions were decisions of English judges, but it was not shewn that there is any difference in this respect between the law of Canada and the law of England. The provisions of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, and the Canadian authorities which were cited to their Lordships, appear to be in harmony with English law and English authorities,\nand at p. 180:\u2014\nThe law appears to their Lordships to be very well stated in the Court of Appeal of the State of New York, in President &c., of the Westfield Bank v. Cornen[3], cited by Andrews J. in his judgment in another case brought by the Quebec Bank against the company. The passage referred to is as follows:\u2014\nWhenever the very act of the agent is authorized by the terms of the power, that is, whenever by comparing the act done by the agent with the words of the power, the act is in itself warranted by the terms used, such act is binding on the constituent, as to all persons dealing in good faith with the agent; such persons are not bound to enquire into the facts aliunde. The apparent authority is the real authority.\nApplying this principle to the circumstances of the case before us it seems to follow that as regards the moneys paid by Meunier to Hobbs in cash as . balances of cheques delivered to him by Meunier after deducting the duties payable in respect of entries made by Hobbs on behalf of the appellant company Hobbs must be taken as between the appellant company and the Crown as having been acting within his authority. Adverting to the language of the power of attorney, it seems clear that prim\u00e2 facie \"all business which we may have with the collector of the Port of Montreal or relating to the Department of the Customs of the said Port,\" would embrace the \"business\" of receiving payment of such balances; and applying the words of the statute it seems equally clear that the acts of Hobbs in receiving such balances are such acts as by section 157 are declared to be\nbinding upon the person by or on behalf of whom the same\nare \"done or performed\" as fully as if they\nhad been done or performed by the principal.\nIn the situation as on the facts known to him it presented itself to Meunier, these balances were payable to the appellant company and the receipt of them, therefore, being part of the \"business\" which the appellant company had to transact with the Collector of the Port of Montreal or the Department of Customs was an act \"warranted by the terms used\" in the power of attorney and an act made binding upon the appellant company by section 157.\nA very different question, however, arises in relation to those moneys, residues of the appellant company's cheques, after deducting payment of the duties payable by the appellant company in respect of goods entered by Hobbs on behalf of the appellant company which by direction of Hobbs were applied by the Department itself in payment of duties payable in respect of goods entered by Hobbs on behalf of principals other than the appellant company. These acts of Hobbs cannot by any ingenuity be brought within the language of either the power of attorney or the statute. The entry of goods by Hobbs on behalf of other principals of his does not fall within the words of the power of attorney \"business which we may have with the Collector of the Port of Montreal or relating to the Department of Customs of the said Port,\" nor does the payment of duties payable in respect of such goods. Nor can the language of the statute be given the effect of making such acts binding on the appellant company as the acts of the appellant company for the short reason that they are not done \"by or on behalf of\" the appellant company.\nFor such acts Hobbs had neither actual authority nor ostensible authority. To make the doctrine of ostensible authority applicable \"the act done by the agent\" to quote from the judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Atkinson in Russo-Chinese Bank v. Li Yau Sam[4], at p. 184,\nand relied upon to bind the principal, must be an act of that particular class of acts which the agent is held out as having a general authority on behalf of his principal to do; and, of course, the party prejudiced must have believed in the existence of that general authority and been thereby misled.\nPaying duties on behalf of other principals payable in respect of goods entered on behalf of such principals did not belong to the particular class of acts which Hobbs was represented by the appellant company as having authority to do so.\nThe direction by which in any particular case Hobbs procured the appropriation of part of the proceeds of one of the appellant company's cheques in payment of duties payable in respect of an entry made by him on behalf of another principal may, no doubt, be conceived as in one aspect a receipt by Hobbs of moneys owing to the appellant company; but in fact the appropriation under Hobbs' direction was a single . indivisible act incapable of being divided into two distinct acts, a receipt by Hobbs on behalf of the appellant company and a wrongful misappropriation of moneys so received for the benefit of another principal. For the purpose of deciding the legal question upon which we have to pass this single indivisible act must be looked at as a concrete fact and when regarded in that way it is quite impossible to bring it within the category of \"business\" that the appellant company had with the Customs Department or within the category of acts \"done or performed\" either really or apparently \"on behalf of\" the appellant company.\nThese directions given by Hobbs to Meunier, to apply the residues of the company's cheques from time to time in payment of goods which he was entering on behalf of other customers, being directions not only beyond the scope of his actual authority but beyond the scope of his apparent authority, unless there was something in the conduct of the appellant company disentitling it to insist upon its strict rights, it follows either that up to the amount of monies so appropriated the duties sued for have been paid or that these monies are still in the hands of the Crown subject either to application by the Crown in payment of some obligation by the appellant company to the Crown or subject to the direction of the appellant company itself.\nI think there is nothing in the conduct of the appellant company to modify or affect its prim\u00e2 facie rights. It is perfectly true that the beginning of the train of events and incidents which led to the loss, if loss there is to be, was in certain acts of Hobbs, fraudulent as against his principals, but \"within the scope of his employment\" according to the accepted meaning of that perhaps not very happy phrase. But if there is to be loss it must result from the fact that the Crown cannot now recover from Hobbs' principals the duties which he professed to pay by appropriation of the appellant company's balances, and of these acts it cannot be affirmed that in relation to such loss they were fraus dans locum injuriae. Two subsequently operative causes\u2014first, the irregular conduct of Meunier, the Crown's own servant, secondly, the concurrence of Meunier with Hobbs in the final act which (and this is the decisive point) was an act beyond Hobbs' actual as well as his ostensible authority, as above pointed out, by which or in consequence of which the residues were appropriated in payment of duties owing by these other customers of Hobbs'\u2014 these were the effective causes of the loss, if such loss there is to be.\nWhether strictly in contemplation of law there has or has not been payment to the extent mentioned may be an arguable question, but it is, I think, immaterial. Assuming that, in point of law, the duties must be considered to be unpaid but that the Crown has in its hands moneys of the appellant company which the appellant company intended to be applied in payment of the duties, and which from a time anterior to the commencement of the action down to the present moment, the appellant company has been insisting ought to have been and ought to be applied in payment of them; it is abundantly evident that the Crown could not, while retaining such moneys, maintain an action for the payment of the duties\u2014for the short reason that the Crown declining to appropriate the moneys, the appellant company is entitled to direct the appropriation of them; and through the conduct of the appellant company, beginning with the sending of the cheques themselves, the Crown even before the commencement of the action had notice of the company's intention so to appropriate them.\nThe result is that, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed as regards the moneys wrongfully applied by Hobbs in the manner above indicated, and that there should be a reference to ascertain the amount.\nAnglin J.\u2014Upon the facts in evidence the only possible conclusion is that the defendant company has failed to discharge the burden placed upon it by the \"Customs Act\" (R.S.C., ch. 48, sec. 264), of proving that the customs duties claimed from it in this proceeding had already been paid to the Crown. It is admitted that delivery of the goods in respect of which those duties were payable was obtained for the defendant company through fraudulent devices practised by its customs broker without proper entries of them having been made. There was never an appropriation to these duties of any moneys in the hands of the Crown. No request or direction for such an appropriation was ever made or given to the officials of the Crown. Whatever other defence or ground of counterclaim (if any) the circumstances may present, they do not sustain the plea of payment of the duties in question.\nNor do I think that in respect of the moneys embezzled by its broker the defendant company could have successfully maintained a counterclaim against the Crown for moneys had and received to its use.\nCollusion between the fraudulent broker and the Customs House cashier who paid out to him, or by his direction appropriated to other purposes, portions of the proceeds of C.P.R. cheques issued to the order of the Collector of Customs and intended to be used for payment of customs duties on C.P.R. importations has not been found by the learned trial judge; and, highly suspicious as some of the circumstances undoubtedly are, I am not prepared to make such a finding I am not to be understood as implying that proof of such collusion would necessarily involve responsibility of the Crown.\nThat there was gross carelessness and neglect of duty on the part of the Customs House cashier, which made the success of the broker's fraudulent scheme possible, is abundantly apparent. But, apart from statutory provision therefor, the Crown is not answerable for the consequences of laches or negligence on the part of its servants.\nEx facie it was within the scope of the power of attorney given to its broker by the defendant company that he should receive for it from the Customs officials moneys in their hands paid by it in excess of the amount of duties payable on goods entered on its behalf. I find nothing in the evidence to warrant a finding that any restriction on the scope of this apparent authority was ever brought to the notice of the Customs officials. The circumstance that all moneys paid by the C.P.R. for customs duties were paid by certified cheques did not amount to such notice. Though each cheque was intended when issued to cover duties upon a particular invoice, the cheque itself was not so earmarked and there was nothing to bring notice of that fact to the customs officers. I would therefore not be prepared to hold that the receipt by its broker of moneys of the C.P.R. Company from time fro time in the hands of the Customs officials in excess of the amount of customs duties for which entries made on its behalf shewed the company to be liable was beyond the scope of his apparent authority. While the appropriation from time to time of a portion of these moneys in the hands of the Customs officers to payment of duties owing by another of the broker's clients would, at first blush, appear to have been clearly beyond the scope of his authority from the C.P.R. Company, such a transaction may be regarded as having taken place merely as a convenient method of avoiding a roundabout process whereby the broker would receive a sum of money by way of refund upon C.P.R. account and would thereupon immediately . hand over to the Customs cashier a like sum belonging to another client in payment of the duties of such other client\u2014the net result being the same. A similar observation may be made as to the payments by direction of the broker to Customs officers, presumably as gratuities, of small sums taken from C.P.R. moneys in the hands of the Customs cashier.\nThe hardship to which the success of the Crown's claim subjects the appellant company is apparent. But we cannot for that reason afford it relief to which we are not convinced that it is legally entitled.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an action for unpaid customs duty. Defendant (appellant) pleaded that it had paid the full amount of duty and was in fact in possession of cancelled cheques payable to the order of the Collector of Customs and of vouchers establishing such payment.\nIt appears that one David Hobbs was given by the C.P.R. Company a power of attorney reading thus:\u2014\nTo be our true and lawful attorney and agent for us and in our name to transact all business which we may have with the Collector of the Port of Montreal or relating to the Department of Customs of the said Port and to execute, sign, seal and deliver for and in our name all bonds, entries and other instruments in writing relating to any such business as aforesaid hereby ratifying and confirming all that our said attorney and agent shall do in the behalf aforesaid. Hobbs as such agent received and had charge of the invoices for all goods imported by the company and on his requisition cheques were issued to the order of the Collector of Customs for payment of duty. These cheques were made for fixed amounts corresponding to the invoices.\nBut instead of making his entries regularly with those invoices he concealed from the Customs authorities the quantities and values entered from day to day. He altered in some cases the documents on which the entries were to be made and his usual procedure was to prepare an entry for a definite number of cars and to attach to this entry an invoice which really covered a part only of the goods contained in the cars and in that way he succeeded in passing entries for much smaller sums than the quantity of goods required.\nFrom time to time he was presenting to one of the cashiers of the customs some of the cheques which he was getting from the company. Sometimes those cheques were covering a larger amount than the entry passed and he was on his request reimbursed the difference by the cashiers and he misappropriated then the amount of the cheques which had been entrusted to him. Those cheques after being received by the cashier and the change given as I have said were handed over to the Collector of Customs by whom they were entered in the usual way and deposited to the credit of the Receiver-General.\nThere is no evidence that the Customs cashier benefitted by those transactions and so far the only man who seems to have benefitted from those frauds is Hobbs, the agent of the company.\nIn some cases the surplus cheques were applied in payment of the duties due by other importers for whom Hobbs acted as customs agent.\nThose frauds having been discovered, Hobbs was arrested, convicted of forgery of invoices and sent to the penitentiary. But it remains to be decided whether this loss of money should be supported by the Crown or by the Company.\nThe Company, as I have said, relies on the cancellation of the cheques and on the receipts which they have in their possession to prove their payment. There is no formal evidence as to whether the receipts which they have in their possession have been duly given by the cashier. They are stamped receipts which could have been very easily forged and the circumstances of the case lead me to believe that Hobbs got a stamp made up which he used on the document which he handed back to the C.P.R. authorities to show that the duties had been properly paid.\nOn the other hand, the official documents on which the official receipt appears would have been kept in his hands and would not have been, of course, handed over to the C.P.R. authorities; because if they had been handed over the fraud would have been easily detected and put an end to.\nThe terms of the power of attorney are as broad as possible. They gave authority to Hobbs to transact all business which the company might have with the Collector of the Port of Montreal and it is wide enough to cover all transactions in connection with the entry and payment of duties. He had power to make payments. He must have had power to receive change when necessary, such power being necessarily implied.\nIt is a well settled principle that the principal is responsible for the fraud committed by his agent while acting in the ordinary course of his employment, whether the result is or is not for the benefit of the principal.\nIn Lloyd v. Grace[5], the House of Lords applied that principle.\nI will refer also to Story on Agency 9th. ed., who says, (p. 374)\nIn respect to the acts and declaration and representations of public agents, it would seem that the same rule does not prevail, which ordinarily governs in relation to mere private agents. As to the latter (as we have seen), the principals are in many cases bound, where they have not authorized the declarations and representations to be made. But, in cases of public agents, the Government, or other public authority, is not bound, unless it manifestly appears that the agent is acting within the scope of his authority, or he is held out as having authority to do the act * * * Indeed, this rule seems indispensable, in order to guard the public against losses and injuries arising from the fraud or mistake, or rashness and indiscretion of their agents.\nIn the circumstances of the case, it seems to me only fair that in a case of that kind the principals should be responsible for the misdeeds of their agents unless there is negligence on the part of the other party or unless the party has by words or conduct made a representation of facts either with a knowledge of its falsehood or with the intention that it should be acted upon. Those elements cannot be found here.\nIn these circumstances, I am of opinion that the company has failed to prove that it has paid the customs duties in question and the judgment which condemned it to pay them should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed on equal division.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, Mitchell, McDougall & Creelman.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davidson & Wainwright.\n[1] 14 Ex.

The respondents, both residing in Great Britain, were in the habit of speculating in lands in Canada, employing as their agent and attorney one Cassels, a solicitor practising at Edmonton. An agreement of sale was passed between the appellant and the respondents represented by Cassels for the purchase of certain lands situated in Alberta; and it was therein provided that, on payment of the price of sale, the appellants would transfer the lands to the respondents \"free and clear of all liens, charges, mortgages and encumbrances.\" The lands were not then owned by the appellants, but by other parties whom they represented, and who had acquired the property with the exception of \"all coal and minerals and the right to work same.\" The first instalment of the price of sale was paid at the signing of the agreement; but, when the second instalment became due, the respondents being then aware that the lands bought by them did not comprise the coal and minerals, brought an action against the appellants for the rescission of the contract of sale and for reimbursement of the payment made under it.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that if Cassels, professing to act on behalf of the respondents, assented to an agreement to purchase the lands in question minus the coal and minerals, he was acting beyond the scope of his agency.\nIt is no answer to the action to say that the appellants were prepared to carry out the terms of the written agreement by conveying to the respondents a valid title to the coal and minerals: the appellants having declared their refusal to be bound by the obligations by which ex hypothesi they were legally bound, the respondents were entitled to treat the contract as rescinded and withdraw from it.\nThe appellants having contracted in the agreement of sale without qualification as principals, it is not open to them, as between themselves and the respondents, to allege that the moneys paid under the contract were paid to them as agents only.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing the judgment of Hyndman J. at the trial [2] by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Wallbridge K.C. for the appellants.\nTilley K.C. and Woods K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the opinion upon which Mr. Justice Scott and Mr. Justice Stuart proceeded, that if Cassels professing to act on behalf of the respondents (plaintiffs) did enter into an agreement with the appellants (defendants) which both parties intended to be and which in fact was an agreement to purchase the land in question minus the minerals and subject to all the rights given by the lease executed by Brutinel in favour of the St. Albert Collieries Company, then Cassels in assenting to that agreement on behalf of the respondents was acting beyond the scope of his agency. There is no evidence in the record supporting the suggestion of a general agency for the purchase of land; and I cannot agree that there is any ground upon which the question of the scope of Cassels' agency could properly be made the subject of further investigation. The issue of authority or no authority in Cassels to enter into the agreement which the appellants sought to enforce by their counterclaim was not overlooked at the trial and it appears to have been quite understood that the power of attorney under which Cassels professed to act was obtainable in the Land Titles Office. No suggestion appears to have been made in the Appellate Division that further evidence should be considered bearing upon the scope of Cassels' authority. Had such a suggestion been made, the Appellate Division would probably have examined this document.\nThe doctrine of ostensible authority has no application here. There is no evidence that Cassels was held out as a person having a general authority and, of course, no evidence that those who acted on behalf of the appellants were misled by a belief in the existence of such general authority resulting from any such holding out. See Russo-Chinese. Bank v. Li Yau Sam[3].\nThe appeal must, however, be considered on the hypothesis that the contract between Cassels and the appellants was that which the respondents alleged it to have been, namely, a contract for the sale and purchase of the land in question subject only to such reservations as are expressed in the original grant from the Crown. On the assumption that this was the contract no question of Cassels' authority arises; but it follows that the appellants have undertaken an obligation which is the consideration for the payment of the purchase money to give to the respondents a good title to the land including the minerals. I am not now alluding to their obligation to \"make\" title\" in the sense of shewing their title which it has been held the purchaser may require the vendor to do before he can be called upon to pay any part of the purchase money. I am now speaking of the main obligation of the vendor, namely, the obligation to convey to the purchaser a good title to the subject matter of the contract.\nIt is abundantly evident that at the trial and in the Appellate Division there was no dispute that in October, 1914, when the question of the title to the minerals was first raised by Mr. Woods, the position was taken on behalf of the appellants that the contract with the respondents was that which they afterwards alleged it to be by the statement of defence, namely, a contract for the sale and purchase of the land minus the minerals. It was not then suggested that the vendors would or could procure a conveyance of the minerals to the purchasers. Their attitude was that this was no part of their contract and they required from the purchasers the fulfilment of the bargain as they alleged it to be by payment of the instalment of the purchase money then due according to the terms of the writing. I think the conduct of the vendors at this stage was such as to justify the purchasers in treating it as a repudiation of the principal obligation of the vendors arising ex facie from the terms of the written agreement; and that the respondents were consequently entitled to accept and act upon the repudiation by declaring the contract to be at an end and by taking the proceedings which they did take in the following month.\nIn these circumstances it is no answer to the action to say that the appellants if held to be bound by the terms of the written agreement are prepared to carry them out by conveying a good title to the minerals to the purchasers. The appellants having declared that they refused to be bound by the obligations by which ex hypothesi they were legally bound, the purchasers were on that refusal entitled to treat the contract as rescinded and withdraw from it. Frost v. Knight[4]; Hochster v. De La Tour[5]; Mersey Steel Co. v. Naylor[6]; Cornwall v. Henson[7]; Rhymney Railway v. Brecon & Merthyr Tydfil Junction Railway[8].\nThe point must be briefly noticed that the moneys already paid, having been paid to the appellants in their character of agents and having by them been paid over to their principals, cannot now be recovered back.\nAssuming, for the purpose of dealing with this argument only, that the relation between Barbey and Bureau on the one hand (the so called principals) and the appellants on the other was truly that of principal and agent, there is nothing to shew that Cassels, when he executed the agreement of purchase, was aware of the existence of this relation. On the contrary, the correspondence in evidence between Cassels and the respondents would indicate that Cassels believed the appellants to be the beneficial owners of the property. By the agreement itself, which is under seal, the appellants contract without qualification as principals for the sale of the land and covenant to convey it to the purchasers; in these circumstances it is not open to the vendors as between themselves and the purchasers to allege that the moneys paid under the contract were paid to them as agents only, in other words, that the moneys paid under the contract were paid not to the appellants but to Barbey and Bureau through the appellants as conduit pipe.\nI have fully considered the question whether in view of the alleged knowledge of Cassels touching the state of the title the appellants have any defence on equitable grounds in respect to the moneys already paid. I think there are no such grounds. The appellants being fully aware of the fact that Cassels was acting as agent, took no steps to inform themselves of the extent of his authority; and although they intended, as they alleged, to enter into a contract for the sale of a limited interest only in the lands in question, they executed an agreement which on the face of it was an agreement to convey a title to the fee simple to the purchasers; a document which they must have known would be sent forward by Cassels to his principals as containing the authentic record of the transaction into which he had entered on their behalf.\nThe difficulty in which the appellants find themselves must be ascribed to their own carelessness\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting) \u2014 This was originally an action by the respondents as purchasers on an agreement of sale to rescind the contract on the ground that the vendors, the appellants, were unable to carry out the sale and to give title.\nThe action was dismissed by the trial judge but the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court decided that there had been no contract and that the defendants-appellants should refund the sums paid on account on the purchase money. The main point at issue is whether the mines and minerals did form part of the sale of land stipulated in the agreement.\nThe circumstances of the case are as follows:\nThe plaintiffs-respondents reside in England and Scotland and had been for some time speculating in lands in Canada and mostly in Edmonton and its vicinity. They had as agent in the city of Edmonton Mr. R. W. Cassels, a solicitor of that locality, who was looking after those speculations and was keeping them posted as to the advisability of making some new deals.\nOn the 10th of October, 1912, the agent, Cassels, cabled his principals, the respondents in this case advising them to purchase a quarter section at $425.00 an acre. No description was given of the land, except that it was adjoining a railway; and he told them in the same cable that an immediate payment of $20,000 would be required, that the property was increasing in value rapidly and that they could sell all at a large profit very soon; telling them also that if they approved they could telegraph the money.\nGreig, one of the respondents, answered that he could purchase only 140 acres.\nBut Cassels advised them by cable to take the whole quarter; and the money was cabled.\nSo far, the respondents had no other information with regard to the land in question, except what was mentioned in the telegrams of Cassels.\nOn the 22nd October Cassels agreed to purchase the property for the respondents. The beneficial owners of the property were two Frenchmen by the name of Bureau and Barbey and a Belgian by the name of Kimpe. As those people were not in Canada they were being represented by the respondent company, the Franco-Canadian Mortgage Company.\nThe titles were passed to Cassels to be investigated and those titles shewed that the mines and minerals that could be found on the property had been leased or sold to a Montreal Mining Co. It did not prevent, however, Cassels to carry out the agreement and moreover it is in evidence that the situation of the property with regard to mines and minerals was discussed with Cassels and it was found by the trial judge that Cassels knew, at the time of the agreement, that the minerals were not handed by the vendors and that the plaintiffs-respondents were not purchasing the same.\nThe agreement of sale was prepared by Cassels himself. He knew that the vendors were not the owners of those mines and minerals, that they had been leased or sold to a mining company and besides it is evident that he had in view in this contract purely and simply the purchase of the land for subdivision purposes, because in a letter which he wrote to his principals on the 22nd of October, 1912, the same day that the agreement was signed by him as agent of the purchasers, he declared that at some future date the deal will be a proposition for subdivision. He speaks also of the title and he says that the title is in perfectly good order. He tells his principals also that he got a commission of $2,000.00 on that sale from the real estate agent who carried it through and that the taking of such a commission will give him the advantage of not charging the purchasers with any proportion of their profits when they come to resell the property.\nMr. Thirlaway, one of the respondents with whom he was communicating at the time, said that the charge was very reasonable.\nEverything seemed to be satisfactory. The first payment was made evidently after the title had been investigated by Cassels.\nIn 1913 those principals seem to be dissatisfied with Cassels and instead of sending him direct the money for the second payment they sent it to Mr. Woods, a solicitor of the city of Edmonton. The reasons why they were dissatisfied with Mr. Cassels are not in evidence but it must be with reference to some money matter and were likely referring to some other transaction, since in the agreement of sale in question in this case there was no money matter which could arise between Cassels and the respondents.\nMr. Woods investigated the matter and it was found by the trial judge, a finding which was not disturbed by the Court of Appeal, that he examined and perused the document of title before paying over the 1913 instalment and must have been aware of the state of the title at that time and must have been satisfied with' the position of things. The payment then due in October, 1913, as I said, was made by Mr. Woods after making all the inquiries and examining the titles.\nAnother instalment became due in October, 1914.\nThe war had then been going on for some months: the money market was in a very bad condition and then the purchasers, for the first time, thought of repudiating the contract because the mines and minerals could not be handed over to them.\nI am quite convinced, after reading the whole evidence, that this question of mines never entered into their minds. They never purchased the property on account of those minerals; they were simply buying the property for subdivision purposes and land speculation. Besides, we do not know whether those mines and minerals could then have been exploited. The sum which was to be paid each year during the existence of the lease was $160 and was naturally a very small sum compared with the $68,000, which was the purchase price of the property agreed upon by the respondents.\nThe respondents had given to Cassels authority to look after their land speculations in Edmonton; they are bound as regards third persons by every act done by their agent, which is necessary for the proper execution of that authority. They never contemplated the minerals in connection with those speculations, but whether or not the lands could be easily disposed of on the land market at a good profit. They were relying on the honesty of their agent as to the price at which those lands could be purchased or sold. The act done by Cassels with regard to the minerals was incidental to the ordinary scope of the business entrusted to him. Halsbury, vo. Agency, p. 201. It seems to me that the respondents are not exempt from liability in the circumstances of the case.\nThe knowledge that their agent received as to the minerals was their knowledge. Cassels was standing in their own name and the information conveyed to him was also binding upon them. If Cassels had been a purchaser for himself he could not complain about those minerals not being conveyed to him. The respondents are in the same position as Cassels himself. They cannot repudiate the agreement.\nThe trial judge granted the prayer of the appellant vendors to the effect that the agreement of sale should be amended in such a way that the mines and minerals would be excluded. I think this amendment is in conformity with the agreement made by the parties, accepted by the respondents' agent. I am, on the whole, of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed, that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs of this court and of the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 10 Alta.

Collings (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe City of Calgary (Defendant) Respondent\n1917: February 16, 19.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Taxes\u2014Payment\u2014Cheque\u2014Bill of exchange. On a demand for taxes, the following words appear: \"All cheques in payment of taxes must be made payable to the City of Calgary and accepted by bank.\" The appellant delivered to the tax collector of the city respondent an instrument purporting to be an accepted cheque on the Dominion Trust Company in payment of taxes due upon lands belonging to him. Before the presentation of the cheque for payment, the Dominion Trust Company ceased to do business.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta that the appellant's taxes had not been paid was unanimously affirmed.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The tax collector had no authority to receive in payment of taxes an accepted bill of exchange, and the order on the Dominion Trust Company was not an accepted cheque on a bank.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014The tax collector was not authorized to receive payment of taxes otherwise than by legal tender.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, [1]reversing the judgment of Simmons J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nAlex. Hannah, for the appellant, argued that the City of Calgary had confirmed the acts of its collector and that there was no provision in the respondent's charter forbidding it to accept cheques. G. J. Ford, for the respondent, submitted that taxes are payable in lawful money only; and that the instrument given in the present case was not even a cheque accepted by a bank, as the Dominion Trust Company was expressly forbidden by sec. 12, ch. 89, Statutes of Canada, 1912, from engaging in the business of banking.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Appeal dismissed with costs\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I do not find it necessary to pronounce any opinion upon the legal power of the municipality to authorize the treasurer to receive payment of taxes otherwise than in legal tender or bank notes. It is very clear that he had in fact no authority to receive in payment an accepted bill of exchange which was not a cheque on a bank. The order on the Dominion Trust Company was certainly not a cheque either in contemplation of law or according to the common understanding.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am unable to find that the appellant Collings has duly paid his taxes.\nThe tax collector had some duties to perform and those duties are defined by the statute and he was not authorized to receive payment of those taxes in other than legal tender. If the notice which had been given to the tax-payer that a cheque in payment of taxes could be made, provided accepted by a bank, is legal and proper, I should say that in this case a duly accepted cheque was not presented for payment. It was not accepted by a bank; and if, in order to oblige Collings, the collector has thought advisable to take the document which was presented to him, there is no reason why the city should suffer for the illegal and unauthorized action of its officer.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 10 Alta.

[1906] c. 120, s. 6. Section 6 of the \"Interest Act\" (R.S.C. [1906] ch. 120) provides that \"whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage on real estate is, by the same made on the sinking fund plan, or any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended * * * no interest whatever shall be * * * recoverable * * * unless the mortgage contains a statement showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance.\"\nHeld, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, that the provisions of this section are complied with if the facts stated in the mortgage shew the amount of the principal and the rate of interest calculated as required; a special statement, complete in itself, of such amount and rate is not essential.\nTherefore, where the mortgagor covenants to pay the principal and interest in ten half-yearly payments, and to pay interest on the principal, or so much thereof as remains due, at the rate of ten per cent. per annum and the same rate on any sum in arrear, the mortgagee is entitled to the interest.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, 33 D.L.R. 792, ([1917] 2 W.W.R. 18), affirming that at the trial (32 D.L.R. 54, 10 West. W.R. 959), reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming by an equal division of opinion, the judgment at the trial[2], in favor of the defendant. Sections 6 and 7 of the \"Interest Act\" (R.S.C. [1906] ch. 120) provide that:\u2014\n6. Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or Recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement shewing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance. R.S., ch. 127, sec. 3.\n7. Whenever the rate of interest shown in such statement is less than the rate of interest which would be chargeable by virtue of any other provision, calculation or stipulation in the mortgage, no greater rate of interest shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on the principal money advanced, than the rate shewn in such statement. R.S., ch. 127, sec. 4.\nThe mortgage in question in this case contains the following covenant by the mortgagor.\n\"First: That he will pay to them, the said mortgagees, the above sum of one thousand four hundred dollars and interest thereon at the rate hereinafter specified in gold or its equivalent at the office of the said mortgagees at the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, as follows: That is to say, in instalments of one hundred and seventy-nine 90\/100 dollars half-yearly on the 24th days of June and December in each year until the whole of said principal sum and the interest thereon is fully paid and satisfied, making in all ten half-yearly instalments. The first of said instalments to become due and be payable on the 24th of December, 1907. All arrears of both principal and interest to bear interest at ten per centum per annum as hereinafter provided.\n\"Secondly: That he will pay interest on the said sum or so much thereof as remains unpaid at the rate of ten per centum per annum by half-yearly payments on the twenty-fourth days of December and June in each and every year until the whole of the principal money and interest is paid and satisfied, and that after maturity interest shall accrue due at the rate aforesaid from day to day, and that interest in arrear, whether on principal or interest, and all sums of money paid by the mortgagees under any provision herein contained or implied or otherwise, shall be added to the principal money and shall bear interest at the rate aforesaid, and shall be compounded half-yearly, a rest being made on the twenty-fourth days of the months of December and June in each year until all such arrears of principal and interest are paid; and that he will pay the same and every part thereof on demand.\"\nThe only question for decision was whether or not this covenant contained the statement required by section 6. The trial judge held not and there being an equal division of opinion in the Appellate Division his judgment stood affirmed.\nNesbitt K.C. and Ford K.C. for the appellants, referred to Credit Co. v. Pott[3], at page 299; Canadian Mortgage Investment Co. v. Baird[4]; Colonial Investment Co. v. Borland[5], at pages 97-8; Biggs v. Freehold Loan Co.[6].\nG. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal was argued at the same time as the appeal from the Appeal Court of the Province of Manitoba of Standard Reliance Mortgage Corporation v. Stubbs. The question for determination in each case turns upon the construction to be put upon the \"Interest Act\" (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 120). Some minor objections to the judgment under appeal were taken by the appellant in its factum, but not pressed at the argument.\nIn the Manitoba case the defendant pleaded that under the provisions of section six of the \"Interest Act,\" no interest was recoverable under the mortgage given by him and judgment was given in his favour on this issue. In the present case this defence was not pleaded at all, but at the conclusion of the trial leave was given to amend by pleading the statute. If the statement of defence was ever amended, it does not so appear on the record. I am disposed to think that leave ought not to have been given to make such an amendment, but it is unnecessary to decide this point in view of the conclusion which I have reached that in this as in the Manitoba case the requirements of section six of the statute have been sufficiently complied with.\nI have in the Manitoba case sufficiently set forth my views of what, generally speaking, are the requirements of the statute and it is unnecessary to repeat them here. As I pointed out, however, it must depend upon the terms of the mortgage in each case whether or not it fulfils the conditions imposed by the statute.\nThe mortgage deed to be construed in the Manitoba case contains the provision:\u2014\n\"It is further agreed between me and the said mortgagees that the principal of $700 and the rate of interest chargeable thereon is 10% per annum.\" In the mortgage given by the respondent to the appellant, the information required to be given has to be sought first in a statement appearing on the face of the deed that the principal sum lent is $1,400, and, secondly, in the covenants of the respondent to pay the said sum of $1,400 and interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum in half-yearly instalments of $179.90 on the days therein mentioned. This in my opinion sufficiently affords the information called for by section six. In this, as in the Manitoba mortgage, it clearly appears in the deed what is the amount of the principal money advanced and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated as provided by section six.\nThe appeal will be allowed and the judgment varied by allowing the appellant interest upon the mortgage. The appellant having substantially succeeded in its claim is entitled to the costs of the action and the appeal. The respondent will have the costs of the counterclaim.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting)\u2014The substantial question arising on this appeal is as to the proper construction of sections 6 and 7 of the \" Interest Act,\" relating to mortgages of real estate in cases where the principal and interest\nare made payable on the sinking fund plan or any plan in which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, etc.\nThese sections read as follows:\u2014\nSection 6.\u2014Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage or real estate is, by the same, made on the sinking fund plan, or any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement shewing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nSection 7.\u2014Whenever the rate of interest shewn in such statement is less than the rate of interest which whould be chargeable by virtue of any other provision calculation or stipulation in the mortgage, no greater rate of interest shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on the principal money advanced, than the rate shewn in such statement\nThe sections are carelessly drawn, and the language used somewhat ambiguous. It is not to be wondered at therefore that there has been much difference of judicial opinion as to their meaning.\nI frankly confess myself I entertained much doubt as to their meaning alike during the argument and subsequently when discussing the sections with my colleagues.\nI have, however, reached the conclusion, after consideration, that the majority judgment of the court of Alberta in this case and the unanimous judgment of the Appeal Court of Manitoba in the appeal case of the Standard Reliance Mortgage Company against Stubbs, the arguments in which appeals were heard by us together, were correct and that both appeals should be dismissed.\nIn the case of the Canadian Mortgage Investment Company, I concur in the reasoning of Mr. Justice Ives with whom Stuart J. concurred, confirming that of Chief Justice Harvey, the trial judge.\nIt seems to me that any other conclusion than that reached by them would render the sections valueless as a protection to the borrower, and defeat their clear object, intent and purpose.\nI construe the sixth section as requiring in mortgages on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended that the \"statement\" called for by the section should shew plainly and separately the amounts of the principal and the interest respectively contained in each blended stipulated payment with the rate at which the interest has been calculated and; as the section says,\ncalculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nNow, it is absurd, to my mind, to talk about the rate of interest being \" calculated yearly or half-yearly.\" What it must mean is that the statement must shew the interest calculated yearly or half-yearly but \"not in advance\" in each blended payment, and the rate of interest, so that the mortgagor might test its correctness.\nI cannot accept the argument that section six requiring the \"statement\" referred to is complied with if the facts required to be shewn in it can be gathered from different parts of the mortgage. It must be, in my judgment, complete in itself\u2014and one shewing the essential facts, principal, interest and rate of interest on each blended payment.\nSection seven refers specifically to the \"statement\" required by section six in the absence of which\nno interest whatever shall be chargeable.\nIt contemplates that there may be a difference between the rate of interest shewn in the statement and the rate stipulated for in\nany other provision, calculation or stipulation in the mortgage,\nand provides that in such case there shall not necessarily be a forfeiture of all interest but that no greater rate than that shewn in the \"statement\" required by the sixth section shall be recoverable.\nThe two sections, when read together, confirm me in the opinion that the mortgagor was not to be left to infer or gather from the \"other provisions, calculations or stipulations\" of the mortgage how the blended payments he was called upon to make were made up and how much was principal, how much interest and at what rate the latter was calculated, but, that the statement required by section six should furnish him with all that information, and that in the absence of any such statement no interest could be recovered and that no other provision in the mortgage however express it might be could make him liable for a higher rate of interest than the statement shewed.\nPutting the best construction I can upon the admittedly ambiguous language used in the section, I can reach no other conclusion than the one I have attempted to express, that the \"statement\" required by the sixth section is one shewing separately in each blended stipulated payment how much of principal and how much of interest the blended payment comprised, and the rate of interest at which the calculation was made,\nyearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nOtherwise, in my judgment, the whole object, intent and purpose of the sections are defeated.\nWe are not to speculate, of course, as to what were the objects, intents and purposes of the enactment but to construe its language. When that language is ambiguous and the object, intent and purpose of the enactment are plain, as I think they are in the sections under consideration, we are justified in putting such a construction upon the ambiguous language as will give effect to and not defeat such object and purpose. I have endeavoured to do so in this case without doing violence to the language of the Act.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting) \u2014 Contrary to my first impression, I have reached the conclusion that the \"Interest Act\" required something more than is to be found in the covenants and other provisions in the mortgage in question, which clearly falls within section 6 of said Act, and in default thereof appellant cannot recover interest.\nI suspect there never was a mortgage but contained statements of fact which, when coupled with the other fact, inevitably well known to the mortgagor, of the amount advanced, would enable him by what are called, perhaps ironically, simple questions of computation to ascertain\nthe rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nThe legislation in question seems to have been designed for the protection of those who perchance by improvidence or want of knowledge of those simple methods of calculation were incapable of determining offhand the meaning of the facts presented to them in such an instrument as this in the way of covenants or other provisions and thus needed to have resort to a simple statement of fact declaring\nthe amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance.\nIt was clearly intended that the borrower need not concern himself further with regard to the rate of interest and that if there were no such simple method provided, no interest could be recovered.\nAnd if there were other stipulations in the mortgage in conflict therewith then that no greater rate of interest should be recoverable than shewn in such statement is provided by section 7.\nThe object of Parliament plainly was to remedy an abuse that had existed and could be successfully continued if resort had to be had to complicated calculations to determine the basic facts of what was implied in the blended periodical instalments of principal and interest.\nAs I agree in the reasoning of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Ives in the Court of Appeal, I need not elaborate.\nI do not think we should interfere with the questions of costs or damages as disposed of in said court.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal and that of Standard Reliance Co. v. Stubbs were heard together and the disposition of them must, in the main, be governed by the same considerations. Before proceeding to discuss the statute upon which the respondents rely in both cases I cite some words of Lord Haldane in Vacher & Sons v. London Society of Compositors.[7], at page 113:\u2014\nMy Lords, we have heard, in the course of this case, suggestions as to the merits of the conflicting points of view and as to the reasonableness, in interpreting the language of Parliament in the \"Trades Disputes Act\" of 1906, of presuming that the Legislature was acting with one or other of these points of view in its mind. For my own part, I do not propose to speculate on what the motive of Parliament was. The topic is one on which judges cannot profitably or properly enter. Their province is the very different one of construing the language in which the Legislature has finally expressed its conclusions, and if they undertake the other province which belongs to those who, in making the laws have to endeavour to interpret the desire of the country, they are in danger of going astray in a labyrinth to the character of which they have no sufficient guide. In endeavouring to place the proper interpretation on the sections of the statute before this House sitting in its judicial capacity, I propose, therefore, to exclude consideration of everything excepting the state of the law as it was when the statute was passed, and the light to be got by reading it as a whole, before attempting to construe any particular section. Subject to this consideration, I think that the only safe course is to read the language of the statute in what seems to be its natural sense.\nIt is in the spirit of these observations that the provisions of the \"Interest Act,\" which have been the subject of the discussion on the appeals, must be examined.'\nThese provisions are as follows:\u2014\nSec. 6. Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payment of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever, shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement shewing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance: R.S., ch., 127, sec. 3.\nSec. 7.\u2014Whenever the rate of interest shewn in such a statement is less than the rate of interest which would be chargeable by virtue of any other provision, calculation or stipulation in the mortgage, no greater rate of interest shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on the principal money advanced, than the rate shewn in such statement: U.S., ch., 127, sec. 4.\nI can discover no ground for ascribing to the word \"statement,\" in these sections, any unusual meaning. If the facts which the statute requires to be shewn are stated, then I think the requirement of section 6 is complied with.\nI find no difficulty in applying the word; of section 6 according to their natural meaning, to the mortgages before us.\nFirst, as to the respondent Cameron's mortgage. The two important paragraphs are these:\u2014\nFirst: That he will pay to them, the said mortgagees, the above sum of one thousand four hundred dollars and interest thereon at the rate hereinafter specified in gold or its equivalent at the office of the said mortgagees at the city of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, as follows: That is to say, in instalments of one hundred and seventy-nine 90-100 dollars half-yearly on the twenty-fourth days of June and December in each year until the whole of the said principal sum and interest thereon is fully paid and satisfied, making in all ten half-yearly instalments. The first of said instalments to become due and be payable on the 24th of December, 1907. All arrears of both principal and interest to bear interest at ten per centum per annum as hereinafter provided.\nSecondly: That he will pay interest on the said sum or so much thereof as remains unpaid at the rate of ten per centum per annum by half-yearly payments on the twenty-fourth days of December and June in each and every year until the whole of the principal money and interest is paid and satisfied, and that after maturity interest shall accrue due at the rate aforesaid from day to day, and that interest in arrear, whether on principal or interest, and all sums of money paid by the mortgagees under any provision herein contained or implied or otherwise, shall be added to the principal money and shall bear interest at the rate aforesaid, and shall be compounded half-yearly, a rest being made on the twenty-fourth days of the months of December and June in each year until all such arrears of principal and interest are paid; and that he will pay the same and every part thereof on demand.\nNow these two paragraphs state with perfect clearness that each of the stipulated half-yearly instalments contains a sum charged for interest at the rate of 10% payable half-yearly and that interest, at this rate, is chargeable under the mortgage and payable at such intervals. That, I think, is a sufficient compliance with the statute.\nAs to the respondent Stubbs' case, the stipulation to be considered is as follows:\u2014\nIn consideration of the sum of seven hundred dollars lent to me by The Sun and Hastings Savings and Loan Company of Ontario (who and whose successors and assigns are hereinafter included in the expression mortgagees), the receipt of which I do hereby acknowledge, covenant with the mortgagees that I will pay to the said mortgagees the above sum of seven hundred dollars in gold or its equivalent, together with interest thereon as hereinafter provided, at the offices of the said mortgagees in the city of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, or in the city of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, said principal and interest being payable as follows: The sum of eight dollars and seventy-five cents on the first Monday of each month for the period of one hundred and thirty-five months next ensuing, the first of such monthly instalments to become due and payable on the first Monday of January, A.D. 1903, together with all sums, penalties and forfeitures which may become due or payable to the mortgagees by me by virtue of the bylaws of the said mortgagees.\nTogether with the further covenant in the following words:\u2014\nAnd it is further agreed between me and the said mortgagees that the principal is seven hundred dollars and the rate of interest chargeable thereon is ten per cent. per annum as well after as before default. These two stipulations contain an explicit statement of the rate of interest chargeable; the rate is declared to be 10% and I think it is stated with sufficient clearness that is it to be payable annually.\nANGLIN J.\u2014What I have stated in Standard Reliance Mortgage Company v. Stubbs disposes of the main question on this appeal\u2014that as to the mortgagee's right to recover interest. The mortgage states that the sum advanced is $1,400 and by the second covenant the mortgagor agrees to pay thereon or on so much thereof as remains unpaid, interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum by half-yearly payments. This I regard as a statement meeting the requirements of section 6 of the \" Interest Act.\"\nExcept an item of $200 allowed for damages for refusal to discharge the mortgage, several grounds of appeal taken by the appellant involving comparatively small amounts were not pressed by Mr. Nesbitt. In view of the disposition in its favour of the question as to its right to recover interest the \"appellant is also obviously entitled to relief as to the $200 item.\nThe appellant is entitled to recover from the respondent its costs in all the courts.\nJudgment should be entered in the usual form for the taking of the mortgage accounts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 33 D.L.R. 792; [1917] 2 W.W.R. 18.\n[2] 32 D.L.R. 54; 10 West.

School Commissioners of Three Rivers (23 Can. S.C.R., 723), followed.\n(Idington and Duff JJ. contra).\nMotion to quash for want of jurisdiction an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Three Rivers, maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe facts on which the questions of law for decision depend are sufficiently 'Stated in the judgments now reported. Belcourt K.C. for the motion, on behalf of the respondents.\nJ. J. Denis K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction. The facts are not in dispute. An action was brought by the present respondents, collectors of revenue for the Province of Quebec, to recover from the the defendants, Dame Louise Olivier and Dame Alice Mailhot, in their quality of universal legatees to the succession of Judge Mailhot, a tax imposed by the Province of Quebec of 2 per cent, upon the estate. There is no dispute that the amount of the tax due to the plaintiffs was $1,808.46. The husband of the defendant, Dame Alice Mailhot, in response to plaintiff's demand, paid one-half of the tax; the defendant, Louise Olivier, widow of the testator, contested the plaintiff's claim to recover any portion of the tax from her, on the ground that the declaration which is required to be made under article 1380 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec by one of the universal legatees, had been made by her co-defendant, Dame Alice Mailhot, and that, under the law, it is the person who makes the declaration alone who is bound to pay all the taxes due from the succession. The amount claimed in the present action is $904.23, and the respondents now claim that the case is not appealable as it does not fall within section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nIn short, the point in dispute between the parties may he stated as fallows; the appellants contend on the one hand that, if the matter in controversy relates to revenue or sum of money payable to His Majesty, the court has jurisdiction. The respondents say \"no,\" the matter in controversy must not only relate to revenue or a sum of money payable to His Majesty, but must be a matter in which rights in future must be bound. In other words they contend that the words \"rights in future might be bound\" in this section apply to each of the items, fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, etc.\nIn my opinion, the case is clearly governed by authority. In 1886, the Supreme Court gave judgment in the case of the Bank of Toronto v. he Cur\u00e9, etc. de la Nativit\u00e9[2]. At that time the provisions of the present section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" were contained in section 8 of 42 Vict. ch. 39, which reads as follows:\u2014\nNo appeal shall be allowed from any judgment rendered in the Province of Quebec in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, wherein the matter in controversy does not amount to the sum or value of two thousand dollars, unless such matter, if less than that amount, involves the question of the validity of an Act of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislature of any of the provinces of Canada, or of an Ordinance or Act of any of the councils or legislative bodies of any of the territories or districts of Canada, or relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nIn that case Mr. Justice Taschereau analyses this section and makes use of the following language:\u2014\nFrom the Province of Quebec four classes of cases are only appealable under 42 Vict. ch. 39, sec. 8: 1st, any case wherein the matter in controversy amounts to the sum or value of $2,000; 2ndly, any case wherein the matter in controversy involves the question of the validity of an Act of Parliament, or of any of the local legislatures; 3rdly, any case wherein the matter in controversy relates to any fee or office or any duty or rent or revenue payable to Her Majesty, where the rights in future might be bound. These last words must be read as qualifying all this third class as well as the next. If, for instance, a fee of office is claimed, but the right to it is denied by the defendant, the case is appealable, but if in an action for a fee of office, the defendant pleads payment, the case is not appealable if under $2,000; 4thly, any case wherein the matter in controversy relates to any title to lands or tenements, or title to annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nThe statutes were revised in 1886 and section 8 became section 29, R.S.C. ch. 135. The only alteration made in the old section being that the letters (a) and (b) are made use of to subdivide the two paragraphs which defined the class of cases in which an appeal would lie. In the revision of 1906 the language of the statute of 1886 was verbally reproduced with the same subdivision except that the amendment which was made, in 1893, by 56 Vict. ch. 29 was inserted, viz., the words,\nsuch like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound\nwere made to read\nother matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nThe section was next considered, in 1889, in the case of Gilbert v. Gilman[3]. In that case the court was mainly concerned in construing the words \"such like matters or things where rights in future might be hound\" in connection with the doctrine of \"noscitur a sociis.\" In that case Strong J. says:\u2013\nNot only must future rights be bound by the judgment in order that an appeal may be admitted, when the amount in controversy is less than $2,000, but further the future rights to be so bound must relate to some or one of the matters or things specified in the subsection in question, viz., fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to some title to lands or tenemerits or to some like matters and things where the same consequence will follow, viz., when future rights will be bound.\nAlso in Chagnon v. Norman[4], Sir W. J. Ritchie, speaking for the court, says:\u2014\nNeither is the case appealable as relating to a fee of office where the rights in future might be bound.\nThe decision in Larivi\u00e8re v. School Commissioners of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res[5], is also instructive because it was decided on the statute after the amendment which substituted \"other matters or things, etc.,\" for \"such like matters or things, etc.\" This amendment was assented to by Parliament on 1st April, 1893, and I find on reference to the records in the Supreme Court office that the action was instituted on 8th April of the same year. In that case the judgment of the court concludes with the following language:\u2014\nThe words \"where rights in future might be bound\" in subsection (b), section 29, govern the preceding words, \"any fee of office, etc.\"\nIn these three cases the court in construing the words\nfee of office, duty, rent or revenue or sum of money payable to His Majesty, etc.,\nheld that they were governed by the concluding clause of the paragraph\nwhere the rights in future might be bound.\nIn view of this uniform jurisprudence of the Supreme Court extending over thirty years even if we were not satisfied with the construction which has been placed upon this section, I do not see that at this late date we are justified in overruling it. I have serious doubts whether in this ease there is a matter in controversy which relates to a sum of money payable to the Crown within the meaning of the statute, because all parties agree the tax to be paid on this estate is $1,808.46. It is only a question as to which of these two ladies shall pay the balance of $909.23, but in any event there is certainly no\nrevenue payable to His Majesty, where rights in future might be bound.\nI would grant the motion to quash with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014Whatever I might think the true construction to be of subsection (b) of section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" if I was called upon to determine it without binding authority\u2014I am of the opinion that such binding authority exists and that it is not now open to us to reverse it. The cases are collected in Mr. Cameron's book of Practice, at page's 211-12. These cases determine that the latter words of the subsection \"where rights in future may be bound\" apply as well to controversies\nrelating to any fee of office, duty, rent, ar any sum of money payable to His Majesty\nas to the words following \"any title to lands, etc.,\" in other words that they apply to and control the whole subsection.\nParliament has not seen fit since these decisions were given to change the subsection and I feel it is not open now for us to put a different construction upon it from that which in the cases I refer to has been placed upon it.\nUnder these circumstances, I would allow the motion to quash for want of jurisdiction. Costs should follow the result.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The amount in controversy does not entitle the appellant to seek relief here. But the official suing must certainly be held to rest his case upon a claim to revenue payable by appellant to His Majesty and therefore I think the application to quash should be refused with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in Quebec in which the appellant was adjudged liable to pay a certain sum of money as succession duty under the Quebec 'Statute, 4 Ceo. V. ch. 9. The respondent is the collector who sued on behalf of the Crown and the controversy relates to the question of the appellant's responsibility for the sum demanded which he has been adjudged liable to pay under the provisions of the statute. It seems to me to be very clear that the \"matter\" thus in \"controversy\"\nrelates to a duty * * * revenue or * * * sum of money payable to His Majesty\nand that the judgment is consequently appealable under section 46, subsection (6) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Mr. Belcourt argues, however, that the words\nany fee of office, rent, revenue, or any sum of money payable to His Majesty\nare governed by the phrase at the end of the clause\nwhere rights in future might be bound.\nThe contention, in my opinion, is quite without substance; and to make that clear it is only necessary to reproduce the subsection in full. These are the words:\u2014\nRelates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, or any sum of money payable to His Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where rights in future might be bound.\nThe meaning of these words according to the grammatical construction is unmistakable. The disjunctive \"or\" separates the whole of what follows from all of the first limb of the subsection succeeding the word \"relates.\" The precise meaning of the subsection would be explicitly given by inserting the word \"relates\" between the words \"or\" and' \"to\" in the second line. The phrase relied upon very clearly does not qualify any of the words of the first limb. Strange as it may seem, however, Mr. Belcourt is not without the support of judicial opinion in the contention he raises. As regards the opinions relied upon I will only say that, in my judgment, having regard to the circumstances in which they were expressed, I am under no obligation to give effect to them.\nAnglin J.\u2014Section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" restricts, in cases from the Province of Quebec, the general right of appeal conferred by section 36. If untramelled by authority I Should certainly hold that the earlier words in clause (b) of section 46,\nany fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, or any sum of money payable to His Majesty;\nare not governed by its concluding words,\nwhere rights in future might be bound.\nThe repetition of the preposition in the unmistakable disjunctive \"or to,\" by which those earlier words are immediately followed, precludes the application to them of the concluding words of the clause. The arrangement of the corresponding provision of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, likewise based on 9 Geo. III. ch. 6, sec. 30, as now found in article 68 of the Code of Civil Procedure, makes it, if possible, still more plain that this is the proper construction of the section.\nNor should I have found any great difficulty in distinguishing the decisions of this court in Bank of Toronto v. Le Cur\u00e9, etc.[6]; Gilbert v. Gilman[7], and Chagnon v. Norman[8], both because of essential differences in the nature of the subject-matters of those cases and because of the material change in the statute made, after they were decided, by 56 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 1, whereby the words of the original section \"such like matters or things\" were replaced by the words \"other matters or things.\"\nAfter that amendment, however, in Larivi\u00e8re v. Three Rivers[9], the court refused to allow security for an appeal in an action by a school-mistress to recover $1,243 as fees due to her collected by school Commissioners, holding (a) that the position of school-mistress is not an \"office\" within the section, and (b) that, if it were, as the plaintiff had ceased to hold it, no rights in future would be bound, adding that \"the words 'when rights in future might be bound' * * * govern the preceding words 'any fee of office.'\" With the utmost respect, while the judgment in Larivi\u00e8re v. Three Rivers9, was no doubt right on the first ground, I am of the opinion that the second ground was clearly erroneous. Moreover, it was unnecessary for the disposition of the appeal. Yet, inasmuch as it is distinctly made a ratio decidendi by the court it cannot be treated as a mere dictum (New South Wales Taxation Commissioners v. Palmer[10]; Membery v. Great Western Rly. Co.[11]. I therefore reluctantly bow to its authority.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\n[1] Q.R. 25 K.B. 532.\n[2] 12 Can. S.C.R. 25.\n[3] 16 Can. S.C.R 189.\n[4] 16 Can. S.C.R. 661.\n[5] 23 Can.

[1906] c. 120, ss. 6 and 7.\nA mortgage on real estate contained a covenant by the mortgagor to pay the combined principal and interest by monthly instalments and also provided that \"it is further agreed between me and the said mortgagees that the principal is seven hundred dollars and the rate of interest chargeable thereon is ten per cent per annum as well after as before default.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Man. R. 276), Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, that these provisions constituted a statement of the amount of the principal and interest sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section six of the \"Interest Act.\"\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThis appeal raises the same question as was raised on the preceding case of Canadian Mortgage Investment v. Cameron. The mortgagor sued for a declaration that no interest could be recovered on the mortgage debt. Lafleur K.C. and Jones for the appellants.\nBergman for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The \"Interest Act\" (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 120) in part represents the statute 43 Vict. ch. 42. Until the year 1911, no case appears to have come before the courts depending upon this statute. In that year there was one in the court of the Province of Alberta and there were two last year. These three Alberta cases and the one now under appeal are the only cases in which the courts have been called on to construe the Act during the 37 years that have elapsed since it was passed.\nIn my opinion, the difficulties that have now been suggested regarding the requirements of the Act are largely imaginary and certainly very exaggerated.\nSection 6 of the Act is as follows:\u2014\nWhenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement shewing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nThe purposes of this section and what it calls for are, I think, very fairly stated by Mr. Justice Walsh in the latest judicial pronouncement on the subject given on the appeal of the case of Canadian Northern (reported in error \"Mortgage\") Investment Company v. Cameron[2]. He says:\u2014\nThe evil which the section aims to prevent is the imposition of an extortionate rate of interest through the medium of blended payments of principal and interest. Under this system without the protection which this section affords a highly usurious rate of interest might be wrapped up in these innocent-appearing blended payments without the slightest suspicion on the part of an ignorant or careless borrower that he was being made the victim of it. And so parliament stepped in and decreed that such a mortgage should itself tell the mortgagor exactly how much of the aggregate of these blended payments represents principal and exactly the rate at which the interest included in them calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance is charged under penalty of the loss of all interest for breach of this direction. I think that if such a mortgage gives all the information to which the mortgagor is entitled under the statute the exact form of words which it uses to convey it to him is absolutely immaterial. A statement is something which is stated. Surely if there is to be found within and as part of the mortgage something which states the amount of the principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated in one of the methods prescribed by the section the mortgage does contain a statement of these things. The main thing, in fact the only thing needed is to give to the mortgagor the information to which the section entitles him and I think he can be given it just as effectually through the medium of his own covenants as he can by tabulating it in a formal statement.\nIf the blended payments of principal and interest amount to more than the principal and interest at the rate stated, then, by section 7 no greater interest is recoverable than the rate stated.\nThe meaning of the requirement in section 6 that\nthe mortgage should shew\nthe rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance\nis not perhaps altogether clear.\nI have read very carefully all the judgments in the decided cases but I have failed to find in them any satisfactory explanation of the meaning of the provision though there are some conclusions as to what it does not mean. It is pointed out that \"calculated\" is not the same as \"payable\" but in the respondent's factum it is said:\u2014\nAppellants' contention is that the interest here is payable monthly. Interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum payable monthly is more than 10 per cent per annum.\nYet the Act cannot have intended to prohibit any such monthly payments of blended principal and interest. I do not know what interpretation has been generally adopted as shewn by mortgage forms in common use in the country, but in the appeal to this court from the Ontario Appeal Court of the case of Biggs v. The Freehold Loan & Savings Company[3], the \"Interest Act\" was incidentally considered through the use that had been made of a printed form adapted to a loan repayable in one sum with interest in the meantime, and we read:\u2014\nThen follows, in the printed form, a clause which is required by the statute to be inserted in every mortgage wherein the principal and the interest secured by the mortgage are blended together and made payable by instalments. It is as follows:\u2014\n\"The amount of principal money secured by this mortgage is $20,000 and the rate of interest chargeable thereon is 9 per cent per annum payable not in advance.\"\nIt must be observed that whatever interpretation is put upon the words \"calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance,\" the difference in the rate chargeable would be only fractional, and, I think, it may well be that if all the information required to be given to the mortgagee is, as I think it is, that set forth by Mr. Justice Walsh then the statute is satisfied without absolutely exact figures which the difference in permissible schemes of repayment renders practically impossible to state. The statement of the rate is, I think, only required for the purpose of a standard of comparison.\nThe effect of judgments like that under appeal leads to extravagant results. These may sufficiently be seen summed up in a note to the report of this case in 32 D.L.R., at p. 60. The learned commentator concludes that,\nin a mortgage providing for periodical payments of blended amounts, there shall be a calculation in figures shewing how each amount is constituted by distinguishing principal and interest and stating that the interest is calculated yearly or half-yearly, as the case may be, at a named rate. No other method would enable an illiterate or inexperienced man to do what the mortgagor, it is said, should be enabled to do, that is, amongst other things, be able afterwards to check over the amounts and see how he stands.\nNow, in the first place, the Act says nothing about enabling illiterate or inexperienced men to understand a calculation which requires a skilled actuary to understand and is beyond the understanding of the majority of even educated men, and nothing about keeping him afterwards informed as to how he stands. But further, it hardly seems worth while blending the principal and interest if in the same deed they have to be separated and so stated in respect of each payment. Indeed, it would seem doubtful whether they could then be called blended payments at all, and as it is only with such blended payments that the Act is dealing, it might then have no application to the mortgage at all.\nI think it is perfectly certain that it was never in contemplation that the Act should impose, in respect of all such mortgages as it provides for, an obligation to set forth all these calculations, and equally certain that it does not do so.\nIt is not necessary to consider the decided cases in detail because each case must depend to a certain extent on the wording of the mortgage deed therein called in question.\nIn the present case, I think the requirements of the Act are satisfied by the agreement between the parties expressed in the mortgage, \"that the principal is $700 and the rate of interest chargeable thereon is 10% per annum.\"\nThe statement of claim asks for declarations that no interest whatever is payable on the mortgage and that the same has been satisfied. As this claim fails, the action must be simply dismissed.\nThe appeal will therefore be allowed and the action dismissed, the costs of the appellant both in this court and the courts below to be paid by the respondent.\nDavies J. (dissenting)\u2014In the case of Canadian Mortgage Investment Company v. Cameron, which was argued with this appeal, I have filed my reasons for dismissing that appeal and would refer to them as my reasons for dismissing this appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014This case was argued together with the case of the Canadian Mortgage Investment Company v. Cameron, raising the same question as to the requirements of the \"Interest Act,\" for a specific statement in the mortgage, in which payments of principal and interest are blended.\nOf the respective mortgages in question that in this case is to my mind far more vicious on its face in disregard of the Act, than those in the other case.\nIndeed its provisions bring to mind some of the very abuses which I have no doubt led to the imperative enactments now in question.\nThe mortgagor in this case covenanted as follows:\u2014\nwhich I do hereby acknowledge, covenant with the mortgagees that I will pay to the said mortgagees the above sum of seven hundred dollars in gold or its equivalent, together with interest thereon as hereinafter provided, at the offices of the said mortgagees in the city of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, or in the city of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, said principal and interest being payable as follows:\u2014\nThe sum of eight dollars and seventy-five cents on the first Monday of each month for the period of one hundred and thirty-five months next ensuing, the first of such monthly instalments to become due and payable on the first Monday of January, A.D. 1903, together with all sums, penalties and forfeitures which may become due or payable to the mortgagees by me by virtue of the by-laws of the said mortgagees; and then after some pages of other stipulations it contains this:\nAnd it is further agreed between me and the said mortgagees that the principal is seven hundred dollars and the rate of interest chargeable thereon is ten per cent per annum as well after as before default,\nwhich is followed by a provision for the said payments of one hundred and thirty-five monthly instalments liquidating the debt and otherwise.\nAnd then this curious provision follows, i.e.:\u2014\nAnd for all purposes of this mortgage and for enforcing all rights and remedies of the respective parties thereunder, whenever it shall be necessary to ascertain the amount of principal or interest remaining due or in arrears, the same shall be ascertained by the actuary of the said mortgagees, and his certificate of the fact required shall be final and conclusive between the parties hereto and those claiming through or under them.\nAs the by-laws of the company to which the mortgage was given and of which appellant is only assignee, are not before us, the penalties and forfeitures covered by the foregoing covenant must be matter of speculation.\nIts nature, however, I regret to say, reminds me of the old time abuses to which I have referred.\nAnd the lastly quoted clause is not, I most respectfully submit, as contended by counsel for appellant, merely a collateral matter, but of the very substance of the covenant which is for payment of principal \"with interest thereon as hereinafter provided,\" limited only by the determination of the mortgagee's actuary.\nI think that these provisions must be taken as a whole when we are asked to find therein a substitute for the specific requirements of the \"Interest Act,\" demanding that simplicity of statement I have adverted to in my opinion in the other case which I need not repeat here. They seem like a determination on the part of the draftsman to circumvent the Act rather than an intention to submit to it.\nI agree with the reasoning in the courts below and need not repeat what I said in the other case.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014See ante page 418.\nAnglin J.\u2014The purpose and effect of the concluding clause of section 6 of the \"Interest Act\" (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 120) are certainly not as clear as could be desired. Consideration of its terms, however, has led me to the conclusion that it does not prescribe that the mortgage shall set forth the calculation by which the several blended payments or instalments of principal and interest are computed, or that it shall be shewn what amount of principal and what of interest is comprised in each such payment or instalment. What the prescribed statement is to shew is (a) \"the amount of such principal money advanced,\" i.e., the amount of the principal money secured which has been advanced and is to be repaid in the blended payments; (b) \"the rate of interest chargeable thereon,\" i.e., the rate at which the interest to be paid is to be computed. (c) The section further prescribes that such interest shall be \"calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance,\" and that the \"statement\" shall shew that it is intended to be so computed. The adjective \"chargeable\" clearly relates to and qualifies the word \"rate.\" The participle \"calculated\" equally clearly relates to and qualifies the word \"interest.\" It cannot apply to the word \"rate\"; a \"rate of interest\" is not \"calculated.\" But the \"rate\" is distinctly affected by the frequency with which it is calculated or computed and interest in advance is appreciably more avantageous to the lender than interest not in advance. Ten per cent. per annum computed monthly is a rate materially higher than ten per cent. per annum computed yearly. There is nothing in the statute which precludes requiring payment by quarterly, monthly or even weekly instalments of blended principal and interest. But however frequently the payments are to be made, not only must the rate of interest chargeable be stated, but it must also appear that such interest is to be \"calculated\" (i.e., computed) \"yearly or half-yearly and not in advance.\" If the rate be stated to be say 10% per annum, although this is not an explicit statement that the interest is to be computed yearly, such a computation is implied, and I should regard it as a sufficient statement to that effect and as precluding the computation of interest on any other than a yearly basis. So too with the provision \"not in advance.\" Unless the contrary is expressly stipulated, I would read a reservation of interest at 10% per annum as precluding computation of interest in advance. That the interest in such a case is to be computed \"not in advance\" is, I think, the reasonable implication from the stipulation. The statement in the mortgage before us that,\nthe rate of interest chargeable thereon (i.e., on the principal of $700) is 10 per cent. per annum as well before as after default\nis, in my opinion, a sufficient statement of the rate of interest and that it is to be calculated yearly and not in advance.\nNor do I think it at all necessary that the statement required by section 6 should appear otherwise than in the expression of the consideration, in the proviso for redemption, or in the covenant for payment. Neither is its form material if the information is given which the statute prescribes.\nIf the blended payments or the instalments stipulated in fact amount to more than the principal money and interest calculated at the rate and on the basis so stated, section 7 provides the mortgagor's remedy by restricting the mortgagee's right of recovery to the amount secured according to such statement. If the sum of the blended instalments amounts to less than the principal and interest secured by the mortgage according to the statement, and the mortgagee has agreed to be redeemed on payment of the specified instalments, it may be that he would have difficulty in seeking to avail himself of the statement to enforce payment of any larger sum. But any error in the computation of the blended payments or instalments does not affect the sufficiency of the statement to meet the requirements of the statute They are satisfied if the mortgage shews the amount of principal money advanced and to be repaid, the rate of interest per annum which it is to bear and, if it be so intended, that such interest is to be calculated half-yearly. A stipulation for interest to be computed in advance or more frequently than half-yearly is altogether forbidden; a statement shewing that interest is to be computed or is to be calculated in advance would not in either case render such a calculation legal; no interest whatever would be \"chargeable, payable or recoverable,\" on such a mortgage.\nOne purpose of the statute is to protect the mortgagor against committing himself to an obligation to pay a higher rate of interest than he understood would be charged through the concealment of such higher rate in blended payments. This object is accomplished by requiring the statement shewing the amount of principal advanced, and the rate of interest, depriving the mortgagee of any right to recover interest at a rate greater than that so shewn, and if the prescribed statement is lacking taking from him all right to recover any interest.\nAs I said at the outset, the construction of the statutory clause in question is by no means free from difficulty. I fully recognize that different views may be taken of its purpose and its purport. I have merely endeavoured to state them as they present themselves to me.\nIt follows that in my opinion the demurrer to the statement of claim must be allowed. The appellant is entitled to its costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McAllister & McCallum.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rothwell, Johnston, Bergman & McGhee.\n[1] 27 Man R. 276.\n[2] 33 D.L.R. 792, [1917] 2 W.W.R. 18.\n[3] 31 Can.

[1914] c. 280, s. 10.\nRates for meeting the cost of local improvements under the Ontario \u201cLocal Improvements Act\u201d are taxation.\nBy sec. 10 of its Act of incorporation the property of the Upper Canada College is \u201cexempt from taxation in the same manner and to the same extent as property vested in the Crown.\u201d Sec. 5 of the \u201cOntario Assessment Act\u201d provides that \u201cthe interest of the Crown in any property is declared to be exempt from taxation\u201d and sec. 6 that \u201cthe exemption provided for by sec. 5 shall be subject to the provisions of the \u2018Local Improvement Act\u2019 as to the assessment of land for local improvements which would otherwise be exempt from taxation.\u201d The \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d contains no express provision for levying rates on Crown lands and no machinery for collecting any such rates.\nHeld, that under this legislation the property of the Crown was not subject to assessment for the cost of local improvements and that of the Upper Canada College was also exempt.\nBy sec. 47 of the \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d \u201cthe land of a University, College or Seminary of learning * * * exempt from taxation under the \u2018Assessment Act\u2019 * * * shall be liable to be specially assessed.\u201d\nHeld, that this section does not apply to land of Upper Canada College which is not exempt under the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d but under its own special Act.\nSec. 48 of said Act provides that \u201clands exempt from taxation for local improvements shall, nevertheless, for all purposes except petitioning for or against undertaking a work be* * * specially assessed\u201d but the special assessment shall not be collectable from the owner.\nHeld, that under this section Upper Canada College is not an essential party to a petition for local improvements affecting its lands.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (37 Ont. L.R. 665), affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the hearing in favour of the respondent.\nThe action was brought by the College for a declaration that by-laws of the city ordering local improvement work to be done on the street on which the College property fronted were invalid as the College did not sign the petition for such work. The legislation relied upon is given in the above head-note.\nArnoldi K.C. for the appellant. Exemption from taxation does not embrace exemption from payment for cost of local improvements. In re Leach and City of Toronto[2], at pages 621 and 625; City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works[3]; Les Ecclesiastiques de St. Sulpice v. City of Montreal[4].\nThe learned counsel also argued that the by-law was invalid for irregularity in procedure.\nFairty for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with the judgment of the Appellate Division and for the reasons delivered by Mr. Justice Masten would dismiss this appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin for dismissing this appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appellant was not at the times in question liable to be specially assessed for the local improvement in question and hence has no right to complain. The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014By section 10 of ch. 280 R.S.O. 1914, all property of Upper Canada College is exempt from taxation to the same extent as property vested in the Crown for the public uses of Ontario. By section 5 s.s. 1 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1914, ch. 195, the interest of the Crown in any property is declared to be exempt from taxation. This enactment, however, must be read subject to the qualification imposed by section 6 of the same Act; the effect of which is, I think, clearly expressed in the argument of Mr. Fairty in his factum, and it is this: That as regards assessment for local improvements of land the exemptions created by section 5 are not to prevail as against the provisions of the \u201cLocal Improvement Act.\u201d\nTurning now to the \u201cLocal Improvement Act,\u201d putting aside for a moment section 47, it is abundantly clear that there is nothing in the Act expressly aimed at the property of the Crown, and moreover, as Mr. Fairty points out, the Act contains no machinery for collecting local improvement taxes from Crown property; on the contrary, the first subsection of section 157 explicitly provides that no interest of the Crown shall be sold for arrears of taxes. Then as to section 47, that section, I agree, has no application here because it applies only to cases where the exemption is created by the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d the exemption enjoyed by Upper Canada College being created not by the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d but by its own special Act.\nThe result is that section 48 of the \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d comes into play, by which it is expressly provided that land exempt from taxation for local improvements shall not be taken into account for the purpose of any petition under the Act. Such land is \u201cassessed\u201d in a qualified sense only; it is entered in the assessment roll and a valuation is set opposite to this entry, but that is done merely for the purpose of convenient book-keeping; because the taxes which would have been collectable had the land not been exempt from taxation are, by force of section 48, charged against the municipality itself.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The main ground of attack on the impugned by-laws is that Upper Canada College, which owns all the property abutting on one side of a projected extension of Oriole Avenue, in the City of Toronto, is liable to be specially assessed in respect of the cost of such extension, and that without its signature the petition for the work did not meet the requirements of sec. 12 of R.S.O. 1914, ch. 193:\nSec. 12. The petition for the work shall be signed by at least two-thirds in number of the owners representing at least one-half of the value of the lots liable to be specially assessed.\nI assume that the value of the lots owned by the appellant, if they were \u201cliable to be specially assessed,\u201d in fact exceeded one-half of the value of all the property so liable.\nThe property of Upper Canada College is vested in a Board of Governors, a body corporate (R.S.O., 1914, ch. 280, sec. 3), and is\nexempt from taxation in the same manner and to the same extent as property vested in the Crown for the public uses of Ontario (sec. 10).\nThe question presented therefore is whether property so vested in the Crown is liable for local improvement taxation, that is, for the public uses of Ontario.\nThat rates levied to meet the cost of local improvements under the Ontario \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d are \u201ctaxation\u201d in my opinion admits of no doubt. Authorities binding on this court have so determined in respect to strictly analogous rates levied in other provinces. The City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works[5], Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Winnipeg[6], Les Ecclesiastiques de St. Sulpice de Montreal v. City of Montreal[7], at pages 403, 409. The Ontario \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d (R.S.O. ch. 193) in sec. 48 itself terms such rates \u201ctaxation for local improvements.\u201d\nBy sec. 5 of the Ontario \u201cAssessment Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 195), \u201cThe interest of the Crown in any property * * * \u201d is declared to be exempt from taxation. Notwithstanding this provision, it is enacted by sec. 6 that:\nThe exemptions provided for by sec. 5 shall be subject to the provisions of the \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d as to the assessment for local improvements of land, which would otherwise be exempt from such assessment under that section.\nThe provisions of the \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d thus referred to are ss. 47 and 48:\nSec. 47. Land on which a church or place of worship is erected, or which is used in connection therewith, and the land of a university, college or seminary of learning whether vested in a trustee or otherwise, which is exempt from taxation under the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d except schools maintained in whole or in part by a legislative grant or a school tax, shall be liable to be specially assessed.\nSec. 48. Land exempt from taxation for local improvements under any general or special Act shall nevertheless, for all purposes except petitioning for or against undertaking a work, be subject to the provisions of this Act and shall be specially assessed; but the special assessments imposed thereon which fall due while such land remains exempt shall not be collected or collectable from the owner thereof but shall be paid by the corporation.\nThe very presence of sec. 47 affords an almost conclusive indication that but for its provisions the property which it describes would have been exempt under sec. 5 of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d from local improvement rates as taxation. Indeed the language of sec. 6 of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d makes this certain. Admittedly the appellant is a University, College or Seminary of learning and it is not a\nschool maintained in whole or in part by a legislative grant or a school tax.\nBut, as Mr. Fairty pointed out, it is not\nexempt from taxation under the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d\nbut is so exempt under s. 10 of the \u201cUpper Canada College Act\u201d (R.S.O. ch. 280). Its property is therefore not within sec. 47.\nNo provision of the \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d renders property of the Crown liable to taxation for local improvements and of course the Crown is not bound by such legislation unless specially mentioned.\nSec. 48, as will be readily perceived, ex facie deals with\nlands exempt from taxation for local improvements.\nWhile directing that such lands shall nevertheless be subject to the provisions of the Act for certain purposes, it specifically excludes therefrom those provisions which deal with petitioning for or against undertaking a work, and it enacts that while (no doubt for convenience in working put the scheme of the Act), lands so exempted shall be specially assessed, yet the assessments thereon shall not be collected or collectable from the owner but shall be paid by the municipal corporation.\nThese provisions make it abundantly clear that the legislature did not intend to restrict the generality of the exemption from taxation of property of the Crown, declared by sec. 5 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d by excluding from it local improvement taxation. Since the property of Upper Canada College is by its Act entitled to the same exemption as if it were property of the Crown and does not fall within the provisions of sec. 47 of the \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d (designed to prevent the exemption of certain defined classes of religious and educational property from general municipal taxation extending to local improvement rates), and there is no provision which renders it liable for such rates, it follows that it is exempted from them and that, although liable to be specially assessed under sec. 48, the municipal, corporation must pay its assessment; and the fact that it is so assessed does not bring it within the provisions of the \u201cLocal Improvement Act\u201d which deal with\npetitioning for or against undertaking a work.\nThe appeal upon this point therefore fails.\nThe other questions involved in the appeal concern alleged unfairness on the part of the respondent corporation in the laying out of the proposed roadway and in the location of a sidewalk upon it. It suffices to say that these matters are peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the municipal council. No fraud or absence of good faith in the exercise of its powers has been shewn. Any exercise of its discretion short of a plain and manifest abuse of its powers is not subject to curial control, Montreal v. Beauvais[8], United Buildings Corporation Ltd. v. Vancouver[9], merely because some benefit therefrom has accrued to particular persons. No case of abuse has been made here.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Arnoldi & Grierson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: William Johnston.\n[1] 37 Ont.

The People's Gas Supply Co. manufacture acetylene gas and purchase said tanks, charge them with their own gas and sell or exchange them. On the tanks so sold is affixed a label covering said trade-mark, which states that the tank is filled with gas manufactured by The People's Gas Supply Co. This label is of paper affixed to the tank by shellac and can only be removed by scraping with a knife or other instrument. In an action by the Prest-o-Lite Co. for infringement of their trade-mark,\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, that such action must fail; that defendants did all that could reasonably be expected to prevent a prejudicial use of the trade-mark; and that they did not \"use\" the trade-mark within the meaning of sec. 19 of the \"Trade-mark and Design Act.\"\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada dismissing the plaintiffs' action.\nThe action was brought for infringement of plaintiffs' trade-mark. The material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nThe action was dismissed by the Exchequer Court and the following reasons assigned.\nCASSELS J.\u2014This action is brought by the plaintiffs to restrain the defendants from infringing the trademark of the plaintiffs. The plaintiff company is an incorporated company having its head office at the City of New York, in the State of New York, one of the United States of America. The defendants are an incorporation with their head office at Ottawa, in the Dominion of Canada.\nThe contention of the plaintiffs is shortly as follows: Apparently in the United States patents were issued to them which covered not merely the process patent but also the tank in which the product of the process was stored. In Canada the only patent which the plaintiffs have is a patent for the process. There was no patent in Canada protecting the tank.\nThe Prest-o-Lite Company are manufacturers and distributors of acetylene gas for lighting automobiles and other vehicles. The plaintiffs stores its gas in portable steel cylinders lined with asbestos, which absorbs a quantity of acetone which in turn is saturated with acetylene gas introduced under pressure, the outflow for consumption being valve controlled.\nIt is conceded that the defendants have by virtue of the second section of chapter 103, of the statutes of 1913, the right to manufacture use or sell the, process product in Canada. Their rights in- this respect are not contested. It is also conceded by the plaintiffs that the tanks manufactured and sold by them have become the property of the purchasers; and it was stated by Mr. Chrysler, on the argument of the case, that the purchasers might utilize these tanks in any manner in which they chose, provided the trade-mark \"Prest-o-Lite\" was removed from the tanks. In other words, if it were feasible to remove the trademark, plaintiffs concede that the defendants have a perfect right to fill the tank with acetylene manufactured by them and to sell the same. The contention, however, is that the defendants have no right to fill the gas into tanks containing the trade-mark of the plaintiffs, and to sell them to others with the trade-mark \"Prest-o-Lite\" on the tank.\nTwo classes of cases arise. One is cases in which the purchasers from the Prest-o-Lite Company in the United States take their tanks to the defendants to be refilled. This comprises the larger number of what the plaintiffs contend are infringements of their trademark. The other class of cases, is cases in which the defendants purchase the tanks out and out with the name Prest-o-Lite on them, refill them and sell them to others or give them in exchange for empty tanks for a consideration.\nThe plaintiffs' contention is that the defendants are infringers of their trade-mark.\nSince the argument I have gone very carefully through all the authorities cited to me, and numerous other authorities, and have come to the conclusion that the plaintiffs' action fails. The cases are so numerous and the principles so clearly settled that it would be useless labour to comment in detail on these authorities.\nIt has to be clearly understood that the Exchequer Court has no jurisdiction in what are called \"passing off\" cases. The jurisdiction is limited purely to questions of infringement of trade-mark. This is conceded by counsel for the plaintiffs. It is also, as I have stated, conceded that the defendants have an absolute right to use the process and sell the product described in the Canadian patent.\nIt is proved before me clearly that in no case, except one or two of trifling importance, have the defendants ever refilled any of the tanks and let them go from their premises without the word \"Prest-o-Lite\" being completely covered over. A notice is posted over the word \"Prest-o-Lite\" this notice showing on its face that the tank was refilled by the Ottawa Company.\nThe contention is that the defendants have covered them over with a substance which might be removed by a wrong-doer. In point of fact no evidence has been adduced to shew any such erasures of the covering placed on the tanks by the defendants, and I am not prepared to adopt the reasoning of some of the American authorities cited before me, in which comment is made upon the fact that the wrapper placed over the\" word \"Prest-o-Lite\" is capable of being removed.\nAs I have said, it has to be kept clearly in mind this is not the case of \"passing off\" or wrongfully attempting to steal the trade of the plaintiffs.\nIn the cases in the United States it is quite evident that the courts were influenced by the fact that the defendants were endeavouring to steal the plaintiffs' trade.\nIn one case, the Searchlight Gas Co. v. Prest-o-Lite Co.[1], before the Circuit Court of Appeals, Baker J., at page 696, uses the following language:\u2014 \"Appellee is entitled to have its lifeblood saved from leeches and its nest from cuckoos.\"\nThe judges in these cases do dwell upon trademark, but it is so mixed up with the passing off, that evidently from a perusal \u00b0of these particular cases the court was much influenced by the fraud of the defendants in seeking to rob the plaintiffs of the benefit of their trade. There is nothing in the case before me corresponding in any way to the facts of these cases.\nThe defendants as far as they can effectually covered the word \"Prest-o-Lite\" when refilling the tanks, and sending them out of their premises. There is no evidence whatsoever of any combination between the parties bringing the tanks to be refilled and the defendant company. Under the patent law there may be cases where a defendant may become what is commonly known as a contributory infringer. The term is a misnomer. If the circumstances are such that it is proved the party connives with another to defraud the patentee he becomes an infringer\u2014but to be an infringer he must be a party to inducing another to break a contract or inducing him to infringe a patent. The law on the subject is very fully discussed by the late Mr. Justice Burbidge, in the case of The Copeland Chatterson Co. v. Hatton[2]. This case was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the judgment of the Exchequer Court was affirmed. The question there discussed was the right of a patentee to enter into a bargain for the use of a patented article. The point of contributory infringement does not seem to have been discussed, but evidently the views of the learned Judge were sustained.\nIn the case before me there is no pretence whatever of any dealings on the part of the defendants similar to the dealings in the Copeland Chatterson Case, referred to. I find no law under the \"Trade-mark Acts\" which refers to contributory infringement.\nIt has to be borne in mind that the case before me is not brought for infringement of a patent. Some point is made that some of the tanks which were brought to the defendant or filled by the defendant, had the word \"patented\" on them. No doubt these were American tanks, and probably very rightly had this stamp upon them. It is of no consequence, and has no bearing as far as I can see on the case before me.\nIn the Ontario Courts, the case of Prest-o-Lite Co. v. London Engine Supplies Co.[3], came up before Chief Justice Falconbridge. This case was taken to the Court of Appeal. On the appeal the reasons of the Appellate Division are set out in[4] (Dec. 22nd, 1916). As far as the reasons would shew this case rested to a very great extent on passing off. The contention was that there was unfair competition. I have looked at the pleadings in this case, and the claim of the plaintiff was not confined to passing off but the plaintiffs in that action also relied upon the infringements of their trademark \"Prest-o-Lite.\"\nI am unable to bring my mind to a conclusion, that what the defendants have done, having regard to the circumstances as detailed in the evidence, amounts to an infringement of the plaintiffs' trade-mark. One or two trifling instances have occurred in which the defendants may have sold the tank filled by them without obliterating the name. There is considerable doubt about this. In any event the amount is trifling.\nNo claim has been pressed that the tanks have not been sold out and out. Any notice such as set out in the defence is a notice under the American patents not in force in Canada.\nIt was argued by Mr. Sinclair that the word \"Prest-o-Lite\" is not the subject matter of a trademark, but that it became the generic name of the article sold. I cannot agree with this contention. The trade-mark was adopted for use by a company other than the company which had the patents under which the tanks and the compound in question were manufactured. It was the trade-mark first used by a company with another name, this company subsequently changing its corporate name into the name of the Prest-o-Lite Company. It is open to argument that the name may not be susceptible of a valid trademark under the principles laid down in the case of Kirstein v. Cohen[5]. My own personal view is that it is a valid trade-mark and not governed by the principles decided in the Kirstein Case. It is, however, unnecessary t6 follow up this line of thought, as after the best consideration I can give to the case I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs are not entitled to succeed for the reasons I have given.\nThe action is dismissed with costs.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants. The defendants used the plaintiffs' trade-mark within the meaning of sec. 19 of the Act. See Bechstein v. Barker[6] ; Monro v. Hunter[7]; Upmann v. Forester[8].\nProof that any purchaser from or through defendants was deceived is unnecessary. Millington v. Fox[9]; Cellular Clothing Co. v. Maxton[10]; Boston Rubber Shoe Co. v. Boston Rubber Co.[11].\nSee also Gannert v. Rupert[12]; Prest-o-Lite Co. y. Davis[13], at page 350; Prest-o-Lite Co. v. Searchlight[14].\nR. V. Sinclair .K.C. for the respondents. The tanks bought from appellants became the property of the defendants who can fill and sell them with the trade-mark on so long as the purchaser is not deceived. Welch v. Knott[15]; Prest-o-Lite Co. v. Auto Acetylene Co. [16]; Kerly on Trade-marks (2 ed.) p. 369; Barret v. Gomm [17]; and United Tobacco Cos. v. Crook[18], were also referred to. THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The case is unusual in that the tanks in respect of which the claim for infringement of trade-mark is brought, are not only things of intrinsic value but of themselves of far more value than their contents, whilst most, at any rate, of the decisions in similar cases deal with vessels or containers of little or no value in themselves, such as aerated water bottles with the trade-mark of the maker of the water embossed or blown in the glass. The difference does not, however, affect the principles on which the ease turns.\nTwo classes of cases arise. One is that in which the individual owner of the tank takes it to be refilled. This he has a perfect right to do and the respondents putting their label over the trade-mark are justified in refilling it. No one can be deceived here and the respondents cannot be said to be using the trade-mark in disposing of their goods. The other class comprises the transactions in which the respondents purchase the tanks and refill and sell or give them in exchange for empty tanks for a consideration, which is the same thing, the empty tank being only part of the consideration given; and also those in which they refill tanks for owners of garages who dispose of them in a similar way to those making use of their establishments. The cases in this latter class constitute, I think, an infringement of the trade-mark.\nIt is well established that regard must be had to the possibility of the ultimate purchaser being deceived and such deception will be restrained even though the original purchaser is not deceived.\nNo man is entitled to represent his goods as being the goods of another man, and no man is permitted to use any mark, sign or symbol, device, or other means, whereby, without making a direct false representation himself to a purchaser who purchases from him, he enables such purchaser to tell a lie or to make a false representation to somebody else who is the ultimate customer. Per James L.J. in Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Loog[19]; adopted by Lord Macnaghten in Reddaway v. Banham[20].\nIf a man does that, the natural consequence of which (although it does not deceive the person with whom he deals, and is therefore no misrepresentation to him) is to enable that other person to deceive and pass off his goods as somebody else's, for that he is answerable.\nPer Cotton L.J. in Singer Mfg. Co. v. Loog at page 422.\nIt is clear that when the respondents sell the tanks which they have purchased and refilled to keepers of garages or others, particularly dealers, of course, or fill them for such persons they put it out of their own power to answer for the ultimate purchaser not being deceived as to the goods he is purchasing bearing the appellants' trade-mark.\nIn this connection it is insufficient that the respondents place their own label over the trade-mark. It was held by North J., in Allan v. Richards[21], that:\nIf the defendant chose to buy second hand bottles bearing a trade-name and fill them with the same liquid as the owner of the name was in the habit of filling them with, the defendant was not in a position to resist an injunction if. applied for. The affixing of the defendant's own label did not affect the question, for the label might get removed in a variety of likely ways, for instance, if the bottles were. plunged in ice. If the label under such circumstances were to come off, there would be nothing to prevent the public from believing they were purchasing in the bottles stamped with the plaintiff's name ginger beer manufactured by the plaintiff. The injunction must therefore be granted.\nBut even if the putting on of the respondents' label were to. be considered sufficient in the case of a sale to an individual it affords no guarantee whatever in the case of dealings with dealers who might well systematically remove the labels before selling the tanks to the ultimate purchasers. In my opinion, however, the practice of buying up the appellants' tanks and refilling them for sale is unfair to them in any case. Let us suppose that the tanks were refilled with an inferior quality of gas; that I dare say is not the case in the present instance but it might well be so in others; it would be very injurious to the reputation of the appellants' tanks that a number of them should be about filled with a gas that could not be relied on; the public cannot be supposed to know the explanation of the difference between the tanks as originally filled and those same tanks still bearing the trade-mark but refilled either improperly or with an inferior gas by some other firm.\nIn the judgment appealed from it is said that\nthe cases in which the purchasers from the Prest-o-Lite Company in the United States take their tanks to the defendants to be refilled comprise the larger number of what the plaintiffs (appellants) contend are infringements of their trade-mark.\nIf this is not meant to include dealers there is a dispute as to the facts because the appellants in their factum say,\naccording to the evidence the greater number of transactions are between the respondent company and the dealers.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to go into the evidence on this point as the case should, in my opinion, go back to the Exchequer Court for re-consideration and determination upon the principle above indicated.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Sir Walter Cassels in the Exchequer Court I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant complains that its trade-mark, duly registered, and engraved upon tanks which it has sold without restriction as to their future use, has been infringed. by the respondent refilling same for the respective owners thereof with its acetylene and charging therefor, or by exchanging the like tanks (which it had duly acquired) after filling same with acetylene for others brought to it empty.\nStress is laid in argument upon the fact that the tanks in question bore the engraving of appellant's trade-mark although that was carefully covered over by something intended to hide it which had an inscription thereon declaring the fact-of the refilling having been effected with acetone and acetylene of the respondent's manufacture.\nIs it- conceivable that any one would attempt the maintenance of such an action if, for example, alcohol or buttermilk had been used instead of gas for refilling such a tank merely, as a convenient vessel for carrying such or the like materials upon sale thereof?\nI suggest such an improbable contention merely to illustrate and make clear the issue raised.\nThe nature of the offence against both law and honest dealing has to be considered in applying the \"Trade-mark and Designs Act\" which was enacted to furnish those concerned with a more efficient remedy against transgressors in that regard than had been obtainable at common law or in equity.\nThe action rests upon section 19 of the Act, which is as follows:-\n19. An action or suit may be maintained by any proprietor of a trade-mark against any person who uses the registered trade-mark of such proprietor or any fraudulent imitation thereof, or who sells any article bearing such trademark, or any imitation thereof, or contained in any package of such proprietor or purporting to be his, contrary to the provisions of this Act.\nIt seems to me impossible to hold, under the facts in evidence and in face of the express declaration inscribed on the label used in such transaction by respondents, which could not escape a purchaser's notice, that there was any use by it of appellants' trade-mark. It is not pretended there was \"any fraudulent imitation thereof.\"\nIt is conceivable that if the label had been shewn to be of a kind easily removed by accident or design and the transactions were of such goods for the purpose of resale, then the case might have been brought within the principle enunciated by Lord Westbury in Edelsten v. Edelsten[22], at page 199.\nThere are many ways in which to my mind, by subterfuges such as are not supported herein by evidence or pretended in argument to exist, that the respondents might have executed the like transactions to those in question herein in such ways and manners as to offend against the Act. We need not speculate regarding these possibilities but simply say on the particular facts presented herein and arguments presented, that there has been no offence against the provisions of the Act of such a kind as to support this action, and therefore the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed. There was, I think, by the respondent a \"use\" of the trade-mark and I think it cannot be denied that. the cylinders bore the trade-mark within the meaning of the statute.\nThe key to the solution of the question presented seems to be this: The fact that the cylinders handed out by the respondent company in exchange for others were complete Prest-o-Lite cylinders exchangeable at the Prest-o-Lite agencies and capable of identification as such, can by no means be regarded as a negligible circumstance in this trading that the respondent company carries on. One must ask one's self the question: Would the customers of the respondent company accept cylinders which, being minus the trademark, would not be exchangeable at the Prest-o-Lite Company's agencies? To ask that question is to answer it. The trade-mark is not obliterated, it is not intended to be obliterated; the device resorted to deceives nobody, is intended to deceive nobody and would defeat its purpose if it deceived anybody. The cylinder bears the trade-mark, is known to bear the trade-mark and has its value largely because it bears the trademark, and the trade-mark is used in that sense and is, I think, within the meaning of the statute. The appellant company is entitled to succeed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014After consideration of the numerous cases cited at bar I am, with respect; of the opinion that the judgment in appeal is right and should be upheld. There is direct and irreconcilable conflict between United States authorities, such as Prest-o-Lite Co. v. Heiden[23], and Searchlight Gas Co. v. Prest-o-Lite Co.[24], and such English cases as Welch v. Knott[25].\nThe defendants completely covered the plaintiffs' trade-mark on each tank filled by them with an adhesive label, which stated in conspicuous characters that the tank had been refilled by them. This label was so securely fastened to the metal case with shellac that it was: not removable by water and could only be taken off deliberately by scraping with a knife or other instrument; Barrett v. Gomm[26]. The defendants did all that they could reasonably be expected to do to prevent any use of the trade-mark prejudicial to the plaintiffs. The tanks when they left their hands could have deceived nobody. They cannot be held responsible for any fraudulent removal of labels, so carefully designed and attached, by persons subsequently handling the tanks. There is no evidence of any such removal in the record. The case at bar is clearly distinguishable from Rose v. Loftus[27], and Thwaites v. McEvilly[28], where the embossed names of the plaintiffs were not covered by the labels pasted on the necks of the bottles, which were, moreover, easily removable. The bottles as sent out by the defendants in those cases might readily be sold as containing the plaintiffs' goods. I agree with the views expressed by Hopley J. in United Tobacco Cos. v. Crook[29], cited by counsel for the respondent.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Chrysler & Higgerty.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R. V. Sinclair.\n[1] 215 Fed.

A newspaper article alleged that the members of a municipal council (referring to the plaintiff and others,) \"will have to do a lot of explanation to satisfy the\" public that their action \"was for the protection of the city's interest and not because of a split as to a possible rake off.\u2026 We have had one year of Tammany. We can't stand another.\"\nHeld that no action for libel will lie against a newspaper which makes fair and reasonable comments upon the evil conditions prevalent in the city and upon corrupt and unlawful practices provided these comments do not exceed bounds of legitimate criticism and could not be construed as imputing personal knowledge and corrupt intention on the part of a member of the municipal council.\nPer Davies and Brodeur JJ., the court must decide this question, not on any possible interpretation which might be suggested of the language complained of, but upon such interpretation as is reasonably fair and as would be understood by the people of the city in question.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. dissenting: The statements complained of amount to allegations of personal corruption against the respondent.\nPer Anglin J., Those statements go far beyond a fair expression of a reasonable inference from any proven facts and indicate an absence of that \"honest sense of justice\" and of that \"reasonable degree of judgment and moderation\" on the part of the critic which are essential to sustain a plea of fair comment.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, [1]which reversed the judgment of Ives J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs. The material circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nE. B. Edwards K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)\u2014The appellant devoted much pains, both in the newspaper articles out of which the present libel suit arises and at the trial, to proving his assertion that there was in the Edmonton city council a party, to which the respondent belonged, known as the \"administration party.\" the members of which held together on all matters of substance, and, composing the majority of the council, had the control of the affairs of the city. There is no point to the statement, unless the power of the alleged party was directed to improper and corrupt ends. The rule of the majority is necessarily incident to any elected council, and such majority has commonly stability through the party system as may be seen in Parliament, the chief council in the land. It was not necessary, as the appellant claims,\nthat the result of this system was to bring about a condition in Edmonton practically the same as the Tammany system in New York.\nThe appellant, in his defence, alleged that his attacks were directed against the system and not against the respondent as an individual. This is perhaps rather inconsistent with the argument advanced in the article of the 28th November,\nthat good government depends on men rather than on form,\nbut there can, I think, be no doubt that the innuendo in the article of the 2nd December is supported,\nthat the plaintiff conspired with other members of the council of the City of Edmonton to conduct the business of the city so as to secure private ends instead of the public good and to introduce and carry out in the City of Edmonton corrupt and unlawful practices usually associated with the name of Tammany.\nAs the learned judge delivering the judgment under appeal says:\u2014\nThere can in this matter be no way open for an interpretation which would not impute personal knowledge and participation;\nit is personal corruption.\nThe appellant is really driven to the claim insistently made before this court that there is a difference between charges against the respondent in his public and in his private capacity. There is none; and I think this cannot be too emphatically stated. The morality which a man is bound to observe in his public life is the same as in his private life. There are not two persons in a man, neither are there two codes of morality but only one. Whilst a man has the same responsibility for his actions whether in his public or private capacity, he is also entitled to a corresponding protection when unjustly charged with immoral acts either in his public or private capacity.\nI give the effect of the appellant's argument so far as I can gather it, but as it is to be found in his factum, it is certainly confused and apparently far from clear to the writer of it. In it we read:\u2014\nThe second point taken by the appellant is that the learned judges in appeal failed to appreciate the difference between criticism of the public action of a public man and an imputation upon the same person in his private capacity.\nCriticism of a man is not synonymous with an imputation upon him. The passage proceeds:\u2014\nThe quotation from the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart at p. 187 of the case, already given, shews that the judges in appeal had clearly in mind the proposition of law that there must be an imputation upon the private or personal character of the respondent in order that he might be entitled to judgment.\nThere is no such previous, quotation, and I can find nothing in the judgment to which counsel can be referring. Further, I do not know the proposition of law asserted. The learned counsel appears throughout to confound the words \"private\" and \"personal \"capacity\" and \"character.\" What is meant by a man's private character I do not know, but every imputation upon his character is a personal imputation whether in his public or private capacity.\nAgain, it is said:\u2014\nThe learned judges have surely gone too far in finding that the reasonably necessary result of the language was a charge of personal corruption. Had they kept in mind the distinction which is always made between conduct in a public capacity and conduct in a private capacity it would have been clear to them that the article not only did not make any charge against the respondent in his personal capacity but made it plain that the criticism was directed against the system and not against the individual.\nThere is no such distinction made or capable of being made and the confusion of language is worse than ever. What capacity can the respondent have which is not a personal capacity? Apparently the argument is that a charge against the respondent in his personal capacity is a charge against the individual, but a charge against a public man is not a charge against an individual but a system. It is idle to attempt to follow such arguments any further.\nMr. Justice Beck did not, as alleged, dissent from the judgment of the other judges of appeal; on the contrary, he agreed with it and went further. I do not find it necessary to say more than that I concur in the disposition of the case made by the Appellate Division and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This action was one brought by the plaintiff against the defendant printing company for several alleged libels published respecting him in their newspaper the Bulletin in the City of Edmonton.\nThe plaintiff was an alderman of that city at the time the articles were published and the libels related to his actions and conduct as such alderman and as one supporting what was known as \"the administration\" in the city council of Edmonton. They were written on the eve of a city election for a number of aldermen. The plaintiff was not one of these, as he had been elected for a two year term, only one of which had expired.\nThe articles complained of were written in a very vigorous and forceful style and did not mince matters n charging that the civic \"administration party,\" that is the mayor with a majority of the aldermen who usually voted with him to support and carry out the policy he advocated, had brought the affairs of the city, socially as well as financially, into a very disgraceful condition which could and should be remedied by the election of a new mayor and a body of aldermen who would support a new and better policy and method of civic government.\nThere were five distinct libels charged against the defendant as having been published in its newspaper. In order to understand these articles properly and to appreciate their true meaning and object and how they would be understood by an ordinary citizen of Edmonton, it is absolutely necessary to read the record we have before us, which includes not only the articles in full as published and the evidence given at the trial, but also many exhibits and amongst them an important report made by Mr. Justice Scott, who had been appointed to examine and report upon the\nexistence of crime and vice within the city and whether its growth and extent had been such as to indicate a failure on the part of the civic authorities to enforce the law. The learned judge, acting as such commissioner, found it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the evidence of many witnesses who were in a position to know the facts on which he was asked to report, as they had been spirited away and could not be had.\nBut while he reported that\nthere is no direct evidence of the receipt by any alderman, commissioner or other officer, servant or agent of the city, of any money for the protection of vice,\nhe went on to say:\nIf the evidence of the prostitutes who left the city on the eve of the investigation could have been procured, more light might have been thrown upon the question. Some of those who were examined before me are shown to have stated that they were under protection by the police by reason of their having paid for it; but, upon their examination, they denied that they had paid any money for that purpose.\nHe winds up his report as follows:\u2014\nHaving regard to the inconclusiveness of the evidence already given in some respects and to the number of witnesses whose absence has made it impossible to examine them, it is suggested that the present report be treated as an interim one, and the authority conferred by the council for the inquiry be extended, so that, if it hereafter becomes possible to obtain any further information, a tribunal for that purpose will be available. The general condition revealed is of the most serious possible character and it seems important, from the point of view of the citizens generally, that the fullest possible light should be thrown upon the subject and the persons responsible definitely ascertained.\nThe conditions the learned commissioner was able to report upon being, as he said, of the \"most serious character\" and \"requiring the fullest possible light to be thrown upon the subject,\" it became not only the right but the duty of the press of the city thoroughly to discuss the deplorable situation revealed and to make such fair and reasonable comments upon it and upon the civic administration responsible for it as the revealed facts called for.\nSuch right and duty however would not, of course, justify unfair or unreasonable comment reflecting upon the characters and reputations of those more or less responsible for those facts. The defence set up by the defendant is that, in the discharge of its right and duty as a newspaper, it did not trespass or go beyond what was fair and reasonable comment upon matters of public interest.\nWhether such defence has been made out is the question before us now, and, in determining it, we are practically acting as jurymen and must decide, not on any possible interpretation which might be suggested of the language complained of, but upon such an interpretation as is reasonably plain and fair and as would be understood by the people of Edmonton.\nIt is, in my opinion, most unfortunate that the issues had not been submitted to a jury\u2014a tribunal recognized as peculiarly well qualified to pass on such a question as we have before us. But we have to deal with the case as it stands with a conflict of judicial opinion.\nThe learned trial judge held that each and all of the alleged libels were fair and reasonable comments upon matters of public interest and on such a finding of fact he dismissed the action.\nThe Appeal Court was divided.\nThree of the learned judges agreed with the trial judge with respect to all of the alleged libels but one, that they were merely fair comment in matters of public interest; but with respect to that one, two of them concurred in the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Stuart that,\nit contained beyond doubt an insinuation that the plaintiff was one of a number of aldermen who were acting corruptly and dishonestly in their dealing with the paving contracts\nand that applying the meaning of the word \"Tammany\" to be that given by the defendant in its article of December 1st it clearly supported the innuendo alleged in the fifth paragraph of the claim that the plaintiff conspired with other members of the council to introduce and cany on in the City of Edmonton corrupt and unlawful practices.\nMr. Justice Beck held that all of the articles charged as libellous were in fact so and was in favour of setting aside the verdict of the trial judge and entering judgment for the plaintiff and if he was not satisfied with nominal damages \" there should be an assessment of damages.\"\nThe extract from the article of December 2nd, which the Appeal Court has held to be libellous, is as follows:\u2014\nThe members of the council (clearly referring to the plaintiff among others) who were so careful not to let a printing contract of $10,000 or $12,000 get by their friends will have to do a lot of explanation to satisfy the men who had to stint their families in order to get their taxes paid by last Monday afternoon that their split on the paving contracts running into the hundreds of thousands was for the protection of the city's interest and not because of a split as to a possible rake-off * * * We have had one year of Tammany. We can't stand another.\nI have given the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal a great deal of consideration and do not find myself able to concur in the conclusion they reached as to the libellous character of this article.\nIn construing that article and forming a conclusion as to what is really meant, one must place oneself in the position of a resident of Edmonton to whom it was specially addressed on the then eve of an election for mayor and aldermen for the then coming year. One must ask oneself in view of the then existing proved conditions in civic matters, of Judge Scott's report, of the evidence given at the trial and of all other surrounding circumstances, whether, as the trial judge found, the article did not go beyond what, in the extraordinary and unfortunate civic circumstances, was fair and legitimate criticism or had crossed the line as the Appeal Court found and become libellous. But in forming one's conclusion, one must not confine one's mind to the ipsissima verba of the extract from the article in question found to be libellous but upon the language of the article as a whole and in the light of all the surrounding conditions and circumstances.\nI do not think that the language of the article when so viewed necessarily \"imputed personal knowledge and participation\" on the plaintiff's part in civic corruption and dishonesty or of a corrupt conspiracy of which the plaintiff was a party with regard to the affairs of the City of Edmonton.\nI fully agree with the statement of the learned judge (Mr. Justice Stuart) that\nwhen personal corruption is charged, there is no distinction between the plaintiff as an alderman and as a private citizen.\nWhere I cannot agree is in finding any charge of personal corruption at all.\nThe writer was referring to and considering the actions of \"the majority of the administration\" to which, it is true, the plaintiff was allied and with whom he as a rule voted. The learned judge himself says in his judgment:\u2014\nAfter an examination of the reports of the proceedings of the council, I am of the opinion that it could with some appearance of reason by a fair and honest though vigorous critic be argued that there was such an administration party and that the plaintiff at least supported it.\nI fully agree. I also concur generally in the reasons given by the learned judge for the conclusions reached by him and concurred in by the majority of the court with respect to all the other alleged libels that they did not exceed the bounds of legitimate criticism when read in the light of all the circumstances and should not be construed as \"imputing personal and corrupt intentions\" on the plaintiff's part. The learned judge says in his judgment;\nI think I can go a step further and also say that an assertion that there was such a party, that the plaintiff was a member of it, that the policy of the party was one of corruption and dishonesty would also not be a libel upon the plaintiff except by an innuendo that the plaintiff knowingly and consciously assisted and supported such a policy. Assuming personal innocence of any corrupt or dishonest motive on the part of the plaintiff, that is, personal ignorance of the real aims and purposes of his party, there could be nothing but legitimate and fair criticism and comment upon his action as a public man in charging him with supporting a party having such corrupt and dishonest purposes because, ex hypothesi, he would not be personally corrupt or dishonest, but only innocently mistaken in his course of action. The presence of an innuendo or personal knowledge and participation would in my opinion clearly be necessary before a charge against him of being a member of such a party could be considered libellous.\nAdopting and accepting as I do those reasons, however, I cannot concur in the conclusion reached by him respecting the article of the 2nd December. There is no charge that the plaintiff knowingly and consciously was a party to a corrupt conspiracy to defraud the city or that he personally was guilty of fraud or corruption. It was the \"administration\" of which the plaintiff was a member that was being attacked, not the plaintiff personally. He, it was argued, must be held responsible with the others comprising it for its acts and its policy. But to say that a member of a party must be held responsible for the acts of the administration he supports and to call that administration \"Tammany\" falls short in my judgment under such facts as are here disclosed of charging personal corruption and dishonesty.\nI frankly admit that it is difficult sometimes to draw the line between libel and fair and reasonable comment upon matters of public interest.\nIn the instance before us, I feel compelled to hold, largely for the reasons advanced by the learned judge who delivered the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal when deciding against the libellous character of all the other charges, that the article in question of the 2nd December did not under all the circumstances exceed the bounds of fair and legitimate criticism upon a matter of great public interest and did not impute to the plaintiff personal fraud or corruption in connection with the affairs of the city of which he was an alderman or that he \"had conspired with other members of the council to introduce and carry on in the City of Edmonton corrupt and unlawful practices.\"\nI think undue weight has been given to the use of the word \"Tammany\" in the libel complained of Years ago in the United States the word was in very bad odour especially in New York under the \"Boss\" governments so called of Tweed and some of his successors. But a construction seems to have been placed upon the meaning of the word in the libel complained of which it does not necessarily bear. It is argued that Tammany government means the practical and systematic application to civic government of the old party cry \"to the victors belong the spoils\" not only with regard to appointments to office but with respect to the letting and awarding of civic contracts. That may be so; the policy may be a very vicious one and may be carried out in ways the most objectionable and corrupt. But it does not necessarily follow that it must be corrupt and it certainly cannot be said that it involves personal charges against each and all of those who supported the administration so called \"Tammany.\" In fact, the defendant, when first charged with libel by the plaintiff, most emphatically disclaimed any intention of imputing personal corruption to the plaintiff or conspiracy on his part to abet, or procure, or maintain corruption If any such construction was put upon the language complained of, the defendant unequivocally repudiated it and expressed himself as willing and ready to make the most complete apology.\nThe substance of the charge was that the plaintiff as a public man and an alderman supported by his votes and maintained in power an administration that the paper held was corrupt\u2014not that he did so for any personal benefit or knowingly and consciously abetted and assisted and supported corruption in civic government.\nThe plaintiff, it must be remembered, was not before the electors for re-election. He had another year to serve as alderman. The articles were written to defeat the mayor, \"the Boss\" of the administration, and those members of it seeking re-election. Looking at the conditions and circumstances and atmosphere surrounding the publication of the article complained of, the relation of the plaintiff to the attack made, and the purpose and object of the writer, so far as I acting as a juryman can determine them, I conclude that the court below has placed a meaning upon the article which it does not reasonably bear and that under all the circumstances it does not exceed the bounds of fair comment and criticism, though it may be fairly argued that it reaches to those bounds.\nI would have been very much surprised if any independent witness, a citizen or resident of Edmonton, could have been found who would state that he understood the article to bear the meaning the learned judges determined it did.\nI need hardly say that no such witness was found.\nThe law on this important subject of fair comment as concisely stated in 18 Halsbury, at p. 711, is, I think, correct and is supported by authorities which will not be challenged.\nIt reads:\u2014\nThe defendant may nevertheless succeed on his plea of fair comment if he shews that the imputation of which the plaintiff complains, although defamatory, and although not proved to have been true, yet was an imputation in a matter of public interest, made fairly and bond fide as the honest expression of the opinion which the defendant held upon the facts truly stated, and was in the opinion of the jury warranted by the facts, in the sense that a fair minded man might upon those facts bond fide hold that opinion.\nThe conclusions inferred as matters of opinion have not to be proved as facts and on the issue of fair comment the mental attitude of the commentator is immaterial.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent was an alderman of the City of Edmonton when the appellant as the publisher of a newspaper called. \"The Bulletin,\" in evident anticipation of the annual city election, attacked in five different articles the conduct of the mayor and city council in relation to their management of the city's municipal government.\nThe respondent complained of these articles in an action tried in Edmonton before Mr. Justice Ives without a jury and he dismissed the action.\nUpon an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Alberta that judgment was reversed and judgment entered for $450 damages and costs.\nThe opinion judgment of the majority of the court held that each one of the first three of said articles, taken by itself, was not libellous under the circumstances, but that the fourth, published on the 2nd of December, was so. The part of the article which Mr. Justice Stuart, writing the majority judgment, quotes and relies upon is as follows:\u2014\nThe members of the council (clearly referring to the plaintiff among others) who were so careful not to let a printing contract of $10,000 or $12,000 get by their friends will have to do a lot of explanation to satisfy the men who had to stint their families in order to get their taxes paid by last Monday afternoon that their split on the paving contracts running into the hundreds of thousands was for the protection of the city's interest and not because of a split as to a possible rake-off * * * We have had one year of Tammany. We can't stand another.\nThe formal judgment of the court is expressed in general terms and makes no distinction between the several counts (if I may be permitted to use the old fashioned term) in the statement of claim. But in the argument of counsel before us, it seemed to be conceded that the judgment appealed from must rest upon this paragraph alone.\nThe innuendo thereto in the statement of claim is as follows:\u2014\nmeaning thereby that the plaintiff conspired with other members of the council of the City of Edmonton to conduct the business of the city so as to secure private ends instead of the public good and to introduce and carry out in the City of Edmonton corrupt and unlawful practices usually associated with the name of \"Tammany.\"\nNo witness was called to support this innuendo and we are left to conjecture.\nI am unable from reading that article, indeed all the articles in their entirety, to attach any such meaning as Mr. Justice Stuart places thereon.\nI think we must look at all the facts and read all the articles and understand so far as we can the situation with which the writer of the article is dealing before we can even approximately reach a correct interpretation of this paragraph.\nThe article was largely based on the action, or want of action, on the part of the mayor and those in the council usually supporting him. The respondent would have us believe he was a man of independent action in everything and not tainted with the common frailty of uniting with others to push forward any agreed on policy.\nHe seems to have been a respectable man who was nominated on a municipal ticket along with the mayor, and that ticket seems to have carried at the election in December, 1913, for the part of the council of 1914 to be then elected.\nHis knowledge of his colleagues was, according to his own story, so slight that I infer he knew little of Edmonton's chosen people.\nIndeed he seems to have been such a stranger that I doubt if he could ever have been elected but by reason of his being placed on their ticket or some one else's ticket.\nAnd at the organization of the council for the coming year, he was kindly taken by the hand on the part of those on whose ticket he was elected, and selected as one of the chosen three to strike the standing committees for the year.\nThat labour, he tells us, was not very arduous, for when he retired to a room with the other two, who were certainly then friends of the mayor, he found the lists all ready. All he had to do was to assent, and he instantly assented accordingly.\nHow could a stranger given a place on two committees, when some had to be satisfied with only one place, refuse to thus assent? Or had he been consulted beforehand?\nCertainly if we analyse the composition of the committees thus struck and bear in mind so much of the council's doings as presented to us, someone close to the mayor had been consulted, unless we attribute the result of these labours to some miraculous inspiration.\nAs any one of experience knows, the formation of these committees was perhaps the most important step of the year, either to promote the general good or the strengthening the hands of the mayor, or someone else, bent on dominating the council. Hence the due preparation of the lists of men constituting the needed committees. There is much in the result arrived at which shews the mayor had a policy of his own and saw to it he could control things generally as he desired.\nThe respondent, later, on the 3rd of February, although on two committees already, was chosen as a member of the Health and Safety Committee, when a Mr. Calder, of whose position as one of the opposition to the administration party there seems to have been no doubt, had resigned from that committee.\nIn light of the foregoing and what I am about to advert to, I think ordinary people, only conversant with ordinary actions of public men and their associates, would be quite justified in assuming and saying that the respondent was looked upon, by the other supporters of the administration, as a general supporter thereof. And as such men often know a man better than he knows himself, they might be quite justified in setting him down as such.\nThe organization for business seemed according to practice and policy to require commissioners to be appointed of whom each was in charge of the department allotted to him. This year, there were four such salaried officers of whom one was supposed to be under the Safety and Health Committee which had to deal with the police department. Perhaps it would be more correct to say the committee was under the commissioner. The commissioner assigned to the charge of the police was one that respondent had voted to place there.\nThe chief of police, an excellent officer, it is admitted, at the dictation of the mayor, was driven out of the service, and step by step the condition of things became so disgraceful that there was an outburst of public indignation early in February.\nThe respondent admits having heard on the 1st of January and perhaps before, that prostitution was on the increase in the city. Mr. Justice Scott reports that the general increase of crime, which is the usual accompaniment of such a condition, is not traceable till about early February and so continued until the investigation.\nThe most pitiable thing in this case is the respondent's story of all he ever did to put a stop to this carnival of vice that Mr. Justice Scott's report sets forth as existent.\nHe voted for an investigation and brought a trifling incident or two to the notice of the commissioner besides asking him to restore a respectable policeman who had been dismissed.\nIf he had no more force of character than to rest satisfied with that course of conduct and serve on that committee in silence, as he seems to have done for four months, whilst the criminal part of the population were having a fine time, under the policy of the administration of the city, I assume he is, by reason of his thus lending his respectability for others to hide behind, not entitled to complain of being treated as one of the mayor's supporters.\nIt likely never would have been necessary to hold any expensive judicial inquiry such as began in the following June after four months of agitation, had the respondent, and such as he, done their whole duty.\nTo remain almost dumb in such a position as he was given at the hands of the mayor and his friends was in my opinion an unworthy toleration of evil policies that was deserving of criticism and censure.\nIf not an active pandering to the desires of the seamy side of social life, it is a policy likely to reap its reward from that side, in kindly remembrance at election times.\nIf that is not in accord with just what \"Tammany\" sometimes stands for in popular estimation and expression, I misunderstand the term.\nNeither Tammany nor any other organization ever sinks so low as to be in action wholly wicked or composed entirely of wicked men. The most deplorable thing about what Tammany and its like are betimes supposed to stand for, is the facility with which respectable men lend their support to those dragging down what was originally respectable. Alone they would be powerless. The aid of respectable men willing to give their countenance to those of evil mind is the menace of what may ultimately destroy free institutions.\nIt need not necessarily be a slavish and unfaltering support but yet enough to lend aid and encouragement to that combination of men who are pursuing an evil or dangerous policy which entitles the press to classify them as of that party or faction and subject to more or less severe criticism as the occasion calls for.\nThere are several incidents in the later development of the municipal management by the mayor and those supporting him, in which the respondent voted with them, which formed the subject of some of these attacks complained of. These incidents furnish concrete illustrations, either of the party alliance of respondent with the administration party (or faction as he on examination for discovery designated the parties in the council) or an identical conception of duty in given crucial tests of the principles which guided him as an alderman in the discharge of his duty. In either alternative he does not seem to me to have any right to complain of his classification by the writer of the articles, if his votes on these occasions reflect his views of public duty.\nThe mayor conceived the idea that the slow method of voting the moneys which lent itself to obstructing the aims and desires of the administration should be swept away and power sought to constitute a two million dollar fund for the council to draw upon, and for this proposal the respondent voted. It was adopted in haste and without due consideration submitted to the electors who refused their assent.\nThey were entitled to have the fullest consideration thereof by the council before being called upon to vote. They were entitled to assume that the council had only after such consideration decided to recommend the adoption of such a scheme before putting the city to the expense of such an election. Moreover they were entitled to look to these chosen men for guidance.\nI am unable to justify the method of the submission or to understand how such risks as involved in the adoption of the scheme, liable to be operated by the men who had brought disgrace upon the city through the mismanagement of police affairs, could properly be supported by any one possessing the experience of that mismanagement, yet respondent tells us he was independent in so acting. There is another concrete illustration of how the administration acted and in doing so got the support of the respondent in a way of which the objectionable feature is easily understood. I refer to the letting of a contract for printing the telephone directory.\nThree tenders were the same on one basis affording greater service than a fourth for a less figure. It seems the superintendent selected that, of the three first named, given by the Esdale Press which had given satisfactory service. It is charged that the difference between that tender and the one favoured meant a loss to the city of $1,700, or, in another way of putting it, possibly $2,000 to $2,500. I cannot find these figures verified. But that there was a loss does not seem to be seriously denied.\nThe civic commissioners were approached by the printing company writing a letter and pointing out some things which possibly entitled it to some consideration from the point of view which had been taken earlier in the year.\nAnd it then ended the letter thus:\u2014\nIt is the aim of the printers of the city to see the work equally distributed so that the condition of affairs that obtained during 1913, in which year the Bulletin Job or Esdale Press obtained seven-eighths of the city's printing does not occur again.\nWe favour the distribution of the city's printing on the pay roll basis and are anxious to include the Esdale Press in a just distribution, but we feel that the letting to one firm of a contract that is likely to reach the $12,000 mark is putting the whole matter back where it was in 1913. Being taxpayers and employers of labor we feel that your Commission Board will see the justice of this course.\nThe council ultimately adopted this scheme in substance and the respondent supported it. It seems to me a most vicious principle of action on the part of the majority, including the respondent.\nIf proper to apply any such rule to printers why not extend it to contractors of every kind giving the city a supply of labour and material? And the same mode of reasoning would shut out all outside contractors. The printing or other contractors would no doubt thus get better prices and all classes so involved would if the scheme of division were fairly conducted have reason to rejoice. But what of the rest of the ratepayers who would not fall within the contracting classes yet had to help foot the bills in their taxes?\nThis, as I understand it, is alleged to be a leading feature of what is sometimes offensively referred to as the \"Tammany System.\"\nThe reward the respectable alderman gets is electoral support and the baser elements occasionally get a something more commonly called a \"rake off.\"\nThe adoption of such a method is doubly offensive in the case of the printers publishing newspapers. He who saps the independence of the press is the worst corrupter of the people in any community.\nThe amount involved in this case was small, but well tended and cared for the plant would grow.\nYet it is to the article complained of herein which trenchantly criticised this conduct of the majority, including respondent, responsible for the adoption of such methods, in dealing with the printing for the city, that the judgment below refers in order to find the meaning of the language used.\nIn the paragraphs I have quoted above as that upon which the judgment rests there is blended an allusion to this very transaction and to a something else I am about to deal with and explain how I understand it and the allusion respecting it.\nSo far as the paragraph alludes to the printing business I hold the appellant has amply maintained its plea of justification. The \"split on the paving contracts running into the hundreds of thousands,\" etc., cannot be understood without bearing in mind what is sworn to have taken place.\nIt was proven and not denied in argument that there were such paving contracts before the council in April, and that in relation thereto there seemed to have been some split, or division of opinion let us put it, between some members of the council usually referred to as the administration or its supporters or as a faction.\nThe result of that difference of opinion led the mayor to publish in a local newspaper an interview giving, as I infer from the evidence, his justification of some proposal to withdraw the proposed paving contracts. In that interview he had referred to \"a gang of wolves\" and as a result thereof no doubt there was much speculation as to who composed the \"gang of wolves.\"\nIt is proven that, following that publication, Alderman Driscoll, up to then a steady supporter of the mayor, demanded, in council, an explanation from the mayor of whom he referred to, that the mayor refused and Driscoll left and said he would not attend till an explanation was forthcoming and ceased to attend council meetings for some weeks thereafter.\nHe did come back again though no explanation was offered so far as the public knew.\nWhat was the meaning of all this? There certainly had been a grave difference of opinion and rupture of some kind between those concerned and it was a matter well deserving of criticism. Indeed, an investigation of some kind would have been in order but respondent did not move for it. The city's charter provides for several methods of investigation including a committee of the council and when respondent failed to move, he cannot have treated the matter so seriously as the Court of Appeal has done.\nAll the paragraph, upon which the judgment rests, says and means in that regard is that the electors were entitled to think in view of the printing contract business, and the mode of dealing with it, that there was a something in the split not merely for the protection of the city's interests, but because of a split as to a possible rake off. By whom that was expected is not stated. It certainly could not be by all, else there could have been no split. It certainly indicated something that those concerned had no desire to have cleared up. It did not involve the mayor for it is he that made the accusation.\nYet I most respectfully submit that he could maintain an action upon this paragraph by the same reasoning as the judgment puts forward to maintain that of the respondent.\nAll said therein relative to the \"gang of wolves\" cannot found any action. Indeed, no one seems at the trial to have supposed so. The respondent's answer as to it does not indicate he had any grievance as to it. But as to the printing business he assumed a different attitude and says there was nothing wrong in it he ever knew of. I differ from him for the reasons already stated.\nI therefore cannot find anything in the paragraph but criticism of facts, well and amply proven and deserving what was said and needed to be said in the interest of the public.\nThere are many other illustrations of the curious views held by some of those concerned of their public duty in transacting the city's business needless to dwell upon.\nMoreover, it is to be observed that the appellant in the very article complained of set forth many of these cases as well as those I have mentioned and gave the division lists upon them, wherefrom the reader could see wherein the respondent occasionally opposed his colleagues, and whether or not he was in serious or important matters generally of the party supporting the administration.\nEven if there had been something more than appears in the case as a whole when a learned trial judge has had before him the man and the situation during a long trial, as the learned trial judge here had, and he dismissed such an action, his finding should not, I respectfully submit, be lightly set aside.\nIf it had been the verdict of a jury, it must have stood unimpeachable.\nIn a case of this kind where the defendant had given in the strongest terms an explanation that should remove all suspicion of personal dishonesty and pointed out that anything said was relative to his public acts and these acts are plain and palpable so that any one reading can tell whether or not the criticism is fair and it is found by a learned judge fair, it should rest there.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs. The primary tribunal in this instance was a judge without a jury; but that does not, in my judgment, in the circumstances of this case, greatly affect the principle upon which the verdict should be dealt with. It is impossible fairly to construe the publications of which the respondent complains without reference to the circumstances existing in Edmonton and to the atmosphere in which the articles were published and read. Having regard to the facts which were notorious and in the light of which the public would read the articles the learned trial judge might, I think, reasonably hold the expressions which the Court of Appeal held to be actionable to be a not unreasonable comment upon the conduct of the group of municipal politicians controlling in part, at least, through the plaintiff's assistance, the municipal administrative machinery which was notoriously exerting its authority and influence in ways tending to destroy respect for the law and to propagate public immorality.\nThe conduct of this group, when considered as a whole as exhibited in the evidence, gave too much ground to suspect some of its members of designs in relation to the municipal finances; strong language with regard to the group as a group was both natural and justifiable; and I am by no means satisfied that the learned trial judge was wrong in holding that the plaintiff was not charged with anything more disgraceful than giving his support generally to this ring \u2014and by means of that support enabling it on critical occasions to retain control\u2014a charge proved in fact to have been true.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting)\u2014The holder of an elective public office seeks damages from the proprietor of a newspaper for the publication of a series of articles which he alleges contained libellous statements in regard to his discharge of the duties of his office. The defences set up are \"no libel\" and \"fair comment.\" In dealing with such a case two dangers confront the courts, which are veritably a Scylla and a Charybdis. On the one hand the right of fair comment on the conduct of public business must not be so restricted that one of the chief instruments for protection against corruption and maladministration in public affairs will be rendered impotent. The publicist who attacks corruption and incompetence in the conduct of public business and has the courage, when justified by facts, to say to a guilty public representative \"Thou art the man,\" should have the assurance that he can rely upon the courts to protect him against the blackmail of the unmeritorious action for libel. On the other hand, a newspaper writer cannot be allowed, under the cloak of fair comment, to make with impunity against a public man in regard to the transaction of public affairs, charges which are not merely untrue but for which there is in fact no foundation on which they could reasonably be based and the libellous character of which, if made against the same man in regard to the administration of a private trust committed to him, no one would dream of questioning. By permitting such libels on public men to pass without condemnation the courts would not only discourage the citizen who esteems his good reputation at its true value and is properly sensitive to attacks upon it from undertaking public office, but would go far towards stamping with approval the wholly vicious idea that the conduct of public business is not subject to the same code of morals as that which governs the performance of fiduciary duties in private life.\nWhat else is meant by the contention, thinly veiled, if at all, that, while such conduct is \"reprehensible,\" so long as the writer abstains from suggesting the motive of personal pecuniary profit or advantage, it is not libellous to charge an alderman with having been a party to the manipulation of contracts involving the expenditure of civic funds \"with a view to securing the interests of 'the boss' and his friends rather than those of the city\"\u2014\"with a view to private profit rather than civic gain,\" and in such a manner that \"the taxes are made to pay for the votes which keep the controlling majority in their places as aldermen?\" What other significance has an \"apology\" in which, after setting forth the following paragraph from the notice served complaining of the alleged libel:\u2014\nThe statements complained of are false and malicious and are libels upon Mr. Sheppard in that they falsely charge him with being guilty of the crime and offence of aiding, abetting and protecting crime and criminals, encouraging and protecting vice, and as an alderman, conspiring with others to introduce and carry out in the City of Edmonton corrupt and unlawful practices usually associated with the name of \"Tammany,\" and in that they falsely charge him with fraudulent, dishonest and dishonourable conduct and motives as an alderman of the City of Edmonton, and by the production of the findings of Judge Scott and otherwise attempt to prove the truth of the statements against him,\nthe writer, while disclaiming an intention to reflect on the personal character or motives of Mr. Rice Sheppard, and withdrawing and expressing regret for the publication of any statement which could be reasonably so construed, asserts, as to Alderman Sheppard, the right \"to take an entirely different stand,\" adding:\u2014\nIt is not necessary to reiterate the statement of the Bulletin's position regarding the results of Tammany administration or its membership.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Stuart that\nIt is fallacious to say that any man leaves behind his personal character when he enters public life by accepting an office of honour, or that he can be safely though untruthfully accused of dishonesty and corruption merely because it can be pleaded that he was being referred to in his capacity as a public man. A man's moral character is the same whether in private or public life and is in, either case equally entitled to the protection of the law from libellous attacks.\nA homily on false standards of morality in public life is not the purpose of these observations. They are intended merely to indicate the point of view from which, in my opinion, the consideration of the case at bar should be approached.\nI agree with the learned judges of the Appellate Division that their function in dealing with an action for libel tried by a judge without a jury is the same as in any other case where that has been the mode of trial. Our statutory duty is to give the judgment which they should have given.\nThe inquiry with which we are immediately concerned is whether the judgment of the Appellate Division holding that the Bulletin Company had libelled the plaintiff Sheppard is right or wrong. Did that company's newspaper charge the plaintiff with having been guilty of the gross breach of the public trust committed to him as an alderman which conscious participation in the handling of municipal affairs and the awarding of civic contracts for the purposes above indicated would involve? Upon the facts in evidence is such a charge defensible as \"fair comment?\"\nI put aside the alleged libels on the plaintiff in connection with matters dealt with by the report made by Mr. Justice Scott, who had held a judicial investigation into the manner in which the \"social evil\" had been dealt with by the city council and the police of Edmonton. In this particular, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, the majority of the judges of the Appellate Court held that what the defendant company had published, though no doubt perilously near the line in view of the attitude of the plaintiff upon that question, did not exceed the bounds of fair comment because in their opinion\nfairly and fully read in the light of all the circumstances (it) could not be taken as imputing (to the plaintiff) a personal and corrupt intention to encourage vice and crime.\nMr. Justice Beck thought otherwise. I am not prepared to hold that the conclusion of the majority on this branch of the case was so clearly wrong that we should reverse it.\nA civic election took place in Edmonton on the 14th of December, 1914. At the same time the question whether a new charter introducing municipal government by a commission should be sought from the legislature was submitted to the electors. The plaintiff had been elected in December, 1913, as alderman for a term of two years and was therefore not a candidate for election in December, 1914. The defendant affirmed in its statement of defence, and (speaking generally) I think it proved, that during the year 1914 the affairs of the city had been controlled by a \"party\" in the city council which usually supported Mayor MacNamara and comprised a majority of the members, including the plaintiff, and that this \"party\" was known as the MacNamara administration.\nThe publication of the series of articles in which the alleged libels appeared began on the 21st of November, 1914. I make extracts from them, necessarily somewhat copious, confined however to the portions relevant to the crucial question whether they charge the plaintiff with having committed the gross breaches of public trust in regard to civic expenditure outlined above. The passages set forth in the statement of claim and alleged to contain this charge are italicized. In his plea the defendant has claimed\u2014and it is his right\u2014that the series of articles should be read and considered as a whole. I have so dealt with them.\nAn article, published on the 21st of November, contains these passages:\u2014\nThe Bulletin has received from W. H. Todd, secretary of the \"Charter Committee,\" what the committee is pleased to call \"an open challenge\" to W. T. Henry, Hon. Frank Oliver, James Douglas, M.P., George S. Armstrong (postmaster), A. F. Ewing, M.P.P., Dr. H. R. Smith (deputy mayor), and W. J. Magrath, to debate the question: \"Shall Edmonton adopt Elective Commission Government as provided in the new charter upon which the electors will vote on December 14th?\" Evidently the charter committee is looking for a line of advertising that will achieve the main purpose they have in view\u2014namely, to take public attention away from the matter that is of immediate and pressing concern by directing it towards a subject that is at the moment rather of academic than of practical interest.\n* * *\nThe men who bedevilled the city's affairs during the current year are the men who are shouting for a new franchise and a new form of government. If there had been another or any other form of city government that they had control of, would the results have been different? Would the election of Messrs. McNamara, Clarke, East, May, Driscoll, Kinney and Sheppard, or any five of them as commissioners, with absolute and arbitrary power to do just what they pleased, have made them do any less harm than they did when they had control by being a majority of the council?\nWould they have been less likely to use the taxpayers' money to build up a Tammany organization on strictly New York lines?\nHaving been served on behalf of the plaintiff and others with notices of their intention to bring actions for libel on account of these statements in the article of the 21st of November, and others not now relevant, the defendant, on the 28th of November, published another article from which I extract the following passages:\u2014\nTAMMANY SHOWS ITS TEETH.\nAldermen Sheppard, Driscoll and Kinney give notice of libel suits against the Bulletin, while Alderman Clarke threatens the \"Unwritten Law\" against Rev. Stewart\u2014a new way of establishing confidence in the good faith and fair play of the Tammany candidates.\nThere is just one specific statement in the extract complained of:\u2014 \"The men who bedevilled the city's affairs during the current year are the men who are shouting for a new franchise and a new form of government.\" If the three martyrs take exception to this statement, the public will be delighted to hear from them or their colleagues now offering for election in what particular it is not correct and the Bulletin will be pleased to retract, apologize and pay costs to date if it can be shown not to be true in substance and in fact, or not to have been made purely in the public interest. Messrs. Sheppard, Driscoll and Kinney will surely not deny that the city's affairs have been \"bedevilled\" during the current year. Neither can they successfully deny that they formed part of the council majority that controlled civic affairs during that part of the year when the \"bedevilling\" was done.\nThe members constituting that majority are mentioned for the sole purpose of fixing in the public mind the fact that there was a definite majority\u2014as it could not be definitely fixed in any other way\u2014and not with any intent of reflecting upon their personal characters, action, or motives or the personal characters, actions, or motives of any one of them. In no way can the extract be fairly construed as such a reflection except in so far as the personal character of a public servant may be affected by his public actions, or the result of actions or failure to act for which he as a public servant is responsible.\nIf it is not the duty as well as the privilege of the press to criticize the results of the administration of public affairs by the elected representatives of the people, and to fix responsibility for acts of administration and their results upon the men from time to time elected or seeking election, we have passed from a condition of democratic government to that of irresponsible tyranny, which is none the less tyranny because it has the sanction of law\u2014if it has that sanction.\nAn article of Dec. 1st opened as follows:\u2014\nHOW TAMMANY BUYS CONTROL OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE PEOPLE'S MONEY.\nTammany tactics are the methods by which the taxes of the city are made to pay for the votes which keep the members of the controlling majority in their places as aldermen. That is, money is paid out for work or material, either directly as wages or for purchases, or by the awarding of contracts to such persons and in such manner as may be expected to ensure their support and the use of their influence at the polls for the aldermen who do the bidding of the \"boss\" at the council board.\nIn the first place, the business of the city is dealt with as being the business of the \"boss,\" not of the citizens, and in the second place it is directed with a view to securing the interests of the boss and his friends rather than those of the city. When the city's business is handled with a view to private profit rather than civic gain it is inevitable that it is not well done, or not done at all, while the city's money is spent and the city's credit destroyed.\nThe article proceeds to deal with steps taken in the council which resulted in the awarding to the Edmonton Printing and Publishing Company of a large printing contract for work which had previously been done by The Bulletin Job, or Esdale Press, Aldermen Clarke, Kinney, Sheppard and Driscoll having supported the change. The article proceeds:\u2014\nThe foregoing recital of facts shews that the contract for telephone directory was:\u2014\nNot let to the firm which could give the most' efficient service.\nNot let to the firm that tendered at the lowest price.\nThat the Tammany majority in the council took out of the hands of the commissioners the letting of this and other contracts because they were determined they should go to the firms that could and would be of most advantage to them in the coming elections without regard to the interests of the city.\nThe Esdale Press was absolutely boycotted from city work from May 1st until November 1st for no other known reason than that the Bulletin company held a part of the stock in the Esdale Press and the Bulletin did not support the administration. No doubt the Bulletin could have traded its support of the interests of the city and of common decency for fat printing contracts for the Esdale Press, but neither the Bulletin nor the Esdale Press are in that line of business.\nIn this connection it is in order to point out that the evident reason why the Tammany majority was so insistent that the telephone directory contract should go to the Edmonton Printing and Publishing Company was because there is produced in the office of that company the only surviving representative of journalistic thuggery in the city since the decease of the Official Gazette and the Daily Capital. No doubt the grass has been short in recent weeks, and unless the city till could be tapped it would have to follow its late confreres, and Tammany would have been without an instrument of ruffianism with which it might hope to frighten off criticism and opposition at the polls, during the present contest.\nTammany always works for Tammany, and the joke is that the taxpayer \"pays the freight.\"\nAn article of Dec. 2nd, contained the following:\u2014\nWHO is TAMMANY?\nWhy did it split\u2014And, Why Again Unite?\nWe have government by majority in Edmonton civic affairs. A majority of the electors voting elect the council. A majority of the Council hires or fires the commissioners, appoints the committees, votes the estimates, passes by-laws, and generally governs the city. The mayor is the administrative head of the city government and the members of the council usually acting with him form the majority that enables him to carry out his policy and constitute the \"administration.\" If the administration is conducted on Tammany principles and for Tammany purposes\u2014that is, to secure private ends instead of the public good\u2014the members of the council who usually form part of the administration majority are properly responsible to the people for what is done and for the results of its being done. It is not necessary, nor would it be advisable, that the supporters of the administration should always vote together. So long as enough of them vote together to maintain Tammany control of the city's affairs, it diverts public attention from the true conditions if from time to time one or another votes the other way\u2014assumedly for reasons of principle.\nThe aldermen who always voted against the mayor's proposals are of course not members of the \"administration\" or Tammany, and are not responsible for the mayor's policy or its results.\nThe Bulletin is now being threatened with three actions for libel because it intimated that Mayor McNamara and Aldermen Clarke, East, Driscoll, Sheppard, Kinney and May were, as members of the administrative majority, responsible for the condition of city morals and finances. As to whether there was or was not such a majority and whether these men or any of them were members of it, it is necessary to go to the records.\nThe writer then gives what purports to be an analysis of votes in council during the year to demonstrate the existence of an administration party of which the plaintiff was a member. The analysis includes this paragraph:\u2014\nOn April 29th, the administration apparently split on the question of paving. The mayor's proposal to drop the entire paving programme was opposed in discussion by Driscoll and Sheppard. Later Driscoll ceased attending the sittings of the council, pending explanations by Mayor McNamara as to who were members of the \"gang of wolves\" to whom he had alluded in a published interview. Still later Driscoll again attended council meetings without any public explanation, such as he had demanded.\nContinuing, the writer says:\nIt will be noted that although Messrs. Sheppard, Driscoll and Kinney from time to time voted against the administration, of all the instances mentioned above only in the case of the motion to withdraw the three money by-laws did the vote of any one of the three prevent the will of the administration from being carried out. On that occasion, the mayor\u2014the then boss\u2014was absent which no doubt accounted for the error. Or it may have been to shew the acting mayor that although acting mayor, he was not actually \"boss.\"\nNothing more seems to be necessary to shew that there was an administrative majority at the council board until the time came for awarding the paving contracts. The paving contracts ran into a great deal of money, and amongst a large number of paving contractors there is always a possibility that one or more may be approachable. The members of the council who were so careful not to let a printing contract of ten or twelve thousand dollars get by their friends will have to do a lot of explanation to satisfy the men who had to stint their families in order to get their taxes paid by last Monday afternoon that their split on the paving contracts, running into the hundreds of thousands, was for the protection of the city's interests and not because of a split as to a possible rake-off. Mayor McNamara's reference to his efforts to protect the city against a \"gang of wolves\" in connection with the paving contract still stands without public explanation to the man who publicly held himself to be affronted by it. We have Mayor McNamara's word that there was a \"gang of wolves.\" His statement has not yet been challenged. He and his colleagues are the men who ought to know\u2014and evidently they do know. We have had one year of Tammany. We can't stand another.\nOn Dec. 5th appeared an article intituled\nAN APOLOGY, TWO LETTERS and CIVIC COMMENT.\nApology to Mr. Rice Sheppard.\nThis apology has been already noticed. The article concludes with this paragraph:\u2014\nIt is not necessary to reiterate the statement of the Bulletin's position regarding the results of Tammany administration or its membership. Alderman Sheppard and his advisers are necessarily aware that the present general financial stringency affects the newspapers, as well as other lines of business. They know that one daily paper in Edmonton has recently suspended and that those which remain have to struggle to keep their heads above water. At such a time it has no doubt been figured out by Tammany that the Bulletin could be made to \"lie down\" during the civic elections, if plenty of libel suits were threatened or brought. The Bulletin has been in business for some years in Edmonton. During those years it has maintained a measure of reputation for dealing with public affairs from the standpoint of the public interest, frequently at considerable risk and cost. A libel suit is a serious matter under present conditions. But the most valuable part of the capital of a newspaper is its reputation. The Bulletin is placed in the position that it stands to lose either capital or reputation, if Alderman Sheppard can use the courts of the country to that end. Under all the circumstances it will have to take a chance on losing the capital, rather than the reputation. How far the citizens will on the 14th condone a system of terrorism ranging from threats of the \"unwritten law\"' to libel suits, as a means of preventing criticism and deterring opposition to Tammany and its candidates, remains to be seen.\nAt the trial the president of the defendant company in his evidence gave a definition of the word \"Tammany\" similar to that above quoted from the article of the 1st of December. That word as used in the articles complained of probably required neither innuendo nor definition to make plain and obvious its defamatory signification. If a glossary were necessary the defendant supplied it in the article of the 1st of December. After having read and reread the articles complained of I entertain no doubt that they charge the defendant pointedly and directly with having been a member of a \"Tammany\" party in the city council, which had had control of civic affairs for the current year\u2014that they thereby charge him with having, as a member of that party, pursued\nmethods by which the taxes of the city (were) made to pay for the votes which (would) keep the members of the controlling majority (the Tammany party) in their places as aldermen,\nwith having \"dealt with\" the business of the city\nas being the business of the \"boss\" (the mayor; see article Dec. 2nd), not of the citizens,\nwith having aided in directing the conduct of civic business\nwith a view to securing the interests of the boss and his friends rather than those of the city,\nand with having been a participant in handling\nthe city's business * * * with a view to private (whose?) profit rather than civic gain.\nAfter having on the 1st of December explicitly stated that the Tammany majority in the council (including the plaintiff) had manipulated a large printing contract and other contracts to the prejudice financially and otherwise of the city,\nbecause they were determined they should go to the firms that could and would be of most advantage to them in the coming elections without regard to the interests of the city,\nand having added an insinuation of direct corruption by saying,\nno doubt the Bulletin could have traded its support of the interests of the city and of common decency for fat printing contracts for the Esdale Press, but neither the Bulletin nor the Esdale Press are in that line of business,\nin its article of the 2nd of December it pointed out that the plaintiff and Alderman Driscoll had opposed a proposal of the mayor in regard to paving contracts and then proceeded to suggest that the\nsplit on the paving contracts, running into the hundreds of thousands,\nwas not\nfor the protection of the city's interest but because of a split as to a possible rake-off.\nThe indirect form adopted by the writer takes nothing from the force of the charge thus made. It rather serves to emphasize it. This same article had stated that\nthe administration apparently split on the question of paving,\nthis observation having been preceded by another\u2014\nIt is not necessary\u2014nor would it be advisable\u2014that the supporters of the administration should always vote together. So long as enough of them vote together to maintain Tammany control of the city's affairs, it diverts public attention from the true conditions if from time to time one or another votes the other way\u2014assumedly for reasons of principle.\nThe innuendo at the close of the 5th paragraph of the statement of claim.\nthat the plaintiff conspired with other members of the council of the City of Edmonton to conduct the business of the city so as to secure private ends instead of the public good and to introduce and carry out in the City of Edmonton corrupt and unlawful practices usually associated with the name of Tammany\nis fully warranted by the terms of the articles complained of. Indeed they are not susceptible of any other interpretation, and the innuendo was probably quite superfluous. Evidence to prove it was certainly not required. I agree with Mr. Justice Stuart that\u2014\nThere can in this matter be no way open for an interpretation which would not impute personal knowledge and participation. And when personal corruption is charged there is no difference between the plaintiff as an alderman and as a private citizen.\nIf what the defendant published of the plaintiff was not defamatory and libellous, written words which expose the plaintiff to hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy\nhas ceased to be an accurate definition of libel or is inapplicable where the plaintiff happens to be a public man.\nBut it is claimed for the defendant that the matter complained of is merely \"fair comment,\" consisting not of bare allegations of fact but either of mere expressions of opinion honestly held or of statements fairly made of inferences or deductions reasonably drawn from facts.\nThe statements complained of in my opinion cannot properly be regarded as mere, expressions of opinion or as inferences drawn by the writer. They amount to allegations of disgraceful and corrupt conduct by the plaintiff and of grave and wilful breaches of the trust committed to him as an alderman in consciously and deliberately participating in the misuse of public moneys. Davis v. Shepstone[2].\nNo attempt was made to prove facts from which the truth of any of the charges might possibly be a reasonable inference. No evidence was given that civic money had been expended corruptly or dishonestly for private gain; no testimony that a single contract had been given for improper motives or otherwise than in what might fairly be regarded as the best interests of the city. There was not a shred of proof of a rake-off or of a conspiracy to blind public opinion by \"apparent\" splits. Nothing in the nature of \"a Tammany organization on strictly New York lines\" was shewn to have existed.\nMoreover, statements of fact and comment are so intermingled in the matter complained of that it would be difficult for any reader to discern what purports to be the one and what the other. Hunt v. Star Newspaper Co.[3].\nBut if the statements in question could be regarded as merely expressions of opinion or of inferences and therefore comment, they appear to lack the necessary quality of good faith and to go far beyond a fair expression of a reasonable inference from any facts, which the evidence establishes, to have been truly stated. They indicate an absence of that \"honest sense of justice\" and of that \"reasonable degree of judgment and moderation\" on the part of the critic which are essential to sustain a plea of fair comment. Wason v. Walter[4].\nIn this connection our attention is drawn to the fact that the so-called administration party had diverted from the \"Bulletin Job or Esdale Press\" some large and, no doubt, profitable printing contracts. But even a person who has a spite against another or who feels that he has been grievously wronged by such other may bring a dispassionate judgment to bear upon a discussion of his work as a public representative. Thomas v. Bradbury Co.[5]. No doubt that is scarcely probable; and, where the imputation of evil motives and the suggestion of deliberate breach of public trust is made so persistently as it was in the articles now under review and rests upon so little of proven fact, the suspicion that the writer was actuated by malice is necessarily grave. I prefer, however, to rest my rejection of the defence of fair comment in this case on the ground that the statements complained of cannot be regarded as mere expressions of opinion and that no facts have been established from which an inference could reasonably be drawn that the plaintiff's actions as an alderman had been influenced by the wicked motives and dishonourable purpose imputed to him. Dakhyl v. Labouch\u00e8re[6].\nNo doubt a personal attack which imputes base and sinister motives is not necessarily and as a matter of law outside the limits of fair comment, ibid. But\none man has no right to impute to another whose conduct may be fairly open to ridicule or disapprobation base, sordid and wicked motives unless there is so much ground for the imputation that a jury shall find not only that he had an honest belief in the truth of his statements but that his belief was not without foundation * * * It is not because a public writer fancies the conduct of a public man is open to the suspicion of dishonesty, he is therefore justified in assailing his character as dishonest * * * Campbell v. Spottiswoode[7].\nIt is always to be left to a jury to say whether the publication has gone beyond the limits of a fair comment on the subject-matter discussed. A writer is not entitled to overstep those limits and impute base and sordid motives which are not warranted by the facts, and I cannot for a moment think that, because he has a bona fide belief that he is publishing what is true, that is any answer to an action for libel: ibid., p. 778: Merivale v. Carson[8].\nHe may not make statements which \"convey imputations of evil sort\" not warranted by the facts truly stated. Joynt v. Cycle Trade Publishing Co.[9]; Walker v. Hodgson[10]. That which the defendant seeks to justify as comment was, in my opinion, neither fair nor such as might reasonably be made under the circumstances. There are no facts in evidence which would warrant any man in attributing to the plaintiff that he had participated in the expenditure of civic funds \"with a view to private profit rather than civic gain\"\u2014that he had knowingly aided in directing the conduct of civic business \"with a view to securing the interests of the 'boss' and his friends rather than those of the city\"\u2014that he had voted as he did in the matter of the paving contracts \"because of a split as to a possible rake-off.\" To bring such imputations within a plea of fair comment a defendant must establish a foundation of facts upon which they can be reasonably based. That the appellant has failed to do.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the Supreme Court of Alberta en banc, and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.

At the time of the sale, the respondent was operating a temporary mill (the permanent mill having been destroyed by fire) situated at the northern end of the site. The purchase money was $25,000, the agreement of sale providing that the appellant was to pay $10,000 cash and take possession of the mill site and limits, and that the balance of $15,000 was to be paid by the appellant as soon as the respondent had obtained title to the mill site from the Crown. Acting on expert advice, the appellant built a permanent mill at the southern end of the 108 acres, so that the portion at the north end, where the mill had formerly stood, was so wholly disconnected and so far away from the mill that the Crown refused to regard it as a part of the mill site and the respondent was therefore unable to obtain a patent to 81 acres of the original 108 acres.\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that the appellant was precluded by his conduct, from insisting upon the exact fulfilment of the condition that the respondent should make title to the parcel of 81 acres, before requiring payment of the last instalment of $15,000.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting.\u2014The respondent had no right to exact payment of the balance of the purchase money, as there was no provision in the agreement of sale obliging the appellant to erect a mill at all, much less obliging him to erect one upon any particular part of the land sold.\nPer Idington J., the respondent, to his knowledge, allowed the appellant to go on and build the mill without remonstrating or proposing a rescission of the agreement.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (31 D.L.R. 607, 1 W.W.R. 566), affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], reversing the judgment of Morrison J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs. The material facts of the case and the issues raised on the present appeal are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Harvey K.C. for the appellant.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The respondent, plaintiff in the action, by deed dated the 10th June, 1910, agreed to sell to the appellant:\u2014\nAll and singular that certain tract of land situate a short distance below the point of junction of Spius Creek and Nicola River in the County of Cariboo in the Province of British Columbia heretofore occupied and used by the said vendor as a sawmill site comprising 108 acres more or less,\nalso eight timber licences therein described.\nAnd all the personal property save as therein mentioned of the vendor situate on said mill site and at other points in said County of Cariboo.\nThe respondent never owned the land it agreed to sell and admits that it can now never acquire title thereto.\nUnder ordinary circumstances when a vendor fails to make a good title to property he has agreed to sell the purchaser is entitled to recover back his deposit together with the costs of investigating the title. Further, if he undertakes to sell knowing that he has no title he may be liable in damages to the purchaser for the loss of his bargain.\nAt first sight, therefore, it seems rather surprising that a vendor who never had even any colour of title should claim not only to be under no liability for the performance of his contract, not only to be entitled to retain the deposit paid on account of the purchase money but to sue the purchaser for the entire balance of the purchase money.\nNo doubt other things besides the lands were included in the sale, but in this action at any rate the court cannot decide what is the value of the annual timber licences assigned or apportion the purchase money even if this were asked, which it is not.\nIt is of course necessary for the appellant to find some ground on which his claim can be supported and the only one put forward, so far as I am able to see, is that the appellant by his own acts prevented the respondent acquiring title to the land.\nThe land was the property of the Dominion Crown and the respondent had made application to the Dominion Government for a homestead grant of it and was in possession at the date of the agreement sued on. The mill had then been recently burned down and the appellant did not rebuild on the same site. The Minister of the Interior was of opinion that the 108 acres applied for by the respondent were not needed in connection with the mill on its new site and refused the application accordingly.\nNow it was not the act of building the new mill which could be said to have prevented the respondent obtaining its grant but rather the failure by the appellant to rebuild the mill burned down upon its old site. But what was the obligation of the appellant to do this? Clearly he had entered into no express contract to that effect. McPhillips J., who has delivered the most elaborate judgment in the Court of Appeal, admits that it is necessary to find that \"it was incumbent upon respondent (the present appellant) to place the saw mill upon the mill site.\" I can however find no ground by which on any principle of law we are justified in imposing such liability upon the appellant when the contract between the parties did not even contain any provision obliging the purchaser to erect a mill at all.\nThe courts can only adjudicate upon the legal rights of litigants and cannot undertake to make such settlement between them as they may think fair without regard to any such rights. In any event, I think it would be difficult to hold that a purchaser agreed to waive his right to have the property contracted for whilst remaining liable to pay the whole of the purchase money.\nThe learned trial judge went as far as he properly could in urging upon the parties the desirability of a settlement of the case and I agree in thinking that this would have been the best course. The respondent, however, rejected any such suggestion and I do not see therefore that the judge could have made any other disposition of the action than he did.\nAlthough the three judges who sat in the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, they did so apparently on different grounds, as Martin J.A. in his reasons for judgment says, \"there is no real dispute about the law,\" whilst McPhillips J.A. says: \"this appeal raises a very difficult question of law.\"\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the reasons of Mr. Justice Anglin for dismissing this appeal.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014The respondent on the 21st March, 1910, gave the appellant an option in writing to purchase eight timber claims or limits in British Columbia and a quantity of timber and lumber and mill machinery and other personal property and a mill site situate at the confluence of Nicola River and Spius Creek containing 108 acres more or less\nfor the sum of $25,000, of which $10,000 was to be paid on or before the 1st June, 1910.\nThe recital in said option represented, amongst other things, as follows:\u2014\nAnd the vendors are also the owners of that certain mill site situate at the confluence of the said Nicola River and Spius Creek containing 108 acres more or less.\nThe appellant paid $1,000 of the said first instalment of $10,000 to secure the said option and either within the time specified or thereabout the balance thereof when the bargain was concluded and an agreement of sale and purchase in writing, dated the 10th day of June, 1910, was executed by said parties.\nThat agreement recited the facts that the vendor had agreed to sell and the purchaser had agreed to purchase the lands and hereditaments, timber licences issued by the Province of British Columbia, and personal property as thereinafter specified.\nOf the property thus specified the first item is as follows:\u2014\nAll and singular that certain tract of land situate a short distance below the point of junction of Spius Creek and Nicola River in the County of Cariboo in the Province of British Columbia, heretofore occupied and used by the said vendor as a sawmill site, comprising one hundred and eight (108) acres more or less.\nThe receipt of the $10,000 is acknowledged and the balance was to be paid in two years from date together with interest for the first year at six, and the second year at eight per cent, per annum.\nThen follows a covenant as follows:\u2014\nThe said purchaser doth hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with the said vendor that he will well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the said vendor the said sum of money above mentioned together with interest thereon at the rates aforesaid on the days and times, and in the manner above mentioned; and also shall and will pay and discharge all taxes, rates and assessments wherew th the said land and goods and chattels may be rated or charged from and after this date; and also shall and will so long as any portion of the said principal money or interest shall remain unpaid, duly renew and keep renewed the said timber licences and pay to the Province of British Columbia, all annual or renewal fees or charges which may hereinafter become payable in respect of said timber licences or any of them. In consideration whereof and of the payment of said sum of ten thousand dollars, the said vendor hath assigned and transferred or caused to be assigned and transferred to the said purchaser, the said timber licences and all renewals thereof, and hath assigned and transferred to the said purchaser, all the said personal property, goods, and chattels freed and discharged from all encumbrances.\nAnd it is hereby further agreed by and between the parties hereto that the said vendor shall forthwith take all the proceedings necessary to obtain a patent or Crown grant of said lands and hereditaments from the Government of the Dominion of Canada. And the said vendor doth hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with the said purchaser that on the receipt by the said vendor of said patent, the vendor shall and will convey and assure to the said purchaser by a good and sufficient deed in fee simple, the said lands and hereditaments together with the appurtenances thereto belonging or appertaining, free and discharged from all encumbrances, and such deed shall contain the usual statutory covenants. When the said deed shall have been duly executed, the said deed shall b placed in escrow in the Bank of Montreal, aforesaid, and shall be delivered to the said purchaser on the due payment in manner aforesaid, of the balance of said purchase money and interest.\nProvided and it is expressly understood and agreed that the said vendor shall not be entitled to the payment of said moneys until the said deed has been placed in said bank as aforesaid.\nUpon this covenant so conditioned the respondent sued for the $15,000 with interest from the 12th June, 1912, although the patent for the mill site had never been procured and, of course, the conveyance of the said lands in fee simple has never been given as agreed upon.\nThe learned trial judge, who heard all the witnesses and was in better position to determine than we can be what weight, if any, is to be attached to such statements of fact as relied upon by the Court of Appeal and in argument by counsel for respondent here for excusing the performance of respondent's agreement constituted as above a condition precedent to the right to recover the said sum of $15,000, held that there was no excuse, that the action was premature, and offered to allow plaintiff to withdraw it without prejudice to pursuing such remedy as it might be advised.\nIt is somewhat difficult to grasp exactly what is relied upon.\nOne oft repeated statement is that the appellant with others had induced some capitalists to join them in the procuring of the incorporation of a company to take over the purchase and develop the property and it had erected a mill for the purpose of doing so.\nIn one way the matter is put it is urged that this mill is not on the mill site in question and hence the respondent has become entitled in law to recover the full price for the property it sold. Surely it is a novel proposition that because a man is a member of a corporate company that erects a sawmill, therefore he has done some wrong to his covenantor and hence the latter has thereby become entitled to disregard his obligations.\nAgain, when it is shewn that the company has in fact built a mill at least partly on the mill site and has occupied in the carrying out of the project about thirty acres of the said hundred and eight acres for the purposes thereof, it is urged that that part of \"the mill site\" is not the part where the respondent once had erected a mill which was burnt down and which it replaced by a portable mill forming part of the personalty sold to the appellant, and that the expectation of its re\u2014erection exactly on that part of the mill site was so reasonable as to constitute an implication of an obligation that it would be done and hence the omission to do so relieved the respondent from the condition precedent imposed by above contract. It appears that the original application of the respondent for a patent for the mill site was the result of two similar applications in 1907, each for a hundred acres having been consolidated and converted into an application for two hundred acres being made in 1908.\nThe application is not produced or its contents proven, but I gather from the evidence that pending the consideration of it by the department, one Ross had located a parcel of land which so cut into that covered by respondent's application as to leave in substance two separate parcels of irregular shape and approximately equal in quantity which together would measure a total of 108 acres of land with only a small strip of land connecting them.\nIt was on the northerly one of these parcels that respondent's mill which had been burnt down and said portable mill were respectively placed and used preceding the sale now in question. It is claimed that there was an implied duty resting on the appellant to build, when building, on same site. How can anything of the kind be properly imported into this contract without a shred of expression pointing to such an obligation? There never was imposed any obligation to build any mill or refrain from doing so.\nI am unable to understand how there could be implied in the agreement any obligation to erect a mill at all, much less an obligation to erect one upon any particular part of the land in question.\nAlthough the application of the respondent had been before the department for all that time under these circumstance and the urgent need of expediting the business in light of the covenant to do everything to produce a deliverance from the department answering the application, nothing effective seems to have been done. Let us assume respondent had done everything it could during the three months which elapsed between the completion of the agreement and the time when the company promoted by the appellant was formed, and had come to a decision to build, then the appellant had, I think, no reason to suppose either he or his company had, if ever, any obligation resting upon them to wait longer.\nThe company was advised by experts to build on the southerly part near where its operation could be most profitably carried on by reason of the facility afforded for forming a pond for storage of logs and other features of the property. Moreover, that was the only way the appellant could find the financial support to build a mill at all.\nIt is quite evident the appellant's own preference was for the northerly part of the mill site until thus convinced. What else he could do I fail to see unless to rescind the contract entirely. He was not bound to that alternative.\nThe company then proceeded to build but before doing so made an application to the department to be assured by it that a title could be obtained for the land actually needed to be used for buildings and the storage of logs.\nThe appellant made a declaration on the 13th September to facilitate this being done.\nI think he had a perfect right to do so, at least after the failure of the respondent to get the assent of the department to a grant of the \"mill site\" it had covenanted to procure.\nHow long must he wait?\nThe judgment appealed from proceeds upon the assumption that there was a breach of good faith on the part of the appellant by reason of some failure on his part to observe some implied obligation.\nI cannot find the implied obligation. And if it ever existed three months was more than necessary to respondent to have availed itself thereof.\nThis judgment appealed from I respectfully submit rests upon making a contract for the parties which they did not make for themselves.\nMoreover, it is abundantly clear that the whole difficulty arises from the policy of the Department of the Interior which forbade the giving of what might constitute two or more mill sites in its view.\nMr. Cowell, later on, endeavoured to get his superiors to waive the objections but the narrower view was taken and a grant refused.\nThe appellant cannot, in my opinion, be held bound by reason of the failure to abandon his rights. And the court has, I submit, no right to impose upon him any such obligation.\nAgain, the respondent relies upon the alleged statement of Mr. Cowell that appellant had said something to indicate that he had no use for this northerly part of the \"mill site\" sold him.\nNot only does appellant contradict this but the evidence establishes clearly he always did so and that in time to correct any misapprehension in the department before ruling upon the application of respondent.\nOne can easily see how the misunderstanding arose. Speaking of the use of the northerly part as a place in which to erect a mill he could have no use for it, but, in the larger sense, as part of a \"mill site,\" in the sense used by the parties to this contract, he clearly had a use for it or of some equivalent thereof.\nThe learned trial judge saw and heard the parties and must have accepted appellant's view of what was said. I do not think it is of very much importance. However, to try to attach to what was a clear misunderstanding as to something that in either view cannot help here, indicates to what respondent was driven.\nIt is quite clear from what transpired at the trial that less land than one hundred and eight acres would give appellant what he wants.\nAnd it is equally clear that the quantity of land he has got does not suffice.\nHis good faith as well as these facts seem established by the offer made at the trial to accept forty acres instead of nearly eighty that is in question and pay the full amount.\nWhy such a proposition should have been spurned instead of being given a prompt response and ready and willing attempt to bring its acceptance about passes my understanding.\nI am of the same opinion as the learned trial judge that upon this record the respondent has no right to succeed.\nIt allowed the new company and appellant to go on and build the mill it did, well knowing the fact, without a word of remonstrance.\nIf it had remonstrated and proposed a rescission of the agreement, or even tried to enforce that, by reason of all that had preceded and succeeded the contract, it is quite possible evidence might have been adduced (which is not in this record) entitling it to a rescission.\nIt might even in this case have presented an alternative claim to specific performance, and been granted relief instead of rigidly abiding by that impalpable thing called waiver when there never was any.\nIf the parties choose to treat the pleadings as if so amended and take a judgment based upon the principles that a Court of Equity should act upon there does not seem much difficulty in dealing with the case. Indeed, I think it is quite reasonable to assume that such is the possible case the appellant must have faced in proceeding to build instead of proposing rescission of the agreement. Quite probably either party would have failed in September, 1911 to have got specific performance with compensation unless as an alternative to rescission of their contract.\nIt is one for compensation. And the basis proposed by the appellant at the trial might well be kept in view in such a reference as that relief would require.\nI do not think we have any power on this record to deal with such alternative and hence need not elaborate the suggestion.\nIf not acted upon the appeal should be allowed with costs without prejudice to any future action.\nDUFF J.\u2014On the twenty\u2014first of March, 1910, the respondent gave the appellant company an option in writing to purchase certain timber limits together with certain timber and lumber and mill machinery and other movable property and a \"mill site situate at the confluence of Nicola River and Spius Creek containing 108 acres more or less,\" for the sum of $25,000, of which $10,000 was to be paid on or before the 1st June, 1910.\nThe appellant paid $1,000 of the said first instalment of $10,000 to secure the option and the residue when the bargain was concluded and an agreement of sale executed, dated the 10th day of June, 1910.\nThe agreement contained the following covenant:\u2014\nTh said purchaser doth hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with the said vendor that he will well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the said vendor the said sum of money above mentioned together with interest thereon at the rates aforesaid on the days and times and in the manner above mentioned; and also shall and will pay and discharge all taxes rates and assessments wherewith the said lands and goods and chattels may be rated or charged from and after this date; and also shall and will so long as any portion of the said principal money or interest shall remain unpaid, duly renew and keep renewed, the said timber licenses and pay to the Province of British Columbia all annual or renewal fees or charges which may hereinafter become payable in respect of said timber licenses or any of them. In consideration whereof and of the payment of said sum of ten thousand dollars, the said vendor hath assigned and transferred or caused to be assigned and transferred to the said purchaser the said timber licenses and all renewals thereof, and hath assigned and transferred to the said purchaser all the said personal property, goods and chattels freed and discharged from all encumbrances.\nAnd it is hereby further agreed by and between the parties hereto that the said vendor shall forthwith take all the proceedings necessary to obtain a patent or Crown grant of said lands and hereditaments from the Government of the Dominion of Canada. And the said vendor doth hereby covenant promise and agree to and with the said purchaser that on the receipt by the said vendor of the said patent, the vendor shall and will convey and assure to the said purchaser by a good and sufficient deed in fee simple, the said lands and hereditaments together with the appurtenances thereto belonging or appertaining, free and discharged from all encumbrances, and such deed shall contain the usual statutory covenants. When the said deed shall have been duly executed, the said deed shall be placed in escrow in the Bank of Montreal, aforesaid, and shall be delivered to the said purchaser on the due payment in manner aforesaid, of the balance of said purchase money and interest.\nProvided, and it is expressly understood and agreed that the said vendor shall not be entitled to the payment of said moneys until the said deed has been placed in said bank as aforesaid.\nI concur with the opinion of the judges of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia that the appellant company is precluded by its conduct from insisting upon exact fulfilment of the condition that the respondent should make title to the parcel of 81 acres, which, by the terms of the contract, was attached to his right to require payment of the last instalment of $15,000. When the agreement was executed all parties contemplated that a title to this property should be acquired under the provisions of the law and the practice of the department governing the granting of mill sites; and without going so far as to hold that by implication the appellant company was bound actively to take all steps with regard to actual use of the property and the improvement of it as might prove to be necessary to enable the respondent to comply with the conditions exacted by the department, there appears to be abundant ground for holding that the appellant company, at least, assumed the onus of an obligation to do no act in relation to the property or by any communication with the departmental authorities, which should hinder or be calculated to hinder the respondent in his efforts to obtain a grant of it for the purpose of a mill site.\nThat must necessarily be so because as it would be the duty of the departmental officers to satisfy themselves upon the subject of the purpose for which the applicants intended to use the property, the conduct and the representations of the respondent's assignee if inconsistent with respondent's representations as to the destination of the property, might gravely compromise or entirely neutralize the respondent's exertions. To apply the test often suggested by eminent judges\u2014it is not possible\u2014having regard to the dictates of common experience\u2014to doubt that if the subject had been mentioned at the time the contract was entered into that the appellant would not have been left free to obstruct by its conduct and declarations the respondent's application for a grant while retaining in full literal force the condition that the grant should be produced in order to entitle the respondent to receive the final instalment of the purchase money.\nThis obligation assumed by the appellant was not fulfilled and in consequence, mainly if not entirely, of the non-fulfilment of it, it became impracticable to obtain a grant in the manner contemplated or without the expenditure of a sum of money so much greater than the expenditure that would have been required, if events had been allowed to pursue their normal course, as to make it impossible to require the exact performance of the condition without plainly defeating the intention of the parties.\nWhat is the legal result? Mr. Ritchie contends, and the court below has held, that the plaintiff is entitled ex debito juris to the sum of $15,000 on the ground that the condition has been purged and a good deal, no doubt, can be said for this view. Indeed, the language of Mr. Justice Willes in Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry Coffee Co.[2], cited with approval in Burchell v. Gowrie Colleries Co. [3], appears to support it; but the actual decision in Inchbald's Case (1) was that the plaintiff was entitled to recover such a sum as the jury, or the court substituted for the jury, might consider to be reasonable.\nOn principle, I think that it is the proper result in the present case. The respondent was entitled to recover the sum of $15,000 less an allowance reasonable in all the circumstances.\nA reasonable allowance must clearly include the difference in cost to the respondent of obtaining the two sites. Ought it to include more? Ought it to include compensation for the loss of the site of 80 acres or rather for the failure to acquire it? After a good deal of consideration, I have come to the conclusion that it ought not. The appellant had gone into possession of the assets which he had purchased as a unum quid; rescission was impossible; and he chose for his own reasons and quite properly to put into operation a plan with respect to the lay out of the property more advantageous as he conceived than the plan their predecessors had been pursuing. The departure from the old plans involved a change in the locality of the mill and together with the declarations made by the appellant's agent led to the difficulties which have given rise to this litigation. It would not, I think, be just or reasonable from the point of view of the respondent to accede now to the demand of the appellant, that the respondent should be required to compensate him for the value to him in the present circumstances of the 80 acre site, the loss of which or the failure to acquire which was mainly, if not entirely due to the course taken by him in his own interests.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs seek to recover $15,000 a balance of $25,000, the purchase money for a mill site with storage pond, etc., comprising 108 acres, some timber limits and other property. A mill situated on the northern end of the site, about a mile and a quarter from the storage pond at the southern end, had been destroyed by fire. At the time of the sale the vendors were operating a portable mill where their permanent mill had formerly stood. The agreement for sale provided that the purchaser should pay $10,000, should take possession of the mill site and limits and should work the latter. The vendors undertook to obtain title from the Crown to the mill site and the $15,000 was to be held until that was done and thereupon paid over to the vendors.\nActing on expert advice the purchaser, instead of erecting a mill where the vendors had had their mill, built it at the other end of the 108 acres, placing it beside the storage pond in a 30 acre parcel consisting partly of the pond and land included in the 108 acres and partly of seven or eight acres additional land in which he procured the rights of a homesteader\u2014one Ross. With the mill at its north end and the storage pond at its south end, the whole 108 acres might not improperly be dealt with as a single industrial site. But with the mill at the south end beside the storage pond the 30 acre parcel formed in itself a fairly complete mill site. At all events the portion of the 108 acres at the north end where the mill had formerly stood was so wholly disconnected and so far away from the 30 acre parcel that the department, on the advice of its agent, refused to regard it and the communicating strip between it and the 30 acres as a part of the mill site on which the new mill and the pond were situated. Hence the vendors were unable to obtain a patent for 81 acres of the original 108 acres as part of an industrial site in connection with the new mill. Upon the evidence, I am satisfied that the purchaser, either because he recognized this impossibility or because; having regard to the altered situation of the mill, he regarded the 81 acres as practically useless for his purposes, informed the Crown Lands' agent that his company would not require the 81 acres and applied, apparently informally, for a grant of 29.4 acres at the south end, including the seven or eight acres over which he had acquired the rights of Ross. The Crown Lands' agent thereupon wrote the department that,\nthe present company have no further use for the land originally applied for, and I would, therefore, suggest that it should be released and the application cancelled;\nand he advised a grant of the 29.4 acres.\nUnder these circumstances I agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia that the vendors were excused from making title to the 81 acres as a condition precedent to their right to payment of the $15,000 balance of the purchase money.\nAlthough the action is framed simply as a common law action to recover the balance of the contract price, I see no serious objection to treating it as an equitable action for specific performance or other relief, if that be necessary, in order to make a disposition of the case which shall do justice between the parties. As a matter of equity and fair dealing, I think the vendors should give credit to the purchaser for the $5 per acre that they would have been obliged to pay to the Crown in order to obtain a patent for the 81 acres for which their application had been rejected, and also upon the same basis for the remaining 27 acres of the original 108 acres which they undertook to sell, since the purchaser will be obliged to pay the Crown its price upon this latter acreage before he can obtain a patent therefor. In all $540 should be credited on this account.\nWith this comparatively slight variation in the judgment a quo, I would dismiss the appeal. The appellant should pay four-fifths of the respondents' costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor, Harvey, Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bowser, Reid, Wallbridge, Douglas & Gibson.\n[1] 31 D.L.R. 607; [1917] 1 W.W.R. 556.\n[2] 17 C.B.N.S. 733.\n[3] [1910] A.

The brokers who, for the vendors, procured the contracts from D. agreed to pay him, personally, half of their commission for effecting the sale. B. when asked to pay for the goods repudiated the contracts on the ground that D. was not authorized to purchase.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (36 Ont. L.R. 522), Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that as the half of the commission promised to D. would be a substantial amount; that as it was not proved that B. knew of it until after the contracts were signed; and as it was not shewn that D. had any expectation of such profit from B. as would prevent the commission from interfering with his duty to the latter; the offer of such payment to D. made the contracts for sale void and it was immaterial whether or not the vendors had knowledge of it.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant. The circumstances of the case are indicated in the above head-note.\nMcKay K.C. for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. and J.G. Kerr for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I am by no means satisfied that Durocher, who made the contracts sued on, had not the appellant\u2019s authority to enter into them on his behalf. Admittedly the only question is as to the extent to which the appellant was committed to the speculative schemes of Durocher, and if these had been successful, the appellant, at any rate, would never have raised a doubt as to the authority given by him. He admits that Durocher had not a dollar in the goods himself and, questioned as to some more or less dubious methods resorted to by Durocher in his attempted \u201ccorner,\u201d he says with perhaps unconscious cynicism:\nI had no reason to interfere. If he had been successful, it would have been to my advantage.\nA man who enters into speculations of this sort through a close friend ought not to be in the position of taking the profits if it is successful or repudiating the authority of the friend if it fails; still less if, as in the present case, he is obliged to admit the authority to a very large extent and only stops short when failure was clearly in sight. I do not think his bare denial of authority, still less that of his friend, can be entitled to much weight against the facts proved. I do not mean a formal authority, for, of course, he cannot escape liability by denying this however plausibly.\nBut even if it is assumed that the appellant did not give his express authority, I think there is abundant ground for saying that he is precluded from raising this defence by having held out his friend as his authorized agent.\nIt is not necessary for me to go through the evidence in detail to point out the grounds in which I come to this conclusion. They are sufficiently set out in the reasons of the learned judges for the judgment under appeal. Briefly, the appellant, a wholesale dealer in fruit, constituted Durocher his purchaser of all canned goods and left to him the sole management of what was in effect a branch of his business. He housed him at his place of business from which he himself was frequently absent for long periods; allowed him not only to use the firm\u2019s stationery with printed headings, but actually to conduct his correspondence in the firm\u2019s name and over its signature. Contracts made by Durocher previous to those now sued on were either authorized by him or if, as alleged sometimes, unauthorized, were ratified without complaint and the goods accepted and paid for by the appellant.\nThe appellant really, I think, held Durocher out as his agent in every possible way.\nThat the respondent\u2019s broker, Wm. Millman, supposed that he was dealing with the appellant through his authorized agent seems indubitable. He would hardly have entered into contracts for sale of the magnitude involved in an attempted corner of an important article of produce with a man not possessed of a dollar and only allowed desk room in the office of a friend. That he would not have dealt with him as an agent for the appellant if he had thought he was not his agent goes without saying. Mr. Millman swears that Durocher told him he was the appellant\u2019s agent and that he thought he had his authority.\nThe contracts, in my opinion, were duly made on behalf of the appellant in the ordinary course of busi- ness which, could hardly be carried on if repudiation were possible under the circumstances of the case.\nI do not attach much importance to the fact that the respondent\u2019s brother, Mr. Wm. Millman, agreed to split his 2% commission with the appellant\u2019s agent Durocher.\nThe principle that anything in the nature of a bribe by the vendor to the purchaser\u2019s agent to neglect his duty to look solely after his principal\u2019s interest should invalidate the sale is clear and well established in innumerable cases. Here, however, the payment was not made by the vendors, nor with their money. It cannot be said that it was within the scope of the duties of the vendors\u2019 agent to bribe the purchaser\u2019s agent. There is no suggestion that the vendors had any knowledge of the arrangement. Presumably Durocher must have said that he could not get any other remuneration himself as the vendors\u2019 broker would not have been likely to pay him half his own commission in addition to the commission of a purchaser\u2019s agent. Mr. Millman says that it is a common practice in his trade and that he had never thought of any secrecy about the payment. The total amount was comparatively small. We should be going beyond anything decided in the cases with which I am acquainted and unduly straining the widest interpretation of the principle involved if we were to hold these contracts invalid on such ground.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the second Appellate Division of Ontario reversing a judgment of the trial judge (except with respect to a sum of $400 for storage not disputed) on the ground that the contracts of sale sued upon were valid and binding upon the defendant, now appellant, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages for breach thereof.\nThe trial judge had dismissed the action except with respect to the $400 above mentioned on the grounds that no valid or binding contracts had been entered into by the defendant for the purchase of the goods.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 claim was for $8,229.68 for loss or damage sustained by them on the sale of goods after defendant\u2019s repudiation of the contracts, that sum being the difference between the alleged contract prices and the price which the goods actually realized when sold.\nThere were two contracts sued on, one for 11,000 cases of canned tomatoes alleged to have been purchased by defendant on or about the 12th of October, 1914, and another for 12,000 alleged to have been purchased by the acceptance of an option dated 7th November, 1914.\nThe contracts were made and entered into by Millman & Sons, who acted as brokers for the Independent Canners, of which the Stoney Point Canning Company was one, and one Durocher assuming to act for Barry, the defendant.\nNo controversy arises as to the agency of Millman & Sons to sell the goods. The whole controversy hinges upon the authority of Durocher to purchase them as agent for Barry.\nThe trial judge after hearing all the witnesses, including Barry, Durocher and Millman, stated in his considered judgment that:\u2014\nMr. Desmarais, who is really the plaintiff, acted, I think, in perfect good faith throughout, supposing that he had in truth made the contract sued upon with Mr. Barry, who was carrying on business under the name of John Barry & Son. On the other hand, Mr. Barry acted, I think, throughout with perfect honesty, and I accept his evidence without question.\nAfterwards he stated his findings on the facts to be\u2014\nThe situation seems to me plain upon the facts. Durocher never had any authority; there never was any ratification, and there never was any holding out by Barry. This being so, the plaintiff must fail\nThe learned judge was also of opinion that the action must fail on the ground that:\u2014\nMillman, who says that he regarded Durocher as Barry\u2019s broker or agent, agreed to divide with Durocher the commission which he as vendor\u2019s broker would be entitled to recover.\nThe learned judges of the Appellate Division who gave reasons for their conclusions while agreeing to reverse the judgment of the trial judge and to hold Barry liable on the alleged contracts, did not agree in their reasons. Meredith C.J. held that:\u2014\nIt was not a question whether the defendant assented to or did not assent to any particular sale, that narrow view of the case seems to have led to some serious misconceptions of the parties\u2019 rights; there was a general power and the authority to use the defendant\u2019s name in these operations; they could not have been carried on without that; no one would have wasted an hour upon any scheme that had no more than the credit financially of Arthur Durocher behind it; the defendant knew this; no one concerned in the matter could help knowing it; and in view of the manner in which the correspondence began and was carried on throughout the purchases made by Durocher and treated by the defendant as binding upon him, the opening of the office in Toronto and the defendant\u2019s personal participation in the negotiations for the purchase of a controlling interest in the output of the \u201cindependent\u201d factories, with a full knowledge of all that had been done and was being done in his name and on his credit, how is it possible for him to escape liability on the contract in question merely because he did not give any specific authorization respecting it?\nI understand that the learned Chief Justice in stating that \u201cthere was a general power and authority to use the defendant\u2019s name in these operations\u201d was merely drawing an inference from the facts and documents proved and not intending to state or imply that there was any such direct or express general power. His inference may or may not be a proper inference to draw from all of the proved facts. In my judgment it is not.\nLater on in his judgment the Chief Justice says:\u2014\nI cannot but find upon the whole evidence that the purchases in question were purchases within the authority of the witness Arthur Durocher acting for and in the name of the defendant carrying on business as John Barry & Sons; and that, if that were not so, the defendant is estopped from denying that the contracts in question are his contracts.\nOf course, if the purchases were within the authority Barry had given Durocher, there is an end to the controversy. But if they were not within such authority, I fail to find any evidence from which the defendant could be held as\nplainly estopped from denying that the contracts in question were his contracts;\nthat is I assume precluded from denying Durocher\u2019s authority because of having held him out as his agent under such circumstances that authority would be presumed.\nMr. Justice Lennox, after disposing adversely of the \u201csecret commission\u201d defence by holding that\nthe divided commission was not intended as a dishonest or fraudulent inducement or to be kept from the knowledge of the defendant\nwent on to deal with the merits at very great length. He says:\u2014\nThe first branch of the claim for 11,000 cases contracted for on the 5th of October, 1914, can I think be safely determined by a careful examination of Mr. Barry\u2019s letter to Durocher on the 8th of October, 1914, in reply to Durocher\u2019s letter to him of the day before, the admitted confidential relations, common purpose, and course of dealing established between these two men, and Barry\u2019s total inability to account for a liability for 94,000 cases of tomatoes mentioned in his letter without including in the 94,000 cases the 50,000 cases purchased by Durocher on the 5th October, and of which the 11,000 cases sued for is the part allotted to the plaintiff company.\nIt is quite apparent that the supposed or \u201cunexplained discrepancy,\u201d as the learned judge calls it, with regard to these 94,000 cases, had very great weight in inducing him to come to the conclusion he did\nthat whether Durocher had actual antecedent authority to purchase the 50,000 cases or not, Barry knew and approved of it and included it as a liability when he wrote the letter of the 8th October to Durocher.\nIt seems to me reasonably clear that the conclusion reached by Lennox J. that of the 94,000 cases of canned goods specifically referred to in the defendant Barry\u2019s letter to Durocher of the 8th October, 1914, 50,000 were those purchased by the latter from Millman & Co. as brokers of the plaintiff and others and now in controversy, settled his mind on the vital questions of Barry\u2019s knowledge and approval of the purchase, ratification of it if there was an absence of antecedent authority, and general authority of Durocher to make the purchase. If he was right in concluding that these 94,000 cases included the 50,000 cases in controversy, his final conclusion as to Barry\u2019s liability would be difficult to dispute. If it was not sufficient proof of an antecedent authority to make the purchase it would be very strong evidence of knowledge and approval of the purchase and ratification of it, and would in addition go very far to discredit Barry\u2019s credibility. No such acceptance \u201cwithout question\u201d by the trial judge of Barry\u2019s testimony would in that case have been possible.\nMr. Justice Lennox, however, seems to have overlooked the testimony of Millman, the plaintiff\u2019s broker and agent, on the point, who while advancing or accepting as correct the theory as put to him in his main examination of the inclusion of the 50,000 cases in the 94,000 referred to in the letter of the 8th October, when cross-examined seems unqualifiedly to admit that any such theory was not under the facts tenable, and that the 94,000 cases mentioned in that letter of Barry\u2019s, referred to a different and antecedent purchase of 94,000 cases made with his authority, which did not include or have any reference to the 50,000 cases in controversy. I notice that the theory put forward by Mr. Justice Lennox was favourably noticed in his reasons for judgment by the Chief Justice, and no doubt must have had weight with him though, as he said, he preferred putting the defendant\u2019s liability on what he called the\nground of the previous general and undisputed authority.\nMr. Justice Masten held that while at the beginning of the purchases of these canned goods Barry was a special agent only with limited authority afterwards but prior to the date of the contract sued on\nthe business changed and Durocher became in fact the general agent of Barry in the buying and selling of canned tomatoes, peas and other like merchandise. This conclusion, he went on to say, rests on a general course of dealing rather than on any specific act of concurrence. Just precisely when this change took place I think it is impossible to say. It is sufficient that it took place, in my opinion, before the contracts now sued on were entered into.\nThe learned judge doubted whether there was any such \u201cholding out\u201d to the plaintiff as would make a basis for the liability claimed, and repudiated the contention\nthat there was anything in the nature of a conspiracy to defraud between Barry and Durocher\nbut found Barry\nliable for the loss in question without any impropriety on his part.\nIn view of the differences of judicial opinion and feeling some doubt at the conclusion of the argument on the question involved, I found it necessary to read the evidence with much care and have given the case much consideration.\nThe conclusions I have reached on the evidence written and oral are in general accord with those of the trial judge, that Durocher never had any authority to enter into or bind Barry by the contracts in question, that the latter never ratified them in any way but that as soon as he reasonably could when they were first brought to his notice on the 28th of November, when the draft for their purchase price was presented, refused payment and repudiated liability\u2014and lastly that there never was any \u201cholding out\u201d of Durocher by Barry as his agent authorized to purchase these goods.\nI frankly admit that the circumstances are peculiar. The facts that Barry had in the first instance given Durocher a limited authority to purchase some canned goods; that Durocher had exceeded that authority and had persuaded Barry to approve of and ratify the excess and accept the drafts therefor; the intimate relationship existing between the two parties; the letters which passed between them and the opening by Durocher, with Barry\u2019s assent, of a branch office of Barry & Son in Toronto, all afford ground for a strong argument either that there was a holding out of Durocher as an agent authorized to buy for Barry, or that the proper inference from all the facts proved, was that he had been so authorized as a general agent to buy.\nBut it does seem to me that the evidence taken as a whole is conclusive against any such holding out or any such an inference of general agency. Barry and Durocher both swear positively that no such authority as Durocher usurped ever was given, and Millman, the agent of the plaintiffs, who sold the goods and completed the contracts with Durocher, was obliged to admit in his cross-examination that when he made the contracts with Durocher assuming to act for Barry,\nhe (Millman) knew he (Durocher) had to go back to Barry and get authority before he could buy. Nothing could be more unequivocal. There was no qualification to Millman\u2019s statement nor was any satisfactory answer given to the argument based upon this witness\u2019 statement. It shewed beyond any doubt that the vendor knew Durocher had no authority to buy without going to Barry and getting authority. Now Millman was the plaintiffs\u2019 agent who carried on the negotiations for the sale and completed them. How in the face of this unqualified admission it can be successfully argued that there was a holding out of Durocher as Millman\u2019s agent or an authority to complete such a purchase as we have here in controversy without going back to Barry and getting authority, I do not understand.\nBoth parties to the contract, Durocher, the alleged agent of Barry, and Millman, the admitted agent of the plaintiffs, swear, the one that he had not authority, and the other that he knew the person to whom he was selling had to go back to his principal and get authority before he could buy. When to this is added the evidence of Barry accepted by the trial judge \u201cwithout question\u201d that he never gave Durocher authority but repudiated the contract when it was first brought to his notice, how can it be held that there was authority either special or general?\nAs to the other defence relied upon, namely, the non-enforceability of the contracts sued upon because of the payments of commission by the vendors\u2019 broker to the purchaser\u2019s agent, I have had the advantage of reading my brother Anglin\u2019s reasons and concur in them.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division and the judgment of the trial judge restored. IDINGTON J.\u2014Assuming that this action is maintainable, upon all the attendant facts and circumstances it is clear that the fundamental facts are that Durocher was employed by the appellant, or permitted by him whilst occupying a desk in his office, to act as if a clerk duly authorized to use the firm name in carrying on that branch of its business correspondence relative to canned goods such as in question, and in short to wear in that regard the semblance throughout from the 2nd of March till the end of November following, of a mere employee of appellant.\nI am of the opinion that the giving by the respondent, through its agent, a share in his commission to induce Durocher under such circumstances to contract in said firm\u2019s name and on its behalf for the purchase of the goods in question from the respondent was corrupt and corrupting and, unless known to and presumably assented to by the appellant, destroyed any legal right to recover upon the alleged contracts.\nReason, fairness and consistency, alike demand herein that the law which forbids, as does also moral sense, the employment of such means to induce such a departure from duty on the part of any mere employee or trusted friend, in acting on behalf of his employer or friend entrusting business to him, should be applied to determine the liability of the appellant herein, which must rest, if at all, only upon facts and circumstances constituting Durocher an agent of one or either of the classes I refer to.\nIt is idle to put forward the cases of brokers who in certain localities and classes of business wherein and in relation to which all those dealing by and through them are, by reason of a practice or custom, well known to all such persons, habitually to divide the commission, or indeed in some cases, have become entitled to receive and demand it from the party the principal has contracted with.\nThis man Durocher, though possibly calling himself a broker, had in fact no visible means of support and was not employed, as to matters herein referred to, as a broker.\nThat in truth is what renders the case somewhat difficult on the other issues raised, and enables the respondent to present a plausible argument in order to maintain the action at all, so far as such issues are concerned.\nHad the business been conducted through a broker there would not have likely arisen any such complications as exist on the facts. Indeed all, or nearly all, that tends to support the respondent on the issue of authority or no authority could not have had any existence.\nThe evidence on this point of Mr. Millman, who acted for the respondent and made the offer to share his commission, is as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014And mentioning it in a telegram would not give you that impression? A.\u2014No, I did not know, only I knew he was with John Barry & Sons.\nQ.\u2014And you did not know him as a broker? A.\u2014I never heard of him as a broker.\nQ.\u2014Then you thought he was John Barry\u2019s agent? A.\u2014He told me he was.\nQ.\u2014And you made an agreement to pay him 1%? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014To the agent of the man? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014That was buying from you? A.\u2014Yes, he told me it made no difference, Mr. Barry knew what he was doing.\nThe appellant denies all knowledge of such fact till after his repudiation of those contracts.\nThe learned trial judge believed him and I see no reason for setting aside his finding. Indeed I see some reasons the other way. For example, a specimen of how this man was approached is furnished by the following letter:\u2014\n27 Front Street, East,\nMr. A. Durocher, Toronto, Aug. 29th, 1914.\nMontreal, Que.\nDear Sir,\nOn contract number 1493 from ourselves to John Barry & Sons 2500 c\/s peas we allow you personally 1% brokerage also on contract number 98 Beaver Canning Co. contract number 99 Ed. McCaw, contract number 100 A.A. Morden & Sons, at Wellington. All these we allow 1% brokerage to yourself when goods are paid for.\nYours very truly,\nW.H. Millman & Sons, Per \u201cM.\u201d\nThis particular letter possibly does not refer to these identical contracts now in question. I quote it only to shew the spirit of the giving and how Durocher was specially and personally addressed, instead of the firm, had it been intended for them. It was not given as sometimes happens between a commission man dealing with a buyer personally and offering to share his commission with him in order to close the deal thus effecting a lowering of the price, though desirous not to call it that. Nor does such a personal address to the agent tend to inspire the belief that the principal knew all about it. In that case it would have been addressed to the first with a polite request to see that poor Arthur got his tip for his civility.\nIt was not denied in argument that the like commission sharing applied to the contracts in question. I gather that sometimes it was agreed on with Durocher orally. Indeed it seems to be suggested he was the first to hold out his hand and shew how it might be advantageously managed. And it was stated in argument that the total of such gratuities thus paid to Durocher exceeded $1,200. I suspect but for this bountiful stream we might never have been troubled with the numerous exhibitions of commercial schemes and plotting and contriving which appellant denies he was an actor in but I think evidently quite willing to encourage, or as he, knowing of it, expresses it:\u2014\nI had no reason to interfere. If it had been successful it would have been to my advantage,\nand which we have had presented for our serious consideration.\nSometimes fine distinctions have been drawn heretofore as to the intention and the result of such gratuities for which at least in this case I find no warrant, and I respectfully submit there never was a place therefor in law.\nThe encouragement thus lent as by expressions in the case of Smith v. Sorby[2], to lessen the rigour and force of the law on the subject and somewhat corrected as Mr. Justice Field pointed out in Harrington v. Victoria Graving Dock Company[3], at page 552, should neither receive approval or extension.\nWhat he there expressed regarding loose commercial practice has so grown as to be a menace to those trying to adhere to honest practices and continue in business.\nThe illicit commission must be most rigidly suppressed if honest men who will not stoop to its use are to be given a fair chance for their commercial life in Canada. The proof of knowledge on the part of any one whose agent has yielded rests with him so asserting. An honest business man giving such gratuity will always put beyond peradventure his ability to prove that he had given notice to the principal in the plainest terms. If such clear proof be required there will not be many gratuities of substantial amount going into the hands of the agent, I imagine.\nIt seems bordering on childishness to ask in this age for further proof of the motive than the promise of such substantial payment, on the successful accomplishment of its purpose, as implied in above letter.\nNor can I entertain the pro form\u00e2 submission made that as it was not proven that respondent knew of this splitting of commission it should succeed, although the legal existence of the contract repudiated therefor is gone.\nThe repudiating of fraud on that ground possibly should have come earlier but Clough v. London and North Western Rly. Co.[4], will support raising it even at the trial so long as no affirmation of the contract by him defrauded or his estoppel in some other way. And the learned trial judge notes he gave leave at the trial to amend.\nI think for these reasons the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored. I think, however, there should be no costs allowed either party in regard to the appeal below or here. The great weight of the appellate costs here certainly consisted in presenting and arguing about the issue of law and fact in regard to what the appellant does not succeed as to, and I presume the same was the case below.\nAn apportionment of costs according to the result of the issues hardly fits the case.\nTo give appellant costs generally when the argument of the point on which he succeeds (if my view adopted) took less than twenty minutes on each side would not be a satisfactory result. The costs allowed him by the learned trial judge should stand. The item upon which judgment below was allowed by the trial judge with costs fixed at $75 did not trouble us and judgments therefor should also stand and be set off as directed.\nMR. JUSTICE DUFF concurs with Mr. Justice Idington\u2019s conclusion.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This action is brought to recover damages for breach by the purchaser of two contracts for the sale of canned goods. The defence originally pleaded was that the defendant\u2019s alleged agent, Durocher, was not authorized to make the contracts.\nEarly in the trial, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 broker, Millman, deposed that although he understood Durocher to be the defendant\u2019s agent, he agreed on Durocher\u2019s demand to divide with him his 2% commission from the vendors on sales made to the defendant for the plaintiffs and other canners whom he (Millman) represented. Durocher\u2019s share of these commissions (according to a statement of counsel made at bar and not controverted) would amount to the substantial sum of $1,200. Millman\u2019s evidence indicates that he was relying upon Durocher to \u201cput the deal through\u201d with Barry, the defendant, and that Durocher was insistent upon being paid the commission. Millman says he made no secret about the commission and that Durocher told him that the defendant knew what he was doing. The defendant denied having had knowledge of any commission arrangement with Millman until some time after the alleged contracts had been made\u2014some time about the end of November\u2014about the time that he repudiated Durocher\u2019s authority. Durocher corroborates this testimony. The defendant\u2019s explanation of his having failed at once to repudiate liability on this ground is that it was then too late to object to the commissions as Durocher had received them and probably spent them. The omission from the statement of defence of a plea based on the commission agreement would indicate that, even when giving instructions to his solicitor, Barry did not appreciate its importance and neglected to bring it expressly to the solicitor\u2019s attention.\nDurocher was largely indebted to the defendant and, while no definite arrangement was made as to the amount of his remuneration, the defendant advanced him money for expenses and says that he expected to pay him for his services. An amendment to the statement of defence alleging voidability because of the payment of commission by Millman to Durocher was allowed at the trial.\nMr. Justice Middleton, who tried the action, has had a large experience as a trial judge. In his judgment he says of the defendant:\u2014\nMr. Barry acted, I think, throughout with perfect honesty and I accept his evidence without question.\nAccepting Barry\u2019s evidence, corroborated as it was by that of Durocher, notwithstanding many features of the correspondence in evidence and some circumstances which go far to warrant contrary inferences in regard to some phases of the case, the learned judge expressly found that:\u2014\nDurocher never had any authority; there never was any ratification and there never was any holding out by Barry. This being so, the plaintiffs must fail.\nNo doubt this conclusion was not a little influenced by the explicit acknowledgment of Millman that, while he regarded and dealt with Durocher as Barry\u2019s agent, he also, knew he (Durocher) had to go back to Barry and get authority before he could buy,\nby Barry\u2019s explicit denial that he ever authorized or ratified the contracts, and by the absence of any direct evidence of ratification.\nIf disposing of the case on this aspect of it, notwithstanding the forceful presentation by the learned judges of the Appellate Division of such facts and circumstances in evidence as tend to support their reversal of the findings of the trial judge, I am not satisfied that I should have been prepared to concur in their conclusion. I should not improbably have felt impelled to hold, for the reasons stated by my brother Davies, that, depending, as it necessarily did, almost entirely upon the credit to be attached to the oral evidence of the defendant given in his presence, the opinion of the trial judge on the pure question of fact in issue should not have been disturbed.\nBut having regard (as Field J. put it in Harrington v. Victoria Graving Dock[5]), to\nhow sadly loose commercial practice has become in respect to transactions of this nature,\nit seems highly desirable and, on the whole, more satisfactory that this appeal should be disposed of on the other question which it presents, viz., the effect on the enforceability of the contracts sued on of the payment of commission by the vendors\u2019 broker to the purchaser\u2019s agent. On this branch of the case the trial judge said:\u2014\nUpon another branch of the defence the plaintiffs must, I think, also fail. Mr. Millman, who says that he regarded Durocher as Barry\u2019s broker or agent, agreed to divide with Durocher the commission which he as vendors\u2019 broker would be entitled to receive. Mr. Millman seeks to shew that that division was not to be with Durocher, but between Millman and Barry & Sons. I cannot so find upon the evidence. In Hitchcock v. Sykes[6], I stated my views that the payment of any sum to any person occupying any fiduciary position, by way of secret commission, is fraudulent and cannot be permitted to be explained away, and that, as held in Panama Co. v. India Rubber Co.[7], any surreptitious dealing between one party to a contract and the agent of the other party is a fraud in equity, and invalidates the agreement. Although this was said in a dissenting opinion, that view was subsequently sustained, and I am informed by counsel who presented a petition to the Privy Council for leave to appeal, that their Lordships expressly assented to this view.\nThe learned judge\u2019s opinion was substantially approved in this court[8].\nThat Durocher was the defendant\u2019s agent, authorized to bind him by the contracts sued upon is the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 case and of the judgment of the Appellate Division. Speaking of the 1% commission paid Durocher, Millman himself tells us:\u2014\nI said you (Durocher) can do what you like with it.\nDealing with this defence in the Appellate Division[9], Meredith C.J., C.P. after disposing of the question of Durocher\u2019s authority adversely to the defendant (which involved discrediting utterly Barry\u2019s denial of that authority and of all knowledge that Durocher had contracted for him), said:\u2014\nAfter being asked to swallow the camel of the defendant\u2019s \u201cinnocence\u201d involving more than $8,000, we are urged to strain at the gnat of the divided commission amounting to a few hundred dollars and upset the whole transaction on the ground of fraud in it.\nI venture to think that in his necessitous circumstances Durocher did not look upon the $1,200 commission as a mere \u201cgnat.\u201d The learned Chief Justice himself subsequently emphasizes its importance to Durocher when, on the assumption that he was not to be remunerated by Barry for his services, he says:\u2014\nThe defendant knew that the man could not live upon air alone. The Chief Justice proceeds to hold that the payment of commission by Millman to Durocher was innocuous and affords no defence to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, because of its comparative insignificance; because the arrangement for it appears in the correspondence; because the evidence does not disclose actual fraudulent intent on the part of Millman; because splitting commissions was customary in the trade; because the commission was received by Durocher \u201cin good faith\u201d; because, not having agreed with Durocher for a definite remuneration for his services, the defendant knew, or must be taken to have known, that he would seek remuneration from \u201cthe other side\u201d; because the defence based on the commission agreement should be regarded as only \u201ca solicitor\u2019s defence raised at the eleventh hour\u201d; and because the arrangement for the commission was made not by the plaintiffs themselves but by their broker, Millman, and it did not appear that it was made in the course of the plaintiffs\u2019 business and for their benefit.\nMr. Justice Lennox discards this defence in three sentences:\u2014\nIt is so much a question of fact that no nice point of law arises; and the reliable evidence in this case is documentary. That the divided commission was not intended as a dishonest or fraudulent inducement or to be kept from the knowledge of the defendant is manifest from the correspondence. The contracts ought not to be avoided on this ground.\nMr. Justice Masten, who had said:\u2014\nI do not for a moment differ from the learned trial judge in his estimate of the evidence given by the witnesses\nand \u201cfelt great difficulty\u201d in dealing with this defence, disposed of it by holding that there was no evidence that the commission was paid\nwith the view of influencing Durocher to purchase more canned goods or at an enhanced price and that, because of his expectation of sharing in the defendant\u2019s profits from the transaction,\nhis interest was immeasurably greatest in the direction of doing the best he could for Barry, and the commission receivable from Millman was not such, * * * either in amount or in the way in which it was received, as to bribe;\nWe have not the advantage of knowing the grounds on which Mr. Justice Riddell based his concurrence.\nThese reasons for reversing the judgment of the learned trial judge on this aspect of the case, with respect, appear to me to be based in part on a misunderstanding or erroneous appreciation of the evidence, and in part on a misconception of the effect of the authorities on this branch of English law.\nTo deal first with Mr. Justice Masten\u2019s view:\u2014\nThere is no evidence whatever that Durocher was to share in the defendant\u2019s profits. The evidence is that the defendant \u201cexpected to pay him a commission for his services.\u201d Neither is there any evidence that the price of the goods sold was enhanced by reason of Durocher sharing in Millman\u2019s commission. There is, therefore, nothing to indicate that the substantial interest, directly adverse to that of his principal, created by Durocher having been promised a commission by Millman was in any way, or to the slightest extent, offset by a countervailing interest in prospective profits. No doubt where it is demonstrably obvious on undisputed facts that the advantage promised by \u201cthe other side,\u201d whatever form it took, could not have created an interest in the agent in conflict with his duty to his principal (as it was in Rowland v. Chapman[10], cited by the learned judge) the right of repudiation does not arise. But the courts will not undertake an investi- gation involving a speculative weighing and balancing of opposing influences in the mind of the agent in order to determine which of them dominated. To do so would be to enter on the prohibited field of inquiry whether the bribe had been effectual. Parker v. McKenna[11], at pages 118, 124-5; Harrington v. Victoria Graving Dock[12]; Shipway v. Broadwood[13], at page 373.\nAll three of the learned appellate judges appear to have shared the opinion that in order to maintain this defence it was necessary for the defendant to establish actual fraudulent or dishonest motive or intent on the part of Millman. The learned Chief Justice speaks of the trial judge having \u201cbeen carried away\u201d by the contrary view, adding:\u2014\nit need hardly be said that that is not the law. In such cases, it is fraud and fraud only that had that effect,\ni.e., of rendering the contract voidable by the principal.\nNo doubt actual fraud must be shewn when no fiduciary relationship exists (Lands Allottment Co. v. Broad[14]; see, however, the observations on this decision of Collins L.J. in Grant v. Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate[15], at pp. 249-50). But given that relationship between one principal and the recipient of a secret commission and knowledge of it by the other principal (or his agent), who makes the agreement to pay such commission, it is quite as unnecessary (and it would seem even more clearly immaterial), to prove an actual fraudulent or dishonest motive on the part of the latter as it is to prove that the former was in fact induced by the promise of the commission to betray his trust. The fundamental principle in all these cases is that one contracting party shall not be allowed to put the agent of the other in a position which gives him an interest against his duty. The result to the agent\u2019s principal is the same whatever the motive which induced the other principal to promise the commission. The former is deprived of the services of an agent free from the bias of an influence conflicting with his duty, for which he had contracted and to which he was entitled. \u201cThe tendency of such an agreement as this,\u201d said Cockburn C.J. in Harrington v. Victoria Graving Dock[16], at page 551,\nmust be to bias the mind of the agent or other person employed and to lead him to act disloyally to his principal.\nAs Chitty L.J. said in Shipway v. Broadwood[17], at page 373:\u2014\nIn Thompson v. Haveloch[18] Lord Ellenborough said \u201cno man should be allowed to have an interest against his duty.\u201d That great principle has been applied in cases innumerable.\nIn Andrews v. Ramsay[19], at page 637, Lord Alverstone quoted with approval the following passage from Story on Agency, page 262, par. 210:\u2014\nIn this connection, also, it seems proper to state another rule in regard to the duties of agents, which is of general application, and that is, that, in matters touching the agency, agents cannot act as so to bind their principals where they have an adverse interest in themselves. This rule is founded upon the plain and obvious consideration, that the principal bargains, in the employment, for the exercise of the disinterested skill, diligence and zeal of the agent, for his own exclusive benefit. It is a confidence necessarily reposed in the agent, that he will act with a sole regard to the interests of his principal, as far as he lawfully may, and even if impartiality could possibly be presumed on the part of an agent where his own interests were concerned, that is not what the principal bargains for; and in many cases it is the very last thing which would advance his interests. The seller of an estate must be presumed to be desirous of obtaining as high a price as can fairly be obtained therefor; and the purchaser must equally be presumed to desire to buy it for as low a price as he may.\nMoreover, by whatever sophistry the person who promises the secret benefit may endeavour to persuade himself to the contrary, the instances are rare indeed in which in his inmost heart he does not hope to derive some advantage from it, direct or indirect, which from the nature of the case must involve a dereliction of duty by the agent to his own principal.\nFor gifts blind the eyes of the wise and change the words of the just. Deut. XVI., 19.\nThe same doctrine was acted on in Panama Co. v. India Rubber Co.[20], by Lord Justice James, who said at page 527:\u2014\nIn this court a surreptitous sub-contract with the agent is regarded as a bribe to him for violating or neglecting his duty.\nAnd the Lord Justice speaks of this as\na plain principle of equity which is to be enforced without regard to the particular circumstances of the case * * * You must act upon the general principle from the impossibility in which the court finds itself of ever ascertaining the real truth of the circumstances.\nHe had already said:\u2014\nAccording to my view of the law of this court I take it to be clear that any surreptitious dealing between one principal and the agent of the other principal is a fraud on such other principal cognizable in this court.\nRomer L.J. in Hovenden & Sons v. Millhoff[21], at page 43, still more definitely states the rule that the motive which induced the offer of the benefit cannot be considered:\u2014\nThe courts of law of this country have already strongly condemned and, when they could, punished the bribing of agents, and have taken a strong view as to what constitutes a bribe. I believe the mercantile community as a whole appreciate and approve of the court\u2019s views on the subject. But some persons undoubtedly hold laxer views. Not that these persons like the ugly word \u201cbribe\u201d or would excuse the giving of a bribe, if that word be used, but they differ from the courts in their view as to what constitutes a bribe. It may, therefore, be well to point out what is a bribe in the eyes of the law. Without attempting an exhaustive definition, I may say that the following is one statement of what constitutes a bribe. If a gift be made to a confidential agent with the view of inducing the agent to act in favour of the donor in relation to transactions between the donor and the agent\u2019s principal and that gift is secret as between the donor and the agent\u2014that is to say without the knowledge and consent of the principal\u2014then the gift is a bribe in the view of the law. If a bribe be once established to the court\u2019s satisfaction, then certain rules apply. Amongst them the following are now established, and in my opinion, rightly established, in the interests of morality with the view of discouraging the practice of bribery. First, the court will not inquire into the donor\u2019s motive in giving the bribe nor allow evidence to be gone into as to the motive. Secondly, the court will presume in favour of the principal and as against the briber and the agent bribed that the agent was influenced by the bribe; and this presumption is irrebuttable.\nIndeed the decision in this case is very much in point. Although a jury had negatived conspiracy between the agent and \u201cthe other side\u201d, and had estimated the loss of the principal at one farthing, the secret commission was nevertheless unhesitatingly treated by the Court of Appeal as a bribe. See also Hough v. Bolton[22], at page 789.\nIn the same judgment in which he laid down the doctrine that the secret benefit to the agent must invariably be regarded as a bribe and the promise of it as a fraud, Lord Justice James added:\u2014\nThat I take to be a clear proposition, and I take it, according to my view, to be equally clear that the defrauded principal, if he comes in time, is entitled, at his option, to have the contract rescinded, or if he elects not to have it rescinded, to have such other adequate relief as the court may think right to give him.\nThese principles of equity, so far as I am aware, have never been departed from or questioned. They have, on the contrary, been frequently recognized, approved and applied. Since the contracts sued upon in the present case still remained executory and there had been no laches on the part of the defendant such as might render repudiation inequitable, I am at a loss to understand the applicability of the distinction to which the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas alludes between the right to set aside the transaction and the right of the principal to recover from his agent the commission or other benefit received by him. Speaking generally, when the circumstances do not actually preclude the relief of rescission or render it inequitable, the same facts which will support a claim to recover the commission from the agent and damages from the other principal will justify repudiation of the contract with the latter\nNeither in Hippisley v. Knee Bros.[23], nor in Great Western Ins. Co. v. Cunliffe[24], to which the learned Chief Justice refers in this connection, did any question arise as to the effect upon the enforceability of the contract of the receipt by the agent of one of the parties of a secret benefit from the other. In neither case was the transaction in respect of which the agent received a secret allowance or gratuity the making of a contract between his principal and the person who paid such allowance or gratuity. In neither case could the payment or allowance by any possibility have given the agent an interest adverse to his principal in transacting the business for which he was employed.\nMoreover, in the Cunliffe Case[25] the circumstances were such that the court found that knowledge of the allowance should be imputed to the principal and that with such knowledge he had acquiesced in it. Barry has sworn that the agreement for splitting the commission in the present case was unknown to him. The only ground for questioning his statement is the fact that the commission is alluded to in some correspondence concerning the contracts sued upon. But the letters which contain these references were either written by Durocher or addressed to him, or, if addressed to the defendant, were placed in envelopes marked \u201cpersonal attention of Mr. Durocher,\u201d and the evidence of the practice as to the handling and disposing of correspondence in the defendant\u2019s office makes it quite probable that he never saw these letters. I have found nothing in the record to justify a reversal of the finding of the learned trial judge that the commission was \u201csecret\u201d\u2014in the sense that Barry was ignorant of it.\nAlthough there is some evidence that it was Millman\u2019s practice to split commissions with purchasers\u2019 agents, there is no evidence that that custom was so prevalent in the trade that Barry should be charged with knowledge of it\u2014if indeed knowledge of a custom involving such an essential departure from the usual relations of principal and agent could be imputed without proof that it actually existed. Robinson v. Mollett[26]; Johnson v. Kearley[27], at page 530.\nNor is this a case in which, because he did not himself contemplate remunerating Durocher for his services, Barry must be taken to have expected that he would seek remuneration from the \u201cother side,\u201d such as were the cases of Baring v. Stanton[28], and Great Western Ins. Co. v. Cunliffe25, cited by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. (See comment of Alverstone C.J. on these two decisions in Hippisley v. Knee Bros.[29], at page 7.) On the contrary, the evidence of both Barry and Durocher is that, while no definite basis was fixed, it was expected that Barry would pay Durocher for his services. Moreover, Durocher was largely indebted to Barry.\nIt may be, and not improbably is, quite true that Millman did not intend that the payment of commission to Durocher should be concealed from Barry and that he was deceived by Durocher\u2019s assurance that Barry knew what he was doing. But the law is thus stated by Collins L.J. in Grant v. Gold Exploration Co.[30], at pp. 248, 249,\u2014\nIn my opinion, if a vendor pays a commission to a buyer\u2019s agent in order to secure his help in bringing about the sale, and does not inform the buyer of the fact, he cannot defend the transaction, if impeached by the buyer, who had, in fact, had no notice, by proving that he believed that the agent had disclosed the circumstances to his principal. I think it is clearly established that in such circumstances the buyer would be entitled to rescind the purchase; see Panama Telegraph Co. v. India Rubber Works Co., where it is pointed out both by Malins V.C. and by the Lords Justices that bona fides without disclosure will not suffice to bar rescission * * *\nI think that if he takes the hazardous course of paying a sum to the buyer\u2019s agent in order to secure his help, and does not himself communicate it, he must at least accept the risk of the agent\u2019s not doing so. He has taken a course which can be validated only by actual disclosure to the opposite principal.\nAs Chitty L.J. said in Shipway v. Broadwood[31], at page 373:\u2014\nIt was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to inform the defendant of the promise * * * if he wished to escape the consequences of having made it * * * The real evil is not the payment of the money, but the secrecy attending it.\nThere was nothing in the present case amounting to acquiescence or waiver by Barry of his right to rescind on account of the payment of the secret commission to his agent. He discovered the commission arrangement only after the contracts sued upon had been entered into. Where that is so a very clear and a very strong case indeed must be made to support an allegation of acquiescence or waiver. De Bussche v. Alt[32], at page 314; Bartram & Son v. Lloyd[33].\nNor does the failure to set up the defence based on the secret commission until the facts concerning it had been disclosed at the trial present a formidable obstacle. Shipway v. Broadwood[34]; Hough v. Bolton[35]. Moreover, the trial judge exercised a discretion in allowing the amendment setting up this defence which, in my opinion, should not have been interfered with on appeal.\nFinally the fact that the agreement to split the commission was not made by the plaintiffs themselves, but by their agent Millman, is not an answer to the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to repudiate. What Millman did was done while purporting to act within the scope of his employment, and in the course of the service for which he was engaged by the plaintiffs; and it is immaterial that it may have been in his own interest as well as in, or even to the exclusion of, that of the plaintiffs. Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[36] The defendant\u2019s agent was given the disqualifying adverse interest which made him incapable of binding his principal.\nMy apology for having dealt with this appeal at what may seem inordinate length is that when a judgment which deals with matter so fundamental is reversed, courtesy to the learned judges who pronounced it demands an adequate statement of the grounds on which it is held to have been erroneous; and also that it is of the utmost importance that it should be clearly understood that in this, the court of last resort in Canada, the rule of equity on which the judgment allowing this appeal rests is regarded as inflexible and its application as universal.\nIn conclusion I cannot do better than quote some apposite observations from the judgments of Lord Alverstone C.J. and Kennedy J. in Hippisley v. Knee Bros.[37] Mr. Justice Kennedy said at page 9:\u2014\nIf a principal when contracting for the services of an agent, is told that the agent is going to receive a profit out of the agency beyond the remuneration that the principal is to pay, there can be no possible harm in the agent receiving it; but, unless it had been in this way authorized by the principal, the receipt of such a profit is an indefensible act. I quite agree with my Lord that in this case the defendants were only doing what they honestly believed to be right having regard to a general practice; but I should be sorry to say that the practice itself is an honest one, if it is to be taken as extending to cases in which the fact that the profit will be received and kept by the agent is not brought to the knowledge of the employer.\nAnd Lord Alverstone, at page 7:\u2014\nUnfortunately there appears to prevail in commercial circles in which perfectly honourable men desire to play an honourable part an extraordinary laxity in the view taken of the earning of secret profits by agents. The sooner it is recognized that such profits ought to be disapproved of by men in an honourable profession, the better it will be for commerce in all its branches.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs in this court and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, McKay, Dods & Grant.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Kerr & McNevin.\n[1] 36 Ont.

Harrell (Defendant) Respondent.\n1917: February 14; 1917: May 1.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nContract\u2014Fraud\u2014Misrepresentation\u2014Evidence\u2014Bu den of proof\u2014Promissory note\u2014Renewal\u2014Jury trial\u2014General verdict\u2014Specific answers\u2014Judgment non obstante veredicto\u2014Order 58, r. 4, Supreme Court Rules of British Columbia, 1906.\nThe respondent made a promissory note, upon the assurance by one Vanstone, a local manager of the bank appellant, that no part of the proceeds of it should be applied otherwise than as agreed upon between themselves. The respondent, however, with full knowledge of the violation of such assurance, but on being promised by said Vanstone that he \"would take care of the loan,\" was induced to renew the note. In an action by the appellant for the payment of the renewal note the trial judge put certain questions to the jury which were answered, but a general verdict in the respondent's favour was also rendered by the jury.\nHeld, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that no reasonable view of the evidence supports the conclusion that the renewal of the note sued upon was procured by fraud. That being the sole defence, the general verdict for the defendant must be set aside.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014Misrepresentation, such as in the circumstances of the present case, even if it amounted to what was called legal fraud, is not sufficient to found an action for deceit, but actual fraud must be proven.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014The general verdict in the respondent's favor being inconsistent and irreconcilable with the jury's specific answers to the questions put, must be ignored; and the verdict for the appellant as entered by the trial judge, and based on these specific answers, should be restored.\nPer Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The dishonest expression of an intention having an important bearing upon the business which contracting parties are about may be just as gross a fraud in law as a misrepresentation of any other fact. Per Idington and Duff JJ. (dissenting).\u2014The admission of the evidence of the assurances alleged to have been given by Vanstone and acted upon by respondent in executing the renewals, was not in any way in conflict with the rule which forbids the reception of parol evidence to contradict, vary or add to the contents of a written instrument which the parties have intended to be the record of a transaction.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014The execution of renewals by respondent with a knowledge of fraud, standing by itself, is indubitably an \"unequivocal act\" whereby he was manifesting his intention to treat the contract as binding upon him, unless attendant circumstances justify the inference that the execution of these renewals was to be treated as a provisional measure until some future settlement might be arrived at.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Upon the evidence, respondent's acts in renewing the note were unequivocal and amounted to communications of his election not to repudiate his liability.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (23 B.C. Rep. 202) reversed, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Murphy J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe Rex Amusement Company, of which one D. H. Wilkie (a member of the firm of Campbell & Wilkie), was a director and treasurer, was in financial difficulties. One Vanstone, manager of a local branch of the bank appellant, induced the respondent to make in favor of the Amusement Company a note for $10,000 to be discounted by the appellant, and the respondent was to be secured by a chattel mortgage on the furniture and accessories of the company, which however were subject to unpaid vendors' liens. The firm of Campbell & Wilkie was also creditor of the Amusement Company, and the bank appellant was interested in the liquidation of their claim. The chattel mortgage security could have any value only if the claims of the lien-holders were discharged by the proceeds of the note, and the respondent alleges that he was assured by Vanstone that it would be so and that no part of such proceeds should be applied on Campbell & Wilkie's account. But $5,000 of these proceeds were so applied. Respondent, with full knowledge of such violation of the assurance given, renewed his note, though for a smaller amount, payments having been made on account, and in his evidence, respondent alleged that he gave this renewal on the faith of a promise by Vanstone that he would protect him against liability on it.\nOn an action brought by the bank appellant, a trial was held, with a common jury. Answers were handed in by the jury to the questions put, and a general verdict was also given in favor of the respondent. The trial judge found the specific answers inconsistent with the general verdict and he gave judgment for the bank appellant for the amount of the note. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, finding that there was evidence to support the general verdict in favor of respondent.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. and C. C. Robinson for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I can find no ground on which the respondent can avoid liability on the renewal note which he signed.\nThe trial judge in his reasons for judgment says:\u2014\"The case went to the jury on the issue that there had been again fraud in obtaining these renewals * * * the case must now be decided on the issues as submitted to the jury.\" Prior to the case of Derry v. Peek [2], it might perhaps have been held that misrepresentation such as in the present circumstances amounted to what. was sometimes called legal fraud. By the decision of the House of Lords, however, it must be considered to have been conclusively established that this is not sufficient, but that the law is that actual fraud is essential to found an action for deceit. The expression of an opinion honestly held, \"the language of hope, expectation and confident belief,\" will not amount to a misrepresentation having legal consequences.\nThe jury have expressly negatived actual fraud and I think it must be recognized that their verdict for the defendant was given on the assumption that the misrepresentations by which, according to their finding, the respondent was induced to renew that note were sufficient for their verdict.\nThe learned trial judge held that if the jury intended by their answers to impute fraud to Vanstone at that juncture there was no evidence on which they could make such a finding. Perhaps, in view of this, the correct course would have been for the judge not to have left the question to the jury.\nI am content to restore his judgment but reducing the rate of interest from 8% to 5%.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge in plaintiff's favour for the amount of the note sued on restored.\nThe action was tried before Murphy J. and a jury. In charging them the learned judge said with respect to the questions he asked them to answer:\u2014\nThere are at any rate three propositions in it and they involve some law. Therefore it will be very much in the interests of the litigants if you will answer these questions. The questions are only put to enable you to understand what I have said to you, and bring before your minds exactly what is required to be dealt with in deciding the case,\nand added:\nI have been requested by counsel to tell you that it is the law of British Columbia that you need not answer these questions. I have already told you that it would be very much in the interests of the parties, in my opinion, if you would answer them, but it is the law of this province that you can bring in a verdict for the plaintiff or for the defendant without answering the questions at all.\nThe jury answered most of the questions put to them and added a finding of a general verdict for the defendant.\nThe trial judge concluded that the specific answers given by the jury to the questions asked them made their general verdict for the defendant impossible and entitled the plaintiffs to judgment.\nOn appeal this judgment was set aside and a verdict entered for the defendant.\nMacdonald C. J. did not think the answers and the general verdict inconsistent and concluded that accepting both the defendant was entitled to judgment.\nGalliher J. A. agreed that the answers and the general verdict could be read together and was of the opinion that neither the renewal in February, 1915, of the original note given by defendant induced as it was by the promise of the branch bank manager Vanstone that the defendant would not be called upon to pay, nor the facts found by the jury as to the subsequent renewal given to the manager Ball and sued upon could be regarded as an election by defendant to confirm the original contract.\nMartin J. A. thought the answers to the questions should be disregarded and the general verdict alone considered and that there was evidence to support this general verdict.\nMcPhillips J. A. held there should be a new trial on the ground that the verdict was not unanimous and the jury had not been out the full three hours which under the law of British Columbia must elapse before any verdict other than a unanimous one could be received.\nI am not able to agree with the learned judges who held that the specific answers of the jury to the questions put to them by the trial judge are consistent or reconcilable with their general verdict or that the specific answers should be disregarded and the general verdict alone accepted.\nThe law of British Columbia on this question is the same as that of England. The jury have the right to find a general verdict and ignore specific questions put to them. If they do so and render a general verdict only or if no questions are asked them, then any reasons which of their own motion they may give for their general verdict may be treated as surplusage and the general verdict alone considered. There seems to be some conflict between the authorities as to whether the same result would follow answers given to questions of the trial judge as to their reasons for their general verdict, after it has been rendered in cases where they had not been asked previously to giving their verdict to give their reasons.\nIn this case, however, and apparently with consent of both parties and certainly without any objections, questions were put to the jury by the trial judge and they were told they were not obliged to answer them unless they chose. They however did answer most of them and added a general verdict for defendant.\nUnder these circumstances, I think the general verdict being inconsistent and irreconcilable with the jury's specific answers to the questions put must be ignored and the verdict entered as was done by the trial judge on these specific answers for the plaintiffs.\nThe jury found in answer to the first four questions, and there was evidence justifying the finding, that the respondent was induced to sign the original note through the fraud of the appellant's branch manager, Vanstone.\nCounsel for the appellant admitted that on these findings it was Harrell's right upon discovery of the fraud to repudiate his liability but contended that, although in February, 1915, he discovered the fraud he waived his right and signed a renewal note for the unpaid balance of the original note.\nThe jury found that he was induced to sign this renewal note \"by promises in reference to his liability made by Vanstone with the intention that Harrell should act upon them,\" and they stated the details of such promises in answer to the 5th question by saying that they accepted Harrell's evidence and \"the architect's statement that Vanstone said to him (Harrell) that he (Vanstone) would take care of Harrell's loan and would see that he was looked after. That he had taken care of Harrell so far and would still do so.\"\nThe jury further found that in signing that renewal Harrell acted upon these promises and that Vanstone's promises were not intentionally fraudulent.\nA very strong argument was advanced by Mr. Nesbitt that the defendant by signing this renewal note in February, definitely elected not to repudiate the transaction on the ground of the fraud already then discovered and known to him and that Vanstone's promise made at the time that if he (Harrell) did sign it he would not be held liable, did not release him from the liability he incurred by signing the renewal.\nIn other words, as I understand the contention, it was that Vanstone's promises which induced the signing of the renewal note in February were mere promises as to the future only, that they were not fraudulently made and that in so far as it was attempted to construe them as an agreement that the defendant should not be liable it must fail as such a verbal agreement would be a contradiction of the terms of the renewal note and that at any rate no such issue was presented at the trial. The trial judge says in hi judgment:\u2014\nThe case went to the jury on the issue that there had been again fraud in obtaining these renewals. Possibly it might have been contended that there was at the time of the renewal an agreement not to enforce the note, but this line was not taken before the jury, entailing as it would have grave difficulties under the decisions relative to introducing parol evidence to vary the tenor of a promissory note. Whatever the reason, the case must now be decided on the issues as submitted to the jury.\nI admit the great force of the contention and it does seem clear on principle that no evidence of a verbal agreement made at the time of the signing of the note contradicting its terms would be admissible.\nI however prefer to base my judgment upon the specific findings of the jury with respect to the further renewal note of August, 1915, now sued on and signed by defendant at the request of the manager of the bank in Vancouver, Mr. Ball. At this interview with Ball, Harrell went fully into the whole transaction with Ball. Harrell says in his main examination:\u2014\nI told him then what the arrangement was I had made with Vanstone, and the way Vanstone had acted in the matter\u2014that he hadn't carried o t his agreement * * * and * * * that he had taken this money and applied it to Campbell & Wilkie's account when it should have gone to pay off these liens. * * * I told him the arrangement I had * * * with Vanstone * * * that he was to carry it, and it was never to cost me a dollar, and that he would see to it. * * * I told him that I didn't owe the note. I told him all the arrangements I had with Mr. Vanstone, that I was never to pay this thing. Ball's reply was, \"Yes, Mr. Vanstone has done a lot of foolish things down there. It is not the only foolish thing he has done.\" Ball then told him that the Amusement Company could not even pay the interest at that time, and said, \"You give me a demand note and as soon as the Rex Amusement Company get this money or Wood, Vallance & Leggatt are in a position to pay you any money, they can apply it on this note, and we won't have to wait its stipulated length of time.\" Thinking (says the defendant) everything was all right, I simply signed the demand note and gave it back to him.\"\nThe seventh question put to the jury and their answer is as follows:\u2014\nDid Ball by word or conduct or both lead Harrell to believe that Harrell would incur no liability by signing the renewal note and thereby induced Harrell to sign the note? Ans. No.\nNow it seems to me beyond reasonable doubt under this evidence of the defendant himself and this finding of the jury that the defendant signed the note sued on with full knowledge of Vanstone's broken, unfulfilled promises, and without any promise or inducement by words or conduct on Ball's part leading him to believe he was not incurring liability upon it and without any fraud practised upon him.\nBy doing so under the circumstances stated and found he definitely elected not to rely upon the alleged fraud in connection with the original note, and I cannot see that he has any legitimate defence to the action. As I have already said, I think the general verdict is irreconcilable with the jury's specific findings on the question No. 7 and is also contrary to the evidence and must be ignored and judgment entered upon the specific finding of the jury for the plaintiffs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014I do not think we should interfere with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal relative to any question herein arising out of the rules in British Columbia governing the time within which the jury are entitled to render a majority verdict or the right of a jury to render a general verdict.\nIn the broader way of looking at the case it is reduced to a question of fraud or no fraud in the representation made by appellant's agent and whether or not such fraud (if any) had been waived by the respondent, or he had not made his election in regard thereto, the general verdict is I think maintainable.\nWe were strongly pressed in argument by the proposition that the misrepresentation which can be held to support a defence of fraud must be of an existent fact.\nNumerous cases of undoubted authority were cited to maintain that proposition but the question of misrepresentation of an intention as a fact was either brushed aside by the statement, equally undoubted in law, that honest intention honestly expressed, which in the result proved disappointing, could not be held fraudulent or, so far as the authorities are concerned, was passed by as if there could be no such thing.\nI am of opinion that the dishonest expression of an intention having an important bearing upon that business which contracting parties are about, may be just as gross a fraud in law as a misrepresentation of any other fact.\nIt may be more difficult to prove such a fraud than one relative to the existence or non\u2014existence of some physical object.\nNevertheless it may be established, as was held in the case of Edgington v. Fitzmaurice [3].\nIn that case there were some minor misrepresentations of fact as well as the main one expressing to investors the intention on the part of the company to apply the money to be got by such representations as made, to certain named purposes which would indicate a possibly prosperous condition of the company's affairs when in truth the intention was to apply the money to other and more pressing needs which if truly stated would or might have indicated the reverse, and tended to prevent possible investments.\nI think we can apply the law laid down there to the facts in this case. There is a very striking resemblance between the cases as to the nature of the intention.\nThe only difference I can see between these cases is that relative to the position of those there making the representations and that of the appellant's agent here.\nIt may be somewhat more difficult to understand why such an agent should misrepresent his intentions than it was to understand the directors doing so in that case.\nThe expression of Mr. Ball as to the agent in question, or his management of the dealing with respondent not being his only foolish act as an agent, when coupled with his relations with the firm, which profited by his success, in so inducing the respondent to become liable at all, helps to solve the mystery.\nIt is quite clear when one realizes the financial condition of the Rex Amusement Company and the position of the firm of Campbell & Wilkie as the creditors of that company, and debtors to the appellant, how such an agent might be so tempted.\nAnd if he assented there is indubitable proof in the immediate transfer by the appellant's agent of a large part of the proceeds of the respondent's note to the said firm's account that he never in truth could have had the intention, as he represented, that they were not to get any of the proceeds and that they should go to other purposes desired by the respondent.\nIt is equally clear how very important it was for the respondent, dependent upon security he had taken to indemnify himself, to be assured that the money being raised by his suretyship should not go to the said firm but be applied to liquidate liens or some of the liens on the company's buildings and thereby improve his position.\nLeaving the firm to help itself in many conceivable ways might help to strengthen the respondent's position. The jury have by their verdict established the fact.\nCan the respondents, however, be held entitled to the benefit of that in the action upon the renewal note now in question?\nOr had the respondent not elected to waive and waived the fraud committed on him by his repeated renewals, though protesting all the time, and accepting reassurances of the agent that he would never have to pay a cent of the debt?\nHis doing so may not have been prudent, but I cannot hold that he thereby elected to waive his right to repudiate, on the ground of fraud, the original transaction which was the only foundation for liability at all.\nTo give effect to the contention that he had so elected would be but to help the successful promotion of the fraudulent purpose of him who had committed the fraud.\nIt seems idle to contend that to admit the evidence of these assurances was an infringement of the rule against varying by oral evidence the obligation contained in a written contract. It is not at all in that sense that such oral evidence was admissible, but to rebut the possible presumption arising from signing renewals, of his election to abide by the contract, and forego his right to repudiate for fraud, the very basis of the transaction and hence that appellant could claim nothing upon such a promissory note for which there could be found no consideration if only founded on fraud.\nThe evidence, for example, admissible to prove fraud itself is not tendered to vary the nature of the written instrument itself.\nAccommodation makers can often in particular circumstances shew by oral evidence why they should not be held liable, but such evidence is not adduced to suggest the slightest variation of the written instrument.\nThe evidence so understood was admissible and entitled to weight.\nI think when so applied there is no more reason to contend the fraud had been waived, or respondent had elected not to repudiate, than there was in the case of Clough v. The London & North Western Railway Co.[4], or Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co. [5], at 1277 et seq., and still less than in Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd[6].\nThese three cases which suggest that the respondent might well have taken the ground that as a surety he was entitled to have come into court, and on the facts that are apparent, or at least possibly easier of establishment than that he risked on the issue raised, he was not treated as a surety should be, and asked as he does in fact to have the note delivered up to to be cancelled. The law sought unsuccessfully to be applied in Hamilton v. Watson [7], and illustrated in cases cited therein, if followed, might have brought the result reached much easier.\nThe facts may all be in the pleading but are not so marshalled as we might desire to see in making such a case, or the principles of law I refer to clearly rested upon.\nHowever, I need not pursue that, for I think in whichever way one looks at the whole of the evidence and questions tried, the general verdict is maintainable, and I have no doubt of the justice of the result, especially in view of the suggestion I have just made of the applicability of the facts found in the answers to the questions put to the jury, had we need to resort thereto.\nA clearer conception on all hands of the many sided sort of case there is in evidence and possibility of it being presented from other points of view than taken, may have been desirable but in my view no new trial is needed.\nThe appellant cannot now be heard to complain of the learned trial judge's charge which was not against it on the issues as fought out and the evidence justifies a general verdict for the defendant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014In this appeal I think there must be a new trial although the necessity is regrettable. I agree with the Court of Appeal that there was evidence which could not be withdrawn from the jury on the issue of the voidability of the promissory note sued upon because of the alleged deliberate misleading of the defendant as to the purpose for which the bank was making the advance. But there was another issue raised by the pleadings in respect of which the course of the trial was so unsatisfactory as in my opinion to entitle the appellant bank to a new trial. The issue was this; the bank contends that admittedly after full knowledge of the fraud alleged the respondent executed a series of renewal notes and that this conduct constituted an election to affirm the contract as a binding contract, notwithstanding the fraud within the rule that a person entitled to avoid a contract by fraud, who, with knowledge of fraud, does some unequivocal act whereby he manifests his intention to treat the contract as binding upon him, thereby makes his election against attacking it in such a fashion as to preclude him from doing so forever.\nThe view of the trial judge was that as regards this issue there was in truth no question for the jury because the facts admitted by the defendant Harrell entitled the bank to judgment upon it and that is the first point to be considered under this topic.\nSuch an issue obviously raises two questions. First, the question of the knowledge of the person alleged to have elected to abandon the remedy he is seeking to enforce and, secondly, the significance of the act relied upon as an unequivocal act manifesting the intention to abandon his remedy. As to the first question, I gather from the charge of the trial judge that Harrell's knowledge of the fraud was not disputed at the trial, although looking at the evidence alone I should have had little hesitation in holding that there was a question for the jury whether Harrell had brought home to him before the execution of the renewals the fact found by the jury, namely, that Vanstone was deliberately misleading him as to the intention of the bank with respect to the application of the advances\u2014in other words, that Harrell's conduct was not only morally reprehensible but of a kind entitling him in law to rescind the contract; and one may remark in passing that it seems a little paradoxical that knowledge of the legal right to impeach the contract should, in this court, be imputed to Harrell from the knowledge of facts which the Chief Justice of this court holds conferred no such right upon him.\nI proceed, however, upon the assumption founded upon the observations of the learned trial judge and strongly supported by the frame of the question submitted without objection that Harrell's knowledge was admitted.\nThe answer to the second question turns upon a point of law touching the admissibility of evidence. The execution of a series of renewals by Harrell with a knowledge of fraud standing by itself comes indubitably under the category of \"unequivocal act\" within the meaning of the rule above referred to; that is so because ex facie the renewal notes executed by Harrell affirmed Harrell's responsibility and affirmed his responsibility under the original contract (the promissory note first executed) since renewals given in the circumstances in which these were given do not destroy the original obligation, they merely suspend the debt. (Byles on Bills p. 257.) On behalf of the respondent, however, it is said that in order to determine whether or not the execution of the renewals with knowledge of fraud manifested an intention on Harrell's part to abandon his rights we must ascertain the circumstances known to Harrell and known to the bank and the communications which passed between Harrell and Vanstone, the bank's representative, acting on behalf of the bank in which and with reference to which the renewals were given; and it is argued since the attend- ant circumstances justify the inference that it was understood by Harrell and by the bank, that is to say, by Vanstone, acting for the bank, that the execution of the renewals was between them to be treated as a provisional measure, all questions as to Harrell's ultimate responsibility being postponed until the affairs of the Theatre Amusement Co., for which Harrell was surety, were finally sifted, it follows that the execution of the renewals cannot be properly regarded as an \"unequivocal act.\"\nThere can, I think, be little doubt that in principle the argument, up to this point, is well founded. If a letter had been written expressly embodying the terms of such an understanding, nobody would argue that the execution of the renewals amounted to an election and if the existence of such an understanding were a proper inference from facts legally admissible in evidence and proved the case could not legitimately be distinguished from the case in which the understanding was expressed in a written stipulation.\nIn the present case oral communications between the parties were proved, that is to say, between Harrell and Vanstone, which in themselves would support the conclusion that Harrell's execution of the renewals was not unequivocal, that is to say, that it did not convey to Vanstone the belief in a fact and was not calculated to convey to Vanstone any such belief, that Harrell was abandoning any rights he might prove to have arising out of the fraud if the bank should ultimately attempt to hold him accountable. Here emerges the point of the controversy, was evidence of these communications admissible? Broadly speaking, they consisted of assurances alleged to be given by Vanstone, and acted upon by Harrell in executing the renewals that he (it would be a question for the jury whether Vanstone might reasonably consider Harrell's assurance to be given on behalf of the bank) would protect Harrell against responsibility. The jury has in fact found that such assurances were given, and that Harrell in fact acted upon them in executing the renewals. On behalf of the appellant bank it is contended that evidence of these assurances is not admissible as being evidence contradicting the terms of the documents which constituted the contract between the parties.\nI have come to the conclusion that this contention on the part of the appellant bank is not well founded. Fraud of the kind relied upon by the respondent gives a person wrongfully affected by it a right to elect whether the contract shall be avoided or not. So long as no election takes place the contract remains on foot and especially where the contract takes the form of a negotiable instrument, the wronged person may easily lose his remedy entirely in consequence of the innocent third person acquiring rights.\nThe admission of the evidence was not in any way in conflict with the rule which forbids the reception of parol evidence to contradict, vary or add to the contents of a written instrument which the parties have intended to be the record of a transaction. The respondent does not attempt to contradict, vary or add to the instrument but to impeach the consideration for it, the original obligation which he alleges to be voidable by reason of the original misrepresentation, a course always held admissible and consistent with the maintenance unimpaired of the above mentioned rule. Goldshede v. Swan [8]; Morrell v. Cowan[9].\nThe respondent's prim\u00e2 facie right to impeach the consideration being attacked on the ground that he abandoned it by executing the renewals with knowledge of the alleged fraud, it was open to him to shew circumstances from which an agreement could be inferred that his act in doing so was to be treated as done in ignorance of the circumstances pointing to the fraud, of which he was in fact aware.\nSuch evidence being admissible it follows, I confess I can perceive no reason for doubt upon the point, that this issue presented a question which it was the duty of the learned trial judge to leave to the jury. In view of the difference of opinion between some of my learned brethren and myself upon the point it is right to dwell a little upon it. The question was much debated in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Rly. Co. v. Slattery [10], and there was much difference of opinion upon it whether a trial judge might withdraw an issue of fact from the consideration of the jury where there is conflicting evidence, but where\u2014the onus resting upon one side\u2014there is, to use the language of Lord Blackburn, \"no reasonable evidence to rebut it.\" The majority of the House took the view that it is beyond the province of the trial judge where there is any evidence that is anything more than a scintilla adduced by the party on whom the onus of proof lies to withdraw the issue from the jury and the distinction between \"cases where there is no evidence and those where there is some evidence though not enough properly to be acted upon by the jury,\" is a distinction which must be recognized. (Paguin v. Beauclerc [11].) Here the incidence of the issue was as a matter of substantive law on the appellant bank. Assuming that proof of execution of the renewals with knowledge of the facts constituting the fraud alleged would, in the absence of countervailing evidence, justify a direction to the jury to find a verdict for the appellant bank upon this issue, it is doubly clear that as against the respondent who was not supporting the burden of the issue such a direction could not after production of evidence of the assurances referred to properly be given.\nThe issue ought, therefore, to have been submitted to the jury. In concrete form for the purposes of this case the question for the jury was this: Did the respondent by his conduct in executing the renewals considered in the light of the communications which had passed between him and Vanstone and from the point of view of reasonable men accustomed to business, manifest on his part an intention to abandon his right to avoid the obligation he had ex facie undertaken in favour of the bank in such a way as to lead Vanstone, in other words, the bank, to believe that he had made that choice? This form of the question, I may say in passing, is based upon the judgment of Lord Blackburn in Scarf v. Jardine [12], at pp. 360 and 361, a case of a somewhat different character but which Lord Blackburn held to be governed by the principles expounded in the judgment of the Court of Exchequer in Clough v. London & North Western Railway Co. [13]; a judgment which Lord Blackburn mentions was written by himself although delivered by Mr. Justice Mellor. In Codling v. Mowlem & Co. [14], at pp. 66 and 67, Mr. Justice Atkins applies the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in Curtis v. Williamson [15], at page 59, in which it is stated that \"in general the question of election can only be properly dealt with as a question of fact for the jury.\"\nThis question was neither in substance nor in form submitted to the jury as one of the specific issues on which they were asked to pass. And it cannot be contended that any decision upon it is involved in the general verdict because the learned trial judge's charge leaves it almost untouched; indeed, the one observation directly pointed to the question, namely, that the defendant was bound to elect within a reasonable time, is an observation which cannot be supported by authority [16], at p. 35.\nIt is quite true that the jury finds in the answer to one of the specific questions submitted that the respondent was induced to execute the renewals upon the assurances already referred to; but the ultimate question involved in the issue of election or no election, which was a question for the jury, is not dealt with.\nIt follows therefore that there must be a new trial. It cannot be said that the Court of Appeal was invested with authority to give judgment for either the plaintiff or the defendant and that one or the other of them has made out a case entitling him to such a judgment.\nAny power possessed by the Court of Appeal to give judgment in this case is derived from Order 58, Rule 4, which enables the court on an appeal to \"draw inferences of fact and to make such further or other order as the case may require.\" This rule has been the subject of a good deal of discussion and it must be taken as settled that it applies to the case of an appeal from a judgment after trial by a judge and jury, McPhee v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway. Co. [17]; Dominion Atlantic v. Starratt (not reported); and that it enables the court in cases in which, although there was some evidence for the jury (and the trial judge consequently would be obliged to give effect to the verdict), to give judgment either against or in absence of a find- ing on the whole case or on a particular issue involved in favour of the party on whom the burden of proof does not lie on the ground that no reasonable view of the evidence could justify a verdict in favour of the party on whom the onus probandi falls. That is settled by the decision in McPhee's Case [18] (see p. 53) and the authorities therein referred to.\nBut has the court power under this rule to give judgment in favour of the party on whom the law casts the burden of proof?\nThe discussion of this question requires some reference to the senses in which the term \"burden of proof\" is employed. These are conveniently indicated in the treatise on evidence in Lord Halsbury's Collection, vol. 13, at pp. 433 and 434, in the following paragraph:\u2014\nIn applying the rule, however, a distinction is to be observed between the burden of proof as a matter of substantive law or pleading, and the burden of proof as a matter of adducing evidence. The former burden is fixed at the commencement of the trial by the state of the pleadings, or their equivalent, and is one that never changes under any circumstances whatever; and if, after all the evidence has been given by both sides, the party having this burden on him has failed to discharge it, the case should be decided against him. * * *\nThe burden of proof, in the sense of adducing evidence, on the other hand, is a burden which may shift continually throughout the trial, according as the evidence in one scale or the other preponderates. This burden rests upon the party who would fail if no evidence at all, or no more evidence, as the case may be, were adduced by either side. In other words, it rests, before any evidence whatever is given, upon the party who has the burden of proof on the pleadings, i.e., who asserts the affirmative of the issue; and it rests, after evidence is gone into, upon the party against whom, at the time the question arises, judgment would be given if no further evidence were adduced by either side.\nAs regards the issue of election raised by the appellant bank in answer to the respondent's defence of fraud, the burden of proof was cast by the pleadings upon the former, but the burden of proof in the second of the two senses indicated in the passage just quoted, would have been shifted by proof of the execution of the renewals coupled with an admission of the respondent's knowledge of the fraud at the time of the execution of them. These facts, however, being coupled with further evidence, the evidence of the assurances alleged to have been given by Vanstone, the onus remained upon the appellant bank in the first sense to establish to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact that the respondent had elected not to raise the defence he now relies upon. The jury has in fact accepted the respondent's testimony as to the assurances and I have already said sufficient to shew that, in my judgment, these assurances being treated as proved there was a question which the jury might not unreasonably find in favour of the respondent; and I am satisfied that on the same hypothesis a verdict in favour of the appellant bank if the jury had so found could not have been set aside as unreasonable.\nSuch being the circumstances of this particular case the Court of Appeal could not consistently with sound principle give judgment in favour either of the appellant bank or of the respondent.\nI add for the purpose of avoiding a misconception that it is unnecessary to express an opinion as to the power of the Court of Appeal to give judgment in favour of the appellant bank on this issue (in respect of which the onus, in the first of the senses above mentioned, was cast upon it by the pleadings) if the correct view had been that there was no reasonable evidence to outweigh or bring to an equipoise the considerations which from the facts alone of the execution of the renewals and the respondent's knowledge of the fraud would require the inference to be drawn that the respondent had elected to abandon his remedy. I should be disposed in such a case to apply the reasoning of Lord Blackburn in Dublin etc. Rly. Co. v. Slattery, [19] at pp. 1200 and 1202, but as the point does not arise I express no decided opinion upon it. I may add that the rule as to the burden of proof to which I have just referred is admirably illustrated in the judgments of Brett LJ. in Pickup v. Thames Ins. Co. [20], at page 599; in Ajum Goolam Hossen & Co. v. Union Marine Ins. Co. [21], at page 366; and Lindsay v. Klein [22], at page 204.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The Rex Amusement Co. was in financial difficulties. The defendant, on being secured by a chattel mortgage on its furniture and accessories (which, however, were subject to unpaid vendors liens) agreed, in March, 1914, to make in its favour a promissory note for $10,000 to be discounted by the plaintiff bank. In addition to the lien-holders the firm of Campbell & Wilkie were also large creditors of the company and the bank was interested in the liquidation of their claim. The value to the defendant of his chattel mortgage security would depend upon the claims of the lien-holders being discharged or substantially reduced. He asserts that as an inducement to him to give the company his note he was given by the bank manager, Vanstone, an assurance that no part of the proceeds of it should be applied on Campbell & Wilkie's account. In violation of that assurance (if given) $5,000 of those proceeds was immediately so applied. The defendant, however, was afterwards apprised of that fact and with full knowledge of it, in February, 1915, he renewed the company's note for a smaller amount to which the bank's claim had been reduced by payments in the interval. In his evidence at the trial he alleged that he gave this renewal on the faith of a promise by Vanstone that he would protect him against liability on it. Concurrently with the giving of this renewal, however, the defendant obtained from the company's landlords an undertaking that they would collect the company's earnings, that after making necessary disbursements for expenses and on account of lien payments and taking for themselves $1,000 a month on arrears of rent, they would hand any balance of the net receipts to the defendant to be applied on his chattel mortgage, and that after their arrears of rent should have been reduced to $6,000 they would distribute the net receipts pro rat\u00e2 between the two accounts\u2014their own and the defendant's. At this time the defendant appears to have acted in reliance on the payments which he expected to receive under this arrangement sufficing to meet his liability on the note. This expectation was not realized, and in August, 1915, the company being again on the verge of an assignment, the defendant signed the renewal note sued on for $6,448. On the occasion of this renewal he saw not Vanstone but Mr. Ball, the manager of the main office of the bank at Vancouver. His own account of this interview shews that he was fully cognizant of the payment of $5,000 which had been made to Campbell & Wilkie, as he claims in breach of the original understanding which he had with Vanstone, and that he asserted that he had been thereby relieved from liability on the note. Yet he gave a renewal note payable on demand, no doubt in the hope that money to meet it would be forthcoming under the arrangement with the landlords.\nProbably because the defendant's advisers appreciated the legal obstacle in the way of attempting to establish by oral testimony anything in the nature of an agreement by Vanstone with the defendant inconsistent with the liability evidenced by his note, the only defence pleaded was that the note had been procured by fraudulent misrepresentation.\nThis action was tried by a jury. Under instructions that they might return a general verdict and were not obliged to answer the questions put to them (although the learned trial judge expressed his opinion that it was advisable that they should do so) the jury returned the following verdict:\u2014\n1. Was the making of the note induced by any representations made by Vanstone to Harrell? 7 in favour, 1 opposed.\n2. If so, were such misrepresentations false to the knowledge of Vanstone and made with intent that Harrell should act on them? 6 in favour, 2 opposed.\n3. If so, what were such representations? Give full particulars. That Vanstone intended to allow part of the money obtained by loan to be paid to Campbell & Wilkie after promising not to do so.\n3a. Did Harrell sign the note relying on such representations? Not answered.\n4. After Harrell became aware that such fraudulent misrepresentations had been made, was he induced to renew the note by any promises in reference to his liability made by Vanstone with the intention that Harrell should act upon them? 6 for, 2 opposed.\n5. If so, give details of such promises made by Vanstone. By taking Harrell's evidence here and the straightforward manner it was given, and the architect's statement that Vanstone said to him that he (Vanstone) would take care of Harrell's loan and would see that he (Harrell) was looked after. That he had taken care of Harrell so far and would still do so.\n5a. Did Harrell act upon such promises? 6 in favour, 2 opposed.\n6. Were Vanstone's promises fraudulent? In regard to question 5, Vanstone's promises were not intentionally fraudulent.\n7. Did Ball by words or conduct or both lead Harrell to believe that Harrell would incur no liability by signing the renewal note and thereby induced Harrell to sign the note? No.\n8. If \"yes,\" did Ball, when causing Harrell to believe this, intend to hold Harrell if the bank failed to get its money from the Rex Amusement Company?\n9. Did Harrell act on such belief? 8 and 9 answered by 7.\nWe the undersigned jury find a verdict in favour of the defendant.\nFor the defendant it is contended that the answers to the questions should be ignored and effect given only to the general verdict in his favour, because the questions are not completely answered and because, even if they were, the general verdict must prevail.\nThe only question unanswered is No. 3a. It was so left, no doubt, because the jury regarded it as covered by the answer to the first question. If the defendant was induced to give the note by Vanstone's representations, it would certainly seem to follow that he did so relying on them. Questions 8 and 9 were put contingently. They were meant to be answered only if the answer to question No. 7 should be \"yes.\" It was \"no.\" I am, therefore, unable to accept the view that the answers are incomplete.\nI am also of the opinion that inasmuch as the jury saw fit to answer the questions put to it, thus informing the court of the findings of fact upon which it based the conclusion expressed in its general verdict, those specific findings cannot be ignored. If they are inconsistent with the general verdict the latter cannot be sustained.\nThey have explained what they meant by their verdict and how they arrived at it, and it is on this basis that we have to consider their verdict. We must take it as we find it.\nIf any judgment is to be entered upon it, it must be that which it warrants when taken as a whole. That I understand to be the effect of the decision in Newberry v. Bristol Tramways and Carriage Co. [23], and Dimmock v. North Staffordshire Rly. Co. [24].\nBrown v. Bristol & Exeter Rly. Co. [25]. cited by counsel for the respondent, was a case of refusal by a trial judge to question the jury after they had returned a general verdict in order to ascertain on what ground they had found it\u2014a refusal which the court held to be within the right of the learned judge and proper. See too Arnold v. Jeffreys [26], where Bray J. stated the distinction between cases in which questions are put before verdict and are answered by a jury and cases in which no questions are put until after a general verdict has been given,\nTaking the term \"representations\" in the first and second questions and the word \"promising\" used by the jury in their answer to the third question, there is perhaps room for doubt whether they appreciated the difference between a misrepresentation of fact such as would constitute fraud and a breach of a mere promise or contractual undertaking. But I shall assume in the respondent's favour that they did and that they meant to find a misrepresentation of present intention on the part of Vanstone, which would be a misrepresentation of fact amounting to fraud.\nOn the jury's answer to the sixth question and the facts in regard to the renewal in February, 1915, as given by the defendant himself, I think that he then waived any defence which Vanstone's former conduct might have given him and elected to abide by his liability to the bank. He was then admittedly aware of the payment to Wilkie & Campbell. Any misleading or inducing effect of the misrepresentation which he says Vanstone made when the original note was given was thus removed. He has not attempted to allege ignorance of the common and well\u2014known legal effect of such a fraudulent misrepresentation probably because advised of the futility of such an attempt. Carnell v. Harrison[27]. Had he done so the burden of proving such ignorance at all events would have rested upon him. It could not be presumed. No new misrepresentation is suggested. He merely alleges some sort of promise or undertaking by Vanstone, clearly contractual and contradictory of the obligation evidenced by his indorsement. No such promise or contract is pleaded. Fraud is the sole defence and the jury's sixth finding is explicit that there was nothing fraudulent in what Vanstone said or did on this occasion.\nThe jury has again explicitly found that there was neither misrepresentation nor promise of any kind, by words or conduct, of the bank manager, in the obtaining of the renewal note of August, 1915, which is sued upon\u2014obviously the only finding that could be made in view of the admitted facts and the circumstances above stated under which that renewal was given. Whatever fraud or misrepresentation may have induced Harrell originally to become an indorser to the bank did not affect this last renewal. He gave it with full knowledge of all the material facts affecting the existence of his liability and in reliance not upon any representation or promises that the liability thus acknowledged would not be enforced against him, but upon the outcome of an arrangement as to which he had knowledge and means of knowledge quite as complete as had the bank manager.\nHis acts in renewing the note on this and the former occasion were unequivocal and amounted to communications of his election not to repudiate his liability. Scarf v. Jardine [28]. On each occasion the bank, on the faith of what he did, changed its[Page 541]\nposition by extending the time for payment by the maker of the note.\nThe seventh finding of the jury like the sixth is inconsistent with a general verdict for the defendant based on fraud\u2014the only defence raised on the pleadings or at the trial. Notwithstanding that general verdict, applying the doctrine of the Newberry Case [29], upon the verdict as a whole, judgment should, in my opinion, be entered for the plaintiffs.\nBut if the general verdict alone should be considered I am convinced that it must be set aside because there is no evidence to support it. It is also perversely opposed to the direction of the learned trial judge, who expressly instructed the jury that they could return a general verdict for the defendant only if they should find in his favour all the facts covered by the questions put to them. Upon the defendant's own story it is too clear to admit of doubt or controversy that when he signed the renewal of February, 1915, he elected to waive any defence that earlier misrepresentations by Vanstone might have given him. On his own version of his interview with Ball it is obvious to me that he then abandoned any idea of repudiating liability either because of alleged misrepresentations or of alleged promises made by Vanstone\u2014which he says Ball had characterized as \"foolish things\"\u2014and accepted the position of maker of the note liable to the bank in the hope and expectation that under his arrangement of February with the Amusement Company's landlords the bank's claim would be satisfied out of the proceeds of the company's business\u2014thinking, as he puts it, \"that everything was all right.\" Any other than a verdict for the plaintiff would, in my opinion, be so palpably perverse that it could not stand for a moment. Under these circumstances, having regard to the power conferred on the Court of Appeal by Order 58, r. 4, of the Supreme Court Rules of British Columbia, 1906, to give judgment non obstante veredicto for one of the parties where no reasonable view of the evidence could justify any other result, and it is satisfied that it has all the evidence before it\u2014a power, no doubt, to be exercised sparingly and with caution (see McPhee v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Rly. Co. [30], and Skeate v. Slaters [31], the proper course in the present case, in my opinion, is to order the entry of judgment for the plaintiff. Indeed, I strongly incline to the view that the learned trial judge should have directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff.\nI am, for these reasons, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and that the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored, subject, however, to a variation reducing the rate of interest from 8% to 5% McHugh v. Union Bank [32].\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bird, Macdonald & Ross.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Duncan & Duncan.\n[1] 23 B.C.

Prior to expropriation, the respondent laid out as building lots part of his lands, which were devoted mainly to agricultural uses. Article 5797 R.S.Q. provides that the award of the arbitrators should be final and without appeal. Appellant took an action to set aside the award of the arbitrators.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The arbitrators were within the scope of their jurisdiction in valuing the lands of respondent as town building lots instead of as agricultural property, as the decision, as to whether the lands had a present marketable value as town lots or not, was a question of fact upon which it was the duty of the arbitrators to pass.\nPer Duff J. Upon the evidence of the arbitrators, it has not been proven that they had based their award upon an appraisement of something which was not the thing they were authorized to appraise, which they would have done if they had taken, as their starting point, not the value of the property as of the date of the expropriation, including the value as of that date of its economic potentialities, but the value as of a later date.\nPer Duff J.\u2014An award, being a decision of one having limited authority, whether given by agreement of the parties or by statute, is pro tanto void if the arbitrator appraises something he was riot directed to appraise and void altogether if that part which is void cannot be severed from the rest, it being immaterial whether the arbitrator has acted by mistake or by design.\nAppeal dismissed, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of Flynn J. in the Superior Court for the district of Montmagny, which maintained the action of appellant and quashed the award as granting an excessive indemnity.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nL. G. Belley K.C. for the appellant.\nMaurice Rousseau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellant, by means of duly authorized expropriation proceedings, had obtained a servitude over lands of the respondent for laying and maintaining a pipe line. In due course, an arbitration took place to decide the amount of compensation payable to the respondent. In these proceedings, the appellant is resisting payment of the amount awarded.\nPrior to the expropriation, the respondent laid out part of his lands, which were devoted mainly to agricultural uses, as building lots with a view, as is claimed by the appellant, of enhancing the compensation which he could claim at the arbitration.\nIt is unnecessary to consider in particular what he did, with what purpose or with what effect, for it must be conceeded that a man has a perfect right to do what he pleases with his own property; it suffices to say that there is in the case no suggestion of anything fraudulently done in subdividing the property or in any other respect in connection with the arbitration\nThe arbitration proceedings were admittedly regular. The appellants knew the basis on which the arbitrators were proceeding to make their valuation and acquiesced therein by calling no evidence to shew that it was erroneous. Article 5797 of the R.S.Q. provides that the award of the arbitrators shall be final and without appeal.\nNow, on the ground that the amount awarded is excessive and that the arbitrators proceeded on a wrong basis in estimating the compensation, the appellant is inviting the court to re-open the whole question and has put the respondent, whose property is forcibly expropriated, to all this enormous expense of legal proceedings carried from court to court in an attempt to avoid payment of part of an award of some $4,000.\nIt must be conceded that we cannot disturb the award merely because we deem the compensation allowed to be too great. To do so would obviously be to entertain the prohibited appeal. The appellant seeks to escape this difficulty by suggesting that the compensation was assessed on a wrong basis\u2014i.e., on the footing that the lands affected should be valued as town building lots instead of as agricultural property\u2014and that the arbitrators thereby exceeded their jurisdiction. But whether the land had a marketable value as town building lots or had no such value and was available only for farming or market gardening purposes was certainly a question of fact upon which it was the duty of the arbitrators to pass. It is very difficult to appreciate the contention that, in doing so, they exceeded their jurisdiction. To review their determination of this issue would be to entertain the appeal which the statute excludes, and in reality to interfere with their decision as to the value of the land injuriously affected, which is of course one of the chief elements in fixing the amount of the damage for which the owner is entitled to be compensated.\nI am glad to think that there is no ground on which the court is in any way justified in entertaining such a claim. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting)\u2014I concur with the reasons stated by Cross J. (dissenting) in the appeal court of King's Bench, Quebec, for dismissing the appeal to that court, and would therefore allow the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014I think, for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Cross in his dissenting opinion in the court of appeal, that this appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nThe latter judge has assigned some further cogent reasons, with some at least of which I incline to agree, in support of his judgment, but I am unable without further examination, which in the view I take is unnecessary, to say whether or not I can agree in all the reasons so assigned. For example, the question of the arbitrators disregarding the benefit to be derived by respondent from the projected work in arriving at their conclusion, is one of those considerations which would require perusal of the whole evidence owing to the fact that the point was not much pressed and fully argued. Thorough examination of the evidence may support the position that the board disregarded its duty in this behalf or might lead to the conclusion that the appellant did not bring the necessary evidence before the board. However, one good ground, as it seems to me, being sufficiently apparent requiring a reversal of the judgment appealed from, it is unnecessary to labour further I think.\nDuff J.\u2014The proceedings of the municipality were taken under the authority of articles 5790 to 5800 R.S.Q. The principles governing the determination of compensation under these articles are concisely explained in the judgment of Lord Buckmaster, speaking for the Judicial Committee in Fraser v. Fraserville[1], at p. 194:\u2014\nThe principles which regulate the fixing of compensation of lands compulsorily acquired have been the subject of many decisions, and among the most recent are those of In re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas & Water Board[2]; Cedars Rapids Manufacturing & Power Co. v. Lacoste[3]; and Sidney v. North Eastern Rly. Co.[4]. The principles of those cases are carefully and correctly considered in the judgments the subject of appeal, and the substance of them is this: that the value to be ascertained is the value to the seller of the property in its actual condition at the time of expropriation with all its existing advantages and with all its possibilities, excluding any advantage due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired, the question of what is the scheme being a question of fact for the arbitrator in each case.\nTheir Lordships held that as the arbitrator, instead of determining the value of the property to the seller, had arrived at the amount of compensation awarded by fixing its value to the persons buying the award could not be upheld.\nTheir Lordships add:\u2014\nThat it is plain from the language of the statute making the award of the arbitrators final and without appeal, that, apart from evidence establishing that the arbitrators had exceeded their jurisdiction, their award could not be disputed.\nOn behalf of the municipality, it is contended that the arbitrators, whose award is now the subject of consideration, proceeded upon an erroneous basis, since, in estimating compensation to be awarded to the respondent, they took, as their starting point, not the value of the property affected at the date of the expropriation including the value as of that date of its economic potentialities, but the value as of a later date. It is argued that this is proved by the evidence of the arbitrators themselves; and, if this were established, it would follow that, the arbitrators having based their award upon an appraisement of something which was not the thing they were authorized to appraise, the appellant municipality ought to succeed. The majority of the court below appear to have held that even such a departure from the principles of compensation prescribed by law would not vitiate the award. The judgment of the Judicial Committee, in the case above referred to, is so apt an illustration of the principles on which the courts have always acted in setting aside the awards of arbitrators in compensation cases that it is unnecessary to refer to the long line of authorities establishing that, since an award is a decision of one having limited authority, whether given by agreement of the parties or by statute, the award is pro tanto void if the limited authority has not been pursued and the arbitrator has appraised something he was not directed to appraise and void altogether if that part which is void cannot be severed from the rest; that it is immaterial whether the arbitrator in such a case has acted by mistake or by design and that the fact that his authority has not been pursued may be proved by the testimony of the arbitrator himself, Buccleuch, Duke of, v. Metropolitan Board of Works[5]; Falkingham v. Victorian Railways Commissioner[6].\nIt is sometimes difficult, very difficult indeed, to determine where an arbitrator has made a mistake of law or of fact, whether the mistake amounts to such a departure from authority as to invalidate the award. The question before us on this appeal is whether the opinion of Mr. Justice Cross in the court below is right, that the arbitrators have shewn, by their own evidence, that they exceeded their authority. My conclusion is that excess of jurisdiction is not proved.\nIn Falkingham v. Victorian Railways Commissioner[7], at p. 464, Lord Davey, speaking for the Judicial Committee, uses these words:\u2014\nWhere * * * there is jurisdiction to make an award and the question is one of a possible excess of jurisdiction, the rule (that the onus rests upon those who allege that an inferior tribunal has acted within its jurisdiction) has no application. In such a case the award can only be impeached by shewing that the arbitrator did in fact exceed his jurisdiction.\nWhile the evidence of the arbitrators cannot be said to be wholly satisfactory, I think it is not inconsistent with the hypothesis that what they really had in view in estimating the compensation to be made was value as of the date of expropriation of the economic potentialities of the land as capable of subdivision.\nFor these reasons I should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

C.R. 81), was allowed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining the prayer of the information filed by the Attorney-General for Canada and declaring that a water grant was issued in error and improvidently and should be declared null and void.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. T. Congdon K.C. for the appellants.\nW. D. Hogg K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014The claim of the Crown in this suit is to set aside a water grant in the Yukon Territory made to the appellant on the 8th Oct. 1909.\nThe Yukon Placer Mining Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 64, as amended by 7 & 8 Edw. VII., c. 77, provides:\u2014\nSec. 3.\u2014The Governor in Council may appoint gold commissioners and acting and assistant gold commissioners for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act; but mining recorders and mining inspectors and deputies thereto shall be appointed by the commissioner subject to the approval of the Governor in Council.\nSec. 4.\u2014The Commissioner may, by proclamation published in the Yukon Official Gazette, divide the territories into districts to be known as mining districts, and may, as occasion requires, change the boundaries of such districts.\nSec. 5.\u2014The Gold Commissioner shall have jurisdiction within such mining districts as the Commissioner directs, and within such districts shall possess also all the powers and authority of a mining recorder or mining inspector.\nSec. 6.\u2014A mining recorder shall be appointed in each mining district, and within such district shall possess also all the powers and authority of a mining inspector.\nSections 54 to 58 provide for the adjudication on any application for a water grant by a mining recorder who is then empowered to make the grant.\nIt is admitted that all necessary proceedings were regularly taken under the Act except that the adjudication on the application was held before the Gold Commissioner and it is claimed that this was contrary to the statute inasmuch as he had not been directed by the Commissioner to act as a mining recorder for the district.\nThe Act does not provide for any such direction. Sec. 5 provides that the Gold Commissioner shall have jurisdiction within such districts as the Commissioner directs\nand within such districts shall possess also all the powers and authority of a mining recorder.\nThere was, I think, no necessity for any direction at all because at the date of the grant only one Gold Commissioner had been appointed by the Governor in Council. The statute contemplates the appointment of more than one gold commissioner as appears from other than the sections above quoted, for instance section 79 which provides that affidavits\nmay be made before any Gold Commissioner anywhere within the Territory.\nWhen there are several gold commissioners appointed, the Commissioner is to direct in which districts each shall have jurisdiction and of course it was never intended that there should be a gold commissioner for each district as there is a mining recorder. In the districts directed by the Commissioner each gold commissioner exercises jurisdiction and by sec. 5 has within those districts the powers of a mining recorder. Where there is only one gold commissioner appointed there can be no division of jurisdiction and the only possible direction of the Commissioner would be that he should have jurisdiction in all the districts; if this were necessary it would amount to saying that the gold commissioner appointed by the Governor in Council could have no jurisdiction without being further appointed by the Commissioner. The Judge of the Exchequer Court does indeed attempt a distinction between certain duties of the Gold Commissioner under the statute and those of a mining recorder. He says:\u2014\"An analysis of the statute shews that the Gold Commissioner had certain duties to perform as Gold Commissioner but was not clothed with the powers of a mining recorder until appointed by the Commissioner.\" Passing by the fact that the statute says nothing about any appointment of the Gold Commissioner by the Commissioner such an interpretation of section 5 must apply to all the duties of the Gold Commissioner who would have no jurisdiction either as to the special duties imposed on him by the Act or as to the powers of a mining recorder.\nThe learned judge says in his reasons for judgment: \"Turning to the statutes, for convenience I have been furnished with a copy of the \"Yukon Placer Mining Act\" as consolidated with the amending Acts.\" In case he has not referred to the statutes themselves it may not be amiss to point out that under the original statute the Governor-General in Council appointed all the officials, mining recorders as well as gold commissioners. It was only by the amending Act, 7 & 8 Edw. VII., c. 77, that the change was introduced \"but mining recorders and mining inspectors and deputies thereto shall be appointed by the Commissioner.\" This, the only power of appointment given to the Commissioner, may have given rise to the error as to appointment of gold commissioners by the Commissioner; it does not touch them at all.\nI think the Act is perfectly clear though it would have been better if in sec. 5, in place of the words \"The Gold Commissioner,\" the words \"The Gold Commissioners\" or \"A Gold Commissioner\" had been used. The Act, however, repeatedly refers to the Gold Commissioner and if one may make a surmise this is to be accounted for by the fact that there was, and for years previous to the passing of the Act had been, only one official known as the Gold Commissioner in the Yukon Territory.\nThe objection to the grant entirely fails and the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with the reasons of my brother Anglin for allowing the appeal\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed and the Information be dismissed with costs here and below.\nDuff J.-\u2014The controversy on this appeal relates to the construction of certain provisions of the Yukon Act, R.S.C. 1906, ch. 64 which are as follows:\u2014\n\"3.\u2014The Governor in Council may appoint gold commissioners and acting and assistant gold commissioners for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act; but mining recorders and mining inspectors and deputies thereto shall be appointed by the commissioner subject to the approval of the Governor in Council.\n\"4.\u2014The Commissioner may, by proclamation published in the Yukon Official Gazette, divide the territory into districts to be known as mining districts, and may, as occasion requires, change the boundaries of such districts.\n\"5.\u2014The Gold Commissioner shall have jurisdiction within such mining districts as the Commissioner directs, and within such districts shall possess also all the powers and authority of a mining recorder or mining inspector. \"6.\u2014A mining recorder shall be appointed in each mining district, and within such district shall possess also all the powers and authority of a mining inspector.\"\nThe question can be dealt with without any further reference to the particular facts of the case in which it arises and it is this. Is an express direction by the commissioner a condition which must be complied with before a Gold Commissioner appointed by the Governor in Council under the authority of section 3 is invested with jurisdiction as gold commissioner or as mining recorder to perform the duties and to exercise the powers committed to a gold commissioner or a mining recorder under the statutes relating to the Yukon and to mining therein?\nIt is contended on behalf of the Attorney-General that this question must be answered in the affirmative even where only a single gold commissioner for the whole territory has been appointed under section 3; and it was quite candidly admitted by Mr. Hogg that the practical effect of accepting this interpretation of section 5 must be that from some date in 1906 down to some date in 1912, a period of six years, no officer was invested with the powers of a gold commissioner in the Yukon although a gold commissioner had been appointed by the Governor in Council and was all that time acting as if he possessed authority and in the full belief of everybody that his acts were lawful and valid. The section is no doubt a crabbed one, but I think when the law in existence at the time the statute was passed by virtue of the orders in council then in effect touching the powers and authority of the Gold Commissioner is considered, a way is opened out of the difficulty though it is impossible to say the difficulty wholly disappears. Under that law a gold commissioner was ex officio mining recorder. That provision of the law is not explicitly repealed by the Act of 1906 and I think section 5 manifests an intention to recognize the gold commissioner's ex officio capacity as mining recorder.\nI agree with Mr. Congdon's contention that the application of section 5 must be restricted to those cases in which more than one gold commissioner is appointed. Further than that I express no opinion upon the true construction of section 5; it may be hoped that before any further question can arise with regard to that Parliament will by a declaratory Act make the meaning of it clear.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the information dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Crown in this proceeding seeks a declaration that a grant of the right to use and divert water issued to the defendants on the 8th Oct., 1909, is null and void and an order for its cancellation. This relief is asked on the grounds that \"the grant was made and issued through improvidence, inadvertence and error\" and without any adjudication on the application therefor by the Mining Recorder who signed it. Secs. 54-57 of the Yukon Placer Mining Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 64), as amended by 7 & 8 Edw. VII., c. 77, s. 25, provide for adjudication by a Mining Recorder upon any application for a grant of the right to use or divert water and for the issue of such grants with the approval of the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory.\nIn the case at bar the adjudication upon the defendants' application was made by the Gold Commissioner, Mr. F. X. Gosselin, and by his direction Mr. G. P. Mackenzie, a mining recorder, signed the grant to them and it issued with the approval of the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory, who appears to have had full knowledge of the facts. The substantial question presented is whether the Gold Commissioner had the powers and authority of a mining recorder requisite to enable him validly to adjudicate upon the defendants' application under s. 57 of the statute. If he had I attach no importance to the fact that the grant was signed not by the Gold Commissioner himself, as it might have been, but by another mining recorder acting by his direction. No improvidence, inadvertence or error in the making of the grant other than an alleged absence of jurisdiction as mining recorder in the Gold Commissioner has been suggested.\nPrior to 1906 the Gold Commissioner for the Yukon Territory was appointed under the provisions of an order in council of the 7th July, 1898. By this order in council the Gold Commissioner was constituted ex officio Mining Recorder at the headquarters of the Government of the Territory, i.e., at Dawson City, and he was empowered to appoint such additional Mining Recorders as might be necessary and to divide the Territory into such mining divisions as he deemed advisable. Under this order in council the Gold Commissioner acted as a Mining Recorder for the Dawson district and adjudicated upon all conflicting or contested applications for grants of water privileges. That this was the practice which obtained is fully established by the evidence.\nIn 1906 the \"Yukon Placer Mining Act\" was passed and it appears in the R.S.C., 1906, which came into force on the 31st of Jan., 1907, as c. 64. Secs. 3, 4, 5 and 6 of that Act are as follows:\u2014\n3. The Governor in Council may appoint gold commissioners, mining recorders and mining inspectors, and deputies thereto, for carrying out the provisions of this Act.\n4. The Commissioner in Council may, by proclamation published in the Yukon Official Gazette, divide the territory into districts to be known as mining districts, and may, as occasion requires, change the boundaries of such districts.\n5. The gold commissioner shall have jurisdiction within such mining districts as the Commissioner directs, and within such districts shall possess also all the powers and authority, of a mining recorder or mining inspector.\n6. A mining recorder shall be appointed in each mining district, and within such district shall possess also all the powers and authority of a mining inspector.\nOn the 28th May, 1907, Mr. F. X. Gosselin, theretofore Assistant Gold Commissioner at Dawson, was appointed by the Governor in Council \"Gold Commissioner for the Yukon Territory\" and he held that office for about five years. During that time there was no other Gold Commissioner nor any Assistant Gold Commissioner appointed. The Yukon Territory had been divided into mining districts by the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory prior to 1906. No re-division or alteration of existing divisions appears to have been made under s. 4 of the Yukon Placer Mining Act.\nMr. Gosselin states that prior to the 1st April, 1912, he never had\nany specific appointment or directions from the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory as to what districts within the Yukon Territory he should exercise his jurisdiction over as Gold Commissioner and the Mining Recorder,\nthat he acted as mining recorder because of his\nconstruction of the \"Yukon Placer Mining Act\" * * * and the construction of the order in council of the 7th July, 1898, defining the powers of the Gold Commissioner * * * (and) according to the practice of the office from the earliest times.\nI am quite satisfied that under s. 5 of the Yukon Placer Mining Act the authority and powers of the Gold Commissioner as Mining Recorder were territorially co-extensive with his jurisdiction as Gold Commissioner.\nHaving regard to the circumstances and to the provisions of ss. 3 and 4, I should, if necessary, require to consider very carefully whether, although it speaks of \"the Gold Commissioner,\" the provision of s. 5 prescribing a direction by the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory was meant to apply unless the Governor in Council, under the power conferred by s. 3, should appoint more than one Gold Commissioner, as it was probably expected that he would when the statute was enacted. Until that had been done there could be no purpose in having the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory direct within what mining districts the sole Gold Commissioner should act. It was certainly not intended by Parliament that any part of the Yukon Territory should not be subject to the jurisdiction of a Gold Commissioner, nor can I think that it was intended that while the Governor in Council had appointed only one Gold Commissioner for the Territory the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory should have the power to restrict his jurisdiction to particular mining districts. If the construction of s. 5 for which counsel representing the Attorney-General contends should prevail and no direction under that section was given by the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory to Mr. Gosselin, from the date of his appointment in May, 1907, until the 12th of April, 1912, though appointed sole Gold Commissioner for the Yukon Territory as a whole, he had no jurisdiction therein and all his acts not only as Mining Recorder but as Gold Commissioner were invalid. Before accepting a construction of s. 5 which would entail consequences so disastrous, I would have to be convinced that it is not open to any other.\nBut this case may be disposed of without determining that the provisions for designation by the Commissioner of particular districts as those within which a Gold Commissioner shall exercise his office was inapplicable. Since it was clearly intended that every mining district in the Yukon Territory should be subject to the jurisdiction of a Gold Commissioner, the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory had no discretion under s. 5, if applicable, but was obliged to direct that the sole Gold Commissioner appointed should exercise jurisdiction throughout the whole Territory. Such a direction would be the veriest formality. No form of direction having been prescribed, it should be inferred from the facts that Mr. Gosselin acted as Gold Commissioner for five years under the direct supervision of the Commissioner of the Territory and that his acts as Gold Commissioner and Mining Recorder were continually under the consideration of the Commissioner, who expressly approved in writing of grants made upon some 64 applications for water privileges, of which this was one, adjudicated upon during that period by him; that he had been however informally it matters not, directed by the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory to act as Gold Commissioner throughout the Territory, as his predecessors in office had done. It is true that Mr. Gosselin himself appears to have thought that no direction from the Commissioner of the Territory was necessary\u2014that under the statute and the order in council of 1898 his commission from the Governor in Council made his official status complete. The Commissioner of the Territory, however, was not examined as a witness and we do not know that he entertained the same view, and in the absence of evidence to that effect it should not be assumed that he did. On the contrary, we should rather presume that if his duty required that he should give a direction under s. 5\u2014as it clearly would if that section were applicable\u2014that that duty was discharged, though it may have been in some manner so informal that it escaped Mr. Gosselin's notice, as it well may have since no change was made in the practice which had theretofore prevailed. It is consistent with Mr. Gosselin's evidence that something may have transpired which would satisfy sec. 5 as a general direction, but which he would not regard as a\nspecific appointment or direction from the Commissioner.\nIf the Crown desired to exclude the inference of performance of his duty by the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory I think the burden was upon it to adduce that officer's evidence to negative it. The case is one to which the maxim omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta applies with peculiar force. Either because the direction prescribed by sec. 5 of the Yukon Placer Mining Act was not necessary under the circumstances, or because, if it was requisite, there is a cogent presumption that it was given, which has not been rebutted, I would uphold the grant made to the defendants.\nI would, therefore, with respect, allow this appeal with costs and dismiss the information also with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fred T. Congdon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hogg & Hogg.\n[1] 16 Ex. C.R. 81.\n"

C.R. 146) was allowed, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting.\nHeld, Where compensation awarded is so clearly and grossly excessive that it is manifest that the correct principles of valuation, though stated in the abstract have not been applied, interference on appeal is not merely warranted, but ex debito justitiae.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The cardinal rule to be observed in expropriation proceedings is to allow the market value only, except in cases where the taking has incidentally damaged the owner's business or other material interests; and the advantages to be derived from the construction of the works for the promotion of which expropriation is made must be excluded in determining such market value.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014The indemnity to be paid is the value to the owner of the property expropriated and such value is determined by the advantages, present and future, of the property; but the actual value only of these advantages, at the time of the expropriation, must be taken into consideration.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. (dissenting).\u2014In an appeal to the Supreme Court from the award of an arbitrator, when the question of value has been fully discussed before him and no mistake of law Or fact is alleged, the mere suggestion that the amount of compensation is excessive or inadequate ought rarely to be considered a sufficient ground of objection to the award; and this principle must be applied with even more force in the case of an appeal by the Crown, the Exchequer Court being its own tribunal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], awarding, in expropriation proceedings taken by appellant, for the value of land taken and damages to parts of land adjoining, the sum of $133,976.03. The Supreme Court of Canada, allowing the present appeal, reduced the amount to $81,767.60.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nGibsone K.C. and Dobell for the appellant.\nStuart K.C. and St. Laurent K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting)\u2014By the \"Expropriation Act\" (R.S.C. (1906) ch. 143), Parliament has authorized the Attorney-General, in any case in which land is acquired, for any public work, to exhibit in the Exchequer Court an information which shall be deemed the institution of a suit, and in and by which the compensation to be paid shall be ascertained and all claims, other than such as may be allowed, shall be barred. But though Parliament has set up this special machinery for reference of claims to compensation to the court which it has erected for the adjudication of claims against the Crown in right of the Dominion, yet the proceedings, though judicial in form, are in reality no different from the settlement of such cases by arbitration, the usual procedure in cases between private corporations or individuals\nIn appeals to this court from the award of an arbitrator and recently in the appeal from the Exchequer Court of the Capital Brewing Company and The King, I have expressed the view that where the question of value has been fully discussed and no mistake of law or fact is alleged, the mere suggestion that the amount of compensation is excessive or inadequate ought rarely to be considered a sufficient ground of objection to the award.\nThe case I have just mentioned was an appeal by the owner of the land taken, and I think the remarks which I then made apply with even more force in the case of an appeal by the Crown, the Exchequer Court being its own tribunal, the decision of which other parties may not always be so content to accept as they would that of arbitrators of their own choice or at all events independent of the parties and matters in dispute.\nIn the appeal, this year, by special leave, to the Privy Council, of Buddy v. Toronto Eastern Ry. Co.[2], in which an award of arbitration under the \"Railway Act\" was called in question, their Lordships, after stating that in their opinion such an award was in a position similar to that of the judgment of a trial judge, continue:\nFrom such a judgment an appeal is always open both upon fact and law. But upon questions of fact an appeal court will not interfere with the decision of the judge who has seen the witnesses and has been able, with the impression thus formed, fresh in his mind, to decide between their contending evidence\u2014unless there is some good and special reason to throw doubt upon the soundness of his conclusions. * * * In the present case, as far as the question of fact is concerned, their Lordships see no reason whatever to justify interference with the award. The arbitrators appear to have scrutinized and examined the evidence on both sides with great care, and, in addition, they paid at least two visits to the property and made a careful inspection for themselves. It would be in a high degree unreasonable to interfere with such a finding of fact, based on such materials.\nThe principle so laid down, with which I am in entire accord, seems to have its application very fully in the present case. We cannot overlook the fact that the assistant judge of the Exchequer Court has a vast experience of this class of cases with which indeed a great part of his time is constantly occupied. An immense volume of evidence was taken, and no doubt carefully weighed by the learned judge who delivered an elaborate judgment. With all the advantage of a view of the premises, he has fixed on each lot separately the amount of compensation which he concludes is fair and reasonable. No doubt the amount is large, but I am unable to find any sufficient reason for disturbing an award so arrived at. That the value of property in the City of Quebec has risen enormously in recent years, there can be no doubt, and excluding the increase in the value of the respondents' property attributable to the particular public work for which the lands are expropriated, their property must have shared in the general increase. This must necessarily have been the case, if we consider how strictly limited is any space available for harbour accommodation within the port of Quebec.\nI am myself intimately acquainted with the property expropriated and indeed with the whole locality, and to this extent, at any rate, I have the same advantage as the assistant judge derived from his view of the premises.\nWhilst, as I have said, the amount awarded is large and perhaps more than I should have felt justified in giving, had I been in the place of the learned judge, I am still unable to concur in the judgment of the majority of the court.\nIdington J.\u2014The Exchequer Court has awarded, in expropriation proceedings taken by appellant, for the parts of ten parcels of land so taken and damage to the remainder, the sum of $133,796.03, of which $133,196.03 is directed to be paid the Hearn estate, represented by three of the respondents. From this judgment appeal is taken herein, and the contention of appellant is that the learned trial judge had not adhered to the cardinal rule to be observed in such cases, of only allowing the market value, unless in such, cases (of which this is not one), as where the taking has incidentally, in doing so, damaged the owner's business or other material interests.\nThe case is a remarkable one and by no means easy of solution. The difficulties are created chiefly by the obvious failure of the witnesses for the respondents, representing the Hearn estate, including one of themselves, giving valuations that were not based on a strict adherence to the rule to which I have referred. Indeed I doubt if any one of these witnesses correctly apprehended what he was called upon to testify as to\nIn perusing their evidence, I do not find a single one of them pledging his oath to his belief that a sale could have been made, wholly uninfluenced by the advantages to be derived from the construction of the works in question and before the expropriation, of any of these properties, for the prices at which each of the respective witnesses says he values it or them\nThe learned trial judge has referred to them in comprehensive terms as follows:\u2014\nThe Crown has expropriated from these properties the right of way for the National Transcontinental Railway, coming into the city on the water front as far as the old Champlain market, and took all the land, belonging to the defendants, on the river side from the north line of the right of way, thus leaving the defendants with a certain piece of land on the northern side of the right of way to Champlain street. The part or piece of land so left to the defendants is, with the exception which will be hereafter mentioned, covered with dwelling houses with a small yard at the back. These buildings are being used for residential purposes and are subdivided into small lodgings to the one house and are occupied by tenants of the labouring class, yielding very small net revenues. The back part of their property, that is the part on the water front, is in some cases partly covered by old wharves running out at various distances. These wharves were built many years ago for a trade which no longer exists and for a number of years back have practically remained unused and indeed shew the result of wear and tear occasioned by time and age.\nWhile indeed, these properties at some time back, when the timber business and shipbuilding were at their best in Quebec and when large rafts of timber towed down the river St. Lawrence to Quebec and placed in the several coves adjoining the city, and while the water fronts of some of these properties were then used for retaining the logs and timber by booms stretched in front of them, these properties then commanded quite a value; on the other hand, this trade has now almost completely vanished and dissappeared from Quebec since a number of years, with the result that his water front property has gone down to a very little value on the market at the present time and at the date of the expropriation. In fact, it is a question as to whether there would now be a market for such property at Quebec, but for the public works now going on.\nIn connection with what I have just now said relative to market value, I would call particular attention to the last sentence of that just quoted. That and the rest of the quotation expresses with fairness the impressions I have received from an examination of the case and due consideration of the arguments advanced, as well as those derived from a perusal of the evidence of those witnesses I have referred to.\nI agree with the observations of Rowlatt J. quoted by the learned trial judge herein, from his judgment in the case of Sidney v. North Eastern Railway Co.[3], at page 637, and other authorities he cites, bearing upon the exclusion from consideration of the market value, the advantages to be derived from the construction of the work in question for the promotion of which expropriation is made. Yet I cannot help thinking that the respondent, Hearn, and his witnesses failed to observe any such distinction in giving their evidence. Hearn himself says in speaking of two of these parcels, as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014In connection with the land lots Nos. 2402 and 2410, are there any special circumstances which make them more valuable in your opinion? A.\u2014Well, I would think the very fact of their being very close to this railway terminal, that has been decided upon, should give them value.\nQ.\u2014Could you give us an idea of what you mean by saying it was worth more 5% or 10%? A.\u2014Probably more. I am dealing entirely with my own property. I know just what I would have accepted for it in 1900 and what I would want for it in 1913, had it been let to me as it was.\nQ.\u2014That is the basis of your valuation? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014May I say it was made in the same way as you said your estimate of No. 2376 was made, viz., the price you would have been willing to take in 1913? A.\u2014Exactly.\nQ.\u2014I think I asked you this question before. In the different estimates in which you have put the prices of these different lots, I think you said that the figures you had placed were the figures at which you were willing to sell; that is the basis on which you arrived at these figures? A.\u2014Yes, the prices I felt they were worth. I was not prepared to accept less than what I thought the properties were worth.\nThen one of the witnesses, Nesbitt, says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014How did you arrive at the valuation of the lots? A.\u2014From my general experience of values round the city, within the city and outskirts.\nQ.\u2014In the city and outskirts generally? A.\u2014Yes, generally.\nQ.\u2014Any special reference to Champlain street? A.\u2014No, I can't say any special reference to that part particularly.\nAnd Conway says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014In view of the rentals and other revenues of these different properties and the amount of business that has been carried on upon the different properties for the past twenty or forty years, do you still consider those prices reasonable? A.\u2014I do not consider the rentals on the revenue at all.\nQ.\u2014What do you consider the proper revenue of, say, the wharves on 2376? A.\u2014I don't know, I did not consider that.\nQ.\u2014I want to know what the revenue would be. I want to know where the value lies. How could you make money out of it? A.\u2014 I would consider it a good property to hold and sell to men who would come there for shipping purposes and build a wharf and including that part in it.\nQ.\u2014The prospective value of the property is what gives it the value that you name. Is that right? A.\u2014That is right.\nMr. Taschereau's views were also evidently unduly impressed with the possibility of future development in the city.\nWhether for the reasons I suggest or other good reasons, the valuations of these witnesses has not been accepted by the learned trial judge in arriving at his award.\nThere was evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant which was ostensibly based on transactions relative to similar properties next or near to those here in question.\nThe learned trial judge has not accepted that either, but seems, though he does not say so, to have reached his conclusions by a compromise between these two sets of evidence.\nIt is to be observed that the respondent's witnesses, referred to, also relied upon some transactions relative to properties of which the nearest was half a mile distant from the properties in question, except where Mr. Taschereau refers to those of one Evoy and another Picard deal, to be referred to presently.\nThe latter, as explained in appellant's factum, is hardly worth mentioning. The other is claimed to have been no real transaction, but the evidence on which that contention is set up is not cited, and if it exists, has escaped me.\nThe respondents make no argument based or bearing upon them.\nOn the other hand, there are a number of transactions relied upon by appellant relative to properties in the immediate neighbourhood of those in question based upon prices, which if to be accepted as evidence of market value of property, seem strongly to maintain the contention of the appellant.\nSome of these are the result of decisions of the Exchequer Court relative to expropriations for the same purpose as now in question.\nThese should have considerable weight in the same court. Obviously, however, the parties concerned as owners may not have taken the same care in presenting their case as the present respondents or they may have given a grudging assent through failing to appeal.\nFor these and the like reasons they cannot carry the same weight as bargains made between parties relative to properties next to or in the immediate neighbourhood of those in question.\nFor that reason I look on the latter as a safer guide. And, as I have said in other cases heretofore, such bargains should, when there is no reason shewn to impeach their value as such, be taken as a safe guide touching the question of market value. There are at least three instances herein presented by the appellant of such bargains bearing upon the issue presented.\nI refer to that called \"The Molson Macpherson sale,\" that known as \"The Allen sale,\" and that belonging to the Belanger estate.\nThe first and lastly named seem directly in point though some objections are taken as to the Allen sale, which renders it of less value, yet of very great value, if correctly understood. A number of other properties referred to are not quite as clearly in point and would require an inspection and study of their relative situation to render sales thereof as valuable in evidence as those I specially refer to.\nIndeed two of the experts produced to testify for the appellant tell that it was their duty, according to instructions, to try and reach a proper estimate and to be liberal in doing so, as it always is the interest of the Crown not to deal harshly nor to antagonize, needlessly, proprietors who may not desire to sell, and may be likely to resent injustice or even the appearance thereof, and force undesirable litigation. They tell that they used the many instances they give, as well as results of other inquiries, as the basis of their investigation.\nMen so instructed and so acting frequently give evidence of greater value than experts retained, as it were, to promote the views of him retaining them, when often they may be unconsciously influenced by the interested suggestions of him whose cause they represent.\nFor these several reasons I think their estimates are more reliable than those presented by respondents' witnesses.\nAgain I observe that the latter seem herein prone to cite sales of property a long way from the property in question.\nNo doubt such illustrations as shew a rapid rise in properties elsewhere in same city are of value for that purpose, but not beyond the surmise that in time all may be more or less appreciated thereby. Any one of experience knows that properties may only be a very short distance from some others in the same city, yet by reason of many circumstances, sometimes puzzling to understand, be much inferior in value and much less responsive to any general rise in values in the city.\nHence the nearer any property sold is to that expropriated renders a sale of same of greater value than any sales beyond the district where the expropriated land is situated.\nFor these various reasons I attach great importance to the sales, already referred to, in the district in question, few though they be, and am inclined favourably towards the evidence of those Crown experts who approached the valuation in question herein from that point of view I have referred to. Again the prospective rise in value is of no weight unless the market value of that possibility is directly borne in mind and testified to.\nThere are a number of other considerations I am about to present which tell very strongly against the respondent's claims as being of a most exaggerated character. I observe how far they exceed any estimate made by their witnesses.\nThese properties had been acquired by the late Mr. Hearn who died in 1894, and had then, I think, become worth a great deal less than when first acquired, or at all events less productive of revenue.\nThe respondent, Hearn, who seems to have had them in charge, gives an account of the revenue for five years preceding the year 1913, which shews a total of less than a thousand dollars per annum, after deducting taxes and insurance. He does not seem to have kept any accurate account of repairs which no doubt would still further reduce the net revenue given.\nHe intimates the results would be pretty much the same for the time back to his father's death.\nIs there any conceivable reason why properties worth what he says, or any of his witnesses says, should be held for such a long period of time producing no more than he testifies to?\nI have not heard of any prohibition against their being sold. The only reason that has occurred to me is that they were quite unsaleable at any such price as these gentlemen estimate them to be worth, or anything more than the Crown's witnesses have estimated them at.\nIs it conceivable that any business man who could undoubtedly reap 6% per annum on a capital investment of say fifty or sixty thousand dollars, would hang on for twenty years to a property he could sell for that and reap such an income, yet would not sell it, if he could, even if in that time, it increased in value 25%? In other words, why did he, with such gloomy prospects as that decayed part of Quebec presented, accept less than a thousand dollars a year, with all the worries of weary waiting for something to turn up, face his steadily losing say two thousand dollars a year? At the best, admitting a rise of 25% in nearly twenty years, he would be winning in that time twelve to fifteen thousand dollars, and losing the compound interest on the surplus from a new investment.\nI can find no answer except that it was quite impossible to realize even fifty thousand dollars on these properties.\nAnd when we come to contemplate a possible one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty thousand dollars the proposition to hang on seems still more absurd, unless on the hypothesis that, as they could not be sold at all, the [owners might amuse themselves by imagining such values.\nI do not suggest that a non-productive property is valueless. All that I submit is there must exist some reasonable probability of its use to give it a value.\nThen let us turn to the assessed values. We find them running from $14,250 in 1903, on a rental basis to $38,700 in 1913, when a new basis of actual values seems to have been adopted for assessment purposes. The latter system admittedly increased the assessment values, as it generally does.\nThe assessment, I admit, varies so much as not to be a very reliable guide to exact actual values, but what a difference between $38,700 and $133,169! Can it be possible that the assessment was so far below what it ought to have been? But when we come to contemplate the sworn return of values for purposes of succession tax duties we find these properties, in 1894, valued at $7,250 and that accepted by the provincial authorities on the spot as right, or near enough to make it not worth contesting.\nAssuming they were undervalued, how came it that the provincial authorities, sitting in Quebec, did not find anything worth quarrelling about? A slight difference of say even double or treble, might not matter for all the province could reap. But is it at all conceivable that any one then imagined they were, then, in 1894, worth forty thousand dollars or thereabouts? It would require that to bring them, allowing for rise since in value, up to what the agents of appellant placed them at in 1913.\nAnd when we come to think of $133,169 it seems something unthinkable.\nTrue such estimates do not bind those entitled to claim the true value for another purpose, but they do bind the conscience of the respondent Hearn and lead us to weigh his evidence accordingly.\nI cannot, in view of all these considerations, see how we should allow more than the estimate made by the appellant's witnesses, save to add thereto the usual 10% for expropriation.\nBut then there are the questions of title which may make some slight variation in the result.\nIt will depend on the opinion of the other members of this court, as to valuations, whether it is necessary or worth my while entering upon that phase of the matter.\nIf their estimate exceeds mine to any very substantial extent that may cover the utmost possible margin of difference arising from the view to be taken by appellant's witnesses of the titles and consequent area to be considered. But I, by no means, admit that extra area, liable to be covered by water, equal to that not so when we find no present use for watered lots.\nThe appeal should, in any event, be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The award should be reduced to $81,767.50.\nAnglin J.\u2014I agree with the learned assistant judge of the Exchequer Court that, having regard to the statutory right of the Hearn Estate to maintain and use the wharves owned by it, it was unnecessary to determine the question of title raised as to the lands below low water mark on which portions of those wharves are erected. The estate had practically all the benefit and advantage of full proprietorship and was entitled to compensation on that basis. I therefore accept the areas adopted by the learned judge as the proper basis on which to compute compensation.\nThe general views expressed by the learned judge as to the principle on which compensation should be awarded and the elements that should enter into the computation are not open to criticism. But, making due allowance for the advantage which he had in viewing the property, I am, nevertheless, with great respect, of the opinion that the amounts allowed for compensation are so clearly and so grossly excessive that it is apparent that he failed to make a correct application of the principles which he had correctly stated in the abstract.\nWithout laying too much stress on this feature of the case it is, to say the least, astounding\u2014 and something which certainly called for a better explanation than was given of it\u2014that, although, according to the testimony of John G. Hearn, the increase in value in the interval had probably not exceeded 25%, the executors of the Hearn Estate for purposes of succession duties in 1894 valued on oath at $7,250 the entire property for the taking of a portion of which the estate in this proceeding has demanded as compensation $281,181.18 and has been actually awarded, as of the 8th November 1913, $133,796.03. The municipal valuation for assessment purposes of the whole property, of which part was taken, was in 1903, $4,250, in 1908, $21,500 and in 1913, $38,700.\nAfter giving to the whole evidence the best consideration of which I am capable, the valuations of the Crown witnesses on the basis of area on which they were made commend themselves to my judgment as sound and reasonable, erring, if at all, in favour of the respondents. I see nothing to be gained by discussing the evidence in detail or setting out the analysis of it on which this conclusion is based. Applying the figures of the Crown witnesses to the greater areas for which I think compensation should be made, I would modify the judgment in appeal by reducing the sum of $133,796.03, the amount awarded in the Exchequer Court, to $81,767.50, including 10% for compulsory taking.\nIt seems to me to be unnecessary, as the learned trial judge has found, to determine in this proceeding any rights inter se of the Crown and the Quebec Harbour Commissioners in regard to beach and deep water lots.\nThe appellant is entitled to the costs of the appeal to this court. Brodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel de la Cour d'Echiquier concernant l'expropriation de terrains pour le Transcontinental National dans le h\u00e2vre de Qu\u00e9bec. La Cour a accord\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s une somme de $133,196.03.\nLes trois points qui se pr\u00e9sentent dans la cause ont trait\n1o. au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s.\n2o. \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue des terrains qui leur appartiennent.\n3o. \u00e0 leur valeur.\nDroit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLe nombre de lots expropri\u00e9s est de dix; mais il n'y a divergence d'opinion quant au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que pour trois, savoir les lots 2376, 2404 et 2410.\nTous ces lots sont situ\u00e9s sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud de la rue Champlain et se prolongent dans le fleuve St. Laurent. Des quais y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construits depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial, probablement dans la premi\u00e8re partie du si\u00e8cle dernier. La Couronne \u00e9tait alors propri\u00e9taire de ces lots de gr\u00e8ve et ces quais ont d\u00fb \u00eatre faits avec son autorisation, sinon formelle, dumoins tacite. Aussi quand la Commission du H\u00e2vre de Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1859 (22 V. ch. 32), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que la Commission devenait propri\u00e9taire en fid\u00e9icommis du lit de la rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 partir des hautes eaux et qu'elle devenait la cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re des rentes constitu\u00e9es qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9es lors de l'octroi des lots de gr\u00e8ve. Mais la loi ajoutait que les personnes qui avaient construit des quais ou d'autres travaux dans les limites du havre continueraient \u00e0 en \u00eatre les propri\u00e9taires.\nEn 1871, le cadastre d'enr\u00e9gistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sous l'autorit\u00e9 du Code Civil et l'un des terrains dont les intim\u00e9s sont maintenant en possession a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le lot No. 2376. Le plan d\u00e9crit ce lot comme comprenant non seulement la terre ferme, mais aussi une partie du havre couverte par les eaux \u00e0 haute et basse mar\u00e9es. Le livre de renvoi lui donne une superficie de 34,440 pieds. mesure anglaise.\nPlus tard, en 1882, ce No. 2376 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par le sh\u00e9rif et achet\u00e9 par l'Honorable John Hearn, dont les intim\u00e9s sont les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires. La description du lot dans l'acte de vente du sh\u00e9rif est comme suit:\nBounded on the N.W. by Champlain street and by No. 2377; to the S.E. by low watermark of the river St. Lawrence by No. 2377a, to the S.W. by No. 2380 and to the N.E. by No. 2371, containing 34,440 in superficies together with the buildings, wharf, etc., circumstances and dependencies.\nCette description est \u00e9videmment erron\u00e9e. Ce lot ne peut pas avoir 34,440 pieds, s'il ne comprend que le terrain couvert par les hautes eaux; et d'ailleurs une partie du quai qui en d\u00e9pendait se trouvait \u00e0 eau profonde. La description n'\u00e9tait pas conforme d'ailleurs \u00e0 celle du livre de renvoi.\nEn vertu de l'article 2168 du Code Civil, il est statu\u00e9 que le num\u00e9ro donn\u00e9 \u00e0 un lot sur le plan et le livre de renvoi est la vraie description de ce lot et suffit dans tout document quelconque et notamment dans la vente faite par le sh\u00e9rif. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'indiquer ses tenants et aboutissants, except\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 il s'agit d'une portion d'un immeuble. Dans le cas actuel, le sh\u00e9rif, en indiquant que ce lot \u00e9tait born\u00e9 par les limites de la basse mar\u00e9e, a donn\u00e9 un aboutissant qui n'\u00e9tait pas exact et cela n'a aucun effet l\u00e9gal; Caron v. Houle[4]; car le plan couvrait incontestablement un morceau de terrain au del\u00e0 des eaux basses.\nLe lot cadastr\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment fait pour couvrir tout le quai, non-seulement la partie \u00e0 d\u00e9couvert dans les eaux basses, mais aussi celle qui s'\u00e9tendait au del\u00e0. L'appelant all\u00e8gue que le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s est born\u00e9 par la ligne des eaux basses; et, en outre du contrat du sh\u00e9rif, il invoque un acte fait par la Commission du Havre aux auteurs de l'Honorable Mr. Hearn en 1861 par lequel la Commission du H\u00e2vre a vendu une partie de ce terrain.\nIl est loin d'\u00eatre certain que cet acte de vente fut n\u00e9cessaire; car il est \u00e9vident, par le r\u00e9cit des faits qu'il contient, que ce terrain \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 par les acheteurs ou leurs auteurs en 1859, lors de la cr\u00e9ation de la Commission du H\u00e2vre, et par le statut, comme nous l'avons vu, il \u00e9tait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les possesseurs continueraient \u00e0 jouir et \u00e0 se servir de leurs quais comme par le pass\u00e9. Ces possesseurs cependant voulaient je suppose s'assurer \u00e0 tout jamais de la validit\u00e9 de leur titre et c'est, ce qui les a incit\u00e9s \u00e0 se faire donner un nouveau titre par la Commission du Havre.\nJe suis d'opinion, avec le cour Inf\u00e9rieure, que la succession Hearn est propri\u00e9taire du lot No. 2376 jusqu'\u00e0 l'extr\u00eame limite du quai qui y est construit et ce, en vertu du statut cr\u00e9ant la Commission du H\u00e2vre. Elle a eu d'ailleurs possession paisible et indiscutable de cette partie du lot 2376, tant par elle que par ses auteurs, depuis plus de trente ans (art 2242 C.C.).\nLa cour Inf\u00e9rieure a fait mesurer la partie ainsi occup\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s et a trouv\u00e9 une superficie de 25,280 pieds.\nJ'en suis venu \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que la Cour inf\u00e9rieure pour les autres lots au sujet desquels le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est contest\u00e9.\nEtendue du terrain.\nLa cour inf\u00e9rieure a accord\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s une indemnit\u00e9 pour cette partie appel\u00e9e Gore. Cela repr\u00e9sente une superficie de 888 pieds. C'est une toute petite lisi\u00e8re de terrain dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans certains actes. Il me para\u00eet cependant que le mesurage des lots tel que fait sous l'autorit\u00e9 du cadastre et par l'arpenteur Tremblay ne saurait justifier les intim\u00e9s de r\u00e9clamer une indemnit\u00e9 pour ces 888 pieds.\nValeur.\nLes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s expropri\u00e9es, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, sont situ\u00e9es en front sur la rue Champlain, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, et s'\u00e9tendent vers et dans le fleuve St. Laurent, dans le h\u00e2vre de Qu\u00e9bec.\nDes maisons sont construites \u00e0 la rue Champlain et sur l'arri\u00e8re des lots, on a \u00e9rig\u00e9 des quais dont on se servait autrefois pour le commerce si consid\u00e9rable de bois qui se faisait dans le cours du si\u00e8cle dernier. La construction du chemin de fer le Transcontinental' ne touchait pas aux maisons b\u00e2ties sur la rue Champlain, mais elle prenait une partie de ces quais; et afin d'\u00e9viter des r\u00e9clamations en dommages assez difficiles \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer, la Couronne a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'exproprier tout le terrain couvert par les quais et m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 la ligne fronti\u00e8re de la Commission.\nLe traffic pour lequel ces quais avait \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement construits n'existe plus ou n'est fait que sur une bien petite \u00e9chelle; et, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, comme dit l'honorable juge de la cour inf\u00e9rieure:\u2014\nThese wharves * * * for a number of years back have practically remained unused and indeed shew the result of wear and tear occasioned by time and age * . * * with the result that this waterfront property has gone down to a very little value on the market at the present time and at the date of the expropriation. In fact it is a question as to whether there would now be a market for such property at Quebec, but for the public works now going on.\nOn voit d'ailleurs que la plupart de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues par le sh\u00e9rif et achet\u00e9es \u00e0 des prix extr\u00eamement bas. Il est possible que ces lots pourraient avoir plus tard une tr\u00e8s grande valeur si le gouvernement ou les autorit\u00e9s du port y faisaient des travaux tellement consid\u00e9rables qu'un particulier ne saurait et ne pourrait pas entreprendre. Ces possibilit\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre prises en consid\u00e9ration quand on d\u00e9terminera la valeur actuelle. C'est ce que le juge de la cour inf\u00e9rieure a fait.\nL'indemnit\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e est la valeur que le terrain expropri\u00e9 avait pour le propri\u00e9taire; et cette valeur consiste dans tous les avantages actuels et futurs que le terrain poss\u00e9dait; mais on ne doit consid\u00e9rer que la valeur actuelle de ces avantages. Cedar Rapids case[5].\nIl y a une grande divergence d'opinion entre les t\u00e9moins des propri\u00e9taires et ceux de la Couronne quant \u00e0 la valeur des terrains: les premiers disent $281,181.18 et les seconds donnent une valeur de $38,700.\nLes t\u00e9moins du propri\u00e9taire proc\u00e8dent suivant diff\u00e9rents principes. M. Hearn, l'intim\u00e9, lui-m\u00eame nous dit qu'il peut fixer un prix et y tenir, sans prendre en consid\u00e9ration la valeur marchande du terrain dans les environs. Un autre t\u00e9moin nous d\u00e9clare que son \u00e9valuation est bas\u00e9e sur le mouvement de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la ville de Qu\u00e9bec et de ses environs, mais qu'il n'a pas pris en consid\u00e9ration les conditions actuelles des terrains expropri\u00e9s et de leur participation dans ce mouvement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Un dernier t\u00e9moin base son \u00e9valuation sur le prix qu'une compagnie de bateaux pourrait plus tard offrir, quand le commerce se d\u00e9veloppera et pourra utiliser ces quais.\nLes t\u00e9moins de la Couronne \u00e9taient des experts employ\u00e9s dans le but de faire l'\u00e9valuation de toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre expropri\u00e9es pour le Transcontinental dans cette localit\u00e9, depuis le Pointe de Sillery a aller jusqu'au march\u00e9 Champlain. Les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question dans cette cause \u00e9taient parmi celles-l\u00e0. Ils se sont mis au courant des ventes de terrain qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans ces derniers temps et ont pris en consid\u00e9ration toutes les autres circonstances de nature \u00e0 influer sur cette valeur. Ils ont \u00e9galement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les revenus que donnaient ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et leur \u00e9valuation municipale.\nLa preuve nous d\u00e9montre que les revenus bruts \u00e9taient annuellement d'environ $1,500 et que les revenus nets \u00e9taient de $500 de moins, soit $1,000 environ.\nAlors les \u00e9valuateurs de la Couronne, en accordant $38,700 d'indemnit\u00e9, donnaient au propri\u00e9taire un capital qui produirait le double de ce qu'il retirait de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer \u00e9galement qu'en 1894, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'Honorable M. Hearn, l'auteur des propri\u00e9taires actuels, les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 M. J. G. Hearn lui-m\u00eame, l'un des h\u00e9ritiers et des ex\u00e9cuteurs, et il a alors pay\u00e9 des droits sur une valeur qu'il a fix\u00e9e \u00e0 $7,250.00.\nC'\u00e9tait bien loin de la somme de $280,000 qu'il r\u00e9clame aujourd'hui.\nIl est int\u00e9ressant de lire la partie du t\u00e9moignage de M. Hearn qui nous parle de la valeur proportionnelle des terrains en 1890 et en 1913c I1 en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que les terrains pendant cette p\u00e9riode ont peut-\u00eatre augment\u00e9 d'une valeur de 10%. Alors comment peut-il expliquer qu'en 1890, il jurait dans sa d\u00e9claration au Tr\u00e9sorier Provincial que ces terrains valaient $7,250 et qu'aujourd'hui ils valent $280,000? Comment concilier ses d\u00e9clarations? Voici d'ailleurs son t\u00e9moignage sur ce point:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You spoke to us about the value of this property, I suppose the values you were talking about were the values in 1913? A.\u2014About that, yes.\nQ.\u2014How would those valuations compare with say five years before? Was there any increase or decrease at all? I am not speaking about small differences. A.\u2014The value might have increased a little, that is five years ago or thereabout.\nQ.\u2014Five years before 1913. Are you talking about? A.\u2014Five years before 1913, I might possibly have sold the property for less than I would since 1913 in certain conditions.\nQ.\u2014Are the circumstances such, since 1913 and the time you now give evidence, as to make it proper or incumbent on you to ask a higher price to-day than you would have asked in 1913? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Would you say there is any great difference in the value of property between the year 1913 and the year 1900? A.\u2014I think in 1913, this property we are speaking of would be of more value than in 1900 had the railway not come in and destroyed it, had the railway remained at Cape Diamond.\nQ.\u2014Leaving aside for the moment any effect the railway might have had would the property have been worth approximately the same in 1900 as it would in 1913? A.\u2014Eliminating any influence the railway might have had?\nQ.\u2014Yes. A.\u2014I think it would be worth more in 1913 because of the general improvement of property in Quebec.\nQ.\u2014Could you give us an idea of what you mean by saying it was worth more? 5% or 10%? A.\u2014Probably more. I am dealing entirely with my own property. I know just what I would have accepted in 1900 and what I would want for it in 1913, had it been left to me as it was.\nQ.\u2014May I say, it was made in the same way as you said your estimate of No. 2376 was made, viz., the price that you would have been willing to take in 1913? A.\u2014Exactly.\nQ.\u2014Would you compare the price in a general way, that you would have been willing to take in 1913 with the price you would have taken in 1900? A.\u2014I would want more than I would want in 1900.\nQ.\u2014Approximately what proportion or percentage? A.\u2014Probably 25% or something of that kind.\nQ.\u2014Could you go as far back, from recollection, and compare in a general way, the value of the property in 1913 with the value in 1890? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Can you say in a general way, whether the value of this property increased between 1890 and 1900? A.\u2014I think it would increase.\nQ.\u2014To any considerable extent? A.\u2014Yes, I would think the property in Quebec during the last ten years increased generally. Q.\u2014I am not talking of the last ten years. I am taking from 1890 to 1900. A.\u2014I cannot tell you that.\nQ.\u2014Can you say, in a general way, whether those properties increased or not from 1890 to 1900? A.\u2014Perhaps not.\nQuant aux ventes de terrain dans les environs, il est en preuve que le lot No. 2411, qui est voisin de Tun des lots expropri\u00e9s, a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu en 1901, avec les quais qui y avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 construits, \u00e0 raison de 16 cents. du pied carr\u00e9, et un autre terrain, aussi contigu, portant le No. 2415, a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu aussi en 1901 pour 22\u00bd cents. Cette diff\u00e9rence dans le prix entre ces deux ventes \u00e9tait probablement due au fait que les quais \u00e9taient plus spacieux dans le premier que dans le dernier cas.\nMais vers le m\u00eame temps o\u00f9 l'expropriation a eu lieu, des terrains semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus \u00e0 la Couronne pour la construction du chemin de fer par les h\u00e9ritiers Molson, par Madame B\u00e9langer et par la Compagnie Allan. Les h\u00e9ritiers Molson ont vendu 65 cents. du pied, Madame B\u00e9langer 85 cents et la Compagnie Allan 94 cents.\nCes terrains \u00e9taient voisins des terrains de la succession Hearn et le prix qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 peut nous donner une id\u00e9e assez exacte de la valeur marchande des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s expropri\u00e9es. Je vois que les terrains ainsi vendus \u00e0 la Couronne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus \u00e0 des prix diff\u00e9rents, selon qu'ils \u00e9taient plus ou moins rapproch\u00e9s du centre de la ville. Ainsi la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Allan, qui est la plus pr\u00e8s, a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 94 cents, la voisine vers l'ouest, celle de Madame B\u00e9langer, \u00e0 85 cents, et enfin celle de la succession Molson, qui est la plus \u00e9loign\u00e9e \u00e0 65 cents. Or, cette derni\u00e8re est justement voisine de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la succession Hearn, la plus proche de la ville. Elle porte les num\u00e9ros du cadastre 2370 & 2371 et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 voisine \u00e0 l'ouest, qui appartient \u00e0 la succession Hearn, porte le num\u00e9ro 2376. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Molson, qui, comme la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Hearn, est un lot de gr\u00e8ve, est donc mieux situ\u00e9e que cette derni\u00e8re. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue cependant au prix de 65 cents le pied, tandis que la cour inf\u00e9rieure a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la succession Hearn une indemnit\u00e9 sur le pied de $1.88 le pied. Il n'y a rien dans la cause qui puisse justifier une si grande diff\u00e9rence.\nLes autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la succession Hearn sont toutes situ\u00e9es plus \u00e0 l'ouest, c'est-\u00e0-dire de plus en plus \u00e9loign\u00e9es du centre de la ville.\nLa cour inf\u00e9rieure a accord\u00e9 pour le No. 2381 une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 $1.35 du pied,\npour le No. 2385................................. 1.57 du pied,\npour les Nos. 2393, 2394.................... 1.17 du pied,\net pour les Nos. 2402, 2403, 2404, 2409 & 2410, $1.64 du pied.\nCe dernier lot (No. 2410) est voisin d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 semblable qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9e et pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 52 cents du pied.\nJe crois que, dans les circonstances, une indemnit\u00e9 raisonnable, m\u00eame lib\u00e9rale, serait accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la succession Hearn, si je fixais un prix uniforme pour tous ces lots et si j'adoptais pour cette fin la valeur pay\u00e9e \u00e0 la succession Molson, soit 65 cents du pied. D'apr\u00e8s les calculs que j'ai faits, la superficie du terrain expropri\u00e9 se chiffrerait comme suit:\u2014\nLot No. 2376..................................................................................\n25,280\nLot No. 2381..................................................................................\n5,880\nLot No. 2385..................................................................................\n2,529\nLots Nos. 2393 & 2394..................................................................\n8,552\nLots Nos. 2402, 2403, 2404, 2409 and 2410................................\n31,633\nformant un total de........................................................................\n73,874\n\u00e0 65 cents. du pied, cela donnerait $48,018.10. Il faudrait ajouter \u00e0 cela la valeur des quais. Il est en preuve qu'il y a 15,833 verges cubes de quaiage et que, pour l\u2019une des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s voisines, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'une somme de $1.50 la verge \u00e9tait raisonnable. La Couronne, dans son factum, reconna\u00eet que la somme de $1.35 la verge serait une valeur raisonnable. Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 accorder la somme de $1.50. Alors cela ferait une somme additionnelle de $23,749.50. Il conviendrait d'ajouter \u00e0 cela la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation que la partie des lots restant \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9 va subir \u00e0 cause de l'expropriation. Cette d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation parait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e par la cour inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la somme de $10,000.00. En ajoutant ces trois sommes de $48,018.10, de $23,749.50, et de $10,000.00 nous arrivons \u00e0 un total de $81,767.60, qui serait certainement une indemnit\u00e9 juste et raisonnable.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et l'indemnit\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite \u00e0 $81,767.60.\nLes frais de la cour inf\u00e9rieure seront \u00e0 la charge de la Couronne.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Gibson & Dobell\nSolicitors for the respondents: Pentland, Stuart, Gravel & Thompson.\n[1] 16 Ex.

Appellant;\nand\nThe Dominion Creosoting Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1916: October 20; 1917: October 15.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRTISH COLUMBIA.\nNegligence\u2014Findings of jury\u2014Railway company\u2014Cars left on tracks\u2014 Extraneous interference\u2014Anticipation.\nThe respondent was engaged in delivering creosoted paving blocks brought in freight cars over the British Columbia Electric Railway's tracks. The employees of the railway company, after having placed the cars so loaded at points indicated by the servants of the respondent, had taken care to set the air brakes and to have blocks placed and \"pinched\" in front of the wheels. Later on the respondent's men, for their convenience, moved the cars further down the grade, put back the blocks without \"pinching\" them and applied the brakes by hand. Then some school boys unloosened the brakes on the car furthest uphill which, being propelled by its own gravity against the lower ones, moved all the cars so that a collision took place at the foot of the hill between them and a passenger coach of the Electric Railway.\nHeld, Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting, that, upon the evidence, the employees of the respondent should have anticipated that the school boys might release the cars and that the respondent was liable for having taken no steps to guard against such interference. Per Idington J.\u2014The question as to whether or not this interference was such an occurrence as ought to have been foreseen and provided against, is not a question of law, but a question of fact within the province of the jury.\nPer Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting.\u2014The proximate and effective cause of the accident was the interference of the school boys, which the respondent had no reason to anticipate.\nAPPEAL from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing in each case the judgment of the trial court and dismissing the actions against the respondent.\nThe material facts of the present case and the questions of law are fully stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. W. de B. Farris for the appellants.\nTilley K.C. for the respondent.\nThe reasons for judgment of the trial judge in Green v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company[2], are applicable to the present cases, as the grounds of action are the same in the three cases.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The facts of the cases from the judgments in which these appeals are brought are fully set out in the notes of my brothers Idington and Anglin. The cars which caused the accident were left by the servants of the respondent (The Dominion Creosoting Company) in a dangerous position, insecurely fastened and without any protection. There can, I think, be no doubt on the evidence that they were actually set in motion on the down grade by mischievous school boys interfering with the insecure fastenings.\nThe employees of the company had reason to foresee the probability of such interference and they took no steps to guard against it. Had the case come before me, sitting as a trial judge without a jury, I should, on these facts, have had no difficulty in finding for the plaintiffs.\nThe jury, however, simply found that the negligence of the defendant was the proximate cause of the accident and I entertain considerable doubt whether the omission of all reference to the action of the boys did not render it impossible to support this finding. I have come to the conclusion, however, that the negligence of the respondents' servants as involving the natural consequences that flow from it may be said to have been the proximate cause of the accident in the same way as it would have been if the cars had started moving through the mere force of gravity. It is of course obvious that the accident could not have happened at all but for the respondents' negligence.\nIt would certainly have been more satisfactory if the jury's attention had been pointedly directed to the exact facts and they had been invited to give a verdict accordingly. The alternative of allowing the appeal, however, is to send the case back for retrial, a most unsatisfactory proceeding in the case of a practically foregone conclusion. Since therefore I am satisfied that the appellants have a good claim on the merits and the majority of the court is prepared to find for the appellants, I am glad to be able to conclude that such finding can be reconciled with strict legal principles.\nThe editor of the Law Quarterly, commenting on the case of Crane v. South Suburban Gas Company[3], says:\u2014\nPeople who create a dangerous nuisance on the verge of a highway, come under the good and fairly old authority of Barnes v. Ward,[4] and will not save themselves by trying to divert the argument into refined distinctions about negligence and intervening acts of third persons.\nI would allow with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia with respect to the defendant, the Dominion Creosoting Company, was right and that these appeals should be dismissed.\nThe negligence of which they were found guilty by the jury and the only negligence found against them was\nin moving the cars without the B.C. Electric Company's shunter and crew in attendance with proper facilities.\nI am unable to see in what respect this negligence could be said to be a proximate or effective cause of the accident. I agree with the Court of Appeal that this moving of the cars in the way they did move them \"did not effect the situation at all.\"\nThe proximate and effective cause of the accident was the interference of a number of mischievous young boys about eleven years of age, two of whom worked together to unloose the brakes of the car and let them loose upon the track on which they stood.\nTwo of the boys worked together, one prying up the dog of the brake with a piece of iron and the other twisting on the wheel.\nThey succeeded after a good deal of ingenuity and labour in loosening the brakes of the upper cars which ran down the inclined grade of the rails they were on by force of gravity and collided with the two cars lower down the grade.\nTwo of these cars, the upper ones, were stopped by one of two men left with the cars by the defendant company but the lower cars, which had been hit by the upper ones, ran down the grade and collided below the switch through the knife switch with a passenger car going north, in which collision the plaintiffs were injured.\nThere are two or three important and controlling facts which must be kept in mind in determining the liability of the Creosoting Company.\nOne is that when and after moving the cars on the day of the accident, in order to get from them the paving blocks necessary to enable the company to go on with the work they had contracted to do, the cars were braked and blocked in the same way in which they had been braked and blocked by the Railway Company on the day previously, and the other is that but for the mischievous intermeddling and loosening of the brakes of the two upper cars by the boys, the accident would not and could not have happened.\nThere was no finding of the jury that the paving company (defendant) had any reason to fear or anticipate this mischievous action of the boys, nor was there any evidence to justify any such finding had it been made. The only negligence found was that I have previously stated\nin moving the cars without shunter and crew of the Railway Company in attendance.\nThere was no negligence found by the jury that the cars had not been left on the tracks well and sufficiently braked and secured by the Creosoting Company.\nThe mischievous interference and action of the boys in unloosening the brakes of the two upper cars which the evidence shews were effectively and securely fastened was the proximate and effective cause of the accident and without which it neither would nor could have happened.\nIt is not the province of this court to make findings of other negligence on the defendant's part than that found by the jury. The explicit and definite negligence found excludes from our consideration any other suggested negligence not found by the jury.\nIf the jury had found that the company had reasonable grounds to anticipate any such mischievous interference of the boys as was proved and had neglected to take reasonable care to guard against it, or if they had found that the company defendant had not properly braked and secured the cars on the inclined grade, a totally different case would have been presented for our consideration.\nOn the findings of fact, however, of the negligence of the company, I am quite unable to hold them liable.\nI think the principles laid down by the Court of Appeal in the case of McDowall v. Great Western Rly Co.[5], must govern our judgment here. These principles stand unquestioned to this day. One of them, as stated by Vaughan-Williams L.J. at p. 337 I take to be this that\nin those cases in which part of the cause of the accident was the interference of a stranger or third person the defendants are not held responsible unless it is found that that which they do or omit to do\u2014the negligence to perform a particular duty\u2014is itself the effective cause of the accident,\nand\nthat in every case in which the circumstances are such that any one of common sense having the custody of or control over a particular thing would recognize the danger of that happening which would be likely to injure others, it is the duty of the person having such custody or control to take reasonable care to avoid such injury.\nHaving regard to the facts proved and the findings of the jury, I cannot reach a conclusion that the defendants are liable in this action.\nI have carefully considered the cases of Cooke v. Midland Great Western Railway, decided by the House of Lords[6], and of Crane v. South Suburban Gas Co.[7], neither of which, it appears to me, question or qualify the principles upon which McDowall v. Great Western Railway Co.[8] above cited was decided. On the contrary, Lord Macnaghten, in the former case, with whose opinion Lord Loreburn concurred, approved expressly of the opinions expressed by Romer & Sterling L.JJ. in McDowall v. Great Western Rly. Co.,8 which, as I read them, are in full accord with those of Vaughan-Williams from which I have quoted.\nSalter v. The Dominion Creosoting Company.\nIdingtonJ.\u2014This action was brought against the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. and the respondent, the Dominion Creosoting Co. The jury found a verdict against both. The learned trial judge thereupon entered judgment against both. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, that court maintained the judgment against the British Columbia Electric Railway Company but allowed the appeal as against the respondent.\nThe British Columbia Electric Company appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and that appeal is still pending there.\nThe appellant brings the appeal here against the judgment of the Court of Appeal exonerating the respondent.\nThe question of the liability of the respondent does not necessarily turn upon the facts implicating, or alleged to implicate, the British Columbia Electric Company.\nBoth companies may be liable, but the facts are such that the liability of either cannot in itself necessarily in law imply the liability of the other. They were independent actors and whether jointly liable or not need not concern us herein. I desire under such circumstances as I have set forth to refrain from passing any opinion upon the liability of the company which is not before us. Yet it is necessary to state a good many facts which may bear upon the question of that company's liability in order to understand the claim made against the respondent.\nThe respondent was engaged in delivering creosoted blocks, for paving streets in Vancouver, brought in railway freight cars, loaded therewith, over the British Columbia Electric Railway Company's railway tracks. The latter company operated a street railway in said city and the appellant whilst a passenger in one of its passenger cars, used in such service, received serious injuries caused by a collision of one of the said freight cars with the said passenger car under circumstances I am about to relate.\nThe British Columbia Electric Railway Company had placed at different times on its track freight cars carrying said blocks for the respondent till there were in all four such cars at one time placed at short distances apart to be unloaded by the respondent at points where its servants had directed them to be placed for that purpose. The British Columbia Electric Company had taken care, when so placing each of said cars, to have the brakes applied by the air compressor available in the operation and took care in connection with that operation to have blocks put in front of the wheels and so pinched thereby as to render it difficult, if not impossible, to move any of them by such means as were resorted to by the mischievous boys who later interfered.\nThe respondent's men later on, for their convenience, having desired the cars to be moved further down the grade, opened the brakes and removed these blocks and then moved the cars further down than they had originally been placed. They then again put some blocks in front only of the car furthest down the grade, and applied the brakes by such simple contrivances as they found available in the absence of a shunter. It seems clear that this second attempt to fix the cars and prevent their moving was far from being as efficient as the first operations performed by the British Columbia Electric Company's men.\nIt is said that the car, or perhaps two cars, last placed by the British Columbia Electric Company were left by it on a level part of the track, but all were, as finally placed by respondent, on a down grade of from two to two and a half per cent.\nIt was attempted to be proved that this second operation was done by the authority of the British Columbia Electric Company. That attempt at proof failed to convince the jury, who answered a question submitted on the point, by saying that it was doubtful if any authority had been given.\nIt seems clear from all this that whatever responsibility existed for securing the cars from being moved by any extraneous cause was thus made to rest upon the respondent. Not only did it assume the responsibility for its men attempting to fix the cars, where they placed them, by the less efficient means they had adopted than the British Columbia Electric Company had applied; but also the entire responsibility for whatever might arise, which either company was bound to have anticipated and against which it should have protected any one liable to suffer from the consequences of want of due care.\nIt may well be that the means adopted by the British Columbia Electric Company were less efficient than the surrounding circumstances demanded; and that seems to be the basis of the finding against the company.\nFrom the moment the respondent took upon itself to meddle with the cars it assumed, in such a case, the entire responsibility, whatever it was, for seeing that neither life, nor person, nor property, was jeopardized by having the cars on such an incline, movable, or in danger of being set rolling down the incline.\nThe cars were started rolling down that incline by some mischievous boys, from a nearby school, at noon hour, unloosening the brakes on the car furthest uphill.\nAccording to the story of Law, an eleven year old actor in that enterprise, there were no blocks removed from the front of the car wheels.\nOf course the momentum of the loaded car furthest from the point of collision (which was the one the boys meddled with) would account for much and that be aided by those started thereby lower down.\nIt is not necessary here to enter upon the story in all its details. Suffice it to say that the car furthest up the incline having been released was propelled by its own gravity against the lower one and all so moved on, that a collision took place between those freight cars and the passenger coach of the British Columbia Electric Company in which the appellant was, and he thereby sustained serious injuries.\nIt is hardly arguable and indeed was not much pressed in argument that, if the respondent can on any ground be held liable for the result of those boys' actions there was no evidence to submit to a jury.\nI am unable to accept the view presented by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, and acted upon by that court, in exonerating respondent from any liability.\nThe attempt to handle these cars without the necessary appliances to control their possible movements was rather a hazardous proceeding in itself. Suppose the cars or any of them had got beyond the control of those so handling them and then accidentally collided with a passenger car, surely the respondent would have been held liable for the damages suffered thereby. It would have furnished no excuse for respondent to have said that it or its servant had not any knowledge of railway business or of the precautions needed to be taken.\nIn assuming as the court below does that the moving of the cars\nwithout the British Columbia Electric Company's shunter and crew in attendance with proper facilities,\ndid not affect the situation at all, I respectfully submit there is error. Indeed it seems to me there is a grave misapprehension of the facts, for the cars were not braked and blocked in the same manner, and by the same efficient means, as I understand the evidence, they had been when placed by the British Columbia Electric Company.\nThe jury heard the men who performed the operation and looking at the evidence may not have accepted literally all they said as true. And even if there was a perfunctory doing of that so as to lend a similarity of appearance to the results, it is not self evident that they were identical in efficiency.\nTo my mind there is ample evidence to warrant the jury in making the broad distinction they do.\nThe place where these cars were placed was on the public highway. One had been placed there on a Monday and later removed. Two of those in question were placed on Tuesday morning and two more on Tuesday evening and all left braked and blocked by the British Columbia Electric Company. On Wednesday at noon, the time of the accident, they stood, as imperfectly braked by respondent, and without any blocking in front of any but the one furthest down the hill. This position of the cars and these conditions as to blocking is that outlined by the respondent's foreman. I fail to find them wear much resemblance to that which is stated to have been the condition in which they were left by the railway company.\nThe difficulty in the case is caused by the interference of the boys, and the question of law thus started is as to whether or not that was such an occurrence as ought to have been foreseen and provided against Its determination depends on the facts which I think were clearly questions for the jury.\nThe cars were clearly liable to all sorts of interference by boys or grown-up idlers, or by movements of other cars or by storms of wind, and their situation liable in such case to produce the disastrous result in question herein.\nThe question in the analogous case of Cooke v. Midland Great Western Railway Company[9], for the consideration of the jury is put thus at page 234 by Lord Macnaghten:\u2014\nWould not a private individual of common sense and ordinary intelligence, placed in the position in which the company were placed, and possessing the knowledge which must be attributed to them, have seen that there was a likelihood of some injury happening to children resorting to the place and playing with the turntable, and would he not have thought it his plain duty either to put a stop to the practice altogether, or at least to take ordinary precautions to prevent such an accident as that which occurred?\nLord Macnaghten proceeds to say:\u2014\nThis, I think, was substantially the question which the Lord Chief Justice presented to the jury. It seems to me to be in accordance with the view of the Court of Queen's Bench in Lynch v. Nurdin[10], and the opinion expressed by Romer and Sterling L.JJ. in McDowall v. Great Western Rly. Co.[11].\nThe McDowall Case11 is that upon which the respondent most strongly relies. The respective facts in each case, as to the care taken to provide against the contingency of interference by boys, makes a marked distinction between that case and this in hand.\nThere reliance was also placed upon the fact that boys had trespassed for years upon the company's premises in question but had never ventured to move a car. In this case, so far from having such assurance to rely upon, these very boys had just got done, on the day in question, amusing themselves in going a step beyond the ordinary form of boyish trespass by running a hand-car of the railway company without interference by any one. Having tried that experiment unchecked, they grew bolder and tried to follow the bad example of what they or others had done a few weeks before with another car. What is the law applicable thereto?\nI have considered the McDowall Case[12] and all the other cases counsel have referred us to, and others, including the recent case of Ruoff v. Long & Co.[13], not cited. I doubt if it is possible by any ingenuity to reconcile all that has been said in these numerous cases and give even an appearance of consistency to the decisions, or find in some of them an observance of the principles of law which have many times been set forth, relative to the duty of anticipation to be observed in such like cases, and the province of a jury as absolute judges of the fact.\nThe law so set forth is simple and in the last analysis nothing but enlightened common sense. It would be futile to demonstrate, even if one could, by an analysis of the cases and what is implied therein, how and why such clear law has become so much mystified, merely by an appearance of learning, through the use of words and possibly more words; for the law has not been changed thereby. It may have been thus rendered confusing to those who feel they have to resort to decided cases and the numerous dicta to be found therein, rather than rely upon the long established principles of law by which the case to be decided should be governed, either as regards the liability in question or the mode of its determination, by which in our system of jurisprudence the trial of fact rests solely with the jury, and only the law with the judiciary.\nThe result of the test suggested by Lord Macnaghten and accepted, at least in words, by those he refers to, when it comes to be applied by a jury, and their verdict has been approved by an able judge, as happened in the McDowall Case[14] may be set aside by three or more other men, who may be possessed of greater learning relative to law in general, but perhaps, for aught one knows, of less actual experience than either jury or judge, of the world of affairs relative to possibilities or probabilities of what was likely to have happened, for example, to a brake van and cars left in a particular situation, unless due care has been taken to avert the consequences of such possible or probable acts as produced the injury complained of in such case.\nWhy should this be so? The jury may not have been properly instructed in regard to the law and exactly what they have in such a case to consider and determine; or they may not have had the evidence to warrant such finding as would answer the test suggested; or from some cause or other in the way of sympathy or prejudice, failed to act within their limits of law and evidence and thus reached a conclusion that twelve reasonable men could not properly have come to. In any such case an appellate court may interfere.\nThere is such an infinite variety of possible situations and possible surrounding circumstances out of which may arise the question of likelihood of some injury happening through the acts of others relative to the car left on a railway track that each case must be determined by the facts presented therein.\nThere should not in reason, I imagine, be demanded the same care to protect, against such contingencies, a car or cars left upon a siding far from the haunts of men or children, as on a public highway in a town or city. But that there is need for such care in such latter situation surely no one of sense can now deny. Why did the British Columbia Electric Company's men who left the cars there take such steps as they did by braking, tightly as power could, each car? Why put blocks in front of the fore wheels of each car if nobody is likely to interfere? Why do we hear of the use of toggles in such a connection? And apart from these means and need for their use being present to the minds of railway men in Vancouver as shewn by evidence and signifying, if common sense be applied, why the need of these things was felt, we have also another means suggested by the witnesses herein as not uncommon, when cars have to be kept in an exposed situation. Surely all these things imply much knowledge of needs begotten of sad experience. Are we to be assumed to be so astute as to find another meaning therein, or so stupid as not to be able to read or interpret what the man in the street can?\nAny single appliance of either sort would quite suffice to keep the car from moving of its own weight or by reason of wind even on a slight down-grade.\nIt is the possibility of improper interference that evidently suggested a combination of all these means being used. To say that no one could be called upon to anticipate the pranks of children is not to my mind self evident. And indeed the possibility of that being a cause of cars moving when left unsecured, must depend upon the quality of the children in each country and the vigilance of the police coupled with the kind of education and bringing up the children get.\nThe conditions must vary in different places. I am not diposed to criticize a jury's view of what evidence may be needed in their own neighbourhood in regard to the probability of such things being done by school children as proven herein. I am not prepared to say that the jurymen who had to consider the probability of such injury happening in the way it did and the need of its being provided against, were without evidence entitling them to find that the respondent was negligent in that regard and its negligence a proximate cause of the injury complained of.\nI quite agree with the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia in appeal, when he remarked that the practice of submitting a separate question relative to the necessity of anticipating the result complained of is to be preferred because it keeps before the minds of the jurors what they might otherwise overlook.\nIn saying so, I by no means desire to encourage the submission of a multiplicity of questions which often tend to confuse the minds of jurors. That aspect of this particular class of cases does not often occur in accident cases where negligence is charged.\nThe cause and consequences are usually self evident. In this class of cases they are not always of necessity so. Want of direction by the learned trial judge in that behalf was not complained of at the trial or indeed pressed in argument.\nI see, however, no reason to suppose that the jury did not fully appreciate the point and understand what was involved in the question submitted. After all, it comes back to the question of the respondent attempting that which ought never to have done by its men.\nIt seems quite clear that the placing of these cars was a matter which had been so safeguarded by the railway company as to require a special leave to its employees to permit cars to be placed for any consignee receiving freight.\nI think respondent must abide by the consequences of its meddling with them.\nIt is, I respectfully submit, rather an absurd excuse that is urged on its behalf that its servants had not the necessary experience. So much the more reason why they should have asked the railway company to lend its aid with the light of that experience, instead of attempting something they possibly knew nothing about. As a matter of fact some of them seem to have had some railway experience but not enough of the sense of responsibility they ought to have had.\nCan any one doubt that the mischievous boys, if of an age to appreciate what they were about, would be liable for all the damages they caused? How much better is respondent's position than theirs?\nOf course if it had succeeded in establishing that what was done by it was with the leave and as directed by the railway company, this excuse would be intelligible. But failing that, I can find no excuse for it, even in relation to the question, so much debated, of the likelihood of the boys or others intervening and their acts being provided against.\nI conclude for all these several reasons that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment as against the respondent be restored with costs of this appeal and so much of the costs of the appeal in the court below as properly attributable to its share in that appeal beyond what was necessarily additional to said appeal by reason of the railway company being a party thereto.\nGeall v. The Dominion Creosoting Company\nIdington J.:\u2014This appeal was argued along with the case of Salter v. same parties.\nThe railway company having been held liable by the Court of Appeal and the respondent exonerated by that court this appeal is taken as against the latter part of said judgment. The main facts bearing upon the liability of the respondent are the same as in the Salter Case. I have reached the same conclusion in this as in that case and for the reasons I assign therein save as hereinafter expressed.\nI observe that the verdict of the jury is not in the same language as that adopted in the Salter Case but is more general and comprehensive. It seems to me that the finding must be read in light of the proceedings and charge of the learned trial judge and that when regard is had to these things there is not much difficulty in understanding what the meaning of the jury's finding is.\nThere was no objection taken to the learned trial judge's charge in relation to anything in question herein or any request by counsel to submit any more specific question bearing upon the question of the likelihood of the cars being interfered with by boys or other idlers.\nThat aspect of the case was no doubt well treated by counsel in addressing the jury. I do not think, in absence of any objection to the learned trial judge's charge relevant to that, we should presume that there was any oversight in the learned judge's charge in failing to do more than he did. I may repeat, however, that we should prefer specific attention in this class of cases being drawn to the question of the likelihood of boys or others improperly meddling with the cars as a matter to be foreseen and guarded against.\nThe case of Jamieson v. Harris[15], is cited by respondent's counsel. Is it unfair to assume that the decision in that case should have been present to the minds of counsel at the trial? If not, then was the time to have pointed out the need of a specific question and answer.\nThat was a case where the unfortunate plaintiff suffered from the multiplicity of the questions submitted. Indeed, there were no less than twenty-five questions submitted there and, as the majority of this court held, the real point at issue had not been effectively hit by any of them.\nI did not think then that the jury should have been held to have misunderstood what they were trying. Nor do I find here that they failed to comprehend what they were about.\nI must, however, frankly say that the answer returned in this case does not as clearly lend itself to the meaning I have attached to that in the Salter Case and hence the stress I have laid in the latter part of my opinion in that case does not seem to have as much force when applied to this verdict as to that in the Salter Case.\nThe other reasons I have there assigned, however, seem to me sufficient to entitle me to reach the result I do herein upon the assumption that the case at the trial was fought out on all that was involved in the question of due care to be taken by the respondent.\nIf I had reached any other conclusion it would not be that of the court below dismissing the action as against respondent but of a new trial for which nobody seems anxious herein.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored with costs of this appeal and in the court below, save such extra costs (if any) as entailed by the British Columbia Electric Company being a party thereto.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The judgment of Mr. Justice Lush in Ruoff v. Long & Co.[16], contains at page 157 of the report an exposition of the principles and considerations which were held to govern the decision of the case in which he was giving judgment and which, I think, are precisely applicable for the decision of the dominating question raised by this appeal. That question is whether the acts of the respondent's servants could properly be held by a jury to be the proximate cause of the most unfortunate accident which led to the proceedings in these actions. I quote from Mr. Justice Lush verbatim in these words:\u2014\nBut in the present case there is no ground for saying that the defendants placed a dangerous thing or an obstruction upon the highway, or in any sense used the highway unlawfully. They left a motor lorry in the street for a few minutes. It could not start of itself. In leaving it standing in the street for that short time they did nothing unlawful. . Then what is the duty of a person situated as the defendants were? He must take reasonable means to prevent such mischief as he ought to contemplate as likely to arise from his user of the highway. As a matter of fact the County Court Judge did not find that this accident was likely to arise from the defendants' user. If he had so found I agree that there was no sufficient evidence to support the finding. There would have been no danger if these two persons had not by their irresponsible acts converted into a source of danger a thing which in itself was perfectly safe and could do no harm to anybody. We need not go so far as to hold that a person lawfully leaving a vehicle standing unattended in a highway can in no circumstances be held responsible for damage through the intervening act of a third party. The circumstances might be such that he ought to recognize that he was offering a temptation or invitation to another to set the vehicle in motion and that danger might result to third persons. The chain of causality may be complete although a link in the chain is the intervening act of a third person. But the act which causes the mischief must be one which he would properly anticipate. In Latham v. Johnson[17], Hamilton L.J. states a rule which he says is as old as Scott v. Shepherd[18], namely, that a person who, in neglect of ordinary care, places or leaves his property in a condition which may be dangerous to another may be answerable for the resulting injury, even though but for the intervening act of a third person that injury would not have occurred. The Lord Justice proceeds: \"Children acting in the wantonness of infancy and adults acting on the impulse of personal peril may be and often are only links in a chain of causation extending from such initial negligence to the subsequent injury. No doubt each intervener is a cause sine qua non, but unless the intervention is a fresh, independent cause, the person guilty of the original negligence will still be the effective cause, if he ought reasonably to have anticipated such interventions and to have foreseen that if they occurred the result would be that his negligence would lead to mischief.\" That indicates that a person who so leaves his property will not be responsible if the mischief is created by a fresh, independent cause, and that a fresh, independent cause may be one which in the circumstances he is under no obligation to contemplate.\nThe question, which must be answered in the affirmative then if the appellants are to succeed, is this: Could the jury properly find that the respondents servants ought reasonably to have anticipated the acts of the boys who loosened the brake on the first car and to have foreseen that such intervention would lead to mischief? As to the second branch of the question, I should have no trouble with that if an affirmative answer to the first branch could be justified on the evidence, but to that branch of the question I think there is no evidence to justify such an answer. There was something, it is true, to shew that apprehensions of interferences by school boys were entertained by some of the servants of the railway company and it may be, I express no opinion on the point, that an inference might properly be drawn that the experience of the employees of that company had proved more instructive than the experience of others; but there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the extent or nature of the risk proved to have been incurred by leaving these street cars unattended when the mischievous propensities of the school boys frequenting the neighbourhood are revealed by the court had been brought home by any special warning or experience to the present respondents.\nAnglin J.\u2014The negligence charged against the defendants, the Dominion Creosoting Company, in both these cases is that after four cars of their co-defendants, the British Columbia Electric Company, had been placed by that company in a situation of comparative safety on level ground at the top of the grade, the Creosoting Company moved them to a place of much greater danger, i.e., down on to the slope or grade, failed to brake them properly, failed to block three of the cars and \"to pinch\" the block under the fourth, and, knowing the risk to be apprehended, left the cars in this dangerous position unguarded. The finding of the jury in the Geall Case is that the Creosoting Company neglected\nto take proper precautions when the cars were in their charge to be unloaded,\nand in the Salter Case, that the Creosoting Company was negligent\nin moving the cars without the British Columbia Electric Railway Company's shunter and crew in attendance with proper facilities.\nIn both cases the jury also found that the Creosoting Company had failed to establish authority from the British Columbia Company to move the cars down the grade. The fact that they moved the cars from above the grade down the hillside is undisputed.\nThe evidence makes it reasonably clear that brakes can be more securely set by air pressure than by hand\u2014so much so that, whereas a boy could release brakes set by hand with comparative ease, he probably could not release brakes set by air; that it is a reasonable precaution to block as well as to brake cars on a grade; that the blocks should be \"pinched\" so that they cannot slip and cannot be easily dislodged; and that there is a knack in hand-braking, which is acquired by training and experience. The Creosoting Company's employees were not trained or experienced brakesmen. There is also evidence from the respondent's foreman that he knew of the proximity of the school boys and of their mischievous tendencies and had in mind the danger of their tampering with the cars and feared that \"they might have got the cars going,\" as they had on other occasions. He was aware of the danger involved in this. Yet he left the cars in the temporarily disused highway near a school-house at the \"noon hour\" when he knew the boys would be out of doors and without supervision, on the grade braked only by hand by inexperienced men, and with a block under only one car, and that block not \"pinched.\" What he anticipated might occur then happened.\nUnder these circumstances, notwithstanding the very meagre charge to the jury, I think we may and should read the verdict in each case as covering the negligence charged against the respondents and involving a finding that their employees either anticipated, or should have anticipated, that the school boys might release the cars. That they did in fact so anticipate was established by their foreman's undisputed testimony. Without so finding, the juries (as is pointed out by Macdonald C.J.) could not properly have found, as they did, that the respondents' negligence was the proximate cause of the collision in which the plaintiff Salter and the deceased Geall were injured. They were explicitly told that the plaintiffs must establish \"negligence (which) was the proximate cause of the accident,\" consisting in a failure\nto take reasonable care under all the circumstances not to injure another * * * not to expose other people to unnecessary risk in connection with (their) operations.\nThese cases are distinguishable from Richards v. Lothian[19], relied on by Mr. Tilley, because there the verdict was held not to involve a finding of failure to guard against a mischievous act that should have been anticipated, which I think may fairly be held to be implied in the findings in the case before us, as it was in Cooke v. Midland Rly. Co.[20].\nUpon the findings so viewed the respondents are liable in both these actions, which seem to me to fall directly within the principle of the decision of the Cooke Case20. There a turntable was left unlocked and therefore easily movable by children. It was situated close to a public road from which it was separated only by a defective fence through which children were in the habit of trespassing to the knowledge of the company's servants. Here the cars were left on the temporarily unused highway, insecurely braked and insufficiently blocked, on a dangerous grade and therefore capable of being easily moved by children, whose proximity and mischievous propensities were known to the company's foreman in charge. This is indeed an a fortiori case because the injury here was sustained not by the mischievous meddlesome trespassers themselves, as it was in the Cooke Case20 but by innocent third persons. The language of Denman C.J. in the case of Lynch v. Nurdin[21], is in point:\u2014 If I am guilty of negligence in leaving anything dangerous in a place where I know it to be extremely probable that some other person will unjustifiably set it in motion to the injury of a third, and if that injury should be brought about, I presume that the sufferer might have redress by action against both or either of the two, but unquestionably against the first.\nLord Atkinson in his speech in the Cooke Case[22], at p. 237, if I may be permitted to say so with respect, admirably expresses the ground of liability in a case such as this.\nThe latest case illustrating liability for leaving unguarded near a highway a dangerous thing which it should have been anticipated might be so interfered with as to cause injury, though not directly in point, is Grain v. South Suburban Gas Co.[23].\nThe McDowall Case[24], relied on by the respondents, is, I think, distinguishable from that at bar in several respects. In that case the cars were left on a private right-of-way safely braked. Upon the evidence the Court of Appeal concluded that there was nothing to warrant a finding that the railway company ought reasonably to have anticipated that the boys would do or might do, what they in fact did, or that the risk of their doing such acts was known to the company. The evidence of the company's foreman in the present case is not merely that the risk was known, but that he feared that the very thing that occurred might happen.\nI would, therefore, allow these appeals with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and would restore the judgments of the trial courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants Geall and Adams: McLellan, Savage & White.\nSolicitors for the appellant Salter: Farris & Emerson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge.\n[1] 10 W.W.R. 620; 10 W.W.R. 617.\n[2] 25 D.L.R. 543; 9 W.W.R. 75.\n[3] [1916] 1 K.B. 33.\n[4] 9 C.B. 392.\n[5] [1903] 2K.B. 331.\n[6] [1909] App. Cas. 229.\n[7] [1916] 1 K.B. 33.\n[8] [1903] 2K.B. 331.\n8 [1903] 2K.B. 331.\n[9] [1909] App. Cas. 229.\n[10] 1 Q.B. 29.\n[11] [1903] 2K.B. 331.\n11 [1903] 2K.B. 331.\n[12] [1903] 2 K.B. 331.\n[13] [1916] 1K.B. 148.\n[14] [1903] 2 K.B. 331.\n[15] 35 Can.

As it was raining, the pavement was slippery. The hill has always been considered as a very dangerous one: half way down there is a stiff turn to the right and the highway is along the edge of a precipice of over twenty feet high. The respondent had erected a prop wall up to the road surface and had put on that wall a wooden fence. The chauffeur, noticing that the wheels of his car were slipping, put on the brakes, but with no result, the automobile ascended the curb stone and the sidewalk, broke through the fence and fell down the incline. The appellant, seriously wounded, claimed from the respondent damages to the amount of $2,500 on the grounds that the accident had been caused by the bad condition of the hill and the want of proper protection for the public. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel on behalf of both parties, the court reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs, Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nBernier K.C. and Dion for the appellant,\nAlex.

Thereupon, Rollit secured a sub-option on that property from the Colonial Real Estate Company, which had an option to purchase from the owners, the Grey Nuns, the price to be paid being $395,000.00. Rollit took such option \"on behalf of his client,\" but it has been found by both courts below, as a fact, that in doing so, he was not acting as the agent of the appellants. Subsequently, the appellant Morin became aware of the fact that the respondent was Rollit's undisclosed principal but said nothing at the time. The conditions of the option held by Rollit were altered, with respect to the terms of payment, to suit the appellants; and to bind the option, Rollit paid the Colonial Real Estate Company $5,000.00, which sum he had received from the appellants. The appellants were notified in due course that Rollit and his principal were prepared to sell the property and make good the title in accordance with the terms of appellants' letter, but the appellants refused to carry out the bargain. The result was that the appellants bought the property direct from the Grey Nuns for the price at which the latter agreed to sell to Rollit; and the respondent lost the benefit of his option, i.e., $29,824, for the recovery of which he took action against the appellants.\nThe judgment of the trial judge, Panneton J., maintaining the action of the respondent, was affirmed by the Court of Review; and, on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the judgment was also affirmed by a majority of the court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nLouis Boyer K.C. for the appellants.\nLafleur K.C. and G.

While he was operating a circular saw, his left hand was suddenly turned into the teeth of the saw. The respondent took an action in damages for $10,000.00, alleging that the accident occurred because there was no guard over the saw, when the appellant should have had one installed. The appellant denied any liability for the reasons that the respondent had, for a long time before the accident, control of the saw, that he was himself aware of the necessity of a guard and that he had never complained or asked that one should be installed.\nThe trial court dismissed the action on the ground that the respondent was alone responsible for the accident. But this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal who held that the appellant was also, though in a less degree, liable and, on account of contributory negligence, assessed damages at $2,000.00.

The defendant's negligence complained of and found by the jury was in having a switch stand \"too close to the rail.\" The trial judge entered a verdict on the jury's findings for the damages found by them, which verdict was set aside and the plaintiff's action dismissed by the Appeal Court of Saskatchewan. That court held that there was no evidence showing that placing the switch where it was placed was contrary to any order of the Board of Railway Commissioners or was not according to good railway practice; and, moreover, that the accident was due to plaintiff's own negligence. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel on behalf of both parties, the court reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, maintained the appeal with costs, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies dissenting.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nP.

Statutes, 1910-1911, c. 9.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in banco[1], affirming, the court being equally divided, the judgment of Newlands J. at the trial.[2].\nThe respondent company, as administrators of the estate of one Thomas Cook, brought an action at law against the defendant (appellant) to recover damages for the death of the said Cook, while in the defendant's employ. The jury brought in a verdict for the plaintiff; but the trial judge reserved his decision on a motion for judgment and subsequently dismissed the action with costs2. The plaintiff, after serving a notice of appeal, abandoned his appeal and made an application, before the same trial judge, to have compensation assessed under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" This was granted and the plaintiff was awarded $2,000 damages.\nThe principal contentions of the appellant were:\n1. That the respondent's right to compensation was conditioned upon the determination in the common law action that the defendant was liable under the Act. 2. That the application for assessment was not made immediately after the judgment in the common law action, as required by the Act, and that, the appeal having been abandoned, the respondent lost the right to apply, which the statute gave in case of an unsuccessful appeal. 3.

The will was drawn in French, and the bequest in question was of an immovable property described in the following words:\u2014\nMon immeuble portant les numeros civiques 1178 \u00e0 1186 inclusive ment de la rue St. Denis, coin Mont Royal, avec dependances.\nIt appears that, on that property on Mont Royal avenue, there were two stores in course of erection at the time when the will was made.

[1914] Ch. 75) do not apply to an action by a mortgagor to redeem, Idington J. dissenting.\nFaulds v. Harper (9 Ont. App. R. 537; 11 Can. S.C.R. 639) considered. Judgment of the Appellate Division (36 Ont. L.R. 587, affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s action was to redeem mortgaged land and the \u201cStatute of Limitations\u201d was pleaded in defence. It was admitted that the statute barred the action unless the plaintiff was relieved by the provisions of section 40 of the \u201cReal Property Limitations Act,\u201d R.S.O. [1914] ch. 75, which was the only question to be decided on the appeal.\nA.B. Cunningham for the appellant cited Hall v. Caldwell[2], Faulds v. Harper[3], and Pearce v. Morris[4]. J.A. Jackson for the respondent Darling, referred to Pugh v. Heath[5], Kinsman v. Rouse[6], and Forster v. Patterson[7].\nJ.L. Whiting, K.C. for the respondents Toner referred to Fisher on Mortgages (6 ed.) page 1403, Lake v. Thomas[8], and Court v. Walsh[9].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The case has been very elaborately considered in the courts below and I do not find it necessary to deal with the arguments at any length.\nThe appellant admits that unless he is relieved by the provisions of section 40 of the \u201cLimitations Act\u201d because of his disability his claim is barred by the Act. I agree with the conclusion at which the judges of the Appellate Division unanimously arrived that we ought to follow the decision in Faulds v. Harper[10], to the effect that the disability clauses of the \u201cReal Property Limitation Act\u201d do not apply to actions of redemption. This decision followed the English cases of Kinsman v. Rouse[11], and Forster v. Patterson[12], construing the Imperial Act which for material purposes cannot be distinguished from the Ontario statute.\nIf the Chief Justice of Ontario had been content to rest his judgment upon the authority of this case it would have been unnecessary to say more, but in the course of his lengthy reasons he denies one of the grounds on which Faulds v. Harper10, is supported? viz., that an action to redeem is not an action to recover land. He says:\nIt is true that a suit to redeem has been decided to be a suit to recover land.\nHe does not refer us to any case in which it was so decided and I myself know of none. Reference is made indeed to an obiter dictum of Strong J. in Faulds v. Harper[13], to the effect that the House of Lords having decided in Pugh v. Heath[14], that a foreclosure suit is an action for the recovery of land, it follows a fortiori that a redemption suit is also an action or suit for the recovery of land.\nI desire to speak with the greatest respect of the distinguished Chief Justice who presided for so long over this court, but the dictum cannot of course carry the same weight as a considered judgment in point. I do not understand how there can be any sequitur.\nThe action of foreclosure is different from the action to redeem in that by the former the mortgagee, who has the land merely as security for his debt, claims in default of payment to be adjudged the owner of the land. The action to redeem on the contrary supposes that the mortgagor is the owner of the property and seeks on payment of the amount of the debt for which it is security to have it discharged of the encumbrance.\nI agree with the view expressed by Sir George Jessel M.R. in Kinsman v. Rouse[15], that\nan action to redeem is not, properly speaking, an action to recover land.\nPerhaps as Burton J. said in Faulds v. Harper[16],\na suit to redeem may be in a sense a suit to recover land.\nIt is not an ordinary action to recover land within the meaning of the \u201cLimitations Act.\u201d The appeal should be dismissed and as I cannot see that the case admits of any doubt the respondents are entitled to their costs both here and in the courts below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014The question raised herein is whether an infant entitled to redeem and recover mortgaged lands may be barred by the mortgagee\u2019s possession for ten years which possibly had begun to run the day after the infant\u2019s birth.\nIt is stoutly maintained in argument and indeed seems to have been held in the court below, that such has been the state of law in Ontario, at least ever since \u201cThe Real Property Limitation Amendment Act, 1874\u201d came into force.\nI cannot entertain that view as ever having been correct. I need not, as will presently appear, for the purposes of this case, go so far as this rejection, which I express of such view, may imply.\nInasmuch, however, as the respondent\u2019s contention is that the \u201cReal Property Limitation Act,\u201d as it stood in the R.S.O. of 1897, is what should govern the rights of the parties herein and alleged to be in substance and effect identical with the like Act as it stood in R.S.O. 1877, which was passed upon by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 1883 in the case of Faulds v. Harper[17], adversely to the view I hold, I may be permitted to suggest in a few sentences the line of thought which followed up should demonstrate the fundamental error of that decision and the argument now rested thereon.\nThat court was dealing with the amending Act of 1874 above referred to, which did not come into force till the 1st July, 1877, by which time the legis- lature had passed, on the 2nd March, 1877, the bill for bringing into force the R.S.O. of that year then contemplated save as to the incorporation therein of the legislation of that session.\nNone of that legislation, so far as I can see, dealt with what we are concerned with herein.\nThe Legislature had thus provided, before the amending Act came into force at all, for its consolidation and hence for a declaration of the law as contained therein and in the prior relevant Acts thus to be substituted by the consolidation.\nMuch, I think too much, was made then and is yet of the provision of the Act expressing its purpose, when introducing and providing for enforcing the consolidation as to the latter not being new law.\nIt seems to me that the gist of the whole section 10 so providing, and which reads as follows:\u2014\n10. The said Revised Statutes shall not be held to operate as new laws, but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation, and as declaratory, of the law as contained in the said Acts and parts of Acts so repealed, and for which the said Revised Statutes are substituted\nis in the words \u201cas declaratory of\u201d.\nTrue, the official proclamation was not issued till 31st December, 1877. Yet I think the foregoing facts must be considered as relevant to a finding of the actual intentions of the legislature.\nAgain, the amending Act itself, by section 15 thereof, provided that the Acts so amended should be construed as in force therewith unless so far as inconsistent with the amending Act.\nWhen almost the whole purpose of the amending Act was to shorten the limitation period, as the recital shews, I fail to see why we should find anything inconsistent in reading section 5 thereof as if it had been (using the very words of section 15) \u201csubstituted in such statute,\u201d i.e., the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada of 1859, for section 45 thereof, which had been in the case of Hall v. Caldwell[18], so interpreted in the Court of Error and Appeal in accord with what is now urged by appellant as applicable herein.\nBe all that as it may, I think the revision of 1877, construed as courts are bound by above quoted section 10 to construe it, as declaratory of the law, should be read as it stands, and so read I see no difficulty in appellant\u2019s way.\nI may also point out that the clear opinion of this court in same Fauld\u2019s Case[19], was against the construction adopted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, although that opinion was perhaps not necessary for the reversal which was granted by the judgment of this court.\nThe opinion thus expressed has generally been referred to as an obitur dictum, but the more carefully one reads the judgment, he is driven to doubt it was not in the last analysis necessary to form such an opinion to maintain the judgment of reversal at all.\nMoreover, the decision in Heath v. Pugh[20], seems to have been relied upon for the opinion so expressed, and conclusively to establish the proposition that a suit for foreclosure is an action to recover lands within the meaning of the words used in the first section of the English \u201cLimitations Act,\u201d and in the Ontario Act so far as copied therefrom. Hence I think the correlative suit for redemption must likewise be so held.\nAs I suggested in argument, I am of the opinion that this case should be decided upon the \u201cLimitations Act,\u201d being 10 Edw. VII., ch. 34, passed 10th March, 1910, long before the time had run for respondents to have acquired by possession any title in or right to bar appellant\u2019s remedy to recover the lands in question by virtue of any statutory limitation.\nThat Act was an independent piece of legislation which specifically repealed, by section 60 thereof, all the former Acts bearing in the slightest upon what is in question herein.\nAs I could not get any answer from counsel for respondent explaining why this statute should not govern, save that the revision of 1897, was in force when possession by his client began to run, I imagine there is no other answer.\nI do not think it is a statute of limitation which happened to exist at any time before the title acquired by possession has extinguished that of him claiming, or at all events, barred or taken away his right of recovery, which can be made applicable and enforcible, but only a statute of limitations which either bars the remedy or extinguishes the title of him adversely affected by possession.\nClearly that of 1910 can alone be so depended on by the appellant or respondent, as defining and settling their relative rights.\nThen the exception given therein in favour of such persons suffering disability as appellant was, whose rights are saved by section 40 of said Act, which was that in truth which was consolidated in the R.S.O. 1914, and by section 40 thereof, exactly the same (except two words not capable of altering the sense) would seem to me to be almost too clear for argument had we not actual proof of much argument in and about same by means only, however, of harking back to something repealed. The said section 40, relating, as it expressly does, to\nthe period of ten years or five years (as the ease may be) herein limited,\nI am unable to see how there should be any doubt in regard to the construction of the Act if allowed to stand upon its plain reading without confusing it with other Acts it repealed, and other things which place no limitations upon the language used.\nAnd when, by the revision and consolidation which took place four years later, this Act was consolidated with others in R.S.O. 1914, its adoption in its entirety was such as made of it a continuous uniform statutory definition of the relation of the parties hereto, from the time when that period of time brought in question thereby first began to run, up to the date of the bringing of this action.\nIndeed, as already pointed out, virtually all prior Acts on the subject consolidated in chapter 133, R.S.O. 1897, except one section not bearing on what we have to deal with, had stood repealed for four years.\nAgain, if we consider the scope and purpose of the Act as a piece of independent and all comprehensive legislation on the subject, and we find it providing, as it does by section 24, for the common case of mortgage and other charges on land being barred by ten years after a present right to receive the money had accrued to some person capable of giving a discharge for or release of the same, thus obviously guarding the rights of infants, idiots and lunatics, it puzzles me to understand why the same classes as mortgagors or those who claimed under mortgagors, should intentionally be excluded from the like protection. I am clear it never was so conceived by the legislature.\nCertainly there is in the frame of the Act and the language used in the parts involved herein, no resemblance between either of these Acts and that upon which the late Sir George Jessel or Bacon V.C. proceeded in the respective decisions given by either of them and so much relied upon.\nThere was more of something akin to analogy between the amending Act which the Court of Appeal for Ontario chose to act upon and the English Act. But why should that trouble us now? Why seek to rest a judgment herein upon the confusion of the past, obviously a possible means of injustice, when the legislature has made all clear and a possible source of injustice has been eliminated?\nThis is one of many cases wherein English judicial authority must be examined closely in relation to the Act construed in order to see, that the Act professing to deal with the same kind of subject matter as our own legislature may have dealt with, is in truth the same, and its purpose expressed in the same language.\nThe English decisions on analogous Acts may be most instructive, and no lawyer here should pass them idly by, but often they proceed as in the case before us upon an Act so differently framed that we cannot say they are in such cases authorities we are bound to follow, but rather may say are to be discarded, when found likely to confuse our thought and perpetuate injustice.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division as against respondent Darling who should also bear the costs of the Toners.\nThere is a doubt in my mind as to the exact meaning of the formal judgment as it stands, and, rather than add to the confusion, I think, if the parties cannot agree as to the result flowing from the foregoing result, they should be left to speak to the minutes. DUFF J.\u2014The single question involved in this appeal can be stated and discussed without reference to any of the facts which have given rise to the litigation. The question is this\u2014do the disability clauses of the \u201cLimitations Act\u201d (Ontario) ch. 75, R.S.O. 1914, (section 40 et seq.) apply in the cases provided for by ss. 20, 21 and 22, relating to the time limit on actions of redemption brought by a mortgagor against a mortgagee who has obtained the possession or the receipt of the profits of some part of the land or the receipt of any rent comprised in his mortgage.\nI propose first to consider the provisions of the statute as it now stands in their bearing upon this question, that is to say of Part 1. The leading enactment is section 5, which I quote in full:\u2014\nNo person shall make an entry or distress, or bring an action to recover any land or rent, but within ten years next after the time at which the right to make such entry or distress, or to bring such action, first accrued to some person through whom he claims, or if such right did not accrue to any person through whom he claims, then within ten years next after the time at which the right to make such entry or distress, or to bring such action, first accrued to the person making or bringing the same. 10 Edw. VII. c. 34, s. 5.\nSection 6 contains a series of provisions laying down the rule for determining in each of the classes of cases dealt with, when the right to make an entry or distress or bring an action to recover land or rent shall for the purposes of the Act be deemed to have \u201caccrued\u201d; the point of time, that is to say, from which the statutory period is to run in these cases in which, including of course all the cases falling within section 5, the time limit is calculated from the accrual of the right.\nThese provisions of section 6 obviously are of no assistance for determining the effect or for dictating the application of section 20 or the two succeeding sections, 21 and 22; that is so because the time limit fixed by these sections upon the mortgagor\u2019s action for redemption in the particular case dealt with, namely, where the mortgagee is in possession of the mortgaged property in whole or in part, is calculated not from the time at which the right to bring an action for redemption accrues to the mortgagor, but from the time when the mortgagee has obtained possession; Re Metropolis and Counties Building Society[21], at pages 706-7; and it may be added that although it is not difficult to bring a mortgagee\u2019s action of ejectment, or a mortgagee\u2019s action for foreclosure within the third subsection of section 6, in order to determine the time of the accrual of his right within the meaning of section 5, it is not easy to find in any of the provisions of section 6 language which appears to contemplate a mortgagor\u2019s action for redemption.\nSection 20 and the complementary provisions contained in sections 21 and 22 are substantive provisions not organically related to sections 5 and 6, and not depending for their operation upon the ascertainment, through statutory definition or otherwise, of the time when the mortgagor\u2019s right to bring an action of redemption \u201caccrues.\u201d\nTurning now to section 40, that section provides, speaking broadly, that where a disability exists at the date when the right to bring an action to recover land or rent accrues at the expiry of the period of ten years or five years, limited in the preceding sections, the period shall be extended to the end of a further five years or until the time when such disability shall have ceased, whichever happened first.\nThe application of this section involves the deter- mination of the time when the right in question accrues; the section is dealing with periods of limitation calculated from that point of time; it connects itself naturally with sections 5 and 6 and fits in with them and it is perfectly obvious that it was framed with direct reference to them.\nIt is impossible to affirm any such thing as to its relations with section 20. I do not say that it is altogether a misnomer to describe an action of redemption against a mortgagee in possession, as an action for recovery of land. I am inclined to think that from the language used in Heath v. Pugh[22], at page 352, by Lindley J. (he is alluded to by Lord Selborne in appeal as a judge \u201cespecially familiar with equity\u201d) he would have thought it was not. It is nevertheless true, that Sir George Jessel had no hesitation in declaring that \u201caction for recovery of land\u201d is not an apt description of an action for redemption, the mortgagee being in possession, Kinsman v. Rouse[23], and Lord St. Leonards appears to have held the same view. But the most formidable difficulty in the way of connecting section 40 with section 20, arises from the circumstances already mentioned, that section 40 contemplates a period of limitation calculated from the date of accrual of the right of action, while the time limit laid down by section 20 for actions of redemption, is determined by reference to a date which has no necessary relation to the accrual of the right to commence the action. In order to meet this difficulty and to make section 40 applicable to cases arising under section 20, it is necessary to read the words in section 40,\u2014\ntime at which the right * * * to bring an action * * * first accrues as herein mentioned, as the equivalent of\ntime from which the periods of limitation herein provided for, begin to run, as herein mentioned,\nI think such a construction could not be supported. There is nothing in section 20 or section 40 either in language or substance which justifies the importing into section 20 of a qualification based on section 40. That section and the succeeding sections find their natural and, I think, their full effect when they are applied to cases arising under sections 5 and 6 and to any other cases, if there be such, where the period of limitation begins to run from the date of the accrual of the right of action.\nI conclude, therefore, that the statute as it now stands, when due effect is given the structure of the relevant sections, read as a whole, gives no support to the appellant\u2019s claim. I should not have found it necessary to examine the history of the legislation, but I have, however, attentively considered the discussion of the subject in the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario, which shews very clearly that such an examination would afford confirmatory grounds for the view at which I have arrived.\nAs to Faulds v. Harper[24], I have only to repeat that the question upon which we have to pass is still unsolved, after one has reached the conclusion that an action for redemption against a mortgagee in possession may for some purposes, be considered an action for the recovery of land. I should be disposed indeed to think it is so within the meaning of section 16 of the \u201cLimitations Act\u201d; the question, as I have said, is whether it is an action to recover land within the meaning of section 40 of the \u201cLimitations Act,\u201d and that is a question which must, to my thinking, be decided, as I have already said, with reference to the enactments of the statute read as a whole.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The material facts of this case are fully stated in the judgments below, 36 Ont. L.R. 587. All the authorities bearing upon the important question which it presents\u2014whether the disabilities sections of the \u201cReal Property Limitations Act of Ontario\u201d are applicable to \u201cactions to redeem\u201d\u2014are there so fully, and, if I may say so with respect, so ably discussed by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, that any further detailed reference to them would be supererogatory. It is perhaps needless to add that they have, however, been carefully examined and fully considered.\nI agree with the learned Chief Justice that the opinion expressed by Strong and Henry JJ. in Faulds v. Harper[25], that the disabilities sections apply to actions of redemption\u2014must be regarded as obiter. Mr. Justice Strong, with whom Ritchie C.J., Fournier and Taschereau JJ. concurred, certainly disposed of that appeal on the ground, which had been taken by Spragge C.J.O. in the Court of Appeal23, that the possession of the defendant was not that of a mortgagee but that of a fraudulent purchaser, and that the case was therefore not within the purview of the section of the statute which limits the time for bringing an action to redeem. There is no English decision upon the question presented which binds us\u2014Kinsman v. Rouse[26], and Forster v. Patterson[27], the two authorities relied upon by the appellant, having been decisions of single judges. Nor is there any such well established line of authority in the Province of Ontario as it would be undesirable that we should disturb. The view which prevailed in the Upper Canada Court of Error and Appeal in Hall v. Caldwell[28], was not accepted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Faulds v. Harper[29], where the majority of the court approved and accepted the decisions in Kinsman v. Rouse[30] and Forster v. Patterson[31], overruling a divisional court which had declined to follow them[32]. The view of the Court of Appeal was not accepted in this court by Strong and Henry JJ. who preferred that of the Court of Error and Appeal in Hall v. Caldwell27. The question may, therefore, be regarded as quite open, if not res integra, in this court.\nI should here state that there was no material difference between the terms and the collocation of the material sections in ch. 108 of the R.S.O. 1877, with which the courts dealt in Faulds V. Harper29 and the corresponding terms and collocation in the Consolidated Statutes of 1859, ch. 88, upon which Hall v. Caldwell28 had been decided. In both statutes the disabilities sections followed the section dealing with actions to redeem, and the \u201cas aforesaid\u201d in section 43 of 1877 was substantially the equivalent of the \u201chereinbefore mentioned,\u201d in section 45 of 1859. As now, in neither statute did the section dealing with actions to redeem contain any reference to disabilities.\nCourts of equity, applying the provisions of the statute of 21 Jac., 1 ch. 16, to redemption suits in equity by analogy held plaintiffs therein to be entitled by a like analogy to the benefit of the disabilities section of that Act. Beckford v. Wade[33], on page 99; Cook v. Arnham[34], at page 287, note (w). But suits in equity were brought directly within the Imperial Limitations statute, 3 & 4 Wm. IV., ch. 27, by sec. 24 thereof, and they were likewise expressly provided for in section 32 of the Upper Canada statute, 4 Wm. IV., ch. 1, which was carried into the Consolidated Statutes of 1859 as section 31 of ch. 88 and continued in the Ontario revision of 1877 as sec. 29 of ch. 108. This section was dropped from the revision of 1887, presumably because thought unnecessary after the introduction of the \u201cJudicature Act\u201d of 1881. Suits for redemption, specially provided for by section 28 of the Imperial Act of 3 & 4 Wm. IV., and by section 36 of the Upper Canada statute, 4 Wm. IV., ch. 1, are still explicitly covered in like terms by section 20 of the present Ontario statute. Since the statute of Wm. IV., it has not been necessary or permissible to deal with them by analogy as was formerly the practice in equity. The period of limitation to which they are subject and any qualifications upon it must be found within the statute.\nThe history of the Ontario statute under consideration is by no means conclusive upon the question before us. It rather presents different aspects according to the mode of looking at it, one or other of which lends colour to the contention of either party. The collocation of the sections in the Act of 1874 (ch. 16), and the use of the phrase \u201chereinbefore limited\u201d in the disabilities section (No. 5) thereof made it very clear (as it had been under the Act of 4 Wm. IV., ch. 1) that that section was not meant to apply to the subsequent section dealing with actions of redemption (No. 8). The order of the sections was changed, however, in the revision of 1877, the redemption section (No. 19) being then placed before the disabilities section (No. 43) and the words \u201cas aforesaid\u201d replacing the words \u201chereinbefore limited\u201d in the latter\u2014a restoration of the collocation of the Consolidated Statutes of 1859 on which Hall v. Caldwell[35] had been decided. That this change might give rise to some uncertainty apparently occurred to the revisors of 1887, because, while they maintained the order of 1877, they substituted for the words, \u201cas aforesaid,\u201d in section 43, the words \u201cas in sections 4, 5 and 6 mentioned,\u201d thus putting it beyond question that section 43 was intended to apply only to cases within the three sections so enumerated and not to \u201cactions to redeem\u201d specially dealt with by section 19. No change was made in the revision of 1897. A new Act was passed in 1910 (chapter 34) preparatory to the revision of 1914. In view of the terms in which the commission of the revisors was couched (R.S.O. 1914, Vol. III, p. cxxxvii.) and of the fact that \u201cThe Limitations Act\u201d was introduced and enacted in 1910 not as part of a revision, but as a separate Act, that statute cannot, I think, be regarded as subject to section 9 (1) of the \u201cAct respecting the Revised Statutes of 1914,\u201d (3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 2), but must be treated as new legislation. In the first of the disabilities sections of this Act (40) the words \u201cas herein mentioned\u201d were substituted for the words of section 43 of the Acts of 1887 and 1897, \u201cas in sections 4, 5 and 6 mentioned,\u201d the collocation of the sections being left unchanged. The Revised Statute of 1914, ch. 75, is identical with the Act of 1910. Any uncertainty in the application of the disabilities sections caused by the change in the order of sections made in 1877, which had been so carefully counteracted in 1887, was thus unnecessarily and, I cannot but think, unfortunately revived. If any section which should have been included was omitted from the enumeration it might have been added.\nWithout suggesting that there was sufficient ground for such uncertainty, I am, with great respect, unable, in view of the explicit provision of clause (i) of section 29 of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d (R.S.O. ch. 1), to assent to the view expressed by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that \u201cthe words \u2018as herein mentioned\u2019\u201d in section 40 of the Act of 1910 are \u201cthe equivalent of the words of the sections in the Revised Statutes of 1887 and 1897 which correspond to section 40, \u2018as in sections 4, 5 and 6 mentioned.\u2019\u201d\nI have made this resum\u00e9 of the history of the legislation under consideration in order that it may be understood that the effect of the various changes has not been overlooked.\nBut apart altogether from, and notwithstanding their history and the collocation of the sections in question in the Act of 1910 and the R.S.O. of 1914, ch. 75, I find in the terms of section 40 itself, cogent internal evidence of its inapplicability to section 20\u2014the section dealing with \u201cactions to redeem.\u201d The subject matter of section 40, as appears in its introductory terms, is a limitation period computed from\nthe time at which the right of any person to make an entry or distress or to bring an action to recover any land or rent first accrues.\nIt enables such a proceeding to be instituted\nat any time within five years next after the time at which the person to whom such right first accrued ceased to be under any such disability or died, whichever of those two events first happened.\nSection 5 prescribes the period within which the right to\nmake an entry or distress or bring an action to recover any land or rent. shall be exercisable; and section 6 defines when that right shall be deemed \u201cto have first accrued.\u201d The identity of the language used in section 40 with that found in sections 5 and 6 is most significant.\nSection 20, on the other hand, deals with a period of limitation reckoned not from the time of the first accrual of the right of action to redeem, but from another and usually an entirely different date, namely,\nthe time at which the mortgagee obtained the possession or receipt of the profits in any land or the receipt of any rent comprised in his mortgage,\nwhich it fixes as that from which the period of limitation upon the right of the mortgagor, or any person claiming through him, to bring an action to redeem shall be computed.\nThe equitable right to sue for redemption accrues as soon as non-fulfilment of the condition or proviso for defeasance has made the estate of the mortgagee absolute at law. It is not from the date of that first accrual of the right to bring an action to redeem that the prescriptive period runs under section 20, but from that of obtaining possession or receipt of the profits of the land. The right of redemption, when that occurs, may not be in\nthe person to whom such right first accrued.\nYet it is from the cesser of his disability or his death that the five years\u2019 period under section 43 is to be reckoned. These are the incongruous features which seem to me to afford practically conclusive evidence that the provisions of section 40 were not intended to be applicable to the case specially dealt with by section 20. Section 43, as Sir George Jessel said in Kinsman v. Roused[36],\nevidently refers to cases of ordinary ownership, where the rightful owner has been dispossessed. Section 20, on the other hand, deals with cases where a mortgagee has taken the possession to which the terms of his deed entitled him. To quote the learned Chief Justice of Ontario:\nThe words, \u201cas herein mentioned,\u201d in s. 40 (i.e., of the Revised Statutes of 1914), it will be observed, apply to the time at which \u201cthe right of any person to make an entry or distress or to bring an action to recover any land or rent first accrues.\u201d That is a matter dealt with by sec. 6, which defines the time at which the right first accrues in various cases, none of them being the case of a mortgagor seeking to redeem, and it is, I think, to these provisions that section 40 refers. The mortgage sections do not define the time at which the right to redeem shall be deemed to have first accrued, but the provision is that the action shall not be brought but within ten years next after the time at which the mortgagee obtained possession or receipt of the profits of the land.\nAlthough, as was pointed out by Sir John Beverly Robinson in Hall v. Caldwell[37], the sole apparent object of making the special provision for mortgagors\u2019 actions to redeem, now found in section 20, was to settle the time from which the prescriptive period governing them should be computed (see comment of Patterson J.A. in Faulds v. Harper[38], at pp. 556-7), and although such actions, especially when the mortgagee is in possession after default, should be regarded as actions to recover lands, the fact that the statute makes such a special and essentially different provision for them takes them out of the operation of sections 5 and 6.\nBecause the terms in which it is couched in my opinion as clearly preclude its application to cases within section 20 as they make obvious its reference to cases within sections 5 and 6, I respectfully concur in the conclusion of the Appellate Division that the disabilities section (40) with the ancillary sections 41 and 42, does not apply to actions to redeem. But for the respect which I entertain for the eminent judges of this court and of the former Court of Error and Appeal of Upper Canada who held contrary opinions, I should have reached this conclusion without much hesitation.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: A.B.

Under the provisions of the Land Titles Act of Alberta, the payment by a purchaser to his vendor of the purchase moneys, without notice of an assignment from the vendor to a third person, is valid.\nThe registration of a caveat by the transferee does not amount to such notice.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], which affirmed the judgment of Harvey C.J. at the trial[2], and dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on the present appeal are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nArmour K.C. and A. H. Clarke K.C. for the appellant.\nBennett K.C. and Sinclair K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014Mr. Justice Stuart prefaces his judgment in the Appellate Division with the observation that\nthe practice which seems to have obtained to some extent in this province whereby an owner of land, who has entered into a solemn agreement to convey the land to another upon payment of certain money, deliberately puts it out of his power to fulfil his contract by himself transferring the land to a third party * * * is a reprehensible one.\nThe qualification does not seem too severe, and it may be added that it is also invalid, unless it be in the case of an innocent purchaser without notice, of which there can be no question here, as the deed of assignment to the appellant sets out the sale already made to the respondents. An owner of the land, who had agreed to sell it, has parted with his ownership and has nothing left but the bare legal title.\nThe transfer of the title here was never effected as the transfer was not registered.\nThe appellant, in my opinion, had only an assignment of the debt, and registration does not enter into the case at all.\nIt seems unnecessary to say that the mere assignment of the debt could not affect the respondents, without notice. This was recognized, no doubt, in putting the respondents in as parties to the assignment of the 5th April, 1913, to acknowledge receipt of notice thereof, and it is strange that, if they were not asked to execute the deed, it should never even have been brought to their knowledge.\nThe Land Titles Office cannot be used for the purpose of giving any such notice. It would be extraordinary, if it could, that a purchaser should have to search his vendor's title every time before paying an instalment of the purchase money.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs, but I have considerable doubt whether the appellant is entitled to the reference offered him by the judgment on the trial.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Alberta (McCarthy J. dissenting), affirming a judgment of the trial judge, Chief Justice Harvey, dismissing the plaintiff's, appellant's, action to recover from respondents part of the purchase money of certain lands which the respondents had purchased from one Steinbreker and which purchase money had been assigned to the plaintiff-appellant subsequently to Kuebler's purchase of the lands from Steinbreker.\nThe facts are stated by Mr. Justice Beck in his judgment as follows and I agree generally with the conclusions of law he reached upon those facts:\u2014\nThere is really no dispute about the facts. I state them briefly.\nJohn and Arthur Steinbreker made on the 27th June, 1912, an agreement to sell certain land to W. A. Kuebler and Carl Brunner. The price was $21,600, payable $4,600 down and the balance, 6 payments of $2,834 or $2,833 on the 27th September, 1913 to 1918.\nThe land at the date of the agreement was subject to two mortgages for $2,000 and $500 held by one Thompson. By instrument dated the 5th April, 1913, the Steinbrekers assigned the moneys then owing by the purchaser to the plaintiff, stated therein to be $17,000 with interest at 6 per cent. per annum from the 27th June, 1912, and by the said instrument purported to grant and transfer to the plaintiff all their interest in the land, but expressly \"subject to the terms covenants and conditions contained in the said articles of agreement.\" Concurrently therewith the Steinbrekers executed a transfer of the land to the plaintiff.\nThe land at that time being subject to mortgage the duplicate certificate of title ought to have been and no doubt was in the Land Titles office.\nThe plaintiff\u2014and in this perhaps he was right\u2014did not register the transfer to him; but on the 7th April, 1913, he registered a caveat claiming an interest in the land \" under and by virtue of a transfer of the said described property of date 9th (a mistake for 5th) of April, 1913, from John Steinbreker and Arthur Steinbreker, registered owners, to Arthur M. Grace.\"\nNeither of the two purchasers\u2014defendants\u2014had any notice of these dealings between the Steinbrekers and the plaintiff, or of the caveat, until long after they had paid the Steinbrekers the full amount of the purchase money, which, however, they paid in entire good faith a considerable time before its maturity.\nThis action was brought by Grace to recover by way of an action for specific performance the balance of the purchase money, which by the agreement the defendants, Kuebler and Carl Brunner, had covenanted to pay to the Steinbrekers and which they had assigned as above mentioned to the plaintiff.\nFreda Brunner was made a party defendant because she had on the 24th January, 1914, registered a caveat claiming an equitable interest as purchaser from her co-defendants or one of them of a one-third interest in the land.\nThe defendants by way of counterclaim asked that the plaintiff be ordered to transfer the land to them.\nThere cannot be any doubt apart from the provisions of the \"Land Titles Act\" in Alberta which may affect the matter in controversy in that province that where a mortgagee assigns his mortgage and the mortgagor has not received notice of the assignment, he discharges his liability under the mortgage by payment to the mortgagee.\nI cannot draw any distinction in this respect between a purchaser who has entered into an agreement for the purchase of land and covenanted to pay the vendor the purchase moneys in instalments and an ordinary mortgagor. Payment by such purchaser to his vendor of his purchase money without notice of any assignment from the vendor to a third person of such purchase moneys is a good payment and pro tanto discharges the purchaser from further liability. The Ontario decisions would seem to have settled the law in that province in the same way, notwithstanding the provisions of the \"Registry Act\" of the province.\nThe main contention on the part of the appellant was that the legal effect of the filing of the above mentioned caveat by him was sufficient under the \"Land Titles Act\" to protect his rights exclusively to receive the purchase moneys Kuebler had agreed to pay Steinbrekers for the land, that it constituted constructive notice to Kuebler and that after the filing of such caveat Kuebler made any payments to any one else at his peril.\nThe plaintiff had full actual knowledge of the defendants' purchase and agreement to pay and he did not beyond fifing such caveat give any notice to the defendants of the transfer to him of the land and the assignment of the purchase moneys Kuebler had agreed to pay. He relied entirely upon the effect of the caveat which he registered and in effect contended that the right of the defendant to pay Steinbreker such purchase money unless and until he had received notice of the transfer and assignment, was defeated by the statute and that the filing of the caveat was sufficient notice.\nThe result of this contention if maintained would be that a mortgagor or purchaser such as defendant would be obliged to search the registry every time he made a payment on his mortgage or agreement to purchase in order to protect himself.\nWith the result of course we are not concerned if the \"Land Titles Act\" in its provisions relating to the filing of caveats has the effect plaintiff contends for.\nNow I understand a caveat is something which protects the existing rights of a man filing it in and to the lands mentioned in it. It does not create any new rights.\nThe question then immediately arises what were the plaintiff's rights with respect to these lands and the purchase moneys Kuebler had covenanted to pay for them at the time plaintiff filed his caveat.\nThey were of course the right to receive those moneys which had been assigned to them and to give a proper discharge to the party paying them.\nBut they did not involve an exclusive right to receive them unless and until they had given the party liable to pay them notice of their rights.\nThese rights were, in my opinion, subject to the right of the purchaser of the land to pay to the vendor from whom he had purchased the moneys he had covenanted to pay him unless and until he, the purchaser, had notice that such moneys had been assigned to another.\nThat right was in my opinion an equitable one which the filing of a caveat did not annul or abrogate.\nThe opinion of Mr. Justice Holroyd of the Supreme Court of Victoria on the point is cited by Mr. Justice Beck from the case of Nioa v. Bell[3]. That learned judge said in speaking of the effect of the provisions of the \"Victoria Transfer of Land Act\" (which is substantially the same as the \"Alberta Land Titles Act\") that:\u2014\nTo have destroyed it (the old equitable doctrine as to notice) the language should have been extremely clear and explicit, because it is a doctrine founded on the plainest principles of justice.\nI conclude therefore, concurring with both courts below, that the filing of the caveat in this case did not displace the equitable doctrine of the right of a mortgagor or purchaser such as Kuebler was, to pay the purchase money he had covenanted to pay to the person he had covenanted to pay to, unless and until he had received notice of the assignment of such moneys to a third person and that the mere filing of a caveat in the Registry Office was not such notice.\n\"It did not,\" as Stuart J. says in his reasons for judgment\nprotect him (the plaintiff-appellant) from the exercise by the purchaser of rights which he knew the purchaser had, rights, indeed, which were the very subject of his own contract with the vendor,\nand which of course were exercised without any actual notice or knowledge of appellant-plaintiff's assignment. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant, as the assignee of John and Arthur Steinbreker who had sold land in Alberta to the respondents Kuebler and Karl Brunner, sought specific performance of the contract after the purchasers had paid the price to the Steinbrekers in cash and a promissory note of fifteen hundred dollars which had passed into a third party's hands for value. The cash payments were made partly at the time of the sale and later by a reduced sum agreed upon in which considerable discount was allowed the purchasers in consideration of cash anticipating the time given by the agreement for payment thereof.\nThe appellant had made a loan to the Steinbrekers upon the security of the assignment to him of the said contract and other securities.\nHe never gave any notice of this assignment to the respondents, or either of them, and it is not pretended they had any notice of the assignment until long after they had paid in full, in the manner I have mentioned. These facts seem rather a novel foundation upon which to rest an action for specific performance at the suit of the appellant as an assignee of the contract for sale and purchase, hoping to enforce thereby a second payment of the price by the purchasers.\nI should, but for the fact evidenced herein to the contrary, have said such a claim was hardly arguable on the ordinary principles governing such suits.\nAnd when we find that, in Alberta, there is an express statutory provision which deals with assignments of choses in action, validating them upon notice in writing to the debtor, only from the date of such notice and then only subject to the equities which would have existed but for the enactment, we are puzzled to find it argued that there are some provisions in the \"Land Titles Act\" which enable a creditor in the case of sale and purchase of land to impose upon his debtor the obligation to search the Registry Office at the time of making any payment, no matter how trivial the amount of his instalment, before he can safely pay the man he bought from.\nLogically followed out the argument would require this search, on every occasion of payment, to ascertain whom to pay what he desired to pay.\nI must say it seems a startling proposition. And when we turn to the instrument of assignment by virtue of which this claim is set up and we find it expressly limited as follows:\u2014\nTo have and to hold the said lands and premises unto and to the use of the said assignee, his heirs and assigns forever, subject to the terms, covenants and conditions contained in the said Articles of Agreement,\nwe must ask ourselves whether it is possible that the Legislature, enacting such a statute as the \"Land Titles Act,\" can really have intended to have so dealt with the contractual relations of parties concerned in sales and purchases of land, as to bring about such confusion.\nI do not think it ever so intended or so expressed itself.\nThe usual way in which purchasers protect themselves against such possible frauds as the vendors committed and are in question here is to register a caveat. But what is a caveat for? Surely it never was conceived as a something to enable the vendee to protect himself against the assertion of right on the part of the vendor. His agreement binds him and no need of it for that purpose as the appellant assignee is equally bound. It is intended solely as against others, not parties to the contract and bound by it, but who innocently might have purchased and but for its registration have acquired a right.\nYet it has been argued herein that, because the appellant as assignee of the contract of sale registered a caveat to protect himself against subsequent assignees of the same contract, hence he is entitled to enlarge thereby the rights conveyed to him beyond that which the instrument under which he claims gave him.\nI do not think such a consequence was ever conceivable as flowing from the non-registration of a caveat.\nBut then it is said and proven that besides the assignment of the lands, contained in the assignment of the purchase money, there was another instrument simply transferring the land and that the caveat covers that also and that upon the proper or improper production of that transfer for registration it would take the place of that caveat and have the effect given thereto of vesting the lands in appellant.\nOne answer to that is, appellant has not got so far. And as to the caveat itself it only pretends that he has an interest and the affidavit of the agent thereto in order to effect its registration states his principal has a good and valid claim upon said land.\nInvestigation herein has shewn just what that claim is. It never justified a, claim as the purchaser or anything but what the instrument first mentioned above conveyed.\nThe caveat was quite proper as a protection of what the appellant had acquired thereby.\nIn any way one can look at these instruments the caveat cannot enlarge their effect and the argument resting upon section 9'7 of the Act does not help appellant, unless we are to assume that by a fraudulent use of the substitution of the transfer for the caveat, when on the facts the appellant had no right to acquire registration or continue the caveat, he might gain something.\nSpeaking as respectfully as one can of such a proposition it seems an idle play upon words in disregard of the entire purview of the statute.\nI think the principle that Rose v. Watson[4], proceeds upon is still good law, and that the appellant is but a trustee, who is bound to obey the order of the court and convey to the purchasers when required thereby. And that is not inconsistent with but may proceed upon the exposition of the principle as dealt with in Howard v. Miller[5], even though that was the converse of this as to the requirement of specific performance. The counterclaim is, I hold, maintainable.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI do not see anything calling for our judgment on the question reserved by the learned Chief Justice as to the possible right of subrogation as to mortgages and have not examined same. DUFF J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. The most important of Mr. Armour's contentions was that, while the appellant took any interest he acquired by the transfer and assignments under which he claims, subject to the rights of the respondents as purchasers from Steinbreker under the agreement of the 27th June, 1912, yet these last mentioned rights were subject to this\u2014that in paying the purchase money to the Steinbrekers, as each successive payment was made, notice must be imputed to them of any dealing by Steinbreker, with his title properly appearing on the registry; and that notice consequently must be imputed to them at the time the payments in question were made of the transfer and agreements under which the appellant claims by reason of the caveat filed by the appellant.\nAfter full consideration I think the argument must be rejected and that the appeal fails. I think the law is settled that a vendor is acting in violation of a vendee's rights if he attempts to dispose of the property sold to any person other than the purchaser and an injunction will lie to prevent him from carrying any such intention into effect; Hadley v. London Bank[6]; and such a disposition, if completed, gives the purchaser the right to rescind and to sue for damages; Synge v. Synge[7]. The judgments in Ex parte Rabbidge[8], really rest on the provisions of the \"Bankruptcy Acts\" and I think the dictum of Moulton L.J. in In re Taylor[9], at page 573, must not be taken too absolutely.\nIt is clear', however, that the vendor may assign the benefit of his contractual rights under the contract and the assignee may enforce those rights, assuming the provisions of the law with regard to assignments to be fulfilled, and the assignee to be in a position to require the vendor to carry out his obligations under the contract. It is elementary, however, that as against the assignee claiming under an assignment of the vendor's contractual rights, the vendee is entitled to deal with 'the vendor until he has received notice of the assignment. See the observations of Lord Cairns in Shaw v. Foster[10]. It follows that the vendee having no notice of the assignment under the vendor's contractual rights, could not be affected by a caveat, unless there is some statutory provision giving to a caveat the effect of a notice in such circumstances. I can find nothing in the statute pointing to that. Section 84 authorizes the filing of a caveat in the form mentioned\nagainst the registration of any person as transferee or owner of any instrument affecting such an estate or interest unless such instrument be expressed to be subject to a claim of the caveator.\nThere is nothing in this language pointing to the conclusion that a caveat is intended to operate as a warning against the mere payment of money; nor indeed do I think, speaking generally, that the office of the caveat is anything more than to protect rights which otherwise might be prejudicially affected by some conflicting registration.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In my opinion notice to the debtors Kuebler and Brunner that their debt to the Steinbrekers had been assigned to the appellant Grace was necessary in order to complete his title to it so as to render subsequent payment by the purchasers to their original creditors made in ignorance of that assignment ineffectual to discharge their debt. Section 101 of the \"Lands Titles Act,\" invoked by Mr. Armour, is, I incline to think, applicable only to the interest of the vendee or encumbrancee. The proviso certainly so indicates. If applicable at all to a transfer by the original vendor or owner, in my opinion it has to do with the transfer of his right, title and interest in the land only\u2014not in the debt. Moreover, any such transfer is explicitly made\nsubject to the conditions and stipulations in such assignment contained,\ni.e., in this case to the original purchasers' right to have the land \"conveyed to them on payment of the debt\u2014their purchase money. The registration of a caveat by Grace did not amount to the requisite notice to them of the assignment to him of their debt to the Steinbrekers. It would, no doubt, be notice of his interest in the land to persons subsequently dealing with it\u2014but not to persons in the position of Kuebler and Brunner so as to render their payments to the Steinbrekers ineffectual to discharge their debt or to entitle Grace to compel them to make such payments again to him. A search of title by Kuebler and Brunner when they entered into their agreement to purchase would have shewn their vendors, the Steinbrekers, to be then the registered owners of the land. In merely making their payments, they were not persons subsequently dealing with it to whom registration in the interval would be notice; Gilleland v. Wadsworth[11]; Williams v. Sorrell[12]. To their subsequent payments the equitable principle of the mortgage cases applies in which it is held:\nthat as against an assignee without notice (meaning without notice to the mortgagor) the mortgagor has the same rights as he has against the mortgagee, and whatever he can claim by way of set-off, or mutual credit, as against the mortgagee, he can equally claim against the assignee. Turner v. Smith[13]; Norrish v. Marshall[14]. I find nothing in the \"Alberta Land Titles Act\" which excludes this equitable doctrine;\nto have destroyed it clean and explicit language would be necessary,\nNioa v. Bell[15]. The insufficiency of registration as looked the fact that in that case the prior mortgage notice in such cases is illustrated in the case of Pierce v. Canada Permanent Loan Co.[16]. I have hot over-was registered. Here the actual and complete notice which Grace had of the rights of the original purchasers when he advanced his money and took his security puts him in a position less favourable in the eyes of a Court of Equity than he would have held had he had merely the constructive notice which registration gives to persons whom it affects. Underwood v. Lord Courtown[17]. The equitable doctrine is that notice which gives real and actual knowledge affects the conscience of the person who receives it. An attempt by him to give to rights acquired with such notice an effect inconsistent with and destructive of prior rights of which he has had the notice is looked upon by equity as a fraud which it cannot countenance. I should require very explicit language indeed to lead me to the conclusion that the legislature in enacting the \"Land Titles Act\" intended to give to registration under it an effect which would render this wholesome equitable doctrine unenforceable. I am not certain that it is not expressly saved by s. 139 of the statute.\nThe express notice of Kuebler and Brunner's rights and of their position in regard to the Steinbrekers which Grace had when he acquired his interest clearly distinguishes this case from McKillop v. Alexander[18], to which I refer merely to make it clear that it has not been overlooked. Grace in fact acquired his interest in the land subject to Kuebler and Brunner's right to increase or better their pre-existing interest in it by payments on account of purchase money made to their vendors until notified that that right had ceased. The increase or betterment of Kuebler and Brunner's interest in the land by the payment which they made was therefore not adverse to or in derogation of the interest which Grace was entitled to protect by registration, whether of his assignment and transfer or of a caveat. By failing to notify his position to them he permitted their right to pay their vendors to subsist as something anterior to and higher than his right to hold the land as security for payment to him of the sums for which he had contracted in consideration of his advances to the Steinbrekers.\nUntil Kuebler and Brunner had notice of the assignment to Grace, they were entitled to treat the Steinbrekers as their creditors and to make payments to them and payments so made discharged their debt pro tanto. Under the assignment of the agreement and the ancillary transfer of the land the appellant Grace held the latter upon trust to convey it to Kuebler and Brunner upon their purchase money being paid to the persons entitled to receive it. As to Kuebler and Brunner, until notice to them of the assignment, the Steinbrekers were so entitled as against Grace, of whom and of whose rights Kuebler and Brunner knew nothing, whereas Grace had full notice of their obligations and rights under their agreement with the Steinbrekers. If the rights of the parties depended upon a balancing of their equities based upon the character of the duty of each towards the other, I should hold that the duty of the appellant to give notice of his assignment was higher and stronger than any duty of Kuebler and Brunner to search the registry before payment of each instalment of their purchase money in order to make certain that no entry there would disclose that their vendors had parted with their interest in the land and their right to receive the purchase money under their contract. In the absence of notice to the contrary they were entitled to assume, and to act on the assumption, that the right to receive their money had not been transferred. The appellant had actual and complete notice of the position of the respondents and took the risk of their innocently making payments to their vendors. The respondents, iii my opinion, had not even constructive notice of the rights of the appellant. It was undoubtedly the failure of the latter to give notice that afforded the Steinbrekers the opportunity to pose as still entitled to receive payment from Kuebler and Brunner.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the respondents' debt under their agreement was discharged by their payment to the Steinbrekers and that, under the trust on which he took it, the appellant is bound to convey the land to them.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 11 Alta.

An agreement was made in 1905 between the city appellant and one D. the assignor of the company respondent, whereby D. was given the privilege of supplying natural gas \"throughout the said city.\" In another agreement, made in 1911, amending the above, it was provided that the respondent should be permitted to charge certain prices for gas supplied \"to the inhabitants of the city.\"\nHeld, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, that the privilege granted to D. was not limited to the area of the city appellant as it existed at the date of the agreement, but extended to the various extensions of the city's boundaries which were subsequently made.\nCity of Toronto v. Toronto Railway Company (1907), A.C. 315; 37 Can. S.C.R. 430, distinguished.\nThe agreement contained a provision that \"the city shall not grant to any person, firm or corporation\" a privilege similar to that granted to D. and referred also to the \"exclusive rights and privileges hereby granted.\"\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that the grant to D. was not exclusive as against the city appellant itself.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing in part the judgment of Ives J. at the trial[2]. The respondent is the assignee of a certain agreement dated August 14, 1905, between the appellant and one Dingman, entered into by authority of a city by-law duly submitted to a vote of the ratepayers, and passed by the council. At that date, the area comprised within the municipal boundaries of the city appellant was approximately 1.800 acres. These boundaries were extended from time to time by Acts of the Legislature, and, at the date of the institution of the present action, the city area had been increased to approximately 25,000 acres. One clause of the agreement contained the following words:\nthat the exclusive right and privileges hereby granted to the said company shall continue subject to the terms and conditions herein expressed * * * and the, said city shall not * * * grant to any person, firm or corporation the right to construct or lay mains or pipes or connections on, in or through the streets of the said city for the supply of natural gas * * *.\nThe contention of the company respondent was that the franchise, rights and privileges conferred under the agreement extended to the new territory added since the date of the agreement, and that the said franchise, rights and principles were exclusive as against the city.\nThe trial judge found against the company respondent on both grounds, and maintained the action of the city appellant. But on appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, the appeal was allowed in part, the court reversing the judgment of the trial court on the first ground, and maintaining it on the second ground. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLafieur K.C. and C. J. Ford for the appellant.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. and Sinclair for the respondent, The Canadian Western Natural Gas Company. Anglin K.C. for the respondent, The British Empire Trust Company.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014As to the first question on which a declaration is sought, viz.: whether or not the respondents' franchise, rights and privileges are limited to and do not extend beyond the area of the city as shown on the plans filed in the Land Titles Office on the 14th August, 1905, the learned judge, who tried the action, gave judgment for the appellant, because he thought the question precluded by the authority of the decision of the Privy Council in City of Toronto v. Toronto Railway Co.[3]. That decision was upon the particular contract which the court was asked to construe, and I do not think it attempted to lay down any principle which could govern in the present case.\nThe agreement under consideration in that case, provided for a right to the city to require the company to lay street railway tracks on streets to be designated by the city. It was a question not of a right granted to the company, but an obligation imposed upon it. That this feature of the nature of the subject matter of the contract in dispute was what mainly motived the judgment of the Privy Council is clear. Beyond saying that their Lordships agreed with the reasons for judgment of the majority of the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada it was only added that\nthe injustice involved in the contrary view, which would enable the corporation to compel the railway company to extend their lines at an indefinite expense, and for indefinite distances where the maximum fare chargeable for any distance is five cents seems to their Lordships insuperable.\nI have gone through, and very carefully considered all the cases between the corporation and the company which are referred to in the judgment of Chief Justice Harvey, but I am unable to appreciate the difficulty he finds in reconciling them. In my opinion nothing is gained by any attempted comparison between them.\nI do not underrate the weight of Mr. Justice Stuart's argument when he says:\nEven without precedent or authority I should have come to the conclusion that Dingman did not by virtue of his original contract enter into any obligation to supply gas outside of the original limits of the city and that therefore as a necessary corollary they acquired no right to do so by virtue of the mere original contract itself.\nI cannot, however, agree that this is a necessary corollary. It may be a question in view of the provision of clause 18 how far the obligation extends but nothing is to be gained by a consideration of that here.\nI think the grant in this case is of a right within the limits of the city as now determined.\nAs regards the second question, whether or not the franchise, rights and privileges granted to the defendant are exclusive as against the plaintiff, I was at first disposed to agree with the view taken by the majority of the judges in the Appellate Division, that they were not exclusive. But whilst I fully appreciate the force of the contention that the city has in terms only debarred itself from granting similar rights to any other person, firm or corporation than the defendant, I think we must again look to the whole of the contract for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of the rights thereby granted. It seems to me that, considering the circumstances in which the contract was entered into, and the whole tenor of the clauses referring to the exclusive rights, intended to be granted to the company, it is impossible to suppose that either party contemplated the reservation to the city of a right of entering into competition with the company whilst undertaking to grant to it an exclusive privilege as against all others. The competition by the city might well be more powerful and injurious to the rights of the company than that of any private commercial body. On this point, therefore, I agree with the conclusion of Mr. Justice Beck in the Appellate Division.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal should be allowed to the extent that it asks that the judgment appealed from should be varied in so far as it affirms the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Ives, that the provisions of the statute of the Province of Alberta, being chapter 64 of 1911-12, and the by-laws and agreements therein referred to, do not exclude the plaintiff from itself exercising within the area included in the city of Calgary on the said 14th day of August, 1905, rights, powers and privileges similar to those by the provisions of the said statute, by-laws and agreements vested in the said defendants, by reversing the said judgment, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Ives to the extent aforesaid.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014The defendant respondent company is the assignee of an agreement made between the City of Calgary and one Dingman, under the authority of a by-law duly passed and approved by the ratepayers, dated 14th day of August, 1905. This action was brought by the city to obtain declarations: First, that the rights and privileges granted by the city under this Dingman agreement did not extend to the several extensions of the city boundaries which were made after the agreement was entered into, but was confined to the area of the city within the municipal boundaries at the date the agreement was entered into, and, secondly, that such rights and privileges were not exclusive as against the city itself but only as against grantees of the city.\nThe trial judge decided both points in favour of the city.\nFrom his judgment an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Alberta, which reversed the decision of the trial judge on the first question, and held that the franchise (so called), granted to Dingman by the agreement of 1905, was not limited to the area of the city of Calgary as it existed at the date of the agreement, but extended to and covered the various extensions of the city's boundaries which were subsequently made. The Appeal Court confirmed the trial judge's finding as to the exclusive character of the franchise, and as to this there is a cross-appeal.\nTwo of the learned judges of the Appellate Division, Stuart and Scott JJ., based their judgment that the Dingman franchise must be held to extend to the extensions of the city's area solely upon the construction placed by them upon an agreement made in January, 1911, between the city and the Calgary Natural Gas Co., Dingman's assignee, permitting the gas company to charge a higher price for the gas they supplied than that fixed by the Dingman agreement.\nThese learned judges were of the opinion that certain words and phrases of that agreement refer to the city in a \"territorial sense\" and must be held to be so used with reference to the then existing conditions, at a time when the various extensions of the city's area had been made. Mr. Justice Stuart says:\nUpon this narrow ground, as I have said with some hesitation on account of the extreme narrowness of it, I think the first question should be answered in favour of the defendant.\nI mention this because I am quite in accord with the general reasoning of Mr. Justice Stuart as to the construction of the Dingman agreement when entered into in 1905, and the effect of the subsequent conduct and action of the officials of the city upon that agreement.\nI am of opinion that the Dingman agreement of 1905, when entered into by the parties, had reference solely to the territorial area of the city as it then existed and that it was not then contemplated by either party to it that it should extend to and cover any extensions of that territorial area which might subsequently be made. I do not think the language of the agreement was ambiguous. The City of Calgary at the time that agreement was made had clearly defined territorial limits which must be held to have been known to all parties to the agreement.\nI am also of the opinion that the subsequent action and conduct of the city officials cannot be held to have enlarged or extended the scope of such an agreement granting a franchise over the streets of the city, or bind the corporation on any ground of estoppel or acquiescence to such enlargement or extension.\nI was a party to the judgment of this court in the appeal of The Toronto Railway Co. v. The City of Toronto[4], in which appeal we decided that the right to determine, decide upon and direct the establishment of new lines of tracks and tramway service in the manner therein prescribed applied only within the territorial limit of the city as constituted at the date of the contract.\nIn that case there had been an agreement of sale and purchase between the Toronto City Corporation and the Toronto Railway Company, confirmed by an Act of the Ontario legislature, under which the railway company acquired not merely the material of the railway undertaking in suit, but also, as was clearly provided, the exclusive right \"to operate surface street railways in the city of Toronto\" in the fullest possible way within the period of the agreement. On appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that learned Board held that on its true construction territorial additions to the city made during the term of the agreement were not within its scope.\nIn delivering the judgment of their Lordships, Lord Collins says[5]:\nThe reasons given in the judgments of Sedgewick and Idington JJ., with whom Davies J. concurred, seem to their Lordships so full and satisfactory as to make it unnecessary to say more than that they adopt and agree with them. The injustice involved in the contrary view which would enable the corporation to compel the railway company to extend their lines at an indefinite expense, and for indefinite distances, where the maximum fare chargeable for any distance is 5 cents, seems to their Lordships insuperable. Their Lordships are of opinion, therefore, that on this point the corporation fails.\nI confess myself quite unable to discover any difference in principle between that case and the present appeal.\nIt does seem to me that if parties seek for and obtain from a city corporation an exclusive franchise, right and privilege for many years over the streets of the city, and the granting of which franchise depends upon a majority vote of the municipal voters being first obtained, such franchise will not be construed as extending to territorial additions to the city made during the term of the franchise, even assuming the power of the city to make any such agreement with such possible extensions unless there are either express words shewing an intention that the franchise granted shall be so extended or other language used from which such an intention must fairly and reasonably be drawn. Their Lordships in the quotation I have above made from their reasons for judgment in the Toronto Corporation v. Toronto Railway[6], approving of the judgment of this court for the reasons given by it, point out that the holding of a contrary view to the one they gave effect to in that case involved an injustice to the railway company.\nAnd so in the case before us, the construction of the Dingman franchise agreement contended for by the respondents might have resulted in grievous injustice to Dingman and his assignee. We must put ourselves in the place of the parties at the time the agreement was entered into, and construe the agreement in the light of the facts and circumstances then known or ascertained by both parties. If the agreement is construed to cover extensions of the city then the benefits to and obligations of both parties must be reciprocally so extended.\nIt must be remembered that when the Dingman agreement was entered into the discovery of natural gas in enormous quantities such as was subsequently discovered had not been made.\nThe whole franchise to be granted is predicated in the 4th paragraph of the agreement upon the finding by Dingman within a fixed period \"of a sufficient and paying supply of natural gas which can be utilized in the said city.\"\nThe \"said city\" there referred to is no doubt the Calgary of that day covering an area of 1800 acres with a population of about 12,500, as compared with its subsequent extension and enlargement to approximately 25,000 acres with a population of some 80,000 or 90,000.\nWhat if Dingman, within the term fixed, had found a sufficient supply of gas for the city, as it was in area and population when he entered into his agreement, and had gone on under his franchise rights incurring] large expenditures to carry out his contract? Could he with each rapid extension of the area and population of the city have been forced to supply gas to these extended areas, or, the quantity discovered not being sufficient, forfeit his charter or pay damages?\nIt seems hardly conceivable that in the light of the knowledge then possessed, he so intended to bind himself or the city to bind itself with respect to further possible extensions of the area and population of the city. The obligations of the parties under the Dingman contract must be construed as mutual and reciprocal, and cannot be extended as far as one is concerned and confined as regards the other party.\nThe words in question, \"the City of Calgary,\" were not ambiguous at the time the Dingman agreement was entered into. On the contrary, they at that time had a clear, definite, well understood meaning and only one. Subsequently changes in the territorial area by the addition of new territory may have created conditions which, if they were to control in the construction of the agreement, might make the words ambiguous. But, in my judgment, these words must be construed and interpreted as they would have been the day after the agreement was entered into had any dispute as to their meaning then arisen. Wallis v. Pratt[7] North Eastern Railway Co. v. Hastings[8].\nIf I am right in my construction of the agreement when made, then the question arises whether any subsequent action of the city or its officials operated to create such extension.\nThe agreement of January, 1911, on the language of which two of the judges of the Appellate Division held that the franchise agreement had been extended to the enlarged territorial area of the city, had for its sole object and purpose as recited in its preamble the change in the limitation on the price to be charged for gas supplied from not exceeding 25 cents per 1,000 feet for domestic purposes to 35 cents and from not exceeding 15 cents for power purposes to 20 cents. It was made in response to an application on behalf of Dingman for the increased price on the ground of increased costs incurred and to be incurred by him in his search for gas at further points from the city than any contemplated when he entered into the agreement and agreed to the maximum prices he could charge for the gas.\nI am quite unable to understand how such an agreement as this, having one only object, namely, a change in the price chargeable for the gas supplied provided for in the original agreement of 1905, could be construed as operating to effect such an important and radical change as the extension of the latter agreement to areas and populations it did not originally extend to or contemplate. I not only think it, as called by the learned judge who depended upon it, a \"narrow ground,\" but, with great respect, an unsafe and untenable one. No reference whatever is made to the area covered by the agreement, or to any extension of that area.\nI have read with great care the several by-laws passed by the city after the agreement of 14th August, 1905, was entered into, and which are relied upon together with other official or quasi official acts and conduct as operating to create an extension of the territorial area covered by the original scope of that agreement, but find myself unable to reach a conclusion that, taken together, they had that effect.\nAn agreement such as that of August, 1905, granting such a franchise as that agreement did on its streets, requiring as it did to make it binding on the city the safeguards provided of a by-law of the City Council authorizing it and an approving vote by the ratepayers cannot, it seems to me, be altered and extended in such material ways as it is contended this agreement has been, except by equally solemn steps.\nThe ratepayers of the city approved of the by-law ratifying the original agreement, but there never, was any by-law enacted enlarging or extending the territorial area covered or any vote submitted to the ratepayers for that object.\nAfter the agreement of 1905 was completed, there were many by-laws passed having reference to that agreement and altering and extending its minor terms. By-law 646 extended the time within which active drilling operations might commence to 21st May, 1906. By-law 863 extended the time within which the company might demonstrate the character of gas fields contiguous to Calgary until 14th August, 1910, and continued the exclusive term of the agreement for 15 years from August, 1905. By-law 1097 authorized further extended development works for six years from 14th August, 1910, but confirmed and continued the agreement in other respects. By-law 1114, which I have already commented upon, permitted an increased price for gas to be charged. By-law 1212 gave the city's assent to certain assignments of the Dingman franchise and agreement.\nNone of these by-laws, in my opinion, affect the question of the territorial area over which the agreement extended, or attempted to enlarge or extend that area, and the question whether the original agreement extended to new territory added from time to time must depend upon the construction given to its language.\nI have already expressed my opinion on that point to the effect that the agreement does not so extend, and I am of the opinion that the by-laws passed, the letters written by the mayor and the controllers, and the action taken by the engineer and other officers of the city, cannot alone or collectively operate to create that extension.\nI agree with the contention of counsel that all the evidence as to acts and statements of officials of the city could not enlarge the franchise granted, and that it was quite incompetent for city officials or employees by negligence, laches, or personal acts and conduct to change the construction which the franchise agreement originally bore or to extend that franchise over a larger territorial area than it originally covered; by any negligent administration of the affairs of the city. I am unable to find any evidence that any plans as required by sec. 5 of the agreement were ever furnished to or approved of by the City Council with respect to these enlarged areas or that any action was ever taken by the Council with respect to the extension of the operations under the franchise agreement into the new or added territory.\nNo plans seem to have been officially fyled with the clerk of the council, but certain plans (two) were left, it was stated by counsel, with the city commissioners and engineer. None, however, were approved by the council shewing that the company contemplated operating beyond or outside of the original city limits.\nSo far as the commissioners were concerned, their powers and duties seem to have been solely of an executive and administrative character, as defined by sec. 182 of the city charter. Nothing in the prescribed powers and duties of these commissioners would enable them to extend the limited character of the franchise granted Dingman. As to these powers and duties see sec. 16, c. 36, statutes of Alberta, 1908.\nNothing less than an act done by the corporation itself acting within its powers, under the authority of its municipal council, could extend the franchise of 1905 to the added territory. There is, of course, no pretence that such an act was done or attempted.\nOn the other branch of the case, I am of the opinion that the exclusive character of the franchise granted to Dingman is exclusive of any similar grant which otherwise might be made by the city to some other company or person, and not exclusive as against the city itself.\nIf exclusive as against the city it must be under the words in sec. 9\nthe city shall not grant to any person, firm or corporation the right to construct or lay mains, etc.\nThe words granting the franchise to Dingman do not contain the word \"exclusive,\" but the term is used in a subsequent part of the agreement as the\nexclusive rights and privileges hereby granted.\nThe terms of the grant itself are,\ndoth hereby grant to the said company full power, licence and authority, etc.\nI think the meaning of the term \"exclusive\" as used in the agreement may well be determined to be those rights which might be acquired by a grant from the city, and which the city agreed it would not during the period mentioned in sec. 9 \"grant to any person, firm or corporation;\" I do not think they included the city itself if it then had or subsequently obtained the power of operating natural gas works.\nThe rule of construction of exclusive grants is that they should be construed most strongly against the grantee, and I do not find appropriate words used in the agreement which would exclude the city itself. A proper and reasonable construction of the word \"exclusive\" in the sense used here is the one I adopt and which I think must be held to express the intention of the parties. The grant itself in the 4th section of the agreement gives to the grantee \"full power, licence and authority * * * to open up and lay mains.\" Nothing in that section is said about the grant being an exclusive one.\nIn paragraph 9, the grant is spoken of as the \"exclusive rights and privileges hereby granted to the company,\" &c, and the same paragraph goes on to provide that the city shall not \"grant to any person, firm or corporation the right to construct,\" &c.\nThat seems to me, in the absence of any express words excluding the city itself to limit and define the extent of the exclusive grant\u2014that it is exclusive as against any grantee of the city.\nI would for these reasons allow the appeal, and dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of the opinion that the franchise granted by the agreement of 6th September, 1905, between appellant and Dingman, was limited to the area that the then boundaries of the city included, and that the same has not, as regards its territorial limits, been extended by anything which has since transpired.\nIf a manufacturer possessed of a large factory or a merchant of a large shop or warehouse had contracted with some one to supply for a fixed term of years the lighting or heating necessary for the efficient carrying on of his business in such premises, and then added thereto as the necessities of a growing business demanded, what would be thought of either party to such contract insisting that inasmuch as it was self-evident the business would grow, and it must require more light and heat, therefore that was within the contemplation of the parties, and the contract was binding in relation to the added buildings and business or work therein?\nYet, stripped of all verbiage and confusing collateral matters, needed only to be had regard to as part of the history which brought the parties concerned herein into contractual relations with each other, when we bear in mind the express definition of the word \"street\" in the first paragraph of the said agreement, wherein does the supposed assertion of right to apply the contract in the cases I submit to the extension differ from that set up by the respondents herein?\nTo carry the illustration out fairly, it may be said we must assume that in either of the given cases, the lighting or heating, without a word of agreement, had in fact been supplied and accepted for a year or two and then rejected.\nWould any one contend that then either party was bound to continue it for the remainder of the fixed term of years? I cannot think so. I can see how the original contract might by inference be applied to determine the measure of remuneration or other liability in relation to that extended, but how such contract could be held as a matter to be considered in the construction of the original contract is past my com- prehension. I can conceive also in such a given case something transpiring between the parties to constitute a new contract.\nBut here there is the limited power of the appellant, which is only able to contract in such ways as the statute enables it, as an impassable barrier, and hence the respondents are driven to argue that what was done must be looked to as aiding in the construction of an ambiguous contract.\nWherein is the contract which relates to certain streets as defined in the contract at the date thereof ambiguous?\nIt seems to me the unambiguous thing in the case. And the conduct relied upon is something taking place years after the contract had been made.\nAgain that conduct is not that of the appellant, but of some of its servants, who could not be held as entitled to furnish anything a court should rely upon as the conduct of the appellant.\nThen it is said there was an amendment of the contract by which the rate of remuneration was changed and increased six years later, and thereby a new contract made which must be held as an interpretation of the original contract. As it speaks of \"the inhabitants of the city\" which had been increased in fact, both in area and population, it is said it must be taken to have amended the contract. Unfortunately for the argument the express terms of the new agreement ratified by the legislature limit it to the substitution of prices named for those in the contract \"as though the said prices were mentioned therein instead of the said prices mentioned in paragraph 17 thereof.\"\nThe term \"street\" is defined in the original contract of 1905 as follows: That wherever the word \"street\" occurs in this agreement it shall be held to mean any street, avenue or lane shewn as such on the plans of the said city registered in the Land Titles Office for the South Alberta Land Registration District.\nI am unable to see how the parties could have more carefully restricted the terms of the amendment, unless they had, from abundant caution, needlessly used words limiting the inhabitants to those concerned under the contract.\nI cannot find in this either a new contract or an interpretation of the old one.\nAgain it is said the original contract might not be so in an ordinary case but that this is a contract with a growing city, and it must be presumed to have contemplated such growth, and hence intended to contract despite the express words of the contract limited to streets as defined.\nAny one conversant with how cities in Canada have grown by the annexation of suburban villages or towns which usually have some lighting system of their own, dependent often upon contracts for long terms of years, would be tempted to say that the men making such a contract as here in question extend to future annexation were unfit for such positions of trust, not only as in excess of their powers but as raising a needless barrier in the way of annexing suburban villages and towns.\nThe obviously prudent course for such men in all such cases would be not to create such a conflict of interests, but to keep their city free to deal with the suburban village or town as little untrammelled as possible either by lighting or waterworks contracts or other public utilities.\nI should not but for the force with which this argument was pressed have thought it worth considering. Moreover, it is to be observed that the only exercise of any right or authority within the bounds of any city or town conferred upon the company are conditional upon a consent expressed by by-law on such terms and conditions as the by-law may provide for the exercise of such power within some prescribed area. Such I take it is the meaning of the ordinance respecting water, gas, electric and telephone companies enacted in 1901, before anything in question herein. There has never been any clear assent of the character required enabling the company or those under whom it claims to operate anywhere within the city of Calgary, except in that specifically described.\nAs to the argument founded upon by-laws having been voted upon in the course of years after the city boundaries were extended, and final ratification by the validating Act of the Legislature, I fail to see how any of these transactions can change a line or letter of the contract, except so far as specified. And the streets as originally specified remained unchanged. As to by-laws having been voted upon where the law was duly observed and resort was had to the proper and usual form of authorization, how can all that affect the contract? Whether the subject matter directly concerned all those voting or not, or such voting was validated by the legislature matters little.\nIt frequently happens that a whole city is called upon to sanction what only in truth concerns a small part of it. And it is quite usual to get legislative sanction to overcome the doubts and fears of those having financial dealings based on such actions.\nThe fact that the contract in question was tested so often, and in so many ways as these votings and enactments shew, and that no one ever suggested amending it, demonstrates to my mind that the parties concerned felt they dared not venture to propose so radical a change of what was plain and clear lest their whole scheme should fall to pieces if public attention were drawn to it. Sometimes the promoter sees it wiser to trust to future development, including perhaps a lawsuit, than risk losing everything. Be that as it may, I see nothing in it all to justify our reading into all these transactions what is not there. The legislature is the proper place to go to if there has been an error.\nThere is, I respectfully submit, a confusion of thought in importing into the case such arguments as founded upon the primary powers and duties of a municipal corporation relative to public order, and cases decided thereon with the modern additions thereto of power to carry on certain classes of business commonly referred to as public utilities. In exercising the latter functions the municipal corporation and its contracts must be treated as any other business corporation.\nI still think Toronto v. Toronto Street Railway Co.[9], was decided correctly on the question which has been referred to so much in argument herein, though I purposely abstained from reading our opinions thereon till I had formed my conclusion in this case.\nI think Mr. Justice Ives was right, and that his judgment in this regard should be restored.\nThe respondent has cross-appealed on the question of its exclusive right barring the city itself from using its new power.\nIf I am right in the conclusion I have reached, this is not of much consequence.\nBut as the question is submitted, I may say that in my opinion, the terms of the contract do not seem to anticipate or provide against the city doing its own work, but only, if at all, against its granting to others the like powers conferred on respondent's assignor, and hence the cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014On at least two occasions the municipal corporation of Calgary formally and deliberately dealt with the franchise granted by it to A. W. Dingman in 1905 as covering territory subsequently annexed to the city. After the annexations of 1906, 1907 and 1908, it modified the terms of the franchise by an agreement authorized by a by-law submitted by the council to the vote of all the ratepayers of the city, including those in the annexed territory. After the further annexation of 1910 it again, in January 1911, modified the original agreement in most important particulars by a further agreement, authorized by a by-law likewise submitted to the vote of all the ratepayers of the city as then constituted, including those resident in the annexed area. Legislation confirmatory of these agreements and by-laws was obtained on the joint application of the city and the respondent gas company. I am satisfied that whatever may have been the proper construction of the Dingman franchise at the date of its execution, as to the area of its operation, the subsequent acts to which I have alluded have made it impossible for the appellant successfully to maintain that that area is now restricted to the limits of the city as it existed in 1905. Mr. Justice Stuart has pointed to language of the agreement of 1911, which makes it clear that the parties to it were then dealing with the franchise as covering the entire area of the city at that time. I would, if necessary, be prepared to support that learned judge's conclusion that\nthis constitutes an agreement\u2014an implied one, no doubt, but none the less potent\u2014that in the original contract with which they were dealing and which they were amending those words (\"the city\"\u2014\"the city of Calgary\") should thereafter be given a new and wider meaning.\nBy another act, the significance of which cannot be met by the suggestion that it was that of a mere official acting without authority, the city again recognized that annexed territory was within the franchise. By a resolution passed in January, 1914, which recited the franchise conferred on Dingman by agreement of August, 1905, and subsequently assigned to the Canadian Western Natural Gas, Light, Heat and Power Company, the City Council, exercising a right Conferred by s. 155 of Ordinance 33 of the North-West Territories, requested the Hon. Mr. Justice Stuart to investigate certain interruptions in the services of the respondent gas company in territory annexed to the city after 1905.\nThroughout the entire period from 1906 to 1914, when the present contest arose, everybody interested appears to have regarded and acted upon the Dingman franchise as applicable to the subsequently annexed territory equally with that comprised within the city limits in 1905. Every official of the city who was called upon from time to time to act under the contract \u2014the mayor, the commissioners, the engineer\u2014so dealt with it on innumerable occasions.\nI think there is a presumption that these acts were duly authorized, and that in the absence of proof to the contrary they should be taken as amounting to an acquiescence by the city in the construction placed on the Dingman franchise by the respondent gas company. The responsible officials of the city knew that under permits issued by them large sums of money were being expended by the company in the construction of works in annexed territory, on the assumption that they were covered by the Dingman franchise. Indeed this must have been known to every citizen. The carrying out of these works was facilitated in every way possible by the civic authorities. It would be so inequitable to permit the municipality now to set up that the operation of the franchise is confined to the area of the city as it existed in 1905 that, in my opinion, it cannot be allowed to do so. Some observations of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Winnipeg Electric Railway v. City of Winnipeg[10], seem to be very closely in point. In the present case there is the added circumstance that rights of innocent third parties have intervened which would be seriously jeopardized were the contention of the city to prevail.\nWithout expressing any view as to what construction should have been placed upon the agreement of 1905, but for the subsequent matters to which I have referred, or as to the applicability to it of the decision in the Toronto Railway Case[11], I am, for the reasons I have indicated, of the opinion that the judgment a quo on this branch of the case should be affirmed.\nOn the question raised by the cross-appeal, I have failed to find in the agreement of 1905 anything which binds the city not to exercise in competition with the defendants any powers to supply its in- habitants with natural gas which it then had or might afterwards acquire. On this branch of the case, I agree with the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice of Alberta and Mr. Justice Stuart.\nThe case of Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville[12], cited by the learned trial judge, is very closely in point. Better authority than a decision of the United States Supreme Court on such a question it would be difficult to find.\nI would dismiss, with costs, both the appeal and the cross-appeal.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 10 Alta.

Held, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that, to enforce the mechanics' or the material man's lien, under the \"Alberta Mechanics' Lien Act,\" a \"notice in writing of such lien and of the amount thereof\" must be given to \"the owner or person having superintendence of the work on behalf of the owner,\" according to section 32 of the Act, as amended in 1908.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting.\u2014Such notice in writing is not intended to affect the validity of the lien, but merely to determine the extent of the owner's liability.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Harvey C.J. at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's action.\nThe respondent's action was brought against the appellant to enforce a lien under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" of Alberta, recorded against property owned by the appellant on which a building known as the \"Children's Shelter\" had been constructed. The respondent had supplied for this building the steam boiler and radiators necessary for a heating system and a pumping equipment. The principal issue submitted by the appellant is that respondent's claim was barred by failure to give written notice as required by section 32 (as amended in 1908), of the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" of Alberta. The respondent contends that section 32 is merely a provision made to protect an innocent owner from having to pay money a second time; that the lien given by sec. 4 of the Act has its commencement as soon as the material is furnished, and that, when fyled, such lien is an encumbrance upon the land.\nThe trial judge held against the respondent, and dismissed the action; but, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Alberta unanimously reversed this decision.\nF. E. Meredith K.C. and C. F. Adams for the appellant.\nR. S. Robertson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014Under the terms of the \"Mechanics' Lien Act,\" as I read it, the material men and labourers acquire, from the moment that the material is furnished or the labour performed (section 4), an interest in the contract price limited to the sum actually owing to the person entitled to the lien (section 8), which interest cannot be for any greater sum than the owner has agreed to pay by his contract (section 19). The lien to secure that interest becomes effective upon registration under section 2 (g) and (k) and section 41 of the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nBut the appellants contend: 1st, that the claim of lien was filed too late: and 2nd, that the claim was barred by reason of the failure to give written notice. Section 32, as amended.\nDealing with the first point. I find that section 13 of the Act, fixing the time within which the material man's lien must be filed, provides that the lien shall cease to exist on the expiration of 35 days after the claimant has ceased from any cause to place or furnish the material. In other words, the date from which the delay runs is not that from which the purchase price becomes due and exigible but from the date at which the material man has ceased to place or furnish the material, and that, of course, depends on the facts of each case.\nThere can be no dispute about the facts here. When the city authorities gave the order to supply the heating system for the Children's Shelter in July, 1914, they had then in contemplation the installation of a pumping system to supply the water without which the heating system could not be operated. A well was then dug, and the subject of a pumping system was discussed with the company before they supplied the radiator for the heating. As a matter of fact, the pump was actually ordered about the 14th of November (1914), at which date the radiator and boiler were being installed. The one system was necessarily complementary of the other: the heating system could not be operated without the pumping system. As one witness observes, it is difficult to use radiators and boilers without water.\nAlthough the material required was ordered at different times, the parties had in contemplation from the outset the purchase and supply of a complete set of pumps, boilers and radiators to heat the building by hot water. This explains why a price for the pump was obtained from the respondent at the outset. It is difficult to read the evidence without coming to the conclusion that, as found below, there was what Chancellor Boyd calls in Morris v. Tharle[2]: one entire prevenient governing contract of which the respective deliveries are merely the execution.\nOnce that conclusion was reached by the Appellate Division, then, I think, there can be no doubt that, as found, the claim was filed within the delay (en temps utile). The pump was delivered in December, 1914 but when tested it was found to be defective; and in February the shaft and wheel were returned to the manufacturer. In a letter written in February, 1915, by the contractor, he says:\nIt (the pump) was running about five minutes, when the pinion became jammed and when they stopped the machine it was all chewed up the way it was mailed to you.\nIt was not until March, 1915, that a complete pump was furnished and the lien was filed on April 1st, 1915, well within the statutory delay. Idington J. in the case of Day v. The Crown Grain Co.[3], says:\nThe test question here is whether or not the appellant could in law have sued on the 20th April and recovered from Cleveland as for a complete contract. I am of opinion he could not. Trifling as the parts unfinished were, the party paying, in such a case, was entitled to insist on the utmost fulfilment of the contract and to have these parts so supplied that the machine would do its work.\nNow, dealing with the second objection to the effect that the claim is barred by reason of failure on the part of the material man to give notice in writing. By supplying the material, an interest or lien on the money in the hands of the owner is acquired by the furnisher, and by registration that lien becomes, under the \"Land Titles Act,\" an incumbrance on the owner's title to the land so that under the provisions of the two statutes the furnisher of material acquires, by registration in the Land Titles: Office, an incumbrance on the owner's land for the price of his material. Anglin J. said in Travis v. Brakenbridge (unreported) :\nRegistration may be deemed notice to the owner.\nIn this case the material man not only registered his claim but also gave actual notice to the owners through Sylvester, their representative on the work, that he looked directly to the fund for the payment of his claim. There is nothing in the statute that requires him to do more than to register his lien to acquire this incumbrance; and, as Mr. Robertson argued here, there is nothing in the statute which states that the interest in the fund so secured by an incumbrance on the land ceases to exist or that the incumbrance on the land is discharged, if a notice in writing is not given under section 32. That section, as it formerly stood, read as follows:\nNo lien * * * shall attach so as to make the owner liable for a greater sum than the sum owing and payable by the owner to the contractor\nAs amended it now reads:\nNo lien * * * shall attach so as to make the owner liable for a greater sum than the sum owing; by the owner to the contractor at the time of the receipt by the owner or person having the superintendence of the work on behalf of the owner of notice in writing of such lien and of the amount thereof or which may become owing by the owner to the contractor at any time subsequent thereto while such lien is in effect.\nThe section was amended in 1908 I strongly suspect because of the judgment of the Alberta appeal court in Travis v. Brackenbridge, which condemned the owner to pay twice over.\nThose amendments, especially in view of the conditions in the various sub-sections were intended not to effect the lien but to determine the amount for which the owner would be liable. His liability is limited to the amount due at the moment the notice was served; taken literally, that is all the language means. The Act does not say when the notice should be served to be effective. It does not in terms make the validity of the lien depend upon the service of a notice in writing upon the owner, nor does it say that failure to give notice discharges the encumbrance on the land. The Act says merely (sec. 32):\nNo lien * * * shall attach so as to make the owner liable for a greater sum than the sum owing by the owner to the contractor.\nThe notice is not intended to affect the validity of the lien, but merely to determine the extent of the owner's liability, and for his interest only.\nWhatever may have been the purpose of the legislature in enacting the amendments to clause 32 as it originally stood, it seems to me obvious that the notice in writing was not intended to protect the contractor or his assignee. The construction contended for by the bank would, in the circumstances of this case, give to a general contractor a preference over the material man who had a lien under the statute for the price of his material, and of which lien the owner had particular notice, as is evidenced from the terms in which the receipt taken from the bank is drawn.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment maintaining a claim of respondent to enforce a lien for material, under the \"Alberta Mechanics' Lien Act.\"\nThe only serious difficulty I find in the case turns upon the question of whether or not a transaction between appellant and the Bank of British North America (which, as assignee of the contractors with the city, admittedly stands in the same position as the contractor), represented by an instrument which reads as follows,\nEXHIBIT 13.\nThe Bank of British North America hereby acknowledges to have received from the City of Calgary $1,457.98, the balance due as certified by the city engineer on the contract between Grant Brothers, Limited, and the city for plumbing, heating and water supply in connection with the Children's Shelter; and the bank hereby undertakes and agrees with the City of Calgary that if any claim shall be made and established against the city under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" under said contract not exceeding the said sum of $1,457.98, the same shall be paid by the said bank, and if any action is brought against the city to establish any such lien the bank will either pay the amount claimed, or, at its own costs and charges, contest said claim and indemnify the city against the same and any costs occasioned thereby not exceeding the amount hereinbefore mentioned\u2014the city on receipt of said claim, or on being served with any proceedings in Court, to notify the bank thereof.\nDated the fifth day of May, A.D. 1915,\nis clear evidence of payment absolving appellant from all liability under the Act.\nThere is no evidence, unless it be the admitted fact that the said sum of money was paid to the bank, of how or why the appellant should be held to have so paid, in face of the clearest evidence that both the appellant and the bank knew, at the time of said payment that the respondent had duly registered the lien, under the Act, now sought to be enforced.\nThere were two fairly arguable points of law which may have been present to the minds of those concerned relative to the right of the respondent to maintain the lien so registered as to any part, or at all events as to the larger item, of the claim.\nIt has been stoutly contended throughout, first, that the lien was registered too late to be effective, and secondly, in any event, that the first item of the account had been delivered and for a short time in use, two months or so before registration of the lien. I agree for the reasons assigned in the judgment of Mr. Justice Beck in the court below, that the account was, under the circumstances in question, of that continuous nature and in relation to the same work as to render the lien under section 4 of the Act valid if registered within thirty-five days from the completion of the entire work and that by reason of the inefficiency of the machine which constituted the second item thereby needing a substitution of one of its parts, that the time for registration only began to run from a date clearly within thirty-five days preceding registration.\nWere these the only questions which confronted the appellant and the bank and were present to the minds of those concerned in framing the above mentioned instrument? If so, then there is an end of the appeal.\nBut in the absence of any evidence, we are left to conjecture or to draw such inferences as we may relative to the intention and meaning of the transaction.\nHowever that may be, it is now claimed that under section 32 which reads thus:\nSec. 32:\u2014No lien, except for not more than six weeks' wages in favour of labourers, shall attach so as to make the owner liable for a greater sum than the sum owing by the owner or the contractor at the time of the receipt by the owner or person having superintendence of the work on behalf of the owner, of notice in writing of such lien and of the amount thereof; or which may become owing by the owner to the contractor at any time subsequent thereto while such lien is in effect,\ninasmuch as there was no written notice to the appellant, the lien never attached.\nThat has been answered by holding the statement of claim was a written notice and so it would be literally within the language of the Act.\nThat is answered again by saying that no lien attaches so as to make the owner liable for a greater sum than the sum owing by the owner or the contractor at the time of the receipt by the owner or person having superintendence of the work * * * of notice in writing of the lien, etc.\nWhat does this mean? Clearly the contractor owed, and still owes, the entire sum. And just as clearly under the statute, a lien did attach unless we are to hold that in the case of a contractor paid in advance by the owner, no lien is intended by the statute to attach under section 4 by virtue of the respondent's furnishing the material.\nIt is not the registration that makes it attach. That is only a requirement for its continuation beyond thirty-five days after completion.\nIt may be said this is hypercritical, and that the intention of the statute must be looked to in order to make it workable. I incline to agree therewith, but I submit that those relying upon such a doubtfully worded instrument as that now in question ought, in the same spirit, to have made plain what they intended.\nIt can, in every word of it, be made operative by referring the questions of what it, negatively as it were, provided should nullify the operation of the lien, to the obvious questions I have referred to, as all the document had in contemplation under the circumstances.\nTo insist upon more renders it necessary to impute to the appellant, having full knowledge of the fact that the lien existed, the most unworthy motive of resorting to a trick for the purpose of unjustly depriving respondent of its money.\nFor my part, I will not put that construction (which will wear the appearance of an intent akin to fraud) upon the document, and short of that, in my view, the appeal fails. It comes to this that despite all the growing tendency of public corporations, like the appellant, to promote honesty and fair dealing with those serving the city, as we had illustrated in the contract we had before us in the recent case of Union Bank of Canada v. Ritchie Contracting & Supply Co., which specifically provided (and we upheld its doing so) that such claims must be paid, there is room to argue that material men may be beaten out of their rights under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" if the contractor can induce such corporation to aid them.\nLeaving aside the broad question of whether or not it is possible to so contract that the lien may be prevented by an agreement providing for advance payments to the contractor, suppose we found such an attempt to take the form of this document being incorporated into and made part of the agreement for any public work, how should a court look at it?\nSuppose a bank at the back of a contractor in such a case at the very outset willing to indemnify upon receiving the money, would such a transaction fall within the meaning of section 32 and be held payment?\nThis question I put to counsel and am yet without an answer.\nI cannot assent to such a repeal of the Act.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Walsh that such a transaction of suspensive holding of money, as evidenced by this receipt, is not a payment within the meaning of the Act.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed with costs. ANGLIN J.\u2014Reversing the judgment of Harvey C J., who had dismissed the action, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held the plaintiffs, the Dominion Radiator Co., entitled to a mechanics' lien in respect of the price of a hot water heating system ($1,019.27) and a water pumping system ($438.71) furnished by them as sub-contractors for Grant Bros. Limited to the defendants, the City of Calgary, for a children's shelter. From that judgment the city appeals on three distinct grounds:\u2014\n(a). That the lien in respect of the whole claim had expired before it was registered;\n(b). That the contract for the heating system was entirely distinct and separate from that for the water system and that the lien in respect of the former, at all events, had expired;\n(c). That when the city first received a \"notice in writing\" of the plaintiffs' lien no sum was owing by it to the contractors.\nIn view of my opinion on the third ground of appeal, I have found it unnecessary to pass upon the other two grounds.\nSec. 32, s.s. 1, of the \"Alberta Mechanics' Lien Act\" is as follows:\u2014\nSec. 32.\u2014No lien, except for not more than six weeks' wages in favour of labourers, shall attach so as to make the owner liable for a greater sum than the sum owing by the owner to the contractor (at the time of the receipt by the owner or person having superintendence of the work on behalf of the owner, of notice in writing of such Hen and of the amount thereof; or which may become owing by the owner to the contractor at any time subsequent thereto while such Hen is in effect).\nThe words in brackets were added by an amendment of 1908.\nThe lien is created by section 4 of the Act, and is thereby declared to be\nlimited in amount as hereinafter mentioned. By section 8, it is\nlimited in amount to the sum actually owing to the person entitled to the lien.\nBy section 19 it is provided that\nthe owner complying with the provisions of the Act shall not be liable for any greater sum than he had agreed to pay by contract.\nBy section 32, above quoted, a further limitation is imposed, with the result that the lien attaches only to the extent of any moneys owing to the contractor by the owner when the latter receives notice in writing of the lien, or which may subsequently become owing to the contractor.\nAdmittedly the first notice in writing of the appellant's lien received by the city was the statement of claim in this action delivered on the fourth of November, 1915. At that time the city had in hand no moneys owing to the contractor, Grant Bros. Limited. It had paid the last of such moneys in its hands ($1,457.98), to the Bank of British North America on the 19th of May, 1915, upon a claim made by the bank under an assignment from Grant Bros., of which it had received formal notice on the 25th Feb., 1915. The appellants' lien was registered on the first of April, 1915, and there is evidence of verbal notice of their claim having been given to the city's building superintendent shortly before its registration and again shortly afterwards. On making the payment to the bank the city took from it the following receipt:\nThe Bank of British North America hereby acknowledges to have received from the City of Calgary $1,457.98, the balance due as certified by the city engineer on the contract between Grant Bros. Limited and the city for plumbing, heating and water supply in connection with the Children's Shelter; and the bank hereby undertakes and agrees with the City of Calgary that if any claim shall be made and established against the city under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" under said contract not exceeding the sum of $1,457.98, the same shall be paid by the said bank, and if any action is brought against the city to establish any such lien the bank will either pay the amount claimed, or, at its own costs and charges, contest said claim and indemnify the city against the same and any costs occasioned thereby not exceeding the amount hereinbefore mentioned\u2014the city, on receipt of said claim, or on being served with any proceedings in court, to notify the bank thereof.\nDated the fifth day of May, A.D. 1915.\nUpon the foregoing facts, the respondent urges that the payment by the city to the bank after registration and verbal notice of the lien was a fraudulent attempt to defeat it, and should therefore be held void as against the lien holder, and that the terms of the receipt taken by the city confirm this view and also shew that the payment to the bank was not intended to be a genuine and absolute payment, and should therefore be disregarded in considering whether there was any sum owing by the city to the contractors when it received notice in writing of the lien\u2014that it was in fact merely a conditional payment of money to be returned to the extent to which the city might be held liable to meet the plaintiffs' lien.\nThere is no evidence of any collusion or of fraudulent intent on the part of either the city or the bank. No indirect or improper motive has been suggested for the city or its officials preferring the bank's claim under its assignment to that of the plaintiffs. For aught that appears the civic authorities may have acted in the bond fide belief that the plaintiffs' lien had expired before its registration, and that the city was bound to make payment under the assignment of which it had received notice on the 25th of February. Fraud is not to be presumed in this case more than in any other.\nThe effect of section 32 as it now stands, is, in my opinion, to make the giving of notice in writing to the owner a condition of the mechanic's or the mat- erial man's lien attaching so as to make the owner liable, just as other sections of the Act make registration and the institution of an action within defined periods conditions of its preservation. There can be no more justification for holding verbal notice to be a sufficient ground for dispensing with the fulfilment of one condition than for treating it as a valid excuse for non-compliance with the others. To hold that the extent of the owner's liability is fixed either by actual verbal notice or by registration would be contrary to the explicit terms of section 32 and would involve either reading out of that section the words \"in writing\" or inserting a declaration that registration shall be deemed \"notice in writing.\" Such an alteration of the statute the legislature alone is competent to make.\nThere is nothing inherently unfair or extraordinary in a provision imposing the giving of notice in writing to the owner as a condition of the existence of such a special privilege as the right to a lien conferred on vendors of labour and material for work upon lands. It may be that in endeavouring to protect the owner from the difficulties of a situation that might arise from the absence of some such provision (illustrated in the cases of Breckenridge & Lund v. Short[4] and Travis v. The Breckenridge-Lund Company [5] the legislature went farther in 1908 than was necessary or desirable. But, if so, the responsibility is with it and the remedy in its hands.\nMuch was made in argument for the respondent of the provision of the \"Land Titles Act\" which declares a mechanics' lien when registered to be an encumbrance on the lands. But the existence of the lien itself and its extent depend upon the provisions of the \"Mechanic's Lien Act.\" The two statutes must be read together, and registration under the \"Land Titles Act\" cannot be taken to create an encumbrance where there is no valid lien under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" or to neutralize or modify the limitation upon its extent which the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" explicitly imposes.\nAs to the receipt taken by the city it does not establish that the payment to the bank was conditional. It merely shews that, having some knowledge of a claim of lien which they may have deemed quite unfounded, the civic officials, ex majori cautela, sought and obtained from the bank an indemnity against the possibility of that claim turning out to be enforceable. Failure to have done so in reliance upon their own belief, however firm, that no lien in fact existed, or that the assignment to the bank, operating from the date when the city had notice of it, gave its claim priority over that of the plaintiffs, of which it received verbal notice only subsequently, might have been deemed culpable remissness by those to whom the officials were accountable. However mistaken that belief may have been, after the city had paid over to the bank all the moneys in its hands owing to the contractor, there was, in my opinion, no \"sum owing by the owner to the contractor\" within the meaning of section 32.\nWith great respect for the learned judges who take the contrary view, I am of the opinion that the judgment a quo involves a repeal of the amendment of 1908 to section 32 which the legislature alone can effect. On this branch of the case I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, whose judgment, I think, should be restored. The appellant should have its costs here and in the Appellate Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 11 Alta. L.R. 532 sub nom. Dominion Radiator Co. v.

Ouimet v. Bazin, 46 Can. S.C.R. 502, followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of Belleau J. in the Superior Court for the district of Beauce[2].\nThe respondent is a restaurant-keeper, doing business in the municipality appellant, and took an action to set aside a by-law passed by the appellant, by which were prohibited the opening of the restaurants on Sunday, and the sale therein of any merchandise. The principal grounds invoked by the respondent were that such by-law was regulating the Sunday observance, which was a matter of federal jurisdiction only, and ultra vires of the powers of municipalities. The trial judge dismissed the action, and held that the by-law was only in relation with public peace, good order and good morals, and was within the police power of the corporation appellant. But this judgment was reversed and the by-law quashed by the majority of the Court of King's Bench, which found that they had to follow the ruling in Ouimet v. Bazin[3]\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nLouis Morin K.C. for the appellant cited Ouimet v Bazin3, Tremblay v Cite de Qu\u00e9bec[4] and City of Montreal v. Beauvais[5].\nBelcourt K.C. for the respondent, cited also the above cases and Association St. Jean Baptiste de Montreal v. Brault[6].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should, on the merits, be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin; on the question of jurisdiction, I am bound by the judgment of the majority in Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Company v. Shawinigan Water and Power Company[7] The motion should be dismissed without costs, having been heard on the merits.\nDavies J.\u2014In this case a motion has been made to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, but as there was some question raised as to the constitutionality of the provincial law, under which the by-law in question was said to have been passed, the motion was allowed to stand over, and the argument on the merits took place.\nI have no doubt that the appeal should be dismissed. The by-law in question is a prohibitive one, and deals with the observance of Sunday or the Lord's Day That is a subject matter which it has been determined is within the legislative powers of the Dominion Parliament. That Parliament has already dealt with the subject matter and the Privy Council has decided in favour of the validity of the Act.\nIn the case of Ouimet v. Bazin[8], at page 504, I stated my view as to the construction of this Federal Act, namely, that while it enacted prohibitive legislation for the whole of Canada, it also delegated to the several Provincial Legislatures the power to declare that any act or thing prohibited by the Dominion Act might be exempted from the operation of the Act, and permitted to be done by Provincial legislation either existing at the time the Federal Act came into force or subsequently enacted.\nThe question raised in this case was not as to the validity of any such permissive legislation, for none such was invoked, but as to the validity of a by-law forbidding the opening of restaurants and the sale therein of any merchandise on Sundays.\nSuch a by-law is a direct dealing with Sunday observance, and therefore ultra vires. Provincial legislation attempting to authorize it would itself be ultra vires.\nI concur, therefore, in dismissing the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal involves only the question of the validity of a by-law of the appellant.\nThe judgment from which appeal is taken rests upon the view that there is a constitutional question raised within the meaning of section 46, sub-section (a) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nUnless there is such a question involved in the appeal, we have no right to hear it for we have no jurisdiction to review the work of the Court of King's Bench relative to the validity of municipal by-laws, unless incidentally something else is in controversy between the litigant parties to an appeal.\nSo far as the constitutional question, if any, involved in this appeal is concerned, the decision in the case of Ouimet v. Bazin[9], as I understand it, is conclusive against the appeal.\nIn that case I thought, and still think, it was possible to reduce all that was involved therein to the single question of the power to prohibit a theatre from carrying on its business on a Sunday, for which offence the appellant had been condemned.\nThis court held it was not possible to maintain the distinction between a single item of the numerous prohibitions in the Act there in question giving rise to the issue involved in that case, and the general scope of the Act upon which the prosecution therein was founded.\nBe that as it may, I cannot read the several opinions which led to the decision without feeling that it was founded in truth upon the common notion of a peculiar sanctity found in the religious obligations to observe the day as one devoted to religious observances, which leads to viewing its desecration with such abhorrence as to constitute that something criminal in its nature and hence legislation relative thereto as criminal legislation.\nIf we analyze the history of legislation, designed to secure the observance of what is commonly called the Lord's Day and the judicial decisions thereupon; which ostensibly founded the opinions I refer to as leading to the decision in Ouimet v. Bazin9, it is hard to escape the conclusion that it is impossible, in face of the general conception I have tried to express, to frame the most moderate attempt at legislation relative to what men may be prohibited from doing on that day without being met by the objection that it is of the class falling within what has been thus judicially declared criminal legislation.\nIf we could imagine the Legislature of Quebec taking up each item at a time of what was prohibited in the Act in question in said case, and thus by half a dozen or more Acts covering the same ground as that Act, could such Acts, or any of them, now be upheld in face of such a decision? I think not. In my own judgment in that case I tried an analogous experiment. My attempt was fruitless. I must now observe the law as laid down therein.\nIt seems idle now to say that in the case of The City of Montreal v. Beauvais[10], we upheld similar legislation relative to prohibiting certain work or business on weekdays within specified hours. No one questions that power when duly exercised as to weekdays.\nThere is no reason for denying it in relation to Sunday, except the distinction judicially made between that and other days.\nHence, so far as the judgment appealed from rests upon Ouimet v. Bazin[11] it seems well founded, and leaves no escape from dismissing the appeal.\nIf, as suggested in course of the argument, the by-law is not within the scope of the Municipal Act, no harm has been done.\nBut upon that I express no opinion. We have no jurisdiction to deal with it from that point of view.\nIn any way I can look at the appeal it should be dismissed with costs. The motion to quash failed, because effect could not properly be given to it without hearing the appeal, and hence should be dismissed, but I think without costs under the very peculiar circumstances which seemed to invite it lest the court might complain of its not having been made.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellant, a municipal corporation, seeks the reversal of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench of the Province of Quebec, which quashed one of its by-laws, whereby the opening of restaurants and the sale therein of any merchandise on Sundays is forbidden, on the ground that this by-law deals with Sunday observance, and is, therefore, beyond the jurisdiction of a municipal council.\nIf the purpose and purview of the by-law are what they have been held to be (as I think correctly) by the Court of King's Bench, its invalidity as an invasion of the domain of criminal law, assigned exclusively to the Dominion Parliament, is not open to question in this court. Ouimet v. Bazin[12]. No provision of the Quebec statutes warranting the enactment of any such by-law has been referred to, and it is in conflict with the spirit, if not with the letter, of s. 4466 of the R.S.Q. 1909.\nOn the other hand, if this be not the true character and object of the by-law\u2014if it be merely a local police regulation passed for the maintenance of peace, order and good government in the Parish of St. Prosper\u2014 nobody would dream of questioning the validity of the provisions of the Quebec Municipal Code empowering the municipality to enact it. The proper construction of the impugned by-law does not \"involve the question of the validity of an Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the Legislature,\" \"Supreme Court Act,\" s. 46 (a). On no other ground can the appeal be brought within any of the several clauses, (a), (b) or (c) of s. 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" and, as held in the Bell Telephone Co. v. City of Qu\u00e9bec[13], accepted as binding by the majority of this Court in the recent case of Shawinigan Hydro Elec. Co. v. Shawinigan Water & Power Co.[14], the judgment in an action brought to set aside a municipal by-law is not appealable to this Court under the special provision of s. 39 (e), which is excepted by s. 47 from the operation of s. 46. In other words, the right of appeal in such an action must depend upon the general jurisdiction of the court conferred by s. 36, which is subject, in appeals from the Province of Quebec, to the limitation imposed by s. 46. It therefore does not exist where the case does not fall within one or other of the negatively permissive clauses of the latter section.\nEither the impeached by-law is an enactment dealing with Sunday observance and, as such, has rightly been held ultra vires\u2014and there is no suggestion that any provincial legislation purports to sanction it if that be its character\u2014or it is merely a local police regulation, and, as such, its enactment would be warranted by provincial legislation of unquestioned validity. In neither aspect of the case is it within s. 46 (a) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and we are, in my opinion, without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nI understand, however, that the majority of the court is of the opinion that the appeal; should be dismissed on the merits. If the court has jurisdiction; I would concur in that result.\nAlthough the respondent moved to quash, he did so only after the costs of printing had been incurred, and a few days before the appeal was due for hearing upon the merits. Moreover, he failed to make it apparent, upon the presentation of his motion, that the appeal did not involve a question of the validity of an Act of the Provincial Legislature, and, without disposing of the motion, the court accordingly directed that the appeal should be heard on the merits.

Appellant;\nand\nCalgary Brewing & Malting Company (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1917: October 15-16; 1917: November 28.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\nBank and banking\u2014Bill of exchange\u2014Cheque\u2014Payment\u2014Presentment\u2014 Delay.\nThe appellant sent to the respondent a cheque drawn on the Estevan Security Company, and the Bank of Montreal, acting as agent for the respondent, sent the cheque direct to the drawee by post. Instead of insisting upon prompt payment of the cheque out of the funds which the appellant then had available with the Security Company, the Bank of Montreal gave to the latter almost one month's delay, and then accepted a draft of that company on another bank which was dishonoured; and immediately after the Security Company went into insolvency.\nHeld, that the appellant was discharged of his liability to the respondent for the amount of the cheque.\nDavies J. though not dissenting formally was of the opinion that the case should be sent back for a new trial, so that the cause of the delay might be explained and the responsibility thus determined.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of Haul-tain C.J. at the trial[2], in favour of the plaintiff respondent.\nA bill of exchange, drawn by the appellant on the Estevan Security Company, (where he had funds sufficient to meet it), payable on demand at Bienfait, Manitoba, was deposited by the respondent with the Bank of Montreal, at Calgary, on the 14th of November, 1914. The Bank of Montreal sent the appellant's bill by post directly to the Estevan Security Company, presumably on the day the bill was received. Until the 10th of December, 1914, nothing is known about the bill as far as the record shews, and, on that date, the Estevan Security Company sent to the Bank of Montreal a draft upon the Union Bank at Winnipeg for the amount of the bill, which draft the Union Bank refused to honour. The Estevan Security Company suspended payment on the 16th of December, 1914; and the respondent took action against the appellant for the amount of the bill.\nJ. A. Ritchie for the appellant.\nP. M. Anderson for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The Bank of Montreal, acting as agent for the respondent to collect the amount of appellant's cheque or draft on the Estevan Security Company, sent that cheque direct to the drawee by post, and, instead of insisting upon prompt payment out of the funds which the appellant then had available with that company for the payment of his cheque, chose to give the company almost one month's delay, and at the end accepted a worthless draft of the company which immediately after went into insolvency. On these facts, I do not entertain any doubt that the appellant was discharged of his liability to the respondent for the amount of the cheque or draft, and that the appeal ought to be allowed. I am inclined also to doubt that there was a good presentment, and in any event notice of non-payment was not given in a reasonable time.\nSuppose the Estevan Company had had sufficient funds with the Union Bank on which the draft was made, but the Bank of Montreal, in place of taking cash, had again accepted the draft of the Union Bank on some other bank. The process might have gone on indefinitely. Could it be suggested that the liability of the appellant would always have continued, and that he could have been held responsible for the failure of the Union Bank or any subsequent bank whose draft the Bank of Montreal might have taken? It would be just as true as in the present case that the respondents had never received cash.\nIt is no use for the manager of the Bank of Montreal to say that it did not appoint the Estevan Security Company their agent, because the bank does not appoint private bankers its agents if that is what it in fact did. Suppose, as counsel for the appellant suggested, it had sent the cheque to the express company for collection, and it had taken the worthless draft instead of cash, what answer could the Bank of Montreal have had in face of this action of its agent? Why should it be allowed to repudiate the agency, because it sent it direct to the company on whom it was drawn? Further, the Bank of Montreal did not repudiate the discharge by the draft, did not send back the draft, but accepted and presented it in due course.\nI observe that Mr. Justice Brown says that he does not think the case of Donogh v. Gillespie[3], is applicable to the case at bar. If it could be held to be so, I should not be able to accept it as a binding authority. If an agent presents a cheque and accepts a banker's draft in place of cash, I cannot think the principal can claim that in so doing he was not acting within the scope of his agency. In a sense, every blunder or improper action on the part of an agent is unauthorized by his principal. Such a limitation on the liability of the principal for the acts of his agent would, however, render impossible any dealing with an agent; parties so dealing cannot always know the precise instructions he has received with reference to carrying out the transaction in which he is authorized to act.\nAs a matter of fact, I should suppose the transaction was carried out in accordance with common banking practice and the intention of the Bank of Montreal.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014In this appeal, I would very much have preferred to refer the case back for a new trial, so that the cause of the long delay on the part of the Estevan Security Company in remitting to the Bank of Montreal its draft on the Union Bank of Winnipeg which was dishonoured, in payment of the cheque or bill of exchange of the appellant Rogers in favour of the respondent which the bank had forwarded to the Estevan Company for payment, might be explained and the responsibility for that delay determined.\nAs, however, this view is not shared by my colleagues, I cannot see that any useful purpose will be served by my dissenting formally from the judgment allowing the appeal proposed to be delivered.\nSo far as my personal assent to that judgment is concerned, I simply desire to say that it is given with very grave doubt, arising out of the absence of any evidence on the material fact of delay above referred to\nThe only plea placed upon the record by the appellant was one of payment, and that did not call for any explanation of this delay, and that was, I assume, the reason why no evidence on the point was given. Idington-J.\u2014The appellant owed respondent and gave it a cheque on the Estevan Security Company, a private bank in Bienfait in Saskatchewan, for $700, dated 11th November, 1914, for which due credit was given in an account rendered on the 30th of the said month, by respondent to appellant. Respondent then, on the 14th of the same month, indorsed it over to the Bank of Montreal (at Calgary) where respondent carried on business, as I infer from the date of credit given in said account, and the stamp marking of that bank on face of the document.\nThe learned trial judge says this was done for collection, but I cannot so find from the evidence. That is barren of a good many details relative to the dealings with this cheque regarding which we might have been informed.\nIn law, however, I cannot say that there is any substantial difference in the result so far as appellant is directly concerned, whether it was left for collection or discounted, and placed to the credit of respondent.\nIn either event it was the act of the respondent that entrusted it to the Bank of Montreal, which must be held the agent of respondent, unless treated as holder of the cheque.\nThe bank sent it direct to the Estevan Security Company. But when it did so does not appear.\nIt does appear that the said banking company sent as its payment of it, a cheque dated 10th December, 1915, in favour of the Bank of Montreal on the Union Bank at Winnipeg, which seems to have been accepted by said Bank of Montreal without objection, and in turn sent by it to Winnipeg for presentation.\nThe Union Bank refused payment of that cheque, and the Bank of Montreal had it protested on the 14th of the said December. On the 16th December, 1914, the respondent telegraphed appellant as follows:\u2014\nDecember 16th, 1914.\nTo A. C. Rogers, Bienfait.\nBank advise draft seven hundred Estevan Security on Union Bank unpaid. See Security Company at once.\nC. B. & M. Co., Ltd.\nThe Estevan Security Company had closed business that day by reason of its insolvency.\nThe appellant had money in that private bank sufficient to meet the cheque which was handed over to him with his bank book, marked by a stamp of that company, as paid on the 10th December.\nI am of the opinion that upon the foregoing facts, the judgment of the learned trial judge and of the majority in appeal upholding it, cannot be sustained and should be reversed.\nI have chosen to call the document now in question a cheque, though on a private bank, and thus not a cheque within the meaning of our \"Banking Act\"\u2014 but under that properly called a \"bill of exchange.\"\nThere was a time when that distinction could not properly have been made, and when it would have been called as I have called it, a \"cheque.\"\nI have done so designedly for the reason that there are some considerations which I need not dwell upon, which shew that the position of the respondent holder would be worse if in relation to a bill of exchange than a cheque.\nThe curious may find in the case of Robinson v. Hawksford[4], many cases and authorities referred to where the law is discussed at a time when the distinction between a cheque on a private banker and a chartered bank did not seem to exist. And though it was urged then that the original consideration could have been sued upon, Patterson J. remarked that he thought not when the holder had vitiated the cheque by unreasonable delay.\nBe that as it may, I am clearly of the opinion that the respondent cannot recover herein; if for no other reason than the credit given coupled with the most unreasonable delay which clearly led to the loss of apparently the entire sum through the bank accepting another cheque or bill in its stead, upon the principle laid down in the cases of Smith v. Ferrand[5], Strong v. Hart[6], Lichfield Union v. Greene[7], and by the late Mr. Justice Street (no mean authority) upheld in appeal, in Boyd v. Nasmith[8], and that the appeal should be allowed throughout, and the action be dismissed with costs..\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am, with respect for the learned judges who have taken the contrary view, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nThe material facts are as follows:\nAn inland bill of exchange drawn by the appellant on the Estevan Security Company payable on demand at Bienfait, Manitoba, was deposited by the payee (respondent) with its bankers at Calgary on the 14th November, 1914, for the present I assume for presentment and collection. These bankers had no agency at Bienfait. Instead of employing the Bank of Hamilton, which had a branch office there, to execute their mandate, the bankers sent the appellant's bill by post directly to the Estevan Security Company, presumably on the day they received it. From that time until the 10th of December, nothing further is known of the bill so far as is disclosed by the record. On the 10th of December the Estevan Security Company (with which from the 11th of November the appellant had funds on deposit sufficient to meet his bill) sent to the respondent's bankers a draft on the Union Bank at Winnipeg for the amount of the bill and on the same day stamped the latter. \"Paid.\" On presentment at Winnipeg, the Union Bank refused to honour the Security Company's draft. The latter company suspended payment on the 16th of December, and on the following day, the appellant received a telegram, sent on the 16th, informing him that his cheque (bill) had not been paid. Owing to the hopeless insolvency of the Estevan Security Company, any claim the respondent might have to rank in its liquidation in respect of his deposit with it is of little, if any, value.\nAssuming that the respondent's bankers adopted a usual and proper course in sending the bill drawn by the appellant by the post to the drawees (\"Bills of Exchange Act,\" R.S.C. c. 119, s. 78 (d); s. 90 (2)), they thereby constituted the latter their agents to present to themselves. If so, they must be accountable for the conduct of those agents in regard to the presentment for payment and a like accountability rests on the respondent. If there was a presentment, either it was grossly dilatory if not made until the 10th of December or, if it was made in due course after the receipt of the bill by the Security Company, there was what must, in the absence of any explanation, be deemed an inexcusable delay in giving notice that payment had been withheld. Unless the bankers received the money by return of post, the absence of an answer should have been considered as a dishonour and notice thereof should have been given promptly. At all events, at least some inquiry should at once have been made, and that should have been followed up by steps to enable the appellant to protect his interest. So far as is disclosed by the evidence, nothing whatever was done. I am, therefore, of the opinion that, assuming there was a presentment of the bill, because there was undue and unaccounted for delay either in that presentment or in giving notice of dishonour by the agents of the holder, for which it cannot escape responsibility, the drawer is discharged. If authority for this view be needed, the case of Bailey v. Bodenham[9], supplies it.\nIt is a fair inference from the facts in evidence, that if the bill had been presented across the counter, as it might have been, it would have been paid. That the drawer was damnified to the extent of the face value of the bill by the failure of the bankers to discharge their duty, is therefore apparent. It follows that it is immaterial whether the instrument should be regarded as a cheque or as an inland bill of exchange. For reasons concisely stated by Winter D.C.J. in Revelstoke Saw Mill Co. v. Fawcett[10], I think it is not a cheque but a bill payable on demand, with the result, accurately stated by that learned judge, that, without proof of actual damage (which, however, exists in this case), the drawer was discharged not merely in respect of the bill, but also from his liability on the original transaction for which it was given.\nAlthough the only plea of the defendant is payment, the defence of negligence in regard to presentment and notice of dishonour was fully investigated at the trial, and the issue upon one or both of these defaults was clearly before the court. Moreover, the defence based on the bankers' default is tantamount to a plea alleging that the plaintiff is thereby estopped from denying payment. No injustice to the plaintiff on grounds of surprise or otherwise can result from allowing the defendant to take advantage of any legal defence disclosed by the facts in evidence. Under these circumstances it would savour of extreme technicality to deprive him of the benefit of any such defence because not explicitly raised in his plea.\nIf, as is by no means improbable, the respondent's bankers, when they received the appellant's bill, placed the amount of it to the customer's credit, they would, under the circumstances in evidence, find great difficulty in maintaining a right to debit its account with the amount of the bill when eventually returned to them as unpaid. If they had not that-right, the plea of payment might well be regarded as actually established. Moreover, there is not a little to be said for the view that the defendant, if then still liable, was discharged when the bankers took the Security Company's draft on the Union Bank instead of insisting on payment of his bill in cash. No doubt when that draft was issued the amount of the defendant's bill was charged against his account with the Estevan Security Company, and, as Mr. Justice Brown points out, he would thereafter have been to that extent unable to obtain payment from it of his deposit. It may be that after so charging up the bill to appellant's account, the Security Company should be regarded as having held the amount thereof, as agents for the respondent's bankers and therefore for the respondent. I prefer to rest my judgment, however, upon the effect of the negligence of the respondent through its agents in regard either to presentment or to notice of dishonour.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc and judgment should be entered dismissing the action with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Willoughby, Craig & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Anderson, Bagshaw, McNiven & Fraser.\n[1] 34 D.L.R. 252, 2 W.W.R. 344.\n[2] 9 Sask.

The respondent executed some extensive repairs to the building, according to advice from experts, in order to prevent similar troubles and appellant took possession of the premises. In the spring following, a second flood occurred, causing considerable damage, for which appellant took action against respondent, on the grounds that the respondent's contrivances for keeping away the water were defective and that the respondent was under obligation to protect him from river flooding.\nThe judgment appealed from (Q.R. 25 K.B. 512), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant's action, was affirmed.\nPer Davies J.\u2014It is not necessary, to bring an event within the scope and meaning of the words vis major or the Act of God, that such an event should never have happened before; it is sufficient that its happening could not have been reasonably expected.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Upon the evidence, appellant's action did not fall within art. 1614 C.C., as he is presumed to have been willing to take the premises in the condition in which they were after the repairs had been made with the risk of further trouble from inundation of which he was or should have been aware; or if the flood was so extraordinary that it could not have been anticipated, the defence of vis major should prevail.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nArthur Brossard K.C. and Ed. Fabre-Surveyer K.C. for the appellant.\nP. B. Mignault K.C. and L. P. Cr\u00e9peau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am to dismiss the appeal with costs. The cross-appeal was abandoned.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI do not think that art. 1614 of the Civil Code covers the case of damages arising solely from vis major and the case before us is such a one.\nMr. Surveyer's contention was that the landlord's liability to the tenant under art. 1614 extends to \"all defects and faults in the thing leased\" that skill and science could provide against.\nBut that contention should only be accepted subject to the limitation that it does not extend to damages arising solely from vis major or the act of God.\nAs a matter of fact there was no defect or fault in the premises leased within the meaning of those words of the art 1614.\nThe damages were caused by a combination of a very heavy rainfall and an abnormal overflow of the River St. Lawrence. It is not necessary to bring such an event within the scope and meaning of the words vis major or the act of God, that such an event should never have happened before; it is sufficient that its happening could not have been reasonably expected. That is the true test under the English authorities and on principle. Nitro Phosphate Chemical Co. v. London & St. Katharine Docks Co.[2].\nThe only additional precaution which it is suggested the landlord should have taken against such an unexpected flood as that which occurred in 1913, I agree with Mr. Justice Cross, even if practicable would certainly have been inefficient as against such a flood.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed for the reasons assigned in the judgment appealed from and in the notes of the Honourable Justices Cross and Carroll in support thereof.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Since the defendant (respondent) has acquiesced in the judgment allowing a diminution in the plaintiff's rental, the only question now before us is as to the right of the latter to recover damages for injuries sustained from the flooding of the leased premises in the spring of 1913. The evidence, in my opinion, establishes that with full knowledge and appreciation of the danger of flooding, to which the situation of the property unavoidably exposed it, and of the means which the defendant had taken to prevent, as far as possible, the consequences of inundation due to the waters of the St. Lawrence overflowing its banks, the plaintiff accepted the premises as having been put in the best possible condition and as meeting all requirements on which he was entitled to insist as a tenant. He had himself obtained the report of an engineer as to what could and should be done to protect the basement of the building, as far as possible, from being flooded, yet he neither asked for nor suggested any precautionary measures greater or other than those which the defendant had taken. She had employed an architect, an engineer and a contractor, all of the highest reputation, and had faithfully carried out their recommendations\nI agree with Mr. Justice Cross that the only additional precaution suggested at the trial was probably impracticable and that, however serviceable it might have been had the rise of the river been less, it would not have availed to save the premises from being flooded in the inundation of 1913. The plaintiff's claim so far as it is based on defects in the construction of the building or in the contrivances adopted for keeping out and taking care of the water, is unfounded. Under the circumstances stated I also agree with Mr. Justice Carroll that the case does not fall within art. 1614 C.C., the lessee being presumed to have been willing to take the premises in the condition in which they were after the repairs of 1912 had been made, with the risk of further trouble from inundation, of which he was or should have been aware. The authorities cited fully warrant this conclusion. Dalloz, Receuil periodique 1900, 1, 507; Dalloz 1849, 5, 272; Guillouard, Louage, pp. 137 & seq; Agne, Code et Manuel des Propri\u00e9taires, (2\u00e9d.) 295; Planiol, 2, p. 559, No. 1688; Pothier, Louage No. 113; 25 Laurent, No.117.\nIf on the other hand the flood of 1913 was so extraordinary that it would not be reasonable to hold that the plaintiff, notwithstanding his undoubted knowledge of local conditions, should have anticipated it and should therefore be deemed to have assumed its attendant risks, it would seem impossible to escape the alternative conclusion that the defence of vis major should prevail.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brossard & Pepin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Elliott, David & Malhiot.\n[1] Q.R. 25 K.B. 512.\n[2] 9 Ch.

The accused, appellant, was discharged before the trial court; and the respondent prayed for a reserve case before the Court of King's Bench, appeal side which was granted. The Court of Appeal reversed the Magistrate's decision and sent the prisoner back for sentence.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions of law are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nN. K. Laflamme K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. C. Walsh K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. The appellant was charged before the magistrate with having, he then being Mayor of the Council of the Town of Sault au R\u00e9collet, demanded from Beaulieu and Chagnon, two contractors with the municipality, the sum of $2,500, as a consideration for his aid in procuring them new contracts from the municipality and renewing others in process of execution.\nWe are asked to say whether, these facts being admitted, they disclose a criminal offence.\nI have no doubt that, as found by the majority below, the charge as laid comes directly within the language of section 69 (d) of the Code. In effect, that section provides that every one is party to and guilty of an offence who counsels or procures any person to commit the offence. I am of opinion that the word \"and\" in the first line is to be read disjunctively. If the offence is committed then the accused is a party to it; or, if the offence is not committed, then he who counsels is guilty of a substantive offence. It was suggested, but I hope not seriously, that in demanding payment the accused cannot be said to have counselled payment. I construe \"counsel\" used in collocation with \"procure\" to mean \"advise\" or \"recommend\" and the demand made in the admitted circumstances means at least that.\nIn Rex v. Higgins[2], Lord Kenyon said:\u2014\nIt is argued that a mere intent to commit evil is not indictable; without an act done; but is there not an act done when it is charged that the defendant solicited another to commit a felony? The solicitation is an act.\nHere the accused is charged with having actually asked and demanded the money, which is by section 69 made an offence in itself; and of that act the accused admits he was guilty. To incite to commit a felony, when no felony is committed, is generally a common law misdemeanour. The Queen v. Gregory[3]. See also Reg. v. Ransford[4].\nFurther it is an indictable misdemeanour at common law for any person in an official position corruptly to use the power of his position by asking for a bribe, which is exactly this case, and there can be no doubt in so far as this court is concerned that the criminal common law of England is still in force in Canada, except in so far as repealed either expressly or by mplication. The Union Colliery Company v. The Queen[5], at p. 87.\nComplaint is made that on this construction the accused is not informed specifically of the law under which he is being proceeded against; but while the Code provides that with respect to certain offences the accused is entitled to particulars, ss. 957, 852 and 854 Criminal Code, I am not aware of any provision which requires the prosecuting officer to give notice to the accused that he is being proceeded against for the breach of some particular section of the Code or for a common law offence.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I think section 69 of the Criminal Code clearly makes a person who counsels or procures another to commit an offence, guilty of a specific offence, whether the person so counselled actually commits the offence he is counselled to commit or not It is the counselling or procuring which constitutes the offence irrespective of the effect of such counselling or procuring and so in the case before us the defendant, being at the time Mayor of the town, in soliciting money for his assistance in endeavouring to procure municipal contracts for certain parties, Beaulieu and Chagnon, brought himself within the provisions of this section.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of the opinion that under section 69 of the Criminal Code, every one is party to and guilty of an offence who actually commits it or counsels another to commit the offence, and that when the appellant offered himself as a man to be bribed, he was suggesting and, in the ordinary meaning of the word, counselling those to whom he offered to prostitute his office for a price, and was guilty of the offence to be done.\nI therefore think the Court of Appeal was right in answering the second question in the way they did, and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nAnglin J.\u2014The purport and intent of clause (d) of s. 69 of the Criminal Code in my opinion is to make it an offence to counsel any person to commit an offence whether the actual commission of the latter offence does or does not ensue. I entertain no doubt that the defendant in soliciting money from Beaulieu and Chagnon as a consideration for his aid in procuring municipal contracts for them counselled them to commit what would be an offence under s. 161 of the Code.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] Q.R. 26 K.B . 164.\n[2] 2 East 5 at page 17.\n[3] L.R., I.C.C.R. 77.\n[4] 13 Cox 9.\n[5] 31 Can.

The debt secured by a mortgage on lands in Alberta, registered under the provisions of \"The Land Titles Act,\" is property in the province\" within the meaning of section seven of \"The Succession Duties Act\" (5 Geo. 5 c. 5 [Alta.]), though the domicile of the mortgagee is out of the province and the debt is a specialty debt. Anglin J. dissenting.\nBy the Act the mortgage after registration, is to remain in possession of the Registrar of Titles. The mortgage in this case was executed in duplicate the registrar and the mortgagee each retaining one. That retained by the mortgagee was in his possession when he died at Ottawa, Ont.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that such possession by the mortgagee did not make the mortgage \"property out of the province.\"\nPer Davies J.\u2014The duplicate retained by the registrar is the original mortgage.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The mortgage executed under the seal of the mortgagor is the evidence of the debt independently of registration and is conspicuous at the domicile of the mortgagee.\nThough a seal is not essential to the validity of a mortgage in Alberta, if it is executed under seal the debt is a specialty. Idington J. dubitante.\nHeld, per Duff J.\u2014In the sense of international law a mortgage on land is an immovable. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, affirming the judgment at the trial[1], in favour of the respondent.\nThis appeal raises a question of law which is indicated in the above head-note. One Grigg a resident of Ottawa held a mortgage on land in Alberta and when he died the Provinces of Ontario and Alberta each claimed the right to succession duties on the value of this mortgage. An action was brought by the Alberta Government against the appellant as administrator cum testamento annexo of Grigg for the amount of such duties and a special case was submitted to the Supreme Court of the province. It was heard before Mr. Justice Hyndman who held that the duties could be collected and his judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division.\nHogg K.C. and Ford K.C. for the appellant. Unless affected by the registration provisions of the \"Land Titles Act\" this case is settled by authority in favour of Ontario. See Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[2]; In re Muir Estate[3].\nThe debt and security on the land are created apart from and independently of the registration, Jellett v. Wilkie[4].\nLafleur K.C. for the respondent referred to Ivey v. Commissioners of Taxation[5], and Purdom v. Pavey & Co.[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This case does not, I think, present any difficulty and if I entertained any doubt about the correctness of the judgment appealed from the question is concluded by the authority of the Privy Council, notably in the decision in Payne v. The King[7]. The facts of that case are practically identical with those in the present appeal. The testator resided in Victoria and had a mortgage of lands in New South Wales. The instrument of mortgage was in the form authorized by the \"Real Property Act\" of New South Wales (26 Vict. No. 9) and was not under seal; it was in Victoria at the date of the testator's death. The debtor as well as the testator resided in Victoria. It was held that\nthe debt though a specialty debt in New South Wales was a simple contract debt in Victoria and recoverable under a Victorian probate.\nThat was all that was necessary to decide in the case but in their Lordships' judgment it was added,\nit may well be that in order to discharge the mortgage probate duty would also have to be paid in New South Wales.\nFor material purposes I think the \"Real Property Act\" of New South Wales and the \"Land Titles Act\" of the Province of Alberta are alike. For this and the reasons given by the trial judge I think it impossible to contend that the mortgage was not a specialty debt in the Province of Alberta and I do not know that it would matter if t were considered to be also a specialty debt in the Province of Ontario.\nThe property was an asset of the testator in the Province of Alberta and it was not disputed that if it were such it was property within the interpretation in section 3 of the \"Succession Duties Act\" and subject to the duties thereby imposed.\nIt is well established that the name under which duties are imposed is immaterial if the intention of the legislature is clear. It is only in cases of ambiguity that comparison can be made with probate, succession or other duties for the purposes of endeavouring to ascertain what may be supposed to have been the intention of the legislature in using words which have acquired a particular meaning in other well known statutes. Rex v. Lovitt[8].\nThe appeal will be dismissed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I entertain no doubt that the mortgage in question in this case of lands situate in the Province of Alberta and the debt secured thereby were taxable by the Province of Alberta and came within the provisions of the \"Succession Duties Act\" of that province, unless it can be held that at the time of the death of the mortgagee who was domiciled and resident in the Province of Ontario and in whose possession at such time a duplicate copy of such mortgage was found, the rule in Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[9], operated to make this specialty debt \"conspicuous\" in that province.\nAfter giving the facts of the case and the arguments at bar much consideration, I have reached the conclusion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Hyndman, the trial judge, confirmed by the Appeal Court of Alberta, was correct and that the artificial judicial rule as to the situs of the debt laid down in Hope's Case 9, does not apply in this case, because of the provisions of the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nThe reasons for his judgment given by the trial judge commend themselves to me. I agree with him that the real security for the payment of the debt in question is the mortgage registered and held in the Land Titles Office, just as the certificate of title entered and kept in the register is the essential evidence of title, and that \"the mortgage upon which the deceased would have had to rely for the enforcement of his security would be the instrument registered with and retained by the registrar.\"\nI think section 23 of the \"Lands Titles Act\" clearly operates to overcome the artificial rule laid down in Hope's Case [10] as to the situs of the mortgage and as to where it was \"conspicuous\" at mortgagee's death.\nIt reads as follows:\u2014\nInstruments registered in respect of or affecting the same land shall be entitled to priority the one over the other according to the time of registration and not according to the date of execution; and the registrar, upon registration thereof, shall retain the same in his office, and so soon as registered every instrument shall become operative according to the tenor and intent thereof, and shall thereupon create, transfer, surrender, charge or discharge, as the case may be, the land or the estate or interest therein mentioned in the instrument.\nSo soon as registered, every instrument shall become operative according to its intent. The Registrar is required to \"retain the registered-instrument in his office.\" The fact that a mortgagee may have his mortgage executed under seal and in duplicate and may retain and keep in his possession such duplicate copy, cannot in my judgment avail to defeat this statutory requirement that the registered mortgage be retained by the registrar in his office.\nThe mortgage specialty debt, therefore, in my judgment, would be conspicuous in the province where the mortgage security is required to be registered and kept, and the duplicate copy which the mortgagee may, for convenience or other reasons, take with him abroad to his residence, cannot have the effect contended for of making the debt \"conspicuous\" at such residence in another province.\nThe legislature having full power and authority in the subject matter has so legislated as to make the mortgage when registered and retained in the registrar's office the statutory and official mortgage and the situs of the specialty debt should be held to be the place where the statute has declared the registered mortgage shall be retained.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal and answer the question submitted in the special case in the affirmative.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Since this appeal was argued counsel in response to an inquiry from the bench during the argument have submitted the following admission:\u2014\nThe parties admit that at the date of the execution of the mortgages referred to in the stated case, the mortgagors were resident in the Province of Alberta, and that the place of payment of the debt was in each case in the Province of Alberta.\nThis I take it is to be read as part of the admissions of fact upon which the case is asked to be decided.\nThe statute in question is the \"Succession Duties Act\" of Alberta, assented to 22nd October, 1914, of which section 7 provides as follows:\u2014\n7. Save as otherwise provided, all property of any person, situate within the province, and passing on his death, shall be subject to succession duties, at the rate or rates set forth in the following table, the percentage payable on the share of any person or beneficiary being fixed by the following or by some one or more of the following considerations as the case may be:\u2014\n(a) Net value of the property of deceased;\n(b) Place of residence of person or beneficiary;\n(c) Value of property taken, wherever situate;\n(d) Degree of kinship or absence of kinship to the deceased.\nThe determination of the question submitted must turn upon the words\nall property of any person, situate within the province, and passing on his death\nin their plain ordinary meaning having due regard to the general purview of the statute in which the section is found and the specific provisions therein illuminating what is intended to be expressed by the words \"passing on his death,\" but subject always to the limitations of the taxing power of the province as expressed in the \"British North America Act,\" section 92, item 2.\nThe property attempted to be taxed is a number of mortgages which can only derive their efficacy from and by virtue of the statutes of Alberta having exclusive legislative jurisdiction over property and civil rights in the province.\nThe \"Land Titles Act\" of that province declares, by section 60 thereof, how a mortgage may be constituted, and by section 61 thereof, what it is to be, and cannot be, and by other sections how it may be registered.\nNo seal is required any more than under our English law to a will. Yet some one, doubtless through ignorance, has been known to affix a seal to such a will; and it is admitted seals were needlessly used in the execution of the mortgages in question herein.\nDoes that sort of error constitute a will a specialty? Or does the affixing of a seal to an Alberta mortgage constitute it any greater security on the land than the \"Land Titles Act\" declares it to be?\nAnd if the mortgagee desires to enforce it as against the land he can only go to the courts of Alberta and rely upon the laws of Alberta to realize the security out of the land.\nPersonal remedies he may have elsewhere for the debt but even that is admitted to be payable in each of the cases herein involved in Alberta, and prima facie only recoverable there.\nHow can such a debt and such a security be held to be situate elsewhere than in Alberta? We are told because, probably by accident, someone affixed a seal and constituted the debt a specialty, and therefore because in certain circumstances in English law a presumption exists that the property in that specialty is situate where the mortgagee was domiciled, hence that is the meaning which we must attribute to this Alberta statute.\nIs it conceivable that such a highly technical meaning was present to the mind of the Alberta Legislature?\nSuppose the mortgage had contained no covenant but the mortgagee had, after its registration, taken a bond under seal for payment of the same debt which it secured and kept it with him till his death, would the mortgage, thus freed from such questions as rest upon the covenant being therein, be situate in Alberta or Ontario? How fine can the distinctions be drawn and yet supply the reasoning by which the mortgage can cease to be property situate in Alberta? Some one might tell us that the debt merged in the sealed bond and hence must be situate where the bond is found. However all that may be surely that is not the kind of process of reasoning by which we will be best able to determine what the Legislature of Alberta had in view.\nIs it not plain and palpable that the legislature, if we regard the general purview of the \"Succession Duties Act\" and its manifold provisions, had determined to reach out with all its taxing power to tax the security and the debt due by one of its own citizens as property situate in and taxable by it in the event of death necessitating that such property should pass to someone else and could only pass by virtue of Alberta laws to someone else?\nSuch is my reading of the statute; and of the power to enact it I have no manner of doubt. And if I had a doubt of the meaning of the language used the obvious consideration that the power was intended to be fully exercised would weigh much with me in arriving at the meaning of the words \"situate within the province.\"\nI can conceive of the case where the security had become nil and the debtor had become resident elsewhere than in Alberta at the time of his death, yet perfectly solvent and the debt recoverable from him, in such case that the doctrines resting upon the nature of a specialty debt might well be looked to for guidance in relation to the right of taxation by some other province than Alberta. Then in such case it might be hard to argue that the property at the death was situate in Alberta unless, as admitted herein, the debt was payable there.\nIt was pressed upon us in argument that Ontario was making a claim to duties in relation to these same mortgages. I pass no opinion upon the question of whether or not it can maintain such a claim, or upon the much wider questions either of the economic wisdom or justice of either claim.\nYet it may not be impertinent to suggest that, where a man's money has been invested and enjoyed the protection of the laws of that place, an enforced contribution, called taxation, to the maintenance thereof, cannot be held to fall beyond the limits of direct taxation.\nThe trouble is, however, that direct taxation may, as well as any other form of taxation, carry in it an element of injustice. With that we have (paradoxical as it may sound) nothing to do.\nSo long as the struggle over these succession duties is fought out upon the lines of highly technical reasoning, perfectly sound where relevant, instead of measur- ing the meaning of legislation by the plain ordinary sense of the language used and then clearly operative within the taxing power of the legislature, will the day be postponed for an adjustment of the respective rights and duties of the provincial legislatures.\nThe problems involved are by no means easy of solution on a just basis. And double taxation may in law be inevitable, so it seems to me, if legislatures fail to observe justice. Perhaps wise men investing in the west will avoid needless seals and watch the Statute of Limitations.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed and I am glad to see the parties concerned have by agreement relieved us of deciding the question of cost.\nDUFF J.\u2014It will be convenient, first, to consider whether the securities in question were at the death of the testator taxable subjects in Alberta, that is to say, subjects within the power of Alberta to levy taxation upon. They are mortgages constituted under the \"Alberta Land Titles Act\" as mortgages; that is to say, as affecting the lands mortgaged they are operative by virtue of the provisions of the statute in consequence of registration pursuant to section 60 of that Act. By section 62 the usual remedies for the enforcement of the rights of a mortgagee are given to. the holder of the mortgage. By section 62 a power to enter in default of payment of interest or principal, power of sale upon notice and authority to the Registrar of Titles to grant an order for foreclosure on certain conditions are all given. By the provisions of the Act the security may be released by an entry on the certificate of title made by the registrar under the prescribed conditions and may be assigned by a registered transfer in the prescribed form, and the Act provides that upon registration of such a transfer not only the transferee's interest in the land and all his rights, powers and privileges pertaining to the land, but also the right to recover the mortgage debt shall pass to and become vested in the transferee. The case of the absence of the mortgagee from the province is dealt with by a provision which enables the mortgagor by leave of the judge to pay the amount of the mortgage debt into a bank and to procure the release of the mortgage by the registration of a memorandum prescribed by the statute.\nI have no difficulty in the conclusion that these registered instruments create interests in land which are assets in Alberta. The point, indeed, is concluded by a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Walsh v. The Queen[11]. I quote from the judgment of the Board, delivered by Lord Watson, at page 148:\u2014\nThough resting partly upon personal obligation the debts are all charged upon real and personal estate which the appellant himself alleges to be \"in Queensland.\" Although the debt is not yet due and payable, so that the creditor has no occasion to resort to his security, it is in vain to suggest that a debt covered by security is in the same position with one depending on personal obligation only. The market value of assets of that kind is, in most cases, so greatly enhanced by what the appellant represents as an immaterial and accessory right, that they are generally known and dealt in as securities. It is unnecessary to attempt a precise definition of the relation in which a mortgagee or other incumbrancer who has not taken possession stands to the subjects of his security. It is sufficient for the purposes of this case to say that he has, not merely a jus ad rem, but a present interest in and affecting these subjects, which is preferable to the interest of the mortgagor. Is such an interest in property admittedly situated in Queensland an asset in Queensland within the meaning of the Act? That is the sole question arising for decision in this appeal, and its merits lie within a very narrow compass.\nThe appellant's counsel did not dispute that the debtor's interest in the subjects which he assigned in security was an asset in Queensland; and they went so far as to admit that the creditor's interest would also be so, if he enforced his security by entering into possession. Independ- ently of any concession in argument, neither of these propositions appears to be attended with doubt. Laying aside, as plaintly untenable, the theory that, until he has attained possession, the creditor's right consists in the bare personal obligation of his debtor, it would be difficult to find any good reason for holding that it includes no interest in the subjects of the security which is capable of valuation. The personal obligation to pay may not be an asset in Queensland; but it does not follow that the debt due, so far as it is charged upon an estate within the colony, and gives the creditor a real and preferable interest in that estate, is not an asset in the colony. Such an interest is certainly property of the company, and property in the colony, because it affects the estate which is admittedly situated there.\nSee also Henty v. The Queen[12], at page 574.\nThe appellant company relies upon section 61 of the Act, which is as follows:\u2014\nA mortgage or incumbrance under this Act shall have effect and security but shall not operate as a transfer of the land thereby charged.\nThe corresponding section of the Manitoba statute was considered in Yockney v. Thompson[13], in which it was unanimously held by this court that this last mentioned section which goes further than section 61 had not the effect now contended for. The enactment in the Manitoba Act provides (sec. 100) that the mortgage shall not operate as a transfer of the land thereby charged \"or of any estate or interest therein.\" It was nevertheless held that an agreement to execute a mortgage was sufficient to constitute a foundation for a caveat under section 130 of that statute, on the ground that the beneficiary of the agreement (the vendee) desiring to file a caveat to protect his rights under the agreement was a person claiming an \"estate or interest in land\" within the meaning of section 130. My view of these sections is expressed in my judgment in that case, in these words:\u2014\nThe effect of section 100 was fully considered in Smith v. The National Trust Co[14]. It was there pointed out that., as regards land registered under the new system, title is consummated by registration and that the effect of section 100 is that the holder of a \"mortgage or incumbrance\" registered under the Act has not vested in him, in whole or in part, the registered title. The execution and registration of the mortgage, in a word, does not immediately effect any dismemberment of the mortgagor's registered title. In that sense the mortgagee has no estate or interest in the land.\nI entirely agree, however, with the learned trial judge that it is something very much like a contradiction in terms to say that a mortgagee, having the powers of sale and foreclosure vested in him by the statute, together with other rights as to the possession of the land which the statute gives him, has not, in the broader sense of the words, an interest in the mortgaged land. I do not think section 130 can properly be limited to those cases in which the claim is a claim to be registered as possessor in whole or in part of the registered title. In other words, I do not think it can be properly limited to those cases in which an \"interest is claimed\" in the restricted sense in which \"interest\" is used in section 100.\nThat there was an interest, and a taxable interest in the sense above mentioned, in these lands at the time of the death of the testator seems therefore clear.\nAs Lord Watson pointed out, however, in Walsh v. The Queen[15]., the question whether or not the mortgage debt could properly be the subject of taxation in Alberta is not necessarily the same question. But the answer, I think, to that question must be in the affirmative.\nThe instrument, as we gather from the stated case, was in the statutory form with some additional covenants, and, further, was executed in duplicate under the seal of the mortgagor in every instance, a formality not contemplated by the form. One duplicate was in possession of the testator at the time of his death, in Ontario, where he was domiciled, and the other remained in the proper registry office in Alberta. I do not find it necessary to consider the point raised as to whether the statute requires that the mortgage or the duplicate of the mortgage should be left in the registry where it is registered. The fact is, that in each case this was done and that in doing this the parties acted in accordance with the usual practice.\nThe mortgage debt was in the sense of international law an immovable. That, I think, results from the decision of the Court of Appeal and especially from the judgment of the Master of the Rolls in Re Hoyles[16]. I quote from pages 183 and 184:\u2014\nI think a mortgage debt secured by land is to be regarded, not as a movable but as an immovable. The authority of text-writers is strongly in favour of this view. Story, s. 447, expressly includes \"charges on lands, as mortgages,\" as in the sense of the law immovables and governed by the lex rei sit\u00e6; and Dicey states that \"immovable property includes all rights over things which cannot be moved, whatever be the nature of such rights or interests\" (Dicey, 2nd ed. p. 76; see also p. 496). Thus a Scotch heritable bond has always been treated by our law as immovable although there is a personal obligation to pay: Jerningham v. Herbert[17]; In re Fitzgerald[18], But apart from authority, I should have arrived at the same conclusion from considering the nature and extent of the rights of a mortgagee of freehold land. If he sues on the covenant to pay he must reconvey the land on payment. If he has parted with the land, otherwise than in exercise of a power of sale, he would be restrained from suing on the covenant: Lockhart v. Hardy[19]; Palmer v. Hendrie[20]; Kinnaird v. Trollope[21]. The result is that a mortgagee cannot assign the mortgage debt effectually without also transferring the security upon the land.\nEvery word of this is applicable to the securities now under consideration. It follows from the fact that they are immovables that the law governing their assignment, their discharge and their devolution is the law of Alberta.\nMoreover, they can only be effectively assigned, that is to say, assigned in such a way as to protect the rights of the assignee, by something done in Alberta. They can only be effectively discharged, that is to say, discharged in such a way as to protect the interests of the mortgagor by something done in Alberta. They can only be effectively enforced in Alberta because of the debtor being resident in Alberta and the common rule requiring the debtor to seek out his creditor and pay him being abrogated by the provision that I have mentioned; in other words, the debt being in substance a debt being payable in Alberta, the mortgagee could not even effectively sue upon the debt in Ontario. The circumstance that one duplicate of the instrument executed by the mortgagor was in the mortgagee's possession in Ontario strictly can have no bearing because if it be said that for that reason the debt had its situs in Ontario, precisely the same reasoning leads to the conclusion that the debt had also its situs in Alberta. Whether you take these instruments as constituting together one instrument, or as constituting separate instruments, the result is the same for the purposes of this appeal. If they are one instrument, then the instrument was just as much in Alberta as in Ontario; if two separate instruments, it is equally obvious that neither can be considered, exclusively of the other, to determine the locality of the debt.\nBut does the statute in question effectively cover these securities? On that point I can entertain no doubt whatever. The word \"property\" is so broad as to admit of no escape from it. What I have said already will sufficiently indicate the reason why, in my opinion, Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[22], has no application. And it may be added that probate in Ontario would neither be necessary nor sufficient to enable the executors to enforce their mortgage debt. Westlake, pages 115 and 116; Whyte v. Rose[23], while probate in Alberta would be both necessary and sufficient, ibid. But there is a consideration which I should like to emphasize in addition to what I have already said and it is this: As Lord Macnaghten said, speaking for the Judicial Committee in Payne v. The King[24], if an attempt were made by the appellant company to enforce these mortgages in Ontario and if, by some accident (the present debtors, for example, being in Ontario), it succeeded in obtaining judgement, the company would not be permitted to enforce the judgments against the debtors in person without first providing for the discharge of the mortgages. That could only be done effectively by registration on the books of the registry office in Alberta and I can conceive no manner of reason for doubting the power of the Province of Alberta to require as a condition of the registration of such discharges the payment of duties such as those imposed by the Act in question. The same remark applies to a transfer. In other words, in normal circumstances, the executors cannot effectively realize on these securities either by enforcing the covenants for payment or by a sale of them without resort to the registration machinery provided by the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nIn view of these considerations, it would seem an extraordinary conclusion that for the purposes of taxation these debts are deemed by construction of law to have locality in Ontario and not to have locality in Alberta.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting)\u2014It is the common case of both parties to this litigation that the property on which the Province of Alberta seeks to levy succession duties is a debt secured by mortgage on lands in that province \u2014that this debt, which the mortgagor has covenanted under seal to pay, is a specialty debt\u2014and that its artificial situs for purposes of taxation is where the specialty was \"conspicuous\" at the date of the mortgagor's death. That there may be no room for doubt as to the position taken by the respondent on these points, I quote from his factum the propositions numbered 2 and 3.\n2. The locality of a simple contract debt is at the domicile of the debtor and that of a specialty debt where the specialty is found at the time of the creditor's death.\n3. The mortgage in the present case being a deed under seal constitutes a specialty debt.\nThe parties differ only in their views as to what was the situs of the specialty\u2014as to where it was \"conspicuous\"\u2014the appellant administrator asserting that it was at the City of Ottawa, Ontario, where the mortgagee resided and where an original of the mortgage (which had been executed in duplicate) was found amongst his effects; the respondent claiming that it was at the registry office in Alberta where the other original of the mortgage had been deposited for registration in conformity with the requirements of the \"Alberta Land Titles Act.\"\nNo doubt what passed or devolved on the death of the mortgagee was the debt owing to him. Incidentally, but only as an accessory. (Lawson v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue)[25], the security and the contingent right to enforce it also passed. But no estate in the Alberta land devolved, because under the \"Land Titles Act\" of that province (s. 61) a mortgage or incumbrance does not \"operate as a transfer of the land thereby charged.\" The case in this aspect is more favourable to the appellant than it would have been had the subject of devolution been a debt secured by a common law mortgage, the de- volution of which would have carried with it an interest in land in Alberta.\nThe debt existed as a specialty debt enforceable by virtue of the mortgagor's covenant apart from, and independently of, registration of the instrument evidencing it. When the \"Land Titles Act\" by section 25 (so much made of by the respondent) provides that instruments shall have priority according to the time of registration and that\nso soon as registered every instrument shall become operative according to the tenor and intent thereof and shall thereupon create, transfer, surrender, charge or discharge as the case may be, the land or the estate or interest therein mentioned in the instrument,\nit is obviously only the operation and effect upon the land, or the estate or interest therein, to be transferred or charged that is dealt with. The operation and effect of an instrument as creating or evidencing a debt or other obligation independent of the security for its payment or fulfilment is not in contemplation and is in nowise affected. The mortgagee might enforce the mortgagor's covenant although the mortgage were never registered; and, if it should be registered, proof of that fact would be wholly irrelevant in an action on the covenant in which the plaintiff's claim would be established by production of the duplicate original in his possession.\nThe duly appointed personal representative of the mortgagee in the jurisdiction where the debt has its legal locality is the person entitled to collect it and to enforce payment of it from the debtor, and, upon his default, by resorting to the securities taken to provide against that event. That, for purposes of identification or to obtain a status in the local courts in order to enforce the security, he might require to obtain ancillary probate or administration from the State or province in which the security was situate does not affect the situs of the debt itself or his right to collect it. Payne v. The King[26].\nIf for an entire single debt security were taken by a mortgage (containing a covenant for its payment) upon two parcels of real estate, one in Quebec and the other in Alberta, the mortgagee residing in Ontario and there holding an original of the instrument containing the covenant, could it be successfully or even plausibly contended that the situs of the specialty debt was other than Ontario? Would it be in Quebec, or would it be in Alberta? Anything that could be said for a situs in Alberta would obviously have equal force as an argument in favour of the situs being in Quebec. There is only one debt and it can have but one legal locality, and that, according to English law, must be where the specialty is \"conspicuous.\" Highly artificial as this rule of law undoubtedly is, it is too long and too firmly established to permit of question. If the bond or covenant for payment were contained in one document and the mortgage security in another, as was formerly customary, the fact that a duplicate of the latter was deposited for the purpose of registration where the land charged was situate could not affect the situs of the debt evidenced by the bond or covenant for payment, which would depend solely upon where that document was found. The fact that the two instruments, the bond or covenant and the mortgage, are now for reasons of convenience or economy usually embodied in a single document does not alter their distinct legal characteristics. The duplicate original of the debtor's covenant in the Alberta registry office at the time of the mortgagee's death was there only because the parties had incorporated it in the mortgage instead of executing a separate bond. The instrument held by the creditor as evidence of the debt due him and upon which he would undoubtedly have proceeded in any action brought to enforce the debtor's personal obligation was the document held by him in Ottawa. There is nothing in the record to shew that the personal obligation of the debtor is not perfectly good or that the debt will not be paid at maturity on demand; and the presumption is that it will. It may never be necessary to resort to the accessory security. Its actual value to the estate may be little or nothing.\nIt does not appear from the reports of Hope's Case[27], whether a duplicate original mortgage had been similarly deposited in the registry office in New South Wales. I rather think that must have been the case. Hogg on Australian Torrens Titles, pp. 104 (s. 36), 88, col. 1 line 3, 761. Although not so stated in the report I have little doubt that there was also a duplicate original mortgage deposited in the Michigan registry office in the case of Treasurer of Ontario v. Paitin[28]. Such a fact would not have escaped the attention of the learned counsel and judges concerned in those two cases. In each the situs of the specialty debt was held to be at the residence of the mortgagee amongst whose effects the instrument evidencing it was found.\nThe decision In the estate of Sir William Clark[29], is instructive and closely in point.\nIvey v. Commissioners of Taxation[30], much relied on by the respondent, is distinguishable in that the question there at issue was not the situs o property but the source of an income. In so far as the court may have held that the effect of registration was to give to the specialty debt a situs at the place of regis- tration of the mortgage, regardless of the place where the instrument creating the specialty should afterwards be found, it would seem to have ignored or disregarded the decision in Hope's Case[31]. No doubt for the purpose of making title to the land the duplicate original on deposit in the registry office, or rather the copy thereof made in the register itself, may be deemed the sole original and the copy in the mortgagee's possession \"really a duplicate of that which forms the effective instrument.\" Ivey's Case[32]. But that is not the case where the question is one not of title to the land charged as security but of the existence and nature of the debt secured. See Re McLachlin[33].\nThe question before us is not as to the constitutional power of the Province of Alberta to provide for the taxation of securities held by decedents, wherever domiciled, upon real property in that province, or to impose fees, based on the amounts of the debts secured, for the granting of letters probate or of administration sought to enable foreign executors or administrators to realize by enforcing securities on Alberta real estate. Within the restrictions imposed by section 92 32 of the \"B.N.A. Act,\" I should not question the power of the province to impose such taxation. The duty demanded in the case at bar, however, is not based on the value of the security in Alberta either intrinsic or to the estate. It is based upon the whole mortgage debt regardless of the value of the security, and would be the same if the value of the personal obligation of the debtor were unquestionable or if the mortgagee had also held other security of indubitable value on property situate elsewhere. The claim made is that by virtue of the provisions of the \"Alberta Land Titles Act\" and registration pursuant thereto the situs of the mortgage debt itself is in Alberta and that that debt is therefore subject to duty under section 7 of the \" Alberta Succession Duties Act\" as \"property * * * situate within the province.\"\nFor the reasons above stated I am, with respect, of the opinion that it was not so situate. I would therefore allow this appeal and answer the question proposed by the special case in the negative.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 11 Alta. L.R. 138.\n[2] [1891] A.C. 476.\n[3] 51 Can.

V., c. 18 (N.S.), 6 &7 Geo. V., c. 27 (N.S.)\nBy sec. 2 of the \"Nova Scotia Fisheries Act\" of 1912 (2 Geo. V., ch. 18), every resident of the Province is given the right to go on foot along the banks of any river, stream or lake and to go on or across the same for the purpose of lawfully fishing therein except as to the land of an occupant licensed under the Act. From sec. 3, the provision that such right should not apply \"to lands situate in a municipality where no by-laws imposing any licences are in force,\" was eliminated in 1916 (6 & 7 Geo. V., ch. 27). By sec. 6 any municipality \"may by by-law provide for the issue of licences under this Act\" and for regulation of the fees and by sec. 7 the clerk is required to keep a record of the licences issued and the fees paid.\nHeld, that the provisions of sec. 6 respecting the issue of municipal licenses cannot be construed as imperative and on the neglect or refusal of a municipal council to pass the said by-law an \"occupant\" may obtain the issue of a licence by a writ of mandamus.\nHeld also, Davies J. dissenting, that such writ may be directed to the clerk of the municipality.\nPer Davies J.\u2014The writ should have been directed to the municipal council requiring it to pass the necessary by-law.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], ordering a writ of mandamus to issue against the appellant. The prosecutor, Hensley, was an occupant of land in the County of Halifax and entitled to a licence to fish in Indian River in said county. The County Council had never passed the by-law authorized by sec. 7 of the \"Fisheries Act\" for the issue of licences and regulation of the fees and on his application a writ of mandamus was issued directed to the clerk of the council ordering him to issue the licence. This appeal is from the judgment ordering the issue of the writ.\nJ. J. Power K.C. for the appellant.\nT. S. Rogers K.C. for the respondent.\nJ. J. Power K.C. for the appellant. The clear intention of the Act is that a municipal by-law is necessary before a licence to fish can be granted. See Slattery v. Naylor[2].\nThe amendment to the Act in 1916 does not make a by-law unnecessary. Townsend v. Cox[3], at page 518; Laird v. McGwire[4]; Reg. v. Freeman[5].\nT. S. Rogers K.C. for the respondent, referred to Commissioner of Public Works v. Logan[6], at pages 363-4; Attorney-General v. Horner[7], at page 257; Bradlaugh v, Clarke[8], at page 380.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014At first sight I thought as I suppose any one would have thought that this action was misconceived in that the mandamus should have been asked to be directed to the municipality of the County of Halifax rather than to one of the corporation's officials, namely, the appellant, the municipal clerk.\nUpon consideration, however, I have come to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from is right The reference in the \"Act respecting the rights of fishing in the Province of Nova Scotia\" (Acts of 1912, ch. 15), to municipal councils, is in section 6 which provides:\u2014\n6 (i) The municipal councils may by by-law provide for the issue of licences under this Act, and fix and regulate the fees to be paid by occupants for such licences in respect to fishing rights appertaining to lands within their respective municipalities, but no fee payable for any licence issued under this Act shall exceed the sum of fifty dollars.\nNow this section is prim\u00e2 facie only permissive and in order to see whether it should be read as imperative we must consider whether any further provision essential for the working of the Act is left to be provided by the municipal councils. I do not think it is; the nature and purpose of the licences not only clearly appears in the Act, but the form of a licence which \"any occupant may obtain\" is given in the schedule to the Act; there is provision for the dating of the licence and the period for which it shall remain in force; then it is provided that the \"licence shall be issued by the municipal clerk\" and there is a section imposing on him the further duty of keeping a record shewing the particulars therein set forth concerning all such licences issued, such record to be open for inspection as herein mentioned by any person without charge.\nNow if the permissive section 6 were not in the Act at all there is here a sufficient machinery for carrying out the intention of the legislature without the necessity of any by-laws being passed by the council to \"provide for the issue of licences.\" No fees can be taken unless the fees to be paid are fixed and regulated by the council, but they are in no way essential to the issue of the licence; if the council does not choose to exact any fees it is so much to the advantage of the licensee; for it is not to be supposed that he is to be deprived of his right to obtain a licence because the council do not exercise the right for which permission is given to fix the fees to be paid.\nThe Act not having imposed any obligatory duties on the council but only given permission for the exercise of rights which must be regarded rather in the light of privileges, the duties expressly imposed on the clerk of the council, the named official, must be treated as imperative and addressed to him personally. For the fulfilment of his duties he requires no authority or instruction from the council. The duties are not judicial or discretionary but purely administrative, and that being so I think a mandamus will lie to compel him to perform them and to issue a licence in a proper case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the direction given by the statute to the clerk of the municipality is dependent upon the by-law having been passed by the council providing for the issue of the licences and fixing the fees which should be paid for them.\nAs stated by the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, I think it was the clear duty of the council to have made such provision and that of the clerk to have acted upon it, and issued the licence in accordance with it. But I cannot construe the Act as authorizing the clerk to issue licences free because no by-law had been passed.\nIn my judgment the mandamus should have issued not to the clerk to issue the licence but to the council to discharge its clear statutory duty of providing for the issue of the licences and for the fees payable on them.\nI would therefore allow the appeal on this sole ground and not on those suggested by the appellant's counsel that the municipal council was vested with the power of determining whether or not there should be public fishing on and through an occupant's lands, or whether or not fishing licences should be granted.\nI do not think any such power was conferred on the council by the statute. Their duty was simply to make regulations providing for the issue of licences and fixing the fees to be charged for them. On that being done their clerk's duty was to issue the licences in accordance with their regulations. If they refused or failed to discharge that duty they can be compelled by the court to perform it.\nBut their neglect or refusal does not confer upon their clerk the right or duty to issue licences without payment of any fee or at a fee he may determine, or to determine what degree of neglect on the council's part vested the right and power in him to issue the licences.\nIdington J.\u2014I think the construction of the statute in question adopted by the court below in granting the relief prayed for as against the appellant, is well founded. Clearly sections 4 and 5 are independent of the rest of the statute and for the express purpose of enabling occupants, such as the prosecutor, of land, other than owners of timber land, to enjoy their own property free from the exercise of the rights given to strangers elsewhere in the statute.\nSection 5 enabled such occupants to protect themselves, and section 7 enabled the public to ascertain whose lands had become so protected, and strangers were prohibited from entering thereon for fishing purposes.\nSection 6 is simply a permissive power given the municipal councils named therein to derive revenue by fixing a fee to be paid by those concerned on obtaining the licence.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014If the statute had remained as it was in 1912, a great deal might have been urged in support of Mr. Power's contention that the Legislature had left to the municipal council the right to determine whether or not the procuring of a licence should be \"imposed\" on the owners of several fisheries as a condition of preserving their rights. Under the Act of 1912, it was only where the council had provided by by-law for the issue of such licences that the right of fishing in inland waters bordering upon privately owned \"uncultivated land,\" (not being \"timber lands\"), was conferred on residents of the province. Until the council saw fit to exercise the powers given to it by section 6, the public right did not accrue and it was unnecessary for the \"owner\" or \"occupant\" to exclude it by obtaining a licence from the municipal clerk. It would seem not improbable that under such circumstances the duty of the clerk to issue such a licence would arise only if the council had passed a by-law \"imposing licences.\"\nBut the amendment of 1916 entirely changed the situation. Thereafter, the public right conferred on residents of the province exists whether a by-law under section 6 providing for the issue of licences has or has not been enacted. In order to preserve his private right and to exclude the public the owner of \"uncultivated land\" must now obtain a licence. The effect of the change in the statute, in my opinion, is not, as argued by Mr. Power, merely to remove a restriction upon the public right of fishing imposed by the earlier Act, but also to change the character of the duty imposed by section 5 on the clerks of municipal councils and to take from the councils the right to determine whether uncultivated lands of private owners or occupants should or should not be subject to the provisions of the statute\u2014leaving it in their discretion however to \"fix and regulate,\" within the prescribed limit, and subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council, what fees, if any, such owners or occupants should be required to pay for the licences which section 5 requires the municipal clerks to issue. The duty of the latter to issue licences is no longer dependent upon the exercise by the councils of their powers under section 6. Upon payment of the fees fixed by the council, if any, or, in the event of the council failing to exercise the power conferred by section 6, without payment of any fee, the clerk is obliged to issue a licence in the prescribed statutory form. Otherwise it would be left to the discretion of municipal councils to determine whether the private fishing rights of \"occupants\" should be conditionally preserved or unconditionally confiscated\u2014a result which it is scarcely conceivable that the legislature contemplated.\nWhile I think it quite probable that it was intended to impose a duty upon municipal councils to provide for the issue of licences\u2014leaving to their discretion the amount of the fees (if any) to be exacted (within a prescribed limit)\u2014I am not satisfied that that intention has been expressed. Although the word \"may\" is taken as equivalent to the word \"shall\" where \"the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or the public good\" is authorized, its prim\u00e2 facie connotation is permissive or enabling. I am not satisfied that it is not so used in section 6. Having regard to section 23 (11) of the \"Interpretation Act,\" (R.S.N.S. 1900, ch. 1), only a clear case of impelling context would justify giving it an imperative construction. The use of the word \"shall\" in section 5 indicates that the word \"may\" was used advisedly in section 6 and in a permissive or enabling sense. Moreover, there would appear to be grave difficulty in the way of curial enforcement of any such duty as it has been suggested is imposed upon the municipal councils by section 6, especially in view of the provision of subsection 2 which subjects any action taken by them to the approval of the Governor-in-Council.\nIt by no means follows that because there is a duty cast on the donee of a power to exercise it, that mandamus lies to enforce it; that depends on the nature of the duty and the position of the donee. Julius v. Bishop of Oxford[9].\nNo such obstacle presents itself to the enforcement of the duty imposed on the clerk by section 5.\nIt seems to me probable that the clerk would have a right to demand indemnity from the municipal council for any expenses properly incurred by him in carrying out the provisions of ss. 5 and 7. But if not, the fact that no provision is made for such expenses does not alter the imperative nature of the duties imposed upon him by the statute or deprive the respondent of the right to invoke the aid of the court to compel their performance.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Thomas Notting.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

[1913] ch. 134, sec. 29, provides that \"in cities, towns and villages all real and personal property may be assessed at less than actual value or in some uniform and equitable proportion of actual value, so that the rate of taxation shall fall equally upon the same.\"\nHeld, that this legislation does not authorize the assessment of property at more than its actual value.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the decision of the senior judge of the county court of Winnipeg, reducing the assessment on appellant's property from $160,000 to $88,000.\nThe appellant claims that the assessment is greatly in excess of the real value, the respondent that the value should be that of normal times and that under the legislation quoted in the head-note the property could be assessed at more than its actual value provided that the whole assessment for the property was uniform and equitable.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellant. There are no reported cases upon the interpretation of this Act or of one containing the like provisions but the following decisions may be referred to: Pearce v. City of Calgary[1]; Grierson v. Edmonton[2]; City of Strathcona v. Edmonton and Strathcona Land Syn.[3]; Crawford v. Linn Co.[4].\nTaxing Acts should be construed strictly, O'Brien v. Cogswell[5].\nHull for the respondent. This legislation was first enacted in 1909 and the decisions of the county court judges under it have been uniformly in favour of our contention. When re-enacted in 1910 the legislature adopted this judicial interpretation. See Greaves v. Tofield[6]; Jay v. Johnstone[7].\nChrysler K.C. for the appellant.\nHull for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Idington.\nDavies J.\u2014The main and substantial question arising on this appeal was as to the true construction of section 29 of \"The Assessment Act\" of Manitoba.\nThat section reads:\u2014\nIn cities, towns and villages all real and personal property may be assessed at less than actual value or in some uniform and equitable proportion of actual value, so that the rate of taxation shall fall equally upon the same. The expression \"actual value\" used in this section shall mean the fair market value of such property, regardless of a prospective increase or decrease, either probable, remote or near.\nAs I understood the argument of counsel for the respondent, it was that uniformity was the controlling principle embodied in this section and that it did not matter in applying that principle whether the assessment was above or below the actual value of the lands assessed.\nI was impressed during the argument with the force of this contention but after giving the question much consideration have concluded that it cannot be upheld.\nThe general principle that in construing legislation imposing taxation clear language must be found supporting the taxation must be borne in mind.\nNow in the section before us while express language is used permitting assessment at less than actual value, there is no such language permitting assessment at more than actual value.\nIt was contended that such permission should be inferred from the words\nor in some uniform and equitable proportion of actual value.\nThese are vague and indefinite words and I do not think that from them alone a permission should be inferred to assess at more than the actual value of the land.\nThey are useful and probably necessary in cases where the permission to assess at less than the actual value is exercised as in such case preserving the general principle of uniformity and providing that the permission so to assess must be exercised not in a haphazard way but uniformly\nso that the rate of taxation shall fall equally upon the same,\nwhich latter words I construe to mean upon all the lands and property assessed. If the policy of assessing \"lands and personal property\" at less than their actual value is adopted by the assessors it must be applied generally \"to all real and personal property\" and on some fixed principle, so that uniformity may be maintained and injustice prevented.\nBut, however that may be worked out under the statute, it seems to me reasonably clear that no intention to assess property beyond its actual value can be assumed or inferred. I am not insensible to the many and great difficulties which existing conditions of the absence of any actual value of the lands in many parts may give rise to in making an assessment. But if the two main principles which I suggest are followed these difficulties can be largely minimized if not entirely overcome. These principles are that the Act does not authorize assessments greater than the \"actual value\" of the property assessed which the section goes on to say means\nthe fair market value of such property regardless of a prospective increase or decrease, either probable, remote or near,\nand that when assessed at less than the actual value it must be done on a uniform principle applied to all the lands and property assessed.\nI concur therefore in allowing the appeal with costs, and reducing the assessment to $40,000. There is some evidence at any rate justifying that figure as the actual value of the lands assessed and there does not appear to be any justifying a higher valuation.\nIdington J.\u2014I find no valid reason in the argument set up to support the claim to assess appellant's property at a sum beyond its valuation.\nWhether we consider \"The Assessment Act\" or \"The Municipal Act\" or both together, and read the words \"value,\" \"actual value,\" \"market value,\" respectively used therein and according to their proper force and effect with in the recognized rules of interpretation and construction, there is to be found no warrant for resorting to the particularistic method of interpretation we are asked to adopt, and thereby render much of the language used and legislation it expresses, null and absurd.\nI doubt if ever such methods of interpretation and construction should be tolerated, though we must admit courts of law have too frequently lent a willing ear thereto, and only for that reason do I think such an argument pardonable.\nCounsel for respondent did not seem to deny that Mr. Chrysler's analysis and inferences from the evidence which placed the total value at $40,000, were fair.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the assessment fixed at $40,000, the reduction of $48,000 being applied distributively in proportion to the relative sums fixed as to the assessment of each parcel involved, pursuant to the judgment of the district judge's decision.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed with costs, and the assessment reduced to $40,000.\nAnglin J.\u2014The sole question on this appeal is whether under section 29 of the \"Manitoba Assessment Act,\" (R.S.M., 1913, ch. 134), an assessment of land in excess of its value is permissible in cities, towns or villages.\nBy section 422 of the \"Municipal Act\" (R.S.M. 1913, ch. 133; amended 1916, ch. 72, s. 10) the maximum rate of taxation (exclusive of certain special rates) to be levied in cities, towns and villages is fixed at two cents on the dollar of assessed value. Sec. 423 of the same statute requires that the rates shall be calculated at so much in the dollar upon the actual value of assessable property, except as otherwise provided in the \"Assessment Act\" for cities, towns and villages.\nThe only provision of the \"Assessment Act\" by which it is otherwise provided is section 29, which reads as follows:\u2014 In cities, towns and villages all real and personal property may be assessed at less than actual value, or in some uniform and equitable proportion of actual value, so that the rate of taxation shall fall equally upon the same. The expression \"actual value\" used in this section shall mean the fair market value of such property, regardless of a prospective increase or decrease, either probable, remote or near.\nThe prim\u00e2 facie meaning of the word \"proportion\" in this collocation is clearly \"portion.\" That is the meaning which ninety-nine men out of a hundred would give to it. The only ground for suggesting that it bears another meaning is the presence in the section of the preceding phrase, \"at less than actual value,\" and the connecting conjunction, \"or.\" It is argued that to avoid redundancy the word \"proportion\" must be given the meaning of multiple, or fraction of a multiple. But tautology in statutes is something quite too common to warrant such a straining of the ordinary meaning of the word \"proportion\" in order to avoid it. I think the purpose of all the words following the word \"value,\" where it first occurs in section 29, is to provide that in the event of the basis of the assessment of land being \"less than actual value\" the same fraction of value must prevail in all cases \"so that the rate of taxation shall fall equally.\" The word \"or\" is not used disjunctively to separate the expression of two distinct ideas, but, as is quite ordinary, to indicate that the idea expressed in the phrase, \"at less than actual value,\" is repeated in another form in the word \"proportion,\" with the qualification of uniformity and equitability superadded, the purpose being indicated by the succeeding words,\nso that the rate of taxation shall fall equally upon the same.\nIt may of course be conceded that the section is not a model of draughtsmanship. The form of oath prescribed for the assessor affords a very strong indication that the legislature in fact used the word \"proportion\" in the sense of portion. Moreover, were it otherwise\u2014if assessed values might be \"boosted\" indefinitely\u2014the purpose of the restriction of the rate of taxation in cities, towns and villages to two cents on the assessed value would be defeated. It would indeed be purely illusory. If in fact personalty has been assessed in Transcona \"at its actual cash value,\" (s. 33), or on any lower basis, the \"uniformity\" provision of the statute is violated by the assessment of the appellant's land. The basis of assessment of realty must be the same as that of the assessment of personalty (s. 29).\nIt would require unmistakable language to authorize an assessment of any property at more than its value. Nothing in section 29 of the \"Assessment Act\" warrants attributing to the legislature an intention to do anything, so extraordinary, and the other statutory provisions referred to preclude such a view.\nMr. Chrysler admitted that there is evidence justifying an assessment of $40,000. Mr. Hull stated that he could not point to any evidence which would support a higher figure.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs throughout and the assessment reduced to $40,000.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Munson, Allan, Laird & Davis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hull, Sparling & Sparling.\n[1] 9 West.

The appellant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. On the day fixed for the trial, he moved to be allowed to elect for a speedy trial under the provisions of Part XVIII. of the Criminal Code, and the presiding judge, with the consent of the Crown prosecutor, granted the motion. The appellant was subsequently arraigned in the Court of Sessions of the Peace and found guilty.\nHeld (Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting), that the judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace had jurisdiction to try the offence.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side[1], affirming the judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, at Montreal.\nThe accused, appellant, was found guilty by the trial judge, but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the Court of Appeal.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions submitted on the reserved case stated by the trial judge for decision by the Court of King's Bench, are stated, as follows, by Mr. Justice Cross, in his reasons for judgment in the court appealed from.\n(See Q.R. 26 K.B., at pp. 331 and 332.)\n\"The accused Giroux appeals against a conviction of theft made against him by the judge of Sessions upon a speedy trial.\n\"He had not been committed for trial by a justice.

Komiensky[8]; The Queen v. Lawrence[9].\nN. K. Laflamme K.C. for the appellant\nJ. C. Walsh K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014An indictment for theft and receiving stolen goods was found by the grand jury of the District of Montreal in April, 1915, against the appellant. On that indictment, he was arraigned and filed his plea of not guilty. The trial was fixed for a subsequent day, when the appellant, before the trial commenced, moved for leave to make his option to be tried by the Quarter Sessions under the provisions of section XVIII. of the Criminal Code. The presiding judge with the consent of the Crown Prosecutor granted the motion and gave the leave asked for; and, on the same day\u2014May 17th, 1915\u2014the appellant entered into a recognizance before a judge of the Sessions \"to appear in person at the Court of the Sessions of the Peace on the 27th May then instant,\" to answer to the charge of theft for which he had been indicted.\nAfter much inexplicable delay the appellant was finally tried before the judge of the Sessions and found guilty of the offence with which he was charged.. At his request, two questions were reserved for the consideration of the Court of Appeal.\nOn the application of appellant's counsel, that court also examined into the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. In the result, all the questions were answered adversely to the pretensions of the appellant. Mr. Justice Carroll dissented from the answer of the majority to the first question, which was to this effect: Could the accused, Giroux, charged with the offence of larceny on an indictment preferred by the Crown Attorney, with the written consent of the judge presiding at the assizes, elect, in the circumstances which I have just detailed, to be tried before the Sessions of the Peace under Part XVIII. of the Criminal Code?\nIn the view which I take of the case, it will be unnecessary for me to deal with the other questions and upon which there is no dissent in the lower court.\nAs I have already said, the indictment found against the appellant was preferred under the provisions of section 873 of the Criminal Code. No information had been lodged with a magistrate, no preliminary investigation had been held and consequently there were no depositions and no commitment for trial, and it is in consequence argued on behalf of the appellant that the material necessary to enable him to exercise his right to elect under the provisions of ss. 826, 827 and 828 of the Code did not exist.\nIt is not necessary for me to express any opinion as to whether the appellant could as of right, in the circumstances of this case, exercise his right to elect; but I have no doubt whatever that the leave given by the trial judge on the application of the appellant with the consent of the Crown Prosecutor had for its effect to validate all the subsequent proceedings before the judge of the Sessions. I do not say that the consent of the appellant conferred jurisdiction on the judge of the Sessions but the latter had jurisdiction of the subject matter and in that respect was not dependent upon the appellant's consent. The consent is only important in this aspect of the case. It may be that by pleading to the indictment the appellant chose his forum and acquired the privilege to be tried by a jury. But by his application for leave to be tried by the judge of the Sessions he waived this privilege and selected another forum which he had a perfect right to do with the consent of the prosecuting officer.\nThe new forum had, as I have already said, complete jurisdiction to try the offence with which the appellant was charged and it is equally certain that he not only appeared voluntarily before the judge of the Sessions to answer the charge but at the trial he with the assistance of counsel cross-examined the Crown witnesses and examined witnesses on his own behalf. The only possible objection to the proceedings before the Sessions Court is that a bill of indictment had been already found against him at the Assizes for the same offence as that for which he was tried in the Court of Sessions and that indictment remains undisposed of.\nBut the trial on that indictment was suspended on appellant's own request, and his conviction before the judge of the Sessions and the sentence would be a complete bar to any further proceedings on the indictment. As Graham J. said in Re Walsh[10], at p. 19: \"The case of Reg. v. Burke[11], shews what becomes of the indictment.\" In my opinion the proper course would be to move to have it quashed.\nTo sum up. Both courts had jurisdiction to try the offence. Assuming that the prisoner had by his plea to the indictment selected his forum and acquired the right to be tried by a jury, it was open to him to waive that choice and he was also free to forego the privilege of a trial by a jury. Consent cannot confer jurisdiction but a privilege defeating jurisdiction may always be waived if the trial court has jurisdiction over the subject matter.\nI venture to say that to set aside the proceedings below would in the circumstances of this case amount to a travesty of justice. I have carefully read the cases referred to in the factum and at the argument and when considered with reference to the particular facts with which in each case the judges were dealing, I do not find that they give us much assistance.\nIn the Burke Case (2), the defendants had elected to be tried by the County Court Judge under the \"Speedy Trials Act\" and indictments were subsequently found against them at the assizes for the offences for which they had so elected to be tried. The question at issue was whether they could be deprived of their right to be tried by the County Court Judge and it was there decided that the right to elect to have a speedy trial was a statutory right of which the defendants could not be deprived if they were in a position to avail themselves of it.\nIn The King v. Sovereen[12], the prisoner argued that a person out on bail is entitled to elect to be tried by a judge without a jury after an indictment is returned founded on the facts disclosed by the depositions taken at the preliminary inquiry and it was held that he is not entitled as of right upon bill found and arraignment thereon to elect to be tried without a jury. The prisoner was in that case committed for trial by a magistrate and the indictment on which he was committed was preferred as in this case by the Crown Prosecutor with the written consent of the trial judge. It is only in this last respect that the cases are analogous.\nIt is not necessary to say more than this that I agree with the opinions expressed in The King v. Sovereen12 by Chief Justice Moss and Mr. Justice Magee. The prisoner in that case claimed to be entitled to make his election as of right and as Magee J. said, he had not put himself in a position to claim that right, not being in custody and not having given notice to the sheriff. The Chief Justice, with whom Garrow J.A. and Latchford J. concurred, said:\u2014\nI am unable to think that it was the intention to give an accused person the general right to elect to be tried without a jury.\nIn Re Walsh[13], it was held:\u2014\nA person sent up for trial for an indictable offence and against whom while out on bail a true bill is found is entitled on being taken into custody to elect for a trial without a jury. In this case, the appellant, with the consent of the Crown Prosecutor and the approval of the judge, waived his right to be tried by a jury at the Assizes and then voluntarily appeared before a court having jurisdiction over the offence with which he was charged. He was then put upon his trial for the offence for which he had been indicted; he was assisted by counsel, examined and cross-examined witnesses and now seeks after he has been found guilty to escape the consequences of his own free choice. I fail to understand how ss. 826 et seq. have any application to the facts of this case.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal must be dismissed.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The learned judge who presided at the March term of the King's Bench, Crown Side, for the District of Montreal, duly directed, pursuant to section 873 of the Criminal Code, an indictment for theft and receiving stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen to be presented to the grand jury against the appellant.\nThereupon the grand jury found a true bill upon which the appellant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the said indictment, on the 25th April, 1915, when the trial was duly fixed for the 17th May following.\nHe had never been prosecuted before any Justice of the Peace in respect of the said offence or committed by any such Justice of the Peace to stand his trial. The preferring of the indictment to and return of a true bill by the grand jury followed by appellant's arraignment, his plea thereto and appointment of a day for trial of that issue comprised all that took place.\nIn short there was not the slightest semblance of any such proceedings having been had as to lay the foundation for such a proceeding as contemplated, by the speedy trial provisions of the Criminal Code, to be necessary to give jurisdiction for the exercise of any of the rights, duties or powers furnished thereby.\nYet on the day fixed for his trial, when presumably everything was ready therefor, instead of its taking place he asked to be allowed to elect to be tried by a judge under the said speedy trial provisions. Without any jurisdiction to do so on the part of the presiding judge, or vestige of authority on the part of the Crown officer, each seems to have graciously assented to this novel proposition for the disposal of an indictment, found by the grand jury in a higher court, being transferred to a lower court, on the part of one who had (as expressed by the late Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele in regard to a man before him in the like plight), conclusively and exclusively elected to be tried in due course according to law by a jury.\nDoubtless this assent was inadvertently given without reference to the express terms of the Criminal Code providing for the manner of trial of any one indicted before and presented by a grand jury, as having been truly so indicted.\nIt is stated in appellant's factum that on the same day he went before Mr. Justice Bazin and made his option for a speedy trial in the Court of Special Sessions of the Peace.\nThe case before us, however, only shews that on the 17th May, 1915, the accused appeared before Adolphe Bazin, Esquire, judge of the Sessions of the Peace for Montreal, and entered with a surety into a recognizance to appear on the 27th May at the Court of General Sessions of the Peace in person to answer the indictment found against him for theft and, so continue from day to day until discharged.\nThe first speedy trial provisions were enacted in 1869, by 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 35, and confined to the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec and with many amendments later were extended to other provinces.\nThe purpose had in view was to enable those committed for trial to avoid being kept in suspense for many months awaiting the coming of a court with a jury, if they should choose to dispense with their right to a jury trial.\nThose innocent gladly availed themselves of such an opportunity. Those guilty of some trifling offence which might be adequately punished by a shorter term than they probably would serve, if unable to find bail, were equally glad to avail themselves of the privilege. And even those who could find bail were in very many cases likewise pleased to put an end, by so electing, to the painful suspense they were enduring;\nSuch legislation furnished also a public gain, in saving the time of jurors, both grand and petit at Assizes or Sessions.\nIn this peculiar case it is hard to find what good cause was to be served by applying the speedy trial provisions of the Act, for it was not until the 14th of the month of January following that the appellant was actually put upon his trial and pleaded again \"not guilty,\" before the district judge, when some witnesses were examined, and the case was adjourned till the 20th Jan., when it was again adjourned till the next day, only to be adjourned again till the 1st February, and only after three more adjournments ended by the judge finding him guilty.\nThereupon there was the special case reserved to determine whether the judge ever had jurisdiction to take such proceedings.\nThe Act itself and the many amendments to it gave rise in course of time to many cases, and reserved cases, relative to the jurisdiction of the judge in the given circumstances of each such case. Hence there were decisions of the higher courts or judges thereof in a great variety of circumstances in the Provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and Nova Scotia.\nThese decisions would not, of course, bind us if an obvious misconception of the law had occurred in them all.\nSo far from there being diversity of opinion there has been developed a uniformity of opinion relative to the main features of the statute founding jurisdiction.\nIn not a single instance did it occur, till this case, where an indictment of a grand jury duly found and pleaded to was, notwithstanding the express provisions by the procedure sections of the Criminal Code, attempted to be transferred to another and lower court for trial.\nIn effect that is what was attempted here in rather an off-hand fashion.\nThe case of Reg. v. Burke[14], shews how when the accused had been improperly, in violation of his right to elect, indicted and induced to plead to the indictment, he could free himself from such a predicament.\nAssuming the denial of legal right as was assumed in that case, the proper course was adopted of quashing the indictment. Then the accused was free to exercise his right.\nNo such phase is presented in this case. The indictment and plea thereto still stands ready for trial as it was two years or more ago.\nOf the many cases I have referred to, presenting the true situation of accused in such circumstances, I would refer to the opinion of the late Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele in the case of The King v. Wener[15], wherein at page 413 he spoke as follows:\u2014\nThe Criminal Code does not prescribe that an accused can elect to be tried without a jury when, without a preliminary enquiry or without a committal or an admission to bail, and subsequent custody for trial, a bill of indictment has been preferred by the Attorney-General or by any one by his direction, or with the written consent of a judge of a court of criminal jurisdiction, or by order of such court, and thus remove the prosecution from the forum to which it properly belongs to another to which jurisdiction has not in such case been given by law. In the absence of any statutory provisions or statutory authority an accused has no right in such a case to demand and obtain a trial in any other court than the one in which the indictment was found, and which has jurisdiction over the case, and is seized with it\nAnd I would also refer to the opinion of the late Sir Charles Moss, Chief Justice of Ontario, in the case of The King v. Sovereen[16], before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, so late as 1912, after all the existing amendments had been made to the speedy trial provisions of the Criminal Code. At p. 105 he spoke as follows:\u2014\nSpeaking for myself, and with the utmost respect for those who have indicated or expressed a different view, I think that where, as here, a person committed for trial, and whether in custody or upon bail, has not, before a bill of indictment has been found against him by a grand jury, taken the steps necessary to enable him to elect to be tried by a judge without a jury, he is not, upon bill found and arraignment thereon, entitled as of right to ask to be allowed to elect to be tried without a jury. If that is not the effect of the legislation, it places it in the power of the accused not merely to postpone his trial, but to render futile all that has been done by the grand jury, and necessitate a compliance with all the forms prescribed by section 827 of the Code, including the preparation and preferring by the prosecuting officer of a charge in accordance with the directions given in sec. 827.\nI am unable to think that it was the intention to give an accused person the general right to elect to be tried without a jury. On the contrary, I think that the intention was to give it only in cases in which the exercise of such an election would or might effect a speedy trial of an accused person, and thereby save the delay which waiting for a trial by jury might involve.\nI agree with these opinions. In either case there was some basis for the accused to have elected had he chosen to do so before plea.\nIn the case before us there never was the semblance of any such basis. I conclude therefore that there was no jurisdiction in the district judge to have accepted any such so called election or to try the accused under such circumstances and the appeal should be allowed accordingly.\nThere being no jurisdiction the second point reserved falls to the ground and we have no right to answer the question propounded upon the evidence.\nDuff J. (dissenting) .\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Idington.\nAnglin J.\u2014Upon a bill preferred by Crown counsel with the consent of the presiding judge under s. 873 (1) of the Criminal Code, the grand jury, at a sittings of the Court of King's Bench (Crown Side), held in Montreal, presented an indictment charging the defendant with theft\u2014an offence cognizable by the Court of the Sessions of the Peace. Upon arraignment the defendant pleaded \"not guilty,\" and a subsequent date for his trial was thereupon fixed. He was meantime released on bail on the date fixed he surrendered himself for trial and then demanded that he be allowed to elect to be tried under Part XVIII. of the Code by a judge of the Sessions of the Peace. Counsel for the Crown consented and an order was made granting the demand. He accordingly appeared on the same day before Bazin J. and made his formal election for speedy trial. He was afterwards tried and convicted by Choquet J., presiding at a special sittings of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace. He thereupon sought, and in view of the decisions in The King v. Sovereen[17], and some other cases, quite properly was accorded a reserved case for the decision of the Court of King's Bench upon the question (submitted in the form of two questions), whether, under the circumstances stated, his election for trial under Part XVIII. of the Code was valid and sufficient to give the judge of the Court of Sessions jurisdiction to try him. I deal with the question so reserved, to which, as I understand it, the special jurisdiction conferred on this court by section 1024 of the Criminal Code is restricted.\nUnder section 825 of the Code, every person committed for trial for an offence within the jurisdiction of the general or Quarter Sessions of the Peace may, with his consent, be tried under Part XVIII. A person in custody awaiting trial, however he may so find himself, is under s.s. 4 to \"be deemed to be committed for trial within the meaning of the section.\" The defendant, in my opinion, was \"in custody awaiting trial\" on the charge, when he had surrendered himself for trial on the appointed date. Re Walsh[18]; The King v. Thompson[19]. I read \"the charge\" as meaning the charge mentioned in s.s. (1), i.e., a charge cognizable by the Court of Sessions. The interests of justice are protected, as far as Parliament considered such protection necessary, by the provision of s.s. 5 that, where the offence charged is punishable with imprisonment exceeding a period of five years, the Attorney-General may require a trial by jury.\nI see nothing in any provision of the Code, as it now stands, which precludes an election for trial under Part XVIII. by an accused under indictment, no matter how or when presented, if he comes within the comprehensive terms of section 825. The difficulty which formerly existed owing to the supposed impossibility of complying with section 827 in the absence of depositions taken upon a magistrate's preliminary investigation in cases where such investigation had been waived and the accused had consented to be committed for trial without it, was overcome by the insertion of the words \"if any\" in s. 827 by 8 & 9 Ed. VII., c. 9, s. 2. Any similar difficulty in cases of indictments, preferred under the section now numbered 873 was thus likewise removed.\nIt is contended that the special provision made by s. 828 for re-election after indictment by a person who had already elected for trial by jury imports an intention to preclude the right of election in other cases after indictment. But the raison d'\u00eatre of this provision was not to provide for the case of an indictment having been found, but to confer or make clear the right to a second election. . Its terms, however, pointedly indicate that the presentment of an indictment was not regarded by Parliament as a bar to the right of election. No good reason can be suggested why, if the man who has already elected for a jury trial should be allowed to re-elect after indictment and up to the moment when his actual trial begins, the man who has never elected should be debarred from doing so by the presentment of an indictment. As Mr. Justice (afterwards Chief Justice) Graham said in Re Walsh[20]:\u2014\nWhen Parliament did draw the line of exercising the option as it does in sec. 828, sub-sec. 2 (the re-election provision), it provided that he (the accused) may exercise \"the election at any time before such trial (i.e., before a jury) has commenced.\"\nI agree with the views expressed upon this point by the learned judges of the Nova Scotia Appellate Court in Re Walsh20 and by Howell C.J.A. in The King v. Thompson[21].\nBut it may be said that after plea to the indictment, at all events, the right of election is irrevocably gone for two reasons: that the plea is an election of forum; and that upon arraignment the trial has already commenced. Neither reason in my opinion is sound.\nAssuming that the plea should be regarded as an election of and submission to the forum of the Court of King's Bench and a jury trial, it was the first and only election made by the accused and by s. 828 express provision is made for a re-election by a prisoner who has elected to be tried by jury \"at any time before such trial has commenced.\" That the arraignment is not part of the trial\u2014that the trial only begins after plea\u2014appears from the heading \"Arraignment and Trial\" (s. 940) in the Code itself and is established by many authorities collected in the judgment of Graham. E.J. in Re Walsh20, at p. 17. Parliament has therefore in explicit terms provided for an election after plea, since plea precedes the commencement of the trial. The reasoning of Mr. Justice Graham and Mr. Justice Ritchie in support of the right of election after indictment seems to me conclusive in a case such as that before us. If Parliament, which, in enacting s. 828, had election after indictment brought expressly to its attention, did not mean that that right should exist where an indictment is preferred under s. 873, notwithstanding the comprehensive terms in which secs. 825 and 828 are couched, I think it certainly would have said so by an explicit exception. In the case of re-election, whatever the offence and however punishable, by the proviso to sec. 828 after indictment the consent in writing of the prosecuting officer acting under s.s. 2 of s. 826 is required, and in any case either the judge or the prosecuting officer may prevent effect being given to a second election (s.s. 3). The requisite consent of the prosecuting officer was given here.\nWith great respect for the learned judges who hold the contrary view, in my opinion, the fact that the indictment under which the accused was awaiting trial had been preferred under s. 873 (1) of the Code, did not prevent his exercising the right of election either under s. 825 or s. 828 and the judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace therefore had jurisdiction to try him.\nThe tendency of the courts in the earlier cases to place a narrow construction upon the \"Speedy Trials\" provisions of the Criminal Code has been adverted to in the Thomson Case[22] and Walsh Case[23]. It should probably be attributed to the view strongly held by many, lawyers as well as laymen, that trial by jury, especially in criminal cases, should be preserved intact. But Parliament by one amendment after another has overcome the several restrictions that judges have from time to time sought to place upon the right to elect for trial before a judge of the Court of Sessions, thus evincing its policy and determination that this mode of trial shall, as far as possible, be available within the limits and subject to the safeguards which it has prescribed, and its desire that the sections of the Code providing for it should receive a liberal rather than a narrow construction.\nUpon another question, as to the sufficiency of the evidence, which the Court of King's Bench allowed the defendant to raise, there was no dissent in that court and there is therefore no right to appeal here.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] Q.R. 26 K.B. 323.\n[2] 6 Can.

German (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe City of Ottawa (Defendant) Respondent.\n1917: November 7, 28.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Municipal corporation\u2014\u201cGross negligence\u201d\u2014Ice and snow\u2014Personal injuries\u2014Weather conditions\u2014\u201cMunicipal Institutions Act,\u201d R.S.O. (1914), c. 192, s. 460(3).\nSec. 460(3) of the \u201cOntario Municipal Institutions Act\u201d provides that \u201cexcept in cases of gross negligence a municipality shall not be liable for injury caused by ice or snow upon a sidewalk.\u201d The City of Ottawa undertakes the work of removing snow from the sidewalks and keeping them safe for pedestrians.\nHeld, that failure to sand or harrow a sidewalk before 9 a.m. of February 2nd, when the conditions calling for it only arose on that morning, if negligence at all, is not \u201cgross negligence,\u201d and the city is not liable for personal injury caused at that hour by ice on the sidewalk especially if it was not a place of special danger nor on a street of heavy traffic and did not call for immediate attention.\nHeld, also, that reducing the working staff on the day of the accident was probably not \u201cgross negligence\u201d in the absence of evidence that such reduction caused the injury.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that after a thaw for some days the temperature fell on the afternoon of the day preceding the accident and the city officials should have realized that the sidewalks would be dangerous on the following morning. It was, therefore, \u201cgross negligence\u201d to reduce the working staff and to fail to do work on the sidewalk where the accident occurred.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division (39 Ont. L.R. 176) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nBelcourt K.C. for the appellant. \u201cGross Negligence\u201d has been defined by this court to be \u201cvery great negligence:\u201d City of Kingston v. Drennan[2].\nThe defendants in allowing the dangerous condition of the sidewalk, where the plaintiff was injured, to remain until 9 a.m., without sand or harrowing, was very great negligence. See Huth v. City of Windsor[3]; Cranston v. Town of Oakville[4].\nThe findings of fact by the trial judge should be maintained: Johnston v. O\u2019Neill[5].\nProctor for the respondent, cited Ince v. City of Toronto[6]; Bleakley v. Corporation of Prescott[7]; Lynn v. City of Hamilton[8], and Palmer v. City of Toronto[9].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Idington.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014The learned trial judge gave effect to the claim of the plaintiff by finding that the respondent had been grossly negligent of its duty in relation to the ice on the sidewalk which caused the appellant to fall and thereby suffer serious injury. The Court of Appeal reversed that decision and much was made of the opinion judgments of the Chief Justice in appeal and of Mr. Justice Lennox on the part of the court, relative to the question of what constitutes gross negligence within the meaning of the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d section 460, sub-section 3.\nChief Justice Meredith, in attempting to define what might be claimed as and to define \u201cgross negligence,\u201d said:\u2014\nIf the same condition of the sidewalk; or a like condition, as that which existed when the respondent fell upon it had continued for a considerable number of days, negligence, and even gross negligence, would have been proved if that condition could practicably have been prevented.\nI cannot agree with this definition, and to the implications therein when applied to streets in a thickly populated part of a city like Ottawa.\nIn every case in which the term \u201cgross negligence\u201d has to be considered, regard must be had to all surrounding circumstances in which the city or municipality is placed in relation to the work in question and the reasonable requirements for prompt and efficient service in relation to the maintenance thereof in good repair. What might be gross negligence in a densely populated part of a city like Ottawa might not be gross negligence, or perhaps negligence at all, in a rural municipality possessed of a highway over which there might not be a traveller for days at a time.\nParties concerned in litigation dependent upon the section in question might be well advised on either side to be ready to present more direct evidence of the surrounding facts and circumstances than are made clearly to appear in this case. What exists of common knowledge available to a judge and what inferences may be drawn from the evidence that was given I think must be held sufficient in this case to enable us to pass upon the judgment in question.\nAt all events I think the learned trial judge must be presumed to have been in quite as good a position to determine the crucial fact of whether there was \u201cgross negligence\u201d or not as any appellate court. We have some evidence as to the extent of Ottawa and some general knowledge of the size and general character of the city, and I think we may also be able to use our stock of common knowledge relative to the vicissitudes of climatic conditions in Ottawa.\nAlong with that we have evidence directly bearing upon the conditions existent in what is sometimes referred to in Canada as a January thaw.\nIt is explained that on Monday there was rain and thaw as there had been for five or six days preceding it. On Tuesday there seemed to come a change which any rational human being fit to appreciate the fact and to be in the service of the city in charge of a large part of its streets ought to have recognized immediately a freezing temperature which in all human probability, following the rain of Monday and preceding days, would render the sidewalks in Ottawa on Wednesday morning what the witnesses have referred to as a \u201cglare of ice.\u201d\nThe evidence of the foreman and other witnesses seems to put beyond doubt the facts that whilst there nine men engaged on Monday and a corresponding team force for the district in which the sidewalk in question exists, there were assigned to the duty there to be done on the Wednesday on which the accident took place only five men and little, if any, team force.\nThen it is to be observed that it is conclusively proven that it was raining very much on Monday, some of the respondent\u2019s witnesses going so far as to say that it had been raining all day on Monday, and others saying twenty-four hours rain on Monday, and others again that the sidewalks in some places were flooded. I incline to think some of the expressions relative to the extent of the amount of rain and thaw on Monday were possibly exaggerated, yet I cannot get rid of the impression that it was one of those days when the sanding process would result in little good by reason of the rain and thaw washing it away. Whether washed away or not, certainly the conditions of Monday and the preceding days were clearly likely to prepare for the condition of things that did happen, of a freezing up on Tuesday afternoon and night which demanded, instead of a relaxing of effort and reduction of the staff of men to half of those engaged on Monday; that there should have been an effort to increase them, or at all events keep the force going.\nA perusal of the entire evidence in the case leaves my mind much puzzled with what the foreman in charge of the sidewalk in question really was about.\nThe assistant city engineer tells of the force over the city having been doubled for these three days including Wednesday.\nThe city\u2019s street superintendent gives the figures for the entire city shewing the employment of fifty-three men on Monday and a corresponding increase in team force, that on Tuesday there were fifty-one men and sixteen horses and sleighs, and that on Wednesday there were only forty-five men and seventeen horses and sleighs.\nIt would be obvious from the consideration of these figures that the reduction of man force over the entire city would seem to have come almost entirely out of the force employed for St. George\u2019s Ward. Why there should be this remarkable falling off under the circumstances when it did not seem to occur to other superintendents to do anything like that (but on the contrary practically to maintain their whole force) is not explained and is inexplicable upon any other ground than that there was gross negligence on the part of those concerned in failing to appreciate the conditions they had to contend with on Wednesday morning.\nThe evidence is most unsatisfactory as to what they were doing on Wednesday and does not in any manner explain away the evidence of the appellant and Mr. Burns as to the condition of the street they had to travel on,\nIt is made clear by Mr. Burns that from the moment he stepped out of his house and took a survey of the street and the sidewalk, that he decided the centre of the road was the safest place to go on account of the ice on the sidewalk. I think evidence of that kind is of unquestionable force and worth a great many guesses on the part of civic employees as to what they thought they possibly did on that day, or some other day, or what they must have happened to be doing by reason of something else having happened.\nJust by way of illustration of how that part of the city was being attended to I may refer to the evidence of Mr. Chapleau who was called for the defence. He tells us that he had phoned to the city hall to have some water removed from the street in order that he might get out of his house by other means than by laying down a plank to travel upon. His phoning brought no response in the way of service until the next day.\nThat incident, to my mind, illustrates what were the probable conditions permeating the force at the time in question. But not only that day but for eight years previously had Mr. Chapleau had occasion to make the like call, and yet in face of such experiences spread out upon the record in this case, counsel for the city sees fit to make it a ground of complaint against the appellant that neither he nor Mr. Burns had called the attention of the city authorities to the state of the sidewalk.\nPerhaps this incident and Mr. Chapleau\u2019s experience illustrate better than anything else in the case how wretchedly in some parts of the city the business of taking charge of the sidewalks has been managed. And I think it is from incidents like that that inferences may be drawn as to the general condition of the service.\nIf that fairly illustrates the nature of the service that was being given, then so much more reason for finding that there was gross negligence. We are furnished by witnesses for the defence with evidence of the kind of energy that was expected to be applied when sanding the sidewalk would be of any avail. They would seem to have been required to get up at two o\u2019clock in the morning and be on duty at five o\u2019clock, as they swear they were on Sunday night and Monday morning.\nThe changed condition on Tuesday afternoon and night demanded something akin to the like energy on Wednesday morning if the people were to be permitted to use the sidewalks with safety.\nNo doubt many thousands have to tread the streets of Ottawa between six and seven o\u2019clock in the morning, and so on at various times till the hour when men like the plaintiff and the civil service part of the population proceed to work. Yet we are told, and it is conclusively established, I think, that there was no sanding done upon the sidewalk in question before nine o\u2019clock on the day of the accident, and I doubt if there ever was that day. If that does not constitute \u201cgross negligence\u201d under such circumstances what would? It certainly would not have been \u201cgross negligence\u201d for the pathmaster in a country district to have delayed that long, but for a city such as Ottawa to be told that it is permitted by statute to neglect a service so obviously needed for the safety and comfort of those using its streets is, I most respectfully submit, to encourage that neglect of duty, only too obviously often apparent on the part of municipal authorities in our Canadian towns and cities.\nAgain, with great respect, I submit that Mr. Justice Lennox was under a misapprehension of fact when he speaks of what was done as follows:\u2014\nIt is shewn that a double force was employed, that the fires were lighted at two o\u2019clock and the men and teams were at work on the streets by four o\u2019clock on Monday morning and kept regularly on at work until the time of and after the accident, doing all that they could do, and as to ordinary level streets doing more, I venture to think, than the statute demands.\nIt was admitted in argument as already stated that this force which was applied on Monday was cut down on Wednesday morning to consist of five men instead of nine. I fear there has been a misapprehension in the court below of the actual facts as they appear when properly analyzed, and hence the reversal of the learned trial judge\u2019s judgment.\nThe conditions on Wednesday, I repeat, demanded more men, more sand and more energy. The battle on that morning was not the hopeless task that the men were sent to face on Monday, if the description of things that some give is correct, but it was a condition of things that required prompt energetic action with sand or harrowing or whatever might produce the best result most speedily, and enable the citizens to travel the streets at the time of day they needed them.\nI think the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that of the trial judge be restored with costs throughout. DUFF J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Seriously injured by falling on an icy sidewalk on the south side of Besserer Street, east of Charlotte Street, in the City of Ottawa, \u201ca trifle after 9 o\u2019clock\u201d on the morning of Wednesday the 2nd of February, 1916, the plaintiff recovered judgment against the municipal corporation for $2,250 damages after a trial before Mr. Justice Britton. That judgment was unanimously reversed, and the action dismissed by the Second Appellate Division. The plaintiff now appeals to this court. Our right and our duty to review the evidence, to form our own conclusions upon it, and to reverse the judgment of the provincial appellate court, if satisfied that upon the whole case the respondent should be held liable, is undoubted. But it must clearly appear that the judgment of the Appellate Division was erroneous before we can reverse it. Demers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co.[10]\nIn Ottawa the municipal corporation does not, as is the case in many other Ontario cities, impose upon property owners the duty of dealing with snow and ice so that the sidewalks on which their property fronts shall be kept passable and reasonably safe for pedestrians. It undertakes to perform that work itself. The system adopted is to remove the snow by horse\u2011drawn plows and to deal with danger from slippery surfaces by harrowing them or sanding them. As the learned trial judge said:\nThe city has a difficult and expensive proposition, involving the expenditure of large sums of money to keep miles of streets in a reasonably safe condition.\nAs said in the Appellate Division by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, a judge of many years\u2019 experience: It was well proved and not denied that the appellants\u2019 methods and means for the performance of this duty were good. I should have no hesitation in saying, more than such as are ordinarily provided, and during this exceptional week, ending on the day of the accident, the usual road-gang had been doubled, and according to the testimony of those connected with it, testimony that is not questioned by other testimony or by any circumstances, there had been unusual vigilance and care during that trying weather.\nAs put by Mr. Justice Lennox:\nIt is not pretended that the appellants did not make reasonable and careful preparation in advance to meet winter conditions, or that their system was improper or inadequate. This was not a sidewalk of exceptional character nor was it a place of peculiar hazard. It was like other miles and miles of streets in Ottawa, a level, ordinary walk.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s complaint is not that the system was defective, but that there was gross negligence on the part of civic employees, as put by the learned trial judge:\nin not doing what it was intended should be done.\nThat at the time of the unfortunate occurrence the sidewalk was in an extremely dangerous condition is not controverted. Whether the failure of the city employees to prevent that condition arising or to remove it before 9 a.m. on Wednesday the 2nd of February amounted to \u201cgross negligence\u201d (defined by this court as \u201cvery great negligence\u201d; Kingston v. Drennan[11]); which is the statutory condition of the defendants\u2019 liability (R.S.O. ch. 192, sec. 460 (3)), is, therefore, the vital question involved in this appeal. Its solution must depend upon the notice of the existence of the dangerous condition which the city authorities actually had, or which should be imputed to them, and their opportunity of remedying it. It is obvious that the state of the weather immediately prior to the accident, and the relative situation of the place where it occurred must be taken into account in determining whether there was such a failure to take advantage of reasonable opportunity to prevent or remove the admitted danger, as amounted to gross negligence.\nThere is no direct evidence that the city\u2019s servants had any actual or specific notice of the existence of the danger at the locus of the accident. But it would be absurd to suggest that they should not have realized at least the probability, if not the certainty, of its existence from early on Wednesday morning. Having regard, however, to the preceding weather conditions, it is also practically certain that similar danger must have existed at a great number of other places upon the five hundred miles of sidewalks in the city\u2014of which some forty or fifty miles were in St. George\u2019s Ward\u2014many of them carrying much heavier traffic and therefore more urgently demanding attention than the part of Besserer Street in question, near the eastern limit of the city, upon which traffic is comparatively light. As stated, there is nothing in the record to suggest that this place was one of special hazard which called for preferential care or treatment. In view of these facts and assuming the adequacy of the city\u2019s system, which is not attacked, if the duty to remove the danger at the point in question arose only on the Wednesday, I should not be prepared to hold that failure to fufil it before 9 o\u2019clock in the morning was such gross negligence as entailed liability to the plaintiff. As put by the ward street foreman, Hackland:\nSt. George\u2019s Ward has a lot of hills and we have to sand them oftener than we sand the level streets. * * * We were looking for dangerous spots and probably had not reached that spot,\ni.e., where the plaintiff fell.\nI have not overlooked the fact that the nine men who had been employed on Monday and Tuesday were reduced to five on Wednesday morning. This may have been a mistake. But there is no evidence that if the services of the nine had been retained the place in question would or should have been reached by the sanding men before 9 o\u2019clock on Wednesday morning. I rather think it would not, as places where there is heavy traffic and hills where danger is to be expected demanded attention first. The reduction of the staff, if negligence at all, has not been shewn to have caused the accident, and I think that in any case it probably could not be designated \u201cgross negligence,\u201d If, therefore, there was not gross negligence in the failure to sand or harrow the spot in question if the condition requiring it only arose on the Wednesday morning, it becomes material to consider the evidence of the conditions which prevailed on the preceding days, and especially on the Tuesday, in order to determine whether sanding or harrowing should have been done on that day.\nThe plaintiff himself says that for six days before he was injured there had been rain on and off, and his witness Burns says:\nIt was raining for three or four days around that period * * * a very heavy downpour of rain.\nAlthough the plaintiff and Burns both stated that there had been no attempt to sand the sidewalks on Besserer Street east of Charlotte Street for six or seven days before the accident, I am satisfied that they were mistaken. The positive and clear testimony of Lewis and Sauv\u00e9 convinces me that they sanded these sidewalks on Monday the 31st of January. The evidence establishes that it rained heavily on that day, and it is quite possible that the sand had been washed away or, more likely still, that it had sunk to the bottom of the water lying on the sidewalks and had thus dis- appeared before the plaintiff and Mr. Burns, who presumably went down town early in the morning, returned later in the day\u2014possibly after dark in the afternoon or evening\u2014or that it escaped their attention for some other reason. I am equally satisfied that the sanding done on Monday, however efficient at the time, proved wholly ineffectual to prevent the condition of glare ice which undoubtedly existed on Wednesday morning. No doubt because he realized that if the duty to sand or to harrow arose only on the morning of the accident, it would be almost impossible to maintain that there had been any negligence on the part of the civic employees\u2014still less gross negligence\u2014Mr. Belcourt strenuously contended that sanding should have been done on Tuesday, and, in order to establish this, he insisted that on that day there was frost and that, at all events in the afternoon, the sidewalks were frozen up. The plaintiff\u2019s own statement is that it began to get colder on Monday or Tuesday. The great weight of evidence, however, is that the thaw continued on Tuesday. The official weather record from 8 p.m. Monday to 8 p.m. Tuesday is:\u2014Night, overcast and mild; Day, cloudy, clearing, wind and a little colder\u2014Temperature, maximum, 41\u00b0: minimum, 26\u00b0 Fahrenheit. From 8 p.m. Tuesday to 8 p.m. Wednesday:\u2014Temperature, maximum, 26\u00b0, minimum, 12\u00b0; and Thursday, Temperature, zero. This record of a steadily falling thermometer makes it clear that the frost began some time before 8 p.m. on Tuesday and warrants the inference, in my opinion, that it began about nightfall This conclusion is borne out by the statement of the plaintiffs witness, Burns, that \u201cit turned cold on Tuesday night.\u201d The foreman, Hackland, says, \u201cit was tightening up a little that day.\u201d During Tuesday his men were en- gaged in opening gully grates, digging trenches to let water off the sidewalks, picking bad spots and doing some sanding.\nMr. S.J. Chapleau, who resides on the north side of Besserer Street, about opposite where the plaintiff fell, tells us that there was \u201ca lot of water\u201d on the sidewalk opposite his house, and that on the Wednesday morning he had to procure a plank in order to cross this water when leaving his house. It was let off by a trench dug later on that day by city workmen in compliance with a request made by Mr. Chapleau at noon on the previous day.\nWhile there is no evidence that it rained on Tuesday, it would seem not improbable that there was water on the sidewalks so that sanding or harrowing them would have been futile. The sand would have sunk to the bottom of the water and the grooves made by harrowing would have been filled up. As put by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas:\nThere is no evidence that sanding on Monday or on Tuesday would have prevented the condition existing at the time of the accident. So too, as to harrowing, the marks would be washed out or filled in by the rain or melted snow and ice each day and frozen over each night, * * * What (sand) was not washed off would have sunk in the water and be useless in the morning, if put there even the day before.\nReferring to the sanding done on the Monday, the learned trial judge said:\nIt may well be that water flowing from the south or following a rain froze over the sand so that none was in sight, and was not then of any use to render the walk more safe for persons walking on the street.\nThere is nothing to shew that sanding done on the Tuesday would not have been equally ineffectual. In my opinion the evidence rather indicates that it would.\nMaking due allowance for the exceptional weather conditions with which the civic employees had to contend, I am not convinced that the conclusion of the Appellate Division, that it was not established that the dangerous condition of the place where the plaintiff fell was attributable to gross negligence on the part of the defendants\u2019 servants, is so clearly erroneous that we should reverse it. On the contrary, an independent study of the evidence has led me to the same conclusion.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: German & Morwood.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Frank B.

North Eastern Railway Co[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is the case of a passenger on appellants\u2019 railway who, when approaching his destination, left the seat he occupied in the car and proceeding to the end platform either stepped off or fell off the train and was killed. The train was at the time running at a speed of about twenty miles an hour. The respondent is the widow, who was present at the accident with her children, and by her action she claims damages for her husband\u2019s death which, she says, was caused by the negligence of appellants\u2019 servant, the conductor of the train. The particular acts of negligence set forth in the statement of claim are: (a) the conductor indicated to the deceased that he had reached his station and could safely alight and did in fact invite the deceased to alight when he could not do so, and (b) the conductor should have prevented the deceased from going upon the platform while the train was in motion and he should have warned the deceased and neglected to do so.\nThe obligation of the company was without delay and with due care and diligence to carry the passenger to his destination. Sec. 284 (c) \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C. [1906] ch. 37. The fact of the casualty once established, it was the duty of the company to give an explanation of the accident consistent with performance on their part of their statutory obligation to safeguard their passengers with all practicable care and skill. The passenger, on his part, was obliged to use reasonable care.\nThe negligence found by the jury consisted in\nthe conductor not remaining at the door of the car until the train stopped\nand they also negatived all negligence on the part of the deceased.\nThe theory of the respondent at the argument here was that the conductor so conducted himself as to lead to the deceased getting off the train at the time he did; and the reply on behalf of the appellant was that, accepting the story told by the respondent, the accident was attributable directly to the negligence of the deceased and that the conductor was fairly entitled to assume that prim\u00e2 facie the deceased would conduct himself with ordinary prudence and discretion.\nIt is somewhat difficult to connect the negligence found by the jury with either of the two causes of the accident alleged in the statement of claim. But the verdict must be reasonably construed; and I think that, read in the light of the pleadings, the evidence and the judge\u2019s charge, it means that the jury were of the opinion that it was the duty of the conductor, having notified the deceased that he was approaching his destination, to be careful to prevent him from going on to the platform, which was a dangerous place when the trap covering the steps which the deceased would use to alight from the car had been removed.\nIf I could agree with Ferguson J.A. who said:\nthe deceased may have been misled by the conductor\u2019s action into the belief that the train was at its destination,\nI would have less difficulty in accepting the verdict, because I assume the learned judge means that the conductor gave deceased the impression that the train had stopped and he could alight with safety. But I can find nothing in the evidence to justify that inference. To call out the name of a station, is merely an intimation that the train is approaching that station, and the speed at which the train was moving, which must have been apparent to any one exercising the slightest care, was in itself sufficient to destroy any impression that the train had reached the station and come to a standstill, and then only would the deceased be justified in attempting to leave the train. Further, the conductor was not under any obligation to assume that the passenger would be so void of common sense and prudence as to endanger his own safety as the deceased certainly did. According to the story of the respondent, the Conductor was standing on the platform when the deceased passed by him to go down the steps with two bundles, one in each hand. The car was then going at a speed of twenty miles an hour and swaying from side to side under the pressure of the brakes, and it is said that the conductor in allowing the deceased to pass on down the steps did not exercise that vigilance and care for the safe conveyance of the company\u2019s passenger which, in the circumstances, the statute imposed upon him and that he should have stopped him at the door. But the conductor, as I have already said, might fairly assume that the passenger would act with ordinary prudence and discretion, and it was almost impossible for any one to imagine that a sane man with any regard for his own safety would have gone down the car steps having both hands fully occupied with the bundles he was carrying.\nOf course the evidence, as in all similar cases, is conflicting. But the jury, who were absolute masters of their own determination in that respect, chose to believe the story of the widow and her children, and I have accepted their conclusion although I would have felt disposed to believe the version of the facts given by the conductor as more consistent with all the other admitted circumstances. The respondent said that when the deceased came on board he asked the conductor to let him know when they reached Dunbarton, his station\u2014which was only a flag station; but there is no evidence, as was assumed below, that he placed himself in the special care of the conductor. The latter gave the engine-driver the proper signal to stop at that station and subsequently called out: \u201cDunbarton is the next stop.\u201d Later on he came up to the deceased and touching him on the shoulder said: \u201cDunbarton is the next stop.\u201d\nThis cannot, in my opinion, be construed as an invitation to alight; at most it was an intimation to the passenger that he should prepare to get off. In a very few moments after, the deceased followed by his family moved towards the door of the car and there, according to the story of the respondent, stood the conductor on the platform. He had previously removed the trap in the platform floor which covered the steps leading off the car. It is a fair inference that the deceased\u2014as I have already said\u2014accepted this as some evidence that he might alight in safety. But was he justified in either attempting to alight or placing himself in a position of danger when the car was moving at a speed of twenty miles an hour and swaying backward and forward, as I have already described? To hold that it was the duty of the conductor to foresee that the passenger would be so imprudent and reckless as to attempt to alight from the car in such conditions is to impose a burden on railway officials greater than the law requires, and that is what the verdict means when the jurors say that the conductor should have prevented the deceased from coming out of the car, i.e., should have treated him like an irrational being.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs if the company deems it advisable, in the circumstances of this case, to collect them.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014On the night of November 13, 1915, the deceased, William Mayne, respondent\u2019s husband, a passenger travelling on a train of the appellants with his wife and seven children, one of which was a baby in arms, came to his death by stepping off the car while it was still in motion and before it had reached the station where he was to get off.\nThe contention on the part of the plaintiff respondent was that the conductor having been informed by the deceased of the station Dunbarton, at which he desired to get off, had opened up the vestibule, had informed the deceased that, \u201cthis is Dunbarton where you get off\u201d and had generally by his conduct actively created in the mind of the deceased the belief that the train had reached Dunbarton and that he and his family could safely alight, when as a fact the train was still moving at a rapid speed and had not then reached Dunbarton station.\nThe appellant contended that upon the evidence and upon the jury\u2019s findings there was not in law or in fact an invitation for the deceased to alight when he did, and that all that took place only amounted to an intimation by the conductor to the deceased that the next station was his station and an invitation to alight when the train stopped. They further contended that the deceased so regarded it as was clear from the evidence, because when the conductor told the deceased \u201cthis is Dunbarton, this is where you get off\u201d the children immediately made a move in anticipation of getting off, and the deceased told them to resume their seats, which they did until they were told to come along.\nThough I do not attach very much importance to this latter contention, I think it only fair that the whole evidence on the point should be considered, in which case it would seem that a few moments after telling the children \u201cnot to move till the train stopped\u201d he said to them \u201call right now come on\u201d or \u201cnow come on\u201d shewing that he believed that the train had then stopped.\nThe conductor did not immediately leave these passengers the moment he told the deceased \u201cthis is Dunbarton where you get off,\u201d but remained standing for some moments in the passageway three or four seats down and \u201clooking at some people or something on the south side of the car.\u201d It was when the conductor, after so waiting in the aisle, started for the door that the deceased gave the children the order \u201call right, now come on,\u201d and the inference I draw from the evidence on this point is that the deceased inferred the conductor was waiting for the stoppage of the train, and when he started for the door the deceased assumed he did so because, as he thought, the train had either stopped or was about stopping. I do not think, however, this incident is a controlling one upon the real issue between the parties, but the jury were entitled to believe the plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the point of the conductor having waited in the aisle or gangway for some time after giving notice to the deceased as before mentioned, in preference to that of the conductor, and it explains the other evidence as to the deceased and his family closely following the conductor along the aisle or passageway out into the vestibule.\nThere was no specific finding by the jury in words that there was an \u201cinvitation to alight\u201d nor did the respondent contend that there was. The invitation to alight was a reasonable inference to be drawn from the conductor\u2019s conduct and actions and is rather a question of law to be drawn from the question of fact found by the jury.\nThe jury found that the negligence of the conductor consisted\nin not remaining at the door of the car until the train stopped.\nThey further found that the deceased was not guilty of any contributory negligence.\nThe question then arises as to what is the fair and necessary inference to be drawn from these findings under the proved facts.\nThe learned Chief Justice, who tried the case, upon the findings of the jury directed judgment to be entered for the plaintiff respondent for the damages found. The appeal court was equally divided in opinion, two of the learned judges being to dismiss the action on the ground, as I understand the judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell with whose reasons Mr. Justice Rose concurred, that there was no invitation to alight on the conductor\u2019s part and no negligence found for which the company could be held liable, and two, Lennox and Ferguson JJ., for sustaining the judgment of the trial judge on the jury\u2019s findings.\nOwing to this judicial difference of opinion, I have found it necessary to give the evidence most careful attention, and have reached the conclusion that the finding of the jury as to the negligence of the conductor under the peculiar facts and circumstances detailed in the evidence was justified and that on such finding the appellants are liable.\nThese findings of negligence on the conductor\u2019s part, and of no contributory negligence on the part of the deceased, must be read and construed in light of the facts.\nI am inclined to think that one material fact proved, if the evidence of the widow and daughter is accepted, was overlooked by the learned judges who favoured the dismissal of the action, and that fact was that the conductor did not open the outer door of the vestibule until after he had notified the deceased the second time, touching him on the shoulder and saying, \u201cthis is Dunbarton. This is where you get off.\u201d\nThe importance I attach to this fact will be seen later on. I think the conclusion must be drawn from the jury\u2019s findings that they accepted the evidence of Mrs. Mayne and of her daughter in preference to that of the conductor on all points where such evidence differs or cannot be reconciled.\nAfter reading the evidence carefully over and accepting that of Mrs. Mayne and her children when at variance with the conductor\u2019s, which the jury must have done to make the findings they did, I draw the following conclusions of fact: That after the conductor had first gone through the car and called out: \u201cDunbarton is the next stop,\u201d he went through the car door, lifted the trap door, in the vestibule, but left the outer vestibule door closed. That he then returned into the car, touched the deceased on the shoulder, saying to him, \u201cDunbarton station. This is where you get off\u201d and remained standing for a few moments in the passageway of the car near to or alongside of deceased, looking at something or some passenger on the other side of the car. That he then started for the door, and that when he so started the deceased believing the car had stopped said to the children, whom he had previously warned not to move till the car stopped, \u201call right now, come on.\u201d\nHe himself at once got up and followed the conductor carrying the baby in his arms. The wife and children started to follow him, and she, finding the parcels she had to carry too heavy, called him to give her the baby and take the parcels instead, which he at once did. With the parcels in hand described as \u201ca big parcel tied with a piece of rope or string round it\u201d and a valise, he immediately followed the conductor who was some few feet only ahead and who passed out of the car door into the vestibule and then opened the outer vestibule door. The widow in her evidence stated explicitly that she followed close after her husband and when she had just reached the car door heard the conductor then open the outside vestibule door and saw him, after doing so, step back into the vestibule right to the edge of the platform and that he did not step over on to the platform of the next car. He stood there and the deceased, as she stated, then\nwent out of the car door and I followed him and he went down and stepped right off.\nShe adds:\nWe thought we were to the station and the train had stopped.\nThe widow herself was in the act of descending the steps following her husband when the conductor stopped her.\nNow if the jury believed, as they had a perfect right to do, these statements of fact, confirmed as they substantially were by the elder daughter. Gertrude and in large measure by the boy Archie, they would amount to an invitation to the deceased to alight. The first calling out by him \u201cDunbarton is the next station\u201d was certainly not such an invitation, and was not contended to be such but the subsequent personal intimation to the deceased when the conductor touched him on the shoulder and said, \u201cthis is Dunbarton station, this is where you get off\u201d followed by his conduct and actions in going down the aisle or gangway of the car just a few feet ahead of the procession of the deceased, his wife, and the children, who were following him, his entry into the vestibule and opening of the outer vestibule and then standing lantern in hand on the edge of the vestibule platform leaving room for the deceased to pass out was, it seems to me, a distinct invitation for the deceased man and his family to alight. They were persons unaccustomed to railroad travelling, as the deceased had informed the conductor, and the latter\u2019s action and conduct would reasonably be understood by these persons to be an invitation to alight.\nIn the light then of the facts as proved by the plaintiff and her witnesses, the jury\u2019s finding that the conductor\u2019s negligence was in not remaining by the door of the car until the train stopped is easily understood. It means: You should not have spoken and acted as you did, because you led these passengers astray, but you should have stood at the door of the car until the train stopped and so prevented their alighting.\nIf the conductor believed, as he says he did, that the car had not stopped, but was going at a rapid rate of speed, then his conduct and actions as sworn to are inexplicable on any other theory than that of carelessness and negligence.\nThe facts and circumstances, as I understand and appreciate them from the evidence, and which the findings of the jury shew they believed, were such as distinctly called for such an act of prudence on the conductor\u2019s part as the jury suggest, namely, his standing by the door of the car till the train stopped, or some equivalent action which would have prevented the calamity which occurred.\nThe controlling question is whether there was evidence from which the jury might fairly find that the conductor was guilty of negligence in not having prevented the deceased from attempting to alight when he did. The action which the jury say he should have taken so as to prevent him would certainly have been effective. There was no evidence that any other passengers desired either to alight at this flag station or to get on the train there, nor was there any evidence that the conductor\u2019s duties required his presence elsewhere. If they did and he could not remain in the doorway, then he was bound after opening the outer vestibule door and knowing that the train had not stopped, to give the family who were about to alight from the train, and as to whose ignorance of railway travelling, in my opinion, he had full knowledge, clear warning not to alight when they attempted to do so. He neither interposed his physical body before the deceased so as to prevent the deceased alighting, nor gave him any warning not to alight, nor was his presence required elsewhere. He simply stood by on the vestibule platform and allowed the man carrying a valise and a large parcel, to go down the steps with the outer door open, without any warning whatever. His suggestion, on cross\u2011examination, as an explanation of his silence and inaction, that he thought the man might have been going into the first-class coach, was evidently not accepted seriously by the jury, and I must say that, looking at all the facts and circumstances, it was a most unreasonable if not absurd one. I think this case must be decided on its special facts, and not upon the law which, it is contended, applies to the duties which, under ordinary circumstances and with respect to ordinary passengers, conductors owe to them with regard to alighting from trains.\nMy judgment is that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014When the somewhat confusing facts presented by the evidence herein, as dealt with in the conflicting opinion of the learned judges in the Appellate Division have been sifted and tested by the process of fair argument before us, there is found in them, I think, a case for the jury to try and in the result found such a judgment as appealed against.\nThey found the deceased came to his death through the negligence of the appellant.\nThey found further that the deceased had not been guilty of negligence which caused the accident or which so contributed to it that but for his negligence the accident would not have happened.\nIt seems quite clear from this latter finding that the jury must have accepted the version of the relevant facts as given by respondent and two of her children and rejected whatever the conductor said in evidence in conflict therewith.\nOn the evidence of the latter it would be difficult to acquit deceased of negligence.\nOn the evidence of and on behalf of the respondent it was easy to come to the honest conclusion that deceased had been misled by the words and acts of the conductor into the belief that the train was stopping, and the way clear to get out. Dunbarton was a mere flag station. The present tense used by the conductor speaking in relation to it must have meant, if anything, the station. It was not the case of a conductor coming into a large city or town, when the same expression used to a passenger could not reasonably be interpreted as an invitation to alight or do so in a few seconds. But spoken of, or relative to, a mere flag station or platform, they could only mean that the spot was at hand and the train stopping, and hence the only thing to do was to get ready and get off.\nThe every-day traveller might use his own sense of motion and use his own judgment of the fact, but the untravelled and, quite inexperienced man would trust the words and acts of the conductor.\nThere can be little doubt that deceased as result thereof trusted himself thereto and stepped off relying thereon.\nThe respondent swears she thought the train had stopped and the jury quite evidently implicitly believed her. She was mistaken, but evidently that was the impression she had got from what the conductor had said and done till she realized that her husband was off.\nI cannot understand why the conductor seeing such a man as deceased stepping out laden with packages and his hands thus tied, on a train going at the rate of twenty to twenty-five miles an hour, remained dumb so long.\nMoreover there is no evidence of any one else than deceased and his wife and seven children wanting to get off at that station, or any one likely to get on the train there.\nThe night was very dark and feelings of common humanity alone demanded a little attention on his part to such a party.\nHis sole duty to them and his employers demanded it. And if he had given the slightest heed thereto the accident never would have happened.\nHe should, if heeding that duty, have seen by a glance at the movement of the whole family that they must have misunderstood him or were pursuing a most dangerous course.\nHe says he crossed over to open the trap and vestibule door in the next car. There is not a vestige of evidence of any need therefor.\nI much doubt him in that regard till he saw deceased had stepped off and the jury may have disbelieved him in that as they evidently did in regard to other things.\nAll these and other considerations of what the evidence discloses which it is needless to dwell upon in detail, must be borne in mind when we come to consider the only difficulty in the case.\nWhat I refer to is the peculiar form of the answer defining the negligence the jury find the appellant answerable for.\nI should be sorry to lay down as a rule of law that the conductor must always stand at the door of the car until the train is stopped.\nI should be equally sorry to say that the finding was and is incomprehensible.\nI think it stands for nothing more or less than that under all the attendant circumstances, including especially the misleading nature of his invitation to be ready instantly to alight and inducing a procession in obedience thereto, it was his duty to have guarded the door of the car from being used as it was used.\nMany other forms of expression might have been used indicating, as this doubtless was intended to indicate, the neglect of that duty I have signified above as devolving upon him, under said circumtances.\nI think the language used is quite capable of being understood as expressing that neglect of duty imposed on him to have due care of those in his charge, and that his neglect in that regard was in law the neglect of the appellant.\nI am of course aware that the train was twelve minutes behind time, and had little time to waste on a flag station, and of the pressing anxiety to make haste, but that rendered it all the more incumbent on him in charge to see that no chance of harm should come to the helpless and inexperienced ones who were being hastened, possibly beyond their usual pace.\nI agree with the opinion of the learned and long experienced trial judge and the learned judges of the Appellate Division supporting his judgment.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff\u2019s husband, Wm. J. Mayne, was fatally injured, as a result of stepping off a car of a vestibuled railway train at night, while it was moving at a speed of from twenty to twenty-five miles an hour, a quarter of a mile before it reached his stopping place. A jury negatived contributory negligence and held the railway company liable on the ground that the conductor should have prevented what had occurred by\nremaining at the door of the car until the train stopped.\nUpon an even division of opinion the Appellate Division upheld the judgment entered by the learned trial judge for the plaintiff[7].\nThe facts are deposed to by the plaintiff and her two children and the railway conductor. Without imputing deliberate perjury to the conductor, the inaccuracy of several of his answers, and the flippancy of one of them may well have led the jury to reject his version of what occurred where it differed materially from that of the plaintiff, and I think we must, for the purposes of this appeal, assume that the story of the plaintiff and her children is correct. It should, however, be noted that, although the unfortunate Mayne was not accustomed to travelling, there is no evidence that the conductor had been apprised of that fact. The contrary view taken by one of the learned judges of the Appellate Division[8], probably to some extent influenced his judgment in favour of the plaintiff.\nMr. Justice Ferguson, who reached the same conclusion, very succinctly, and, upon the assumption that the plaintiff\u2019s story is correct, I think accurately, states the material facts as follows:\u2014\nThe deceased, his wife and seven children, entered the train at Whitby destined for a flag station called Dunbarton. The deceased requested the conductor to let him know when they were at that station; accordingly, as the train approached Dunbarton the conductor came through the car and called out: \u201cDunbarton is the next stop.\u201d Shortly afterwards the conductor returned and touching the deceased on the shoulder said, \u201cthis is Dunbarton, this is where you get off.\u201d The deceased was entitled to conclude from these words that he had arrived, but he appears to have construed them only as a notice to get ready at once to get off, because, on the children rising to go, the father told them to \u201csit still till the train is stopped\u201d but almost immediately afterwards he said, \u201cnow, come on,\u201d and all started for the door. As the wife and husband reached the car door the conductor stepped out and in the hearing of the husband and wife and perhaps in the sight of the husband, who was ahead, opened the trap door in the vestibule and the outside door, and there in sight of both stepped back, whereupon the deceased walked down the steps. Two difficulties in the plaintiff\u2019s way are that it is almost incredible that a man in possession of his faculties, however inexperienced in travelling, could, when on the platform of a car running twenty to twenty five miles an hour, have been under the impression that it was stationary; and that the finding of the jury, if taken literally, would impose upon the conductor a duty which certainly did not exist.\nA suggestion that Mayne did not intentionally step off the car, but that, laden with a valise in one hand and a bulky bundle in the other, he lost his balance and fell off, is excluded by the evidence of the plaintiff and of the conductor, who both aver that they saw him step off.\nThe improbability that a man in possession of his faculties when on the platform of a car in a train running twenty or twenty-five miles an hour, with the accompanying noise and motion, would not have realized that it had not stopped is perhaps little, if any, greater than that of such a man, if aware that the train was moving, stepping off it on a dark night into space. Yet one or other of these improbable theories must be accepted. The jury, in negativing contributory negligence, evidently preferred the former. The plaintiff and her two children who followed the deceased\u2014the wife according to her story having actually begun to descend the steps after him\u2014say that they were under the belief that the train had stopped. It is possible that the father\u2019s preparations for alighting and his concern for his wife and children and the parcels under his charge so absorbed his attention that he actually failed to realize that the train was still in rapid motion. It may be, as put by Mr. Justice Ferguson, that by the conductor\u2019s action in raising the vestibule trap, opening the outer door, placing the hand-bar in position, and then stepping back to the edge of the platform, Mayne was misled, notwithstanding the evidence of his senses, into a belief that the train was at its destination and stopped. Difficult as it is to conceive of this having been his state of mind, having regard to the testimony of the wife and children as to their own belief and to the unlikelihood of his having knowingly stepped off a rapidly moving train, it seems to me impossible to say that the jury was clearly wrong in assuming that in fact it was. If so, it was for them to determine whether Mayne\u2019s failure to appreciate the actual conditions amounted to negligence. They have found that it did not and I am not prepared to set that finding aside.\nBut the finding of negligence on the part of the conductor involves greater difficulties. In the first place, it is perfectly clear upon all the evidence that it was his duty before reaching the station to prepare for his passengers alighting by raising the trap, opening the vestibule door and putting the hand-bar in place. To do this work after the train had stopped is quite impracticable. It should, however, be done as late as possible before the actual stop in order that the safeguard of the closed trap and vestibule door may not be taken away earlier than is necessary. The conductor, therefore, could not, consistently with his duty, after notifying Mayne that the station then being approached was his stopping place, have \u201cremained at the car door until the train stopped.\u201d If that be the necessary meaning of the jury\u2019s finding it cannot be supported.\nThe findings of the jury must, no doubt, be read in the light of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, the evidence and the judge\u2019s charge, and should be given any interpretation of which they are reasonably susceptible and will enable the court to support them. The relevant allegation of negligence is that\nthe conductor should have prevented the deceased going upon the platform while the train was in motion\nand\nshould, under the circumstances, have warned him\nof his danger. The learned trial judge, paraphrasing this allegation, said:\u2014\nThe plaintiff claims that there was on the part of the conductor a failure * * * to warn the man when it must have been manifest to the conductor that he was in a position of danger, that the conductor should have realized and recognized that danger, and done all he could to avert it by shouting, by springing and stopping the man.\nI think the jury\u2019s finding may\u2014and, if necessary to sustain it, probably should\u2014be taken to mean that after raising the trap and opening the vestibule door the conductor should have placed himself in the car door to prevent passengers coming out on the platform before the train had stopped.\nIt may be that, if strictly discharging his duty, a conductor should, if it be practicable to do so, prevent passengers coming on the platform of a car until the train has actually stopped. Had Mayne been thrown from the platform, or had he fallen from it as a result of his losing his balance while standing there, allowing him to come upon the platform might possibly be said to have been negligence dans locum injuri\u0153. But that is not at all this case. Allowing Mayne to come upon the platform was not the proximate cause of his injury; it was at most a remote cause or cause sine qua non. But for his proceeding to alight his coming on the platform would have been harmless, and, having regard to the custom of travellers on this continent (disclosed by the evidence and a matter of common knowledge, as was pointed out by the learned trial judge) when a train is approaching a station, to move to the car door and to pass out to the vestibule platform with their hand luggage before the train has stopped, even had the unfortunate passenger fallen or been thrown from the platform, I am not at present prepared to say that failure to prevent his coming out upon it would have amounted to actionable negligence. But this remote cause need not now be further considered.\nIf the jury intended to find that the conductor\u2019s fault consisted in having failed to prevent Mayne proceeding to alight from the vestibule platform, they certainly have not said so, and I think their finding is not reasonably open to that interpretation. But, if it is, it involves the idea that the conductor realized or should have realized that it was Mayne\u2019s intention to attempt to alight, notwithstanding that the train was in rapid motion, in time to have interfered to prevent his doing so. The conductor had properly notified him, as requested, that he was nearing his station. That is all his notification amounted to and the evidence makes it clear that it was so understood. He, no doubt, had reason to expect that Mayne and his family would thereupon prepare to alight and, having regard to the custom to which I have alluded, that they would probably move to the door of the car and come out upon the vestibule platform with their luggage before the train had stopped. The opening of the trap and vestibule door were not meant as an intimation that the train had stopped, and that it was safe to alight immediately, and, while Mayne may have so regarded them, it by no means follows that the conductor knew or should have known that such an erroneous and extremely improbable impression would be thus created. I am unable to follow counsel for the plaintiff in his contention that the mere fact that Mayne came out on the platform and turned to the car steps should have made it apparent to the conductor that it was his intention to proceed forthwith to alight. The moment that intention became apparent to him it would, I think, have been the conductor\u2019s duty, having regard to the statutory obligation of the company to \u201ccarry and deliver all traffic with due care and diligence,\u201d to have endeavoured to prevent its being carried out. It is to me unthinkable, that if he had even a suspicion of the intention of the deceased to alight, this conductor of thirty years\u2019 experience would have stood idly by and allowed him to step off to almost certain death. It is, I think, clear that the conductor failed to realize the deceased\u2019s intention until too late to prevent him stepping off, though he succeeded in stopping the wife who was following him. The question therefore is, should the conductor have realized sooner than he did and in time, by a shout of warning or by physical intervention, to have prevented its execution, that it was Mayne\u2019s intention, under the impression that the train had stopped, to attempt to alight from it while actually moving at a rate of twenty or twenty-five miles an hour\u2014or rather, is there any evidence upon which a reasonable jury could so find? After giving to this, for me, vital question a great deal of anxious consideration, I find myself unable to say that there is. Why should the conductor have anticipated anything so utterly improbable?\nOn the ground, therefore, that there is no evidence to warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the conductor, I would allow this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.H.

Respondent.\n1917: November 2; 1917: November 28.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nNegligence \u2014 Crown \u2014 Injury to \"property on public work\"\u2014Scow attached to public wharf\u2014\"Government railways\"\u2014\"Exchequer Court Act,\" R.S.C. (1906) c. 140, s. 20 (c).\u2014 9 & 10 Edw. VII, c. 19.\nHeld, Davies J. dissenting, that a scow, lying beside and attached to a public wharf, being used in making repairs to that public work, must be deemed to be engaged \"on public work\" within the meaning of section 20 (c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act.\" Duff J. expressing no opinion and dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J.:\u2014The intention of the Parliament of Canada, in adding paragraph (f) to section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" (9 & 10 Edw. VII c. 19) was to include all Government railways, in mentioning \"the Intercolonial Railway\" and \"the Prince Edward Island Railway.\"\nPer Anglin J.:\u2014\"Public work\" means not merely some building or other structure or erection belonging to the public, but any operations undertaken by or on behalf of the Government in constructing, repairing or maintaining public property.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the plaintiff's petition of right[2].\nThe appellant, under a contract with the Commissioners of the Transcontinental Railway, was ordered by them to do some repairs to a wharf situated at Levis and belonging to the Commissioners. In order to do the work, the appellant had to use a derrick-scow and to make her fast to the face of the wharf. The \"Leonard,\" a ferry-boat belonging to respondent, was also using the wharf for ferrying the cars of the Transcontinental Railway from Quebec to Levis. The scow was crushed against the wharf by the \"Leonard\" and was sunk.\nMarchand K.C. for the appellant.\nMeredith K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014It is a little difficult to say from the record in what way this appeal comes before this Court. The Assistant Judge of the Exchequer Court before whom the petition of right came on for trial took all the evidence, but in his judgment says\u2014\nat the opening of the case, it was ordered, both parties agreeing thereto' that the questions of law raised herein should be first disposed of before entering into the question of the quantum of the damages.\nIt would seem from this either that the Crown admitted negligence of its officers or servants or else that the case was argued on demurrer. No point of law is raised by the statement of defence which simply alleges negligence on the part of the petitioner.\nThe learned judge has held that\nthe case does not come within the ambit of sub-section (f) of section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" since that section only applies to the Intercolonial Railway or the Prince Edward Island Railway.\nIn this I think he is wrong.\nBy the \"Government Railways Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 36, s. 80, the Intercolonial Railway is defined as follows:\u2014\n80. All railways, and all branches and extensions thereof, and ferries in connection therewith, vested in His Majesty, under the control and management of the Minister, and situated in the Provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, are hereby declared to constitute and form the Intercolonial Railway. By the \"National Transcontinental Railway Act,\" as amended by the Act to amend the \"National Transcontinental Railway Act,\" 4 & 5 Geo. V., ch. 43, it is provided:\u2014\nAfter the Eastern Division is completed and until it is leased to the company, the said Eastern Division shall be under the control and management of the Minister of Railways and Canals who shall have power to operate the whole or any part of the said Division as a Government railway under the provisions of the \"Government Railways Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 36.\nParagraph (f) added to section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" by the Act to amend the \"Exchequer Court Act\" (9 & 10 Edw. VII., ch. 19) was, no doubt, intended to include, and did in fact then include, all Government railways in mentioning the Intercolonial Railway and the Prince Edward Island Railway.\nSince, then, the Eastern Division of the National Transcontinental Railway is certainly now a Government railway, and as regards the locus with which we are now concerned is within the letter of the statute a part of the Intercolonial Railway, I think we are justified in holding that, for the purposes of the present case at any rate, it forms part of the Intercolonial Railway so as to entitle the appellant to rely upon paragraph (f) of section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act.\"\nIt does not perhaps necessarily follow from the case falling within the extended terms of liability in this paragraph (f) that the appellant is entitled to relief even if negligence is proved, as to which we have no finding by the Exchequer Court.\nInasmuch as the appeal was really from a decision on a point of law which is overruled, the case should, I think, go back to the Exchequer Court for determination and, if necessary, assessment of damages. Davies J. (dissenting)\u2014I am of opinion that Mr. Justice Audette of the Exchequer Court was perfectly right in holding that the damages sustained by the scow or dredge of the suppliants while lying alongside of the Quebec Warehouse Wharf were not recoverable under sub-section (c) of section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" because the injuries complained of did not occur \"on a public work.\"\nThe scow or dredge was at the time of the accident moored at the face of the wharf and a diver was preparing to descend the river at the face of the wharf to ascertain whether the foundation was strong enough to build on.\nHe had not, however, completed his preparations when the collision with the steamer \"Leonard\" occurred and to hold that the scow or dredge at the time of the collision was \"on a public work\" within the terms of the section would be to run counter to the construction of the sub-section established by this court in the cases of Chamberlin v. The King[3]; Paul v. The King[4]; The Hamburg American Packet Co. v. The King[5]; and Olmstead v. The King[6].\nPaul's Case4 is, in many respects, like this one and the construction of the section in question there determined must prevail in the case now before us unless that case is overruled. The decision, however, in Paul's Case4 has been consistently followed ever since.\nAs my colleagues, however, have reached the conclusion that the cases I have referred to can be distinguished from this one, this case must, of course, go back to the Exchequer Court to have it determined whether there has been such negligence as the Crown is liable for and, if such is held, to assess the damages.\nAs far as I am concerned, I would dismiss the appeal and the suppliant's petition of right with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree with the learned trial judge below that a very narrow construction has unfortunately been placed upon the words \"on a public work\" in the statute in question, but I cannot agree that any of them have gone quite so far as the judgment now appealed from. There was always something to distinguish physically the spot where the alleged negligence took place from the actual spot where the work was actually being conducted.\nIn this case it is hardly possible unless we give the meaning to the word \"on\" of \"upon\" and insist that the scow in question could not be said to be \"on a public work\" unless it was on the top of the very spot in the wharf under and with which the appellant's men were engaged. I have also come to the conclusion that there was negligence attributable to the servants of the respondent which caused the destruction of the said scow whilst on the work in question. This court must, when the issues have been fully tried out as admittedly they were here, and all the evidence has been adduced that either party desires to present, give the judgment which the court below should have given. The judgment, I conceive, in this case should be to adjudge the respondent liable for the amount of the damages which the suppliant sustained in consequence of such negligence. Inasmuch, however, as the actual quantum of the damages was not dealt with in the evidence adduced, it will be necessary to refer the matter to the learned judge to assess the damages.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered accordingly. Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\nAnglin J.\u2014This case seems to me, with respect, to be distinguishable from the series of decisions on the construction of clause (c) of section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C., ch. 140), culminating in Piggott v. The King[7], the facts in which perhaps . most nearly resemble those now presented. In none of those cases was the property injured, in respect of which damages were sought, employed at the time of injury in the construction or repair of a public work. Here, though not physically \"on a public work,\" the injured scow, lying beside and attached to a public wharf, was in the course of being used in making repairs to that public work. It may properly be said to have been engaged \"on a public work\" just as the men on the scow and the diver (to whose claims, if they had sustained personal injuries in the crushing of the scow, I think the clause in question would have applied) might properly be said to have been \"on a public work.\" It does not seem to me to involve any undue straining of the language of the statute to hold that it covers a claim for injury to property so employed. \"Public work\" may, and I think should, be read as meaning not merely some building or other erection or structure belonging to the public, but any operations undertaken by or on behalf of the Government in constructing, repairing or maintaining public property. In this sense the appellant's scow was \"on a public work\" when it was injured. The judgment of the Exchequer Court cannot therefore be sustained on the ground on which it was based.\nIn the view he took the learned trial judge found it unnecessary to pass upon the issue of negligence. To determine that issue without the benefit of the trial judge's view as to the credibility and weight of the testimony, and without ourselves having had the opportunity of hearing the evidence and seeing the witnesses would be most unsatisfactory. The question of damages was not considered at all.\nThe case must, therefore, be remitted to the Exchequer Court to deal with it in accordance with the judgment now pronounced.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rivard, Chauveau & Marchand.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. (dissenting):\u2014As the respondent has paid for the completion of the contract a larger sum than the amount of the security, the appellant is not entitled to its recovery.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (16 Ex. C.R. 228; 39 D.L.R. 76), affirmed. APPEAL from the decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining in part the petition of right of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nBelleau K.C. and Marchand K.C. for the appellants.\nDrouin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting on the cross-appeal)\u2014The pleadings in a case are meant to bring out clearly the issues presented for the decision of the court. It would be very difficult to gather these from the petition of right in this case and we need not try because the appellants' counsel in their factum say:\u2014\nAt the trial many of the allegations of the petitions of right were abandoned and on behalf of the appellants we submitted that they were entitled to recover a sum of $5,168.41 for the following reasons;\nThey proceed to set out certain amounts and values which they allege the respondent received from them and which, after deducting certain credits, leave a balance of the mentioned sum.\nIt is necessary to set out briefly the facts of the case in order to see what is really the claim now advanced.\nThe appellants entered into a contract with the respondent for the construction of a wharf for the sum of $33,775, and they deposited security to the amount of $3,600. Before the wharf was nearly complete, the appellants, in breach of their contract, as found at the trial, abandoned the works which were thereafter completed by another contractor, one 0. Poliquin. When the appellants threw up their contract they had received from the respondent the sum of $15,300, the total payments made to them on account, and they left on the premises materials to the value of $10,183.30. These, however, to the value of $4,949.89 were unpaid for and the respondent subsequently paid this amount, the value of the appellants' materials which the respondent took over under the terms of the contract being thus only $5,233.41.\nThe contract between Poliquin and the respondent provided that the contractor should take over and utilise in the completion of the wharf all the materials on the site at the valuation of $10,183.30, this being set-off against the total price payable of $22,490. It may be noted that this sum of $22,490 included a small extra of $350.\nIt thus appears that the total cost of the bridge, not including the $350 extra, was:\u2014\nCash paid appellants...................................\n$15,300.00\nValue of material handed over\nto Poliquin and put into the bridge..................\n$10,183.30\nCash paid Poliquin...........................\n11,956.70\n22,140.00\nTotal...................\n$37,440.00\nThe original contract price was............................\n33,775.00\nAn excess of......................\n$3,665.00\nThe appellants admit their liability for this excess\nbut claim to set against it\nThe value of their materials\ntaken over by the respondents..................\n$5,233.41\nTheir deposit...............................\n3,600.00\n$8,833.41\nDeduct the above excess.......................\n3,665.00\nleaving a balance, which is the amount of\ntheir claim, of.....................................\n$5,168.41\nThe Assistant Judge of the Exchequer Court has held that under the contract the appellants are not entitled to recover any part of the value of their materials, but inasmuch as such value exceeded the excess cost to the respondent over the original contract price they are entitled to recover their deposit.\nThe appellants, therefore, are appealing for the difference between the above sum of.........................................\n$5,168.41\nand the deposit allowed them...............................\n3,600.00\nThat is.........................................\n$1,568.41\nThe respondent cross-appeals against the judgment to return the deposit.\nThe fallacy underlying the claim and partly adopted in the judgment appealed from consists in treating the case as if it were an action by the respondent for breach of the contract. The case is, however, quite different and the question of damage sustained does not enter into it at all. In an action for breach of contract the plaintiff must, of course, prove his damages and cannot recover if it is shewn that he has sustained none.. It is, however, useless for the appellants to shew that the respondent suffered no damage, unless they can shew that this fact gives them a claim on the respondent. This is not done and the appellants can only claim, if at all, under the terms of the contract. They can only succeed if they are able to prove a claim regardless of whether or not the respondent suffered any loss by the, breach of the contract. This appears to have occurred to the learned judge but he has not borne it clearly in mind, because he refuses the claim as regards the materials on the ground that the contract provides as\nsecurity to the building owner, for the performance of the works,\nthat all the materials provided by the contractor shall be the property of the Crown if the builder fails to complete his works, but he allows, though\nnot without some hesitation, the claim for the deposit made as security, although the contract provides that\nif the said contractor should make default under the said contract His Majesty may dispose of said security for the carrying out of the construction and completion of the work of the contract.\nUnder this provision the appellants might be entitled to recover any part of the deposit which the Crown had not paid for the completion of the work. If, for instance, the Crown had only paid $3,000 for such completion, the appellants might be entitled to recover $600, the balance not so employed. Here, however, the Crown has paid $16,906.39 for the completion of the work and must be entitled, under the terms of the contract, to utilise the deposit towards payment of this sum.\nA possible view would perhaps be that the materials having become the property of the Crown the appellants cannot claim any credit in respect of them and that consequently they are liable, as the assistant judge suggests they might be, for the excess cost over the contract price, that is $3,665, an amount exceeding the deposit, which is only $3,600. As to this, however, I express no opinion. It is sufficient to say that the appellants, having proved no claim against the Crown, the appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed with costs. But the majority are of a different opinion.\nDavies J.\u2014The appellants were contractors with the Crown for the construction of a pier or wharf under written contract. After they had entered upon their contract work, and partly performed it, they, as found by Audette J,\nthrew up their contract and abandoned its completion.\nThe Crown thereupon entered into another contract with other parties for the completion of the work and it was completed by these other contractors. The cost to the Crown was somewhat less than the suppliants (appellants) \u2014 the original contractors \u2014 had agreed to complete the work for and the first claim made by them in this petition of right is that, although they had abandoned their contract work and left it unfinished, nevertheless, as the Crown was enabled through other contractors to finish the work for a less sum than the appellants had originally contracted to complete and finish it for, they were entitled to recover the difference or saving to the Crown between their tender price and the actual cost of the work.\nThe learned judge found as a fact that this apparent saving to the Crown amounted to $1,568.41, but he very properly and rightly, in my opinion, dismissed this claim of the defaulting contractors as one which could not be allowed.\nA second claim made by the appellants was with respect to the sum of $3,600 delivered by them to His Majesty on their entering into their contract as security for its \"due performance.\" Their contention was that this $3,600 had been deposited by them merely as security for the performance of their contract and had not\nbeen disposed of by the Crown in carrying out the contract work\nafter the work had been abandoned by them but was still in the Crown's hands, and that the work having been completed for a less sum than their contract provided for, and no evidence whatever having been given of any part of the deposit having been disposed of in carrying out the contract, they were entitled to its return.\nThe contract between the appellants and the Crown with reference to this $3,600 deposit was a separate one from the contract for the carrying out of the work contracted for, and the respective rights of the appellants and the Crown must be determined by the terms of this subsidiary contract.\nIt stated in its first clause that\nthe said security ($3,600) had been delivered to His Majesty and was to be held by him as such for the due performance and fulfilment by the contractors of the said contract.\nAfter providing in its third clause that the contractors\nshould be entitled to receive back the value of said security with interest upon the full performance and fulfilment of the said contract,\nit went on in its fourth clause to provide for the contingency of their defaulting under the contract.\nIn that event it provided that\nHis Majesty may dispose of said security and of the interest for the carrying out of the construction and completion of the work of the contract and for paying any salary or wages that may be left unpaid by the said contractors.\nNothing whatever is said in this subsidiary contract as to a forfeiture of this $3,600. It provides for the two contingencies of completion and non-completion of the contract by the contractors. In the former case it provides for the return of the security moneys to the contractors and in the latter for the right of His Majesty to dispose of the security moneys in carrying out the contract which the contractors had failed to do.\nThe $3,600 was, therefore, a mere security for the performance of the contract. If the contract had been duly performed the money would, of course, have been repaid to the contractors. If, as the fact was, the contractors defaulted, the Crown might have\ndisposed of the security in carrying the contract out.\nBut, as the result proved, they were not called upon so to dispose of it because the work was completed under the new contract entered into by the Crown for a less sum than the appellants had originally contracted to complete it for.\nThe Crown gave no evidence whatever that any such disposition of the $3,600 security as the subsidiary contract provided for had been resorted to.\nThe facts shew that no such disposition became necessary and the security moneys now remain in the Crown's hands.\nUnder these circumstances, it seems to me the learned judge's disposition of this branch of the claim declaring the suppliants to be entitled to a return of this $3,600 security was also right. I think, however, that whatever interest that sum has earned in the hands of the Crown up to the date of the demand and thereafter at the rate of 5% should also be allowed, the amount to be settled by the registrar.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal of the suppliants without costs and the cross-appeal of the Crown with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants contracted with the respondent to execute a work for $33,775 and were paid directly $15,300, and indirectly $4,949.89, making a total of $20,249.89. They abandoned their contract which meant by the terms thereof the abandonment of material on the ground as well as in the work.\nThe respondent re-let the work, transferring all such material on the ground, estimated to be worth $10,183.30, to the contractor who had tendered to complete the work, including an extra of $350, for $22,490, and thereby became only, entitled to get a balance of $11,956.70 in cash applicable to the appellants' contract price when due credit was given for said extra and for said material. Respondent paid that balance of cash in addition to the cash paid to and for the appellants as above set forth; and as I read the story had thus $1,568.41 left to meet the incidental expenses caused by the default of appellants.\nI fail to see any alleged profit therein. I surmise it would probably, on examination, be needed to cover immediate expenses and possibly a year's interest on the advance caused by appellants' many delays.\nMoreover, it cannot be recovered in face of the express terms of the contract.\nHence I think the appeal should be dismissed save as to the items of interest on the security deposit as hereinafter mentioned. But I think there should be no costs of the appeal.\nThe cross-appeal arises out of and depends upon another contract, though of same date as that I have disposed of and by the express terms thereof presumably executed after that other and is itself a distinct contract or suretyship for the due performance thereof.\nThis contract must be construed by its own express terms and the necessary implications therein having due regard to its obvious purpose.\nThe cross-appellant having entered into a contract letting to cross-respondents certain work to be constructed by them for him, it became important to ensure the due execution of the work received from them for that purpose certain securities and moneys, valued in the whole at the sum of $3,600.\nThe agreement, in its operative part, declared first that the said security had been delivered to the cross-appellant to be held by him for the due performance and fulfilment by cross-respondents of the said contract and of all the covenants, agreements, provisions and conditions therein mentioned, by them to be performed and fulfilled; next that His Majesty was not to be held responsible for the payment of interest on the security so deposited; and then upon the full performance and fulfilment by cross-respondents of the said contract, and of all the covenants, agreements, provisions and conditions as aforesaid, the cross-respondents should be entitled to receive back the value of said security together with the interest, if any, which might have accrued out of the deposit whilst in the hands of the Finance Department.\nSuch is the tenor of the agreement followed by a provision that the cross-respondents assumed the risk of loss of the security through insolvency of any bank on which any cheque had been drawn or in which any deposit had been made in connection with the security.\nThen follows clause 4 of the agreement which is as follows:\u2014\n4. But if at any time the said contractors should make default under the said contract, or if His Majesty acting under the powers reserved in the said contract, shall determine that the said works, or any portion thereof remaining to be done, should be taken out of the hands of the contractors, and be completed in any other manner or way whatsoever than by the contractors, His Majesty may dispose of said security and of the interest which may have accrued thereon for the carrying out of the construction and completion of the work of the contract and for paying any salaries and wages that may be left unpaid by the said contractors.\nIt is upon the construction of this clause, when read in light of the entire scope and purpose of the agreement, that the claim of the cross-respondents which has been allowed by the learned trial judge below must rest.\nThe contract for which the deposit was made by way of surety for its performance was, after a great part of the work had been performed, abandoned by cross-respondents and thereupon the cross-appellant, as entitled by the terms of the contract, took possession thereof and of the material on the ground and re-let the execution of the work to another contractor who finished same at less expense than the balance of the original contract price when due credit was given for the material abandoned by the cross-respondents and taken over by the cross-appellant.\nNo part of the security was ever needed to be resorted to, or was in fact resorted to, for the carrying out of the construction and completion of the work to be done under the contract, or for paying any salaries and wages left unpaid by the said contractors.\nIt is only by an unjustifiable confusion of two entirely separate contracts and juggling of two sets of figures that have really nothing to do with each other that the semblance of argument is made in support of the cross-appeal.\nSo far has this been carried that the cross-appellant's factum presents one statement alleging the second contractor had been paid by cross-appellant $17,256.59, when in truth he was only paid $12,306.70.\nThe difference was made up by use of the material the cross-respondents had abandoned, and which the second contractor was bound to use and make allowance for.\nThe specifications in the original contract, if the parties had chosen to abide thereby, might require consideration but they are not incorporated with this suretyship contract, or referred to therein, and as I view it have nothing to do with it.\nIt might well have been, as sometimes happens, that a third party, such as a guarantee company, might have given its bond expressed in substance with conditions such as set out in this second agreement for the like purpose.\nWhat would have been said had the Crown sought to recover under the circumstances existent here upon such a bond?\nI need not pursue the matter further except to say that on the facts I think the security is only the property of a subject, detained by the respondent, when it ought to have been returned the moment that events had so developed that the work was complete and that without loss to the Crown.\nAnd I observe that the judgment fails to give interest which, I think, ought to be added from the date when the security should have been returned.\nAny interest earned by the deposit whilst rightfully in respondent's hands should also be allowed.\nIf the parties cannot agree as to the date when the deposit was returnable the matter should go back to the learned trial judge to fix it. That can be done if not by virtue of this cross-appeal then by virtue of the main appeal.\nThe cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with my brother Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed without costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Belleau, Baillargeon & Belleau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Drouin & Amyot.\n[1] 16 Ex.

V. c. 23. Upon evidence that an assessment is \"grossly\" excessive it should be varied by the Supreme Court of Canada, to which an appeal lies from the judgment of the final tribunal created under the charter of the city respondent.\nPearce v. Calgary, 54 Can. S.C.R. 1; 9 W.W.R. 668, followed.\nJudgment of the District Court of the District of Edmonton reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of Taylor J., of the District Court of the District of Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta, maintaining, with a slight reduction in valuation, the assessment, for taxation purposes, of land belonging to the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I adhere to the opinion expressed in Pearce v. Calgary[1], with respect to appeals in assessment cases.\nSpeaking generally, the intrinsic value of a piece of property must necessarily be the price which it will command in the open market and the local judge sitting in appeal with his knowledge and experience in ascertaining the price of real estate within his jurisdiction would, under normal conditions, be in a better position to judge of the value of such property than I can assume to be. But when, as in this case, the property has, by reason of exceptional conditions of a temporary nature, no marketable value and the judge has, misconstruing the statute, proceeded on a wrong basis in fixing the value for assessment purposes, then it is for us to endeavour, applying the statute to the evidence, to ascertain the fair actual value for assessment purposes as distinguished from the intrinsic value. It is important to bear in mind that the statute provides that, in estimating its value, regard may be had to the situation of the land, the purposes for which it is used or could or would be used if sold in the next succeeding twelve months. So that it is not the absolute value of the land that is to be ascertained, and the assessment being only for the current year, the limitation of the statute is a very proper one. The question, therefore, is, having regard to their location, present productive qualities and the uses to which they may be put within the next twelve months, what is the fair actual value for assessment purposes of the two parcels of land in question in the condition in which they were?\nIf the true value is, having regard to the considerations I have just mentioned, that given by the appellant's witnesses, then the difference between that value and the assessed value is certainly gross, if that word has any meaning. The county judge, in my opinion, proceeded upon a false basis when, in the absence of proof of any intention to subdivide, he assessed the value on the assumption that, if subdivided, the property would be saleable within the next twelve months at the figure he fixes. The judge also erred in applying the principle of equalisation having regard to the Swift and Burns properties, both of which are exceptional by reason of their situation and the uses to which their owners were in a position to put them. My attention was not drawn to anything in the statute which justifies the refusal to accept evidence of values on the basis of farm lands, that being the only use to which, at the present time, the appellant's properties could reasonably be put.\nI can find nothing in the evidence that justifies the assessment of the lands in question at a higher figure than that given by the appellant's witnesses. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the land comprised in Roll No. 2081 should be assessed at $475 an acre, $75,525, and that comprised in Roll No. 1503 at $625 per acre, $95,317.50. There is no evidence of the general selling price of property in the appellant's neighbourhood at the time the assessment was made and there is no evidence that, if subdivided, they would realise more in the then condition of the real estate market or within the next twelve months than the appellant's witnesses would allow.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think the learned judge erred in adopting as the sole standard by which he should determine the amount for which the appellant's lands should be assessed, the amount for which other lands in the city, whether in the immediate vicinity of those in question or not, were assessed at. The value at which the lands in the immediate vicinity of those in question had been assessed was, no doubt, under the statute an important factor to be considered when determining the assessment value in question. But that does not apply in cases where the lands in question have been grossly overvalued by the assessors. The object and purpose of introducing this factor of equalisation in the assessments as a guide was as far as possible to obtain uniformity in the valuation. But that equalisation rule cannot be resorted to as the proper test or standard where there has been in the assessment a gross overvaluation in fact of particular lands beyond their \"fair actual value.\"\nSection 321 of the charter of the city of Edmonton is as follows:\u2014\nLand shall be assessed at its fair actual value. In estimating its value regard shall be had to its situation and the purpose for which it is used or if sold by the present owner it could and would probably be used in the next succeeding twelve months. In case the value at which any specified land has been assessed appears to be more or less than its true value the amount of the assessment shall nevertheless not be varied on appeal, unless the difference be gross, if the value at which it is assessed bears a fair and just proportion to the value at which lands in the immediate vicinity of the land in question are assessed.\nThe question then before us is reduced to the simple one whether there has been such a gross overvaluation, looking to the situation of the land and the purpose for which it is used or, if sold by the present \"owner, it could and would probably be used in the next succeeding twelve months.\"\nAfter careful consideration of the evidence, I cannot, acting on the rules the statute lays down for determining the fair actual value, resist the conclusion that the land has not been assessed at its fair actual value, but that it has been grossly overvalued.\nThe question difficult of solution on our part is, assuming\na gross overvaluation in the assessment value,\nwhat is the\nfair actual value of the lands? We have to be guided by the opinions of the witnesses, of course. Applying the statutory rules as above stated, these opinions, as might be expected, greatly differ. Had we the power to refer the case back to the judge who heard the appeal from the assessors in order that he might determine on proper principles the valuation at which the lands should be assessed, I would gladly do so. Not having that power, I have carefully considered the different valuations made by the witnesses called on both sides and have reached the conclusion that the fair actual acreage valuation of the learned judge should be reduced one-half, that is, the lands south of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway to $1,000 per acre, and those north of the track to $575 per acre. Costs must follow the result.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think the respective assessments appealed against of the lands in question are, even as reduced by the local courts, still grossly in excess of the actual values thereof, and should be reduced as follows:\nThe assessment of the land comprised in Roll No. 2081 should be reduced to $475 an acre and fixed at $75,525, and the assessment of the land comprised in Roll No. 1503 should be reduced to $625 per acre and fixed at $95,317.50.\nI retain the views I expressed in the somewhat analogous case of Pearce v. Calgary[2].\nThe appeal should be allowed accordingly with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The learned judge seems to have proceeded upon an erroneous principle. His reading of the statute apparently led him to the conclusion that in applying the Act the governing consideration is supplied by the ratio generally prevailing (as regards the assessment roll for the particular year) between the assessed value and the actual value of assessed properties in Edmonton. This, I think, is a misconception due seemingly to the neglect of the condition upon which the comparison of ratios is to be considered, namely: that the departure in the assessed value from the actual value in the case arising for decision shall not, in the language of the statute, be \"gross.\" The evidence conclusively shews that this condition is not satisfied in the present case where the difference, in my view, is equivalent to considerably more than 100% of the actual value of the property assessed.\nThe cardinal error in the valuation appealed from arises from a failure to observe the fundamental principle that where prospects of future sales or future profitable exploitations are considered in estimating value it is the present value of such prospects only that are to be taken into account. (See judgment of the Judicial Committee in Fraser v. Fraserville[3]). I should reduce the assessment to an amount arrived at by valuing 152.5 acres at $625 an acre and 159 acres at $475 an acre.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The dominant provision for the assessment of land made by the charter of the city of Edmonton is that\nland shall be assessed at its fair actual value.\nIn cases, however, where the difference between the assessed value and the fair actual value is not \"gross,\" the assessment is not to be varied on appeal if it bears a fair and just proportion to the value at which lands in the vicinity of the land in question are assessed.\nThe charter further provides in regard to the assessment of land that\nin estimating its value regard may be had to its situation and the purpose for which it is used or if sold by the present owner it could and would probably be used in the next succeeding twelve months.\nThe word may was substituted by amendment for the word shall, which appeared in the original section. I do not regard this change as entitling the assessor to take into account any prospective use which might be made of the land after twelve months had expired. He was formerly obliged to take into account its prospective use during the next succeeding twelve months. He is now not obliged but permitted to do so. The fair, if not the necessary, implication is that he may not take into account possibilities beyond the period so limited.\nThe judgment of the learned district judge makes it reasonably clear that in dealing with the assessment of the appellant's lands he did not take into consideration their fair actual value based on their situation, their present use and any prospective use to which they might be put within the next succeeding twelve months, or whether the difference between the fair actual value and the assessed value was gross or slight. Assigning as his reasons that\nthe evidence given here is that the value of this land is almost the same as the lots surrounding it after making provision for subdivision\nand\nthere has also been no evidence to shew that this land is assessed higher in proportion to its situation than any other part of the city,\nthe learned judge dismissed the owner's appeal, subject to making a slight reduction as to a portion of the lands in question. On the evidence in the record it is abundantly clear that there was no likelihood whatever\u2014indeed it may be said that there was no possibility\u2014of the land here in question being used for anything else than farm or market garden purposes during the twelve months succeeding the assessment. Yet the assessment was obviously based upon the prospective value of the land for purposes of subdivision into building lots, and all the evidence offered in support of it was based on the assumption that it was properly so treated. The only evidence in the record as to the value of the property viewed as farm lands or as available for market garden purposes was that given on behalf of the appellant. In my opinion the assessment was grossly excessive and should be reduced to the maximum figures deposed to by the appellant's witnesses\u2014$500 an acre for the land north of the right-of-way and $700 an acre for the land south of the right-of-way. These are the prices given by the witness Kenwood, who appears to have viewed the, matter sensibly and equitably.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 54 Can.

The defendant denied the trespass and alleged title to the trees as having been cut on its own limits.\nBelcourt K.C. for the motion.\nHall Kelly K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nThe action was brought to recover the sum of $3,615.35 as damages representing the value of timber which the plaintiff alleges was cut in trespass on its timber limits. The defendants, by their plea, denied the trespass and alleged title in themselves to the trees. At the trial and before enqu\u00eate the amount of the claim for damages was reduced by consent to the sum of $1,369.45.\nOn those facts I am of opinion that we are without jurisdiction to hear this appeal. As has already been said in many cases, in determining the sum or value in dispute the proper course is to look at the conclusions of the declaration. There is no question of title involved; the plaintiffs brought their action in a form which imposed upon them the obligation to prove that they were injured as alleged. This they could not do if there was any doubt about their title. B\u00e9liveau v. Church.[1]. Here the only claim is for damages the amount of which was by consent before trial reduced below the appealable limit. Town of Outremont v. Joyce[2]; Dufresne v. Fee[3]. As was said in Toussignant v. Nicolet[4], it is settled Jaw that neither the probative force of a judgment, nor its collateral effects, nor any contingent loss that a party may suffer by reason of a judgment are to be taken into consideration. The only thing to be considered is the matter directly in controversy and necessary to be determined to dispose of the rights of the parties in the particular case. As to the effect of retraxit, see Cameron, 267.\nMotion granted; appeal quashed with costs.\nDavies, J.\u2014I am of the opinion to dismiss this motion with costs on the ground that the title to the lands in question is involved. Idington J. (dissenting)\u2014It is quite clear that there cannot be any matter in controversy in this appeal which involves an amount of the\nsum or value of two thousand dollars\nas stated in section 46, subsection (c) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" to be the limit of jurisdiction for Quebec appeals, when the amount demanded had before judgment expressly been fixed by the agreement of the parties at a sum much below that.\nTherefore I cannot find the amount so involved a basis for our jurisdiction.\nThe facts in Dufresne v. Fee[5], relied upon render it distinguishable, and I do not think the decision therein affirms any principle of action which we must abide by herein.\nNor do I find any actual dispute of title involved. And, according to the judicial system in Quebec, as I am advised, this dispute of boundaries within which the timber in question was cut cannot test anything relative to title.\nThe motion to quash should prevail with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014It is very clear, I think, that the proceedings out of which the appeal arises involve a controversy regarding a title to lands and that the appeal is consequently not excluded by section 46. It is not disputed that in other respects the conditions of jurisdiction under section 37 are fulfilled.\nAnglin J.\u2014I think this case is indistinguishable in principle from Dufresne v. Fee5, and would, therefore, dismiss the motion to quash.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] Q.R. 2 Q.B., 545, at p. 546.\n[2] 43 Can. S.C.R. 611.\n[3] 35 Can. S.C.R. 8.\n[4] 32 Can.

P. shortly afterwards let contracts to four contractors for the clearing of the land. On May 3, 1912, P. made an application for a certificate of indefeasible title which was granted. A report, dated May 23, 1913, made upon a reference as to title ordered in a mechanics' lien action taken by the labourers who had cleared the land certified that \"there are no charges of any kind whatsoever against the title\" except the liens. On May 18, 1912, P. conveyed the land to N.M. subject to the agreement with A. and also assigned to him this agreement. On May 20, 1912, N.M. applied to register the assignment as a charge, but, not until October 31, 1913, did N.M. make any application to be registered under the grant. On January 6, 1914, the sheriff sold all the right title and interest of P. to R. The Court of Appeal held that this sale was a sale of the fee in the lands charged only by the liens.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014When N.M. acquired title from P. the land was already impressed with the mechanics' liens.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Where an application to the registrar has been cancelled under the provisions of sec. 108 of the \"Land Registry Act,\" the application must be deemed, for the purposes of the \"Land Registry Act\" and particularly for the purpose of applying sec. 28 of the Act of 1912, to have been void ab initio; and it follows that when the lien affidavits were registered there was, in contemplation of law, no application for registration of the N.M. interest \"pending.\"\nPer Duff J.\u2014N.M. was not in the position of a mortgagee but of a person \"claiming under\" P. and a person \"whose rights are acquired after the work of service, in respect of which the lien is claimed, is commenced.\" Per Duff J.\u2014N.M. lost its status with respect to the registered title by its acquiescence in the registrar's notice of cancellation, given on July 10, 1913.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014N.M. had \"no estate or interest either at law or in equity,\" in the land in question which made it a proper or necessary party to the mechanics' lien action under the judgment in which R. derives his title; nor had it any estate or interest of which the plaintiffs in that action or R. should be deemed to have had \"any notice, express, implied or constructive.\" \"Land Registry Act,\" secs. 104, 108.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal, 32 D.L.R. 81; [1917] 1 W.W.R. 494, affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Hunter C.J., and dismissing the appellant's, plaintiff's, action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nW.C. Brown for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. It seems to be abundantly proved that when the appellant company acquired title from Passage, the common auteur, the land was already impressed with the mechanics' liens which are the foundation of the respondent's title. Passage had a certificate of indefeasible title which, under the \"Land Registry Act,\" dates from May 3rd, 1912. He conveyed the land to the plaintiffs subject to the Patterson agreement on the 18th May, 1912, and at that date the work in respect of which the mechanics' liens were created was commenced. The contracts under which the work was done are admitted, the land is identified, and the date at which work started is also proved. DAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014On two distinct grounds I think this appeal must be dismissed. First: The services in respect of which the lien\u2014holders acquired their liens were performed in execution of the contract between Passage and certain contractors, dated the 30th of November. The work was begun within the first week in May and whether the appellant company did or did not become, by virtue of the transfers under which it claims, entitled to registration as owner in fee or as mortgagee, admittedly the instruments were not executed until the 18th of May and no advance was made by the appellant company before that date. By section 9 a mortgagee is entitled to the benefit of that section or to the status of a mortgagee under it only in respect of the principal sum actually advanced to the borrower at the time the works or improvements in respect of which the lien is claimed, are commenced; the appellant company is therefore not in the position of a mortgagee but of a person \"claiming under\" Passage and a person \"whose rights are acquired after the work or service in respect of which the lien is claimed, is commenced,\" that is to say, of an \"owner.\"\nThis is not a case therefore in which any difficulty could arise as to compliance with the provisions of section 19 (a) and the interest of the appellant company was therefore bound by the filing and registration of the affidavit required by that section.Second: The filing and the registering of the lien affidavits on the 15th Oct., 1912, established the priority of the lien-holders over the interest the appellant company then had or any right the appellant company then had in relation to the land or the title to the land. I am not at this moment satisfied that the appellant company would not acquire in virtue of the transfers of the 18th of May, 1912, the right to register a charge. It may well, I think, be doubted whether sec. 35 of the \"Land Registry Act\" has any application to such a case. There is authority for the proposition that a vendor under a contract for the sale of land is not entitled to transfer his title in such a way as to put it out of his power to carry out his contract with the vendee and that the vendee may obtain an injunction to restrain him from doing so. Echliff v. Baldwin[2]; Spiller v. Spiller[3], and if that be the correct view of the vendor's position it is perfectly clear that the registrar having notice of the agreement for sale with Patterson could not properly register the appellant company as owner in absolute fee subject to a charge in favour of Patterson; while on the other hand there could be no doubt of the right of the vendor to charge the interest in the land held by him as security for the payment of the purchase money subject to the rights of the purchaser. However that may be, it is very clear to my mind that the appellant company lost its status with respect to the registered title (which I am inclined to think it might have maintained) by its acquiescence in the registrar's notice of cancellation of the 10th of July, 1913. My reason for thinking so is this. The lien-holders by registration under sec. 19 of the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" acquired the status of incumbrancees, a status recognized by sec. 22, 1 g., of the \"Land Regis- try Act\" and became at least on the registration of the lien affidavits on the 25th Oct., 1912, the holders of a charge or incumbrance on \"registered real estate\" and therefore by force of sec. 28, ch. 15, British Columbia statutes of 1912 they were unaffected by any notice, expressed, implied or constructive of any unregistered title, interest or disposition in or relating to the property in question unless an application for the registration of such interest or disposition was then \"pending.\" I have come to the conclusion and in this I concur with what I take to be the opinion of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, that where an application to the registrar has been cancelled under the provisions of sec. 108 of the \"Land Registry Act,\" the application must be deemed, for the purposes of the \"Land Registry Act\" and particularly for the purpose of applying sec. 28 of the Act of 1912, to have been void ab initio; and it follows, of course, that when the lien affidavits were registered there was, in contemplation of law, no application for registration of the appellant company's interest \"pending.\" We may therefore put aside as having no bearing on the question of law raised for decision, any considerations based upon suggestions of notice by reason of the presence in the Land Registry Office of the application of the 22nd of May and the documents by which it was supported.\nThe effect of section 104 seems to be conclusive in point of law against the appellant company. The instruments of the 18th of May could not in the sense of that section \"pass any estate or interest either at law or in equity.\" It is quite true that they confer a right to registration but there can be no manner of doubt, I think that this right to be registered can only take effect as against registered interests through the instrumentality of an application to register consummated by registration.\nIt follows that, if the appellant company had been made a party to the proceedings, its claim of priority must have failed; and it has therefore suffered no substantial wrong calling for the intervention of this court.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Having regard to the provisions of sec. 104(1) and (2) and sec. 108(1) and (2) of the \"Land Registry Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 127, as amended by ch. 15, sec. 28 of the statutes of 1912 and ch. 43, sec. 63, of the statutes of 1914, the appellant company, in my opinion, had \"no estate or interest either at law or in equity,\" in the land in question which made it a proper or necessary party to the mechanics' lien action under the judgment in which the respondent derived his title. Levy v. Gleason[4]; Goddard v. Slingerland[5]. Nor had it any estate or interest of which the plaintiffs in that action or the present respondent should be deemed to have had \"any notice express, implied or constructive.\"\nThe plaintiffs in the mechanics' lien action were \"holders of a charge or incumbrance\" on the registered land in question, their liens having been duly filed against it in the Land Registry Office on the 25th of October, and action thereon commenced on the 31st of October, 1912. Neither of the \"title (or) interest\" asserted by the appellant, nor of the \"disposition\" under which it claims, was \"the registration * * * pending\" when the mechanics' liens arose, when they were registered, when action on them was brought when judgment therein was recovered, when sale of the land was ordered, or when it was effected and conveyance thereof was made to the respondent. (May, 1912\u2014March, 1914.) This I take to be the effect under sec. 108(2) of the final refusal of the appellant's two applications for registration made respectively on the 22nd of May, 1912, and the 31st of October, 1913. They thereby became \" cancelled and void\" and questions of title must, as to \"strangers,\" be dealt with as if they had never been made. The conveyance of March, 1914, transferred to the respondent whatever estate or interest in the lands in question any of the defendants to the mechanics' lien action had. One of them, Passage, was the registered owner of an indefeasible fee and the holder of the only estate or interest in the lands in question of which, under the circumstances of this case, the \"Land Registry Act\" permits the courts to take cognizance. By that transfer the respondent obtained \"the right to apply to have such conveyance registered,\" which, by his application of the 26th of June, 1914, he asserted prior (see sub-secs. 72-3) to the only application for registration of the appellant company now extant\u2014that made on the 13th of August, 1914. That company is, quoad the respondent, a \"stranger,\" in the same position as if the instrument under which it claims had been executed on the date on which that application was made.\nThe authorities cited on behalf of the appellant appear to be readily distinguishable from the case at bar. It has no equity such as was recognized in Barry v. Heider, et al.[6] There was no fraud such as formed the ground of relief in McEllister v. Biggs[7] ; and in Chapman v. Edwards[8]. The unregistered conveyance on which it founds its claim was not made prior to the 1st of July, 1905, as was that recognized in Howard v. Miller[9]. Section 104(1) applies to it and not sec. 105 (formerly sec. 75).\nMoreover, although the appellant holds a transfer absolute in form, the interest which it asserts is only that of a chargee or mortgagee. The advance in respect of which that interest is claimed was made on the 18th of May, 1912\u2014the date of the transfer. The work for which the mechanics' liens were claimed began between the 1st and the 15th of May, 1912. Although it is somewhat obscurely framed, the probable purpose of clause (a) of sec. 9 of the \"Mechanics' Liens Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 154, would seem to be to postpone the claim of a mortgagee in respect of advances made subsequently to the commencement of the works to the rights of the lien-holders. If the appellant had duly applied for registration it might nevertheless as a subsequent incumbrancer have been entitled to be given an opportunity in the lien action to redeem the lien-holders. Any such right which it might otherwise have had, however, it lost through failure to make an effective application for registration until after the land had been sold to the respondent.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Rivard K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The action is really for trespass although referred to throughout as an action n\u00e9gatoire. No question of servitude arises, the plaintiffs, now respondents, complain that the defendant entered on their land and pulled down some fences. The appellant, defendant below, pleads that there is a road across the plaintiffs' property which he is entitled to use as one of the general public. It is admitted that the road exists and has been for some years used as a thoroughfare by the public on sufferance, as alleged by the plaintiffs and as of right as the defendant contends, and that is the sole issue.\nThe road was admittedly laid out and built by the plaintiffs, and to succeed the defendant must shew that it became a public highway, either by dedication or by prescriptive user during the statutable time;\u2014 assuming the statute of Canada 18 Vict. ch. 100, sec. 41, sub-secs. 8 and 9 to be in force and applicable.\nMy brother Brodeur discusses so ably and fully the legal effect of articles 749 and 750 M.C. that it will be unnecessary for me to do more than refer to what he says on that aspect of the case.\nWere it not for the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[1], I would be disposed to doubt that the principle of dedication as applied in English law is known to the civil law, and to hold that, in the absence of statute, the right of road in Quebec must be based upon the fact of user by the public, as a matter of right, for the full period of the long prescription, thirty years. Contrary to the rule of the English law when a road became a public highway in Quebec the soil of the road was, before the Municipal Code, vested in the Crown; arts. 400 C.C. and 743 M.C. De la Chevroti\u00e8re v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[2]; and a deed of gift must under pain of nullity be executed in notarial form (art. 776 C.C). But the rule in Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[3] has been adopted and followed in the Quebec Courts so universally and for such a length of time that it must now be accepted as definitely fixing the law and I feel bound to hold that a public right of way may be constituted in Quebec by direct or indirect dedication.\nAs Dorion C.J. said in Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e93:\nC'est aux tribunaux \u00e0 juger si, d'apr\u00e9s les circonstances, le public a joui d'un chemin assez longtemps pour faire pr\u00e9sumer que le propri\u00e9taire en a fait l'abandon.\nThere has been considerable diversity of opinion amongst the judges of the courts below. I have perused those opinions with much advantage and have with great care considered the opinions of those from whom I differ. In the result I have come to the conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Review is right and should be restored.\nThe learned trial judge seems to have assumed that in the absence of evidence of direct dedication made by deed or declaration of the owner the public could acquire no right in the highway. He does not appear to have considered the possibility of an implied dedication presumed from an acquiescence by the owners in the use made by the public of the highway which they themselves laid out. The uniformly accepted doctrine is thus expressed in Smith's Leading Cases (1915), volume 2, page 166:\u2014\nExcept where it is expressly created by statute, a highway derives its existence from a dedication to the public by the owner of land of a right of passage over it. This dedication, though it be not made in express terms, as it seldom is, may and generally will be presumed from an uninterrupted use by the public of the right of way claimed.\nIn Rex v. Lloyd[4], it was held:\u2014\nIf the owner of the soil throws open a passage, and neither marks by visible distinction, that he means to preserve his rights over it, nor excludes persons from passing through it by positive prohibition he shall be presumed to have dedicated it to the public.\nIn Mann v. Brodie[5], Lord Blackburn quotes the passage in Poole v. Huskinson[6], where Baron Parke states the principle of the law and then says:\u2014\nBut it has always been held that where there has been evidence of a user by the public so long and in such a manner that the owner of the fee, whoever he was, must have been aware that the public were acting under the belief that the way had been dedicated, and has taken no steps to disabuse them of that belief, it is not conclusive evidence, but evidence on which those who have to find the fact may find that there was a dedication by the owner whoever he was.\nAnd in Folkestone Corporation v. Brockman[7], Lord Atkinson, at page 368, referring to Taylor on Evidence, 9th edition, par. 131, adds:\u2014\nThe statement of the law in that paragraph is perfectly accurate, and is supported by the six authorities mentioned in the notes. It is to this effect that the uninterrupted user of a road justifies a presumption in favour of the original animus dedicandi even against the Crown.\nThe doctrine of dedication, as had been recently said, is based in all the decided cases, upon the proposition that a person cannot lead the general public or a local public, to base their action, and build up their fabric of life upon the theory of permission of a certain kind, on his part, in respect of his land, and when they have thus accommodated their affairs to this expectation, violate the confidence thus invited. I admit, of course, with my brother Anglin, that theoretically there must be intention on the part of the private owner, but such intention may be and in almost every instance is, shewn exclusively by his physical acts; and the requirements of intent on his part is hardly more than theory. Indeed, the private owner's action is ordinarily such that he would be estopped to deny the existence of an intention on his part.\nIn that view of the law, are we, in presence of the conflicting findings of fact in the courts below, in a position to say, that the defendant, upon whom lay the burden of proving dedication, has satisfied his obligation? As Sir Montague Smith said in Turner v. Walsh[8]:\u2014\nThe proper way * * * is to look at the whole of the evidence together, to see whether there has been such a continuous and connected user as is sufficient to raise the presumption of dedication; and the presumption, if it can be made, is of a complete dedication, coeval with the early user. You refer the whole of the user to a lawful origin rather than to a series of trespasses.\nConsidering the whole evidence in the light of that doctrine and with great deference for the opinions of those who differ from me, I am driven irresistibly to the conclusion that the defendant has made out his defence.\nThe facts proved and as to which there is practically no dispute are: that the plaintiff company, owners of large cotton mills, for their own benefit and incidentally for the convenience of their employees, built upon the lot of land known in these proceedings under the No. 59 (a), and across which the road in question runs, two rows of houses facing the river and separated by a road. To enable the employees, occupants of the houses, to reach the mills situate below, on the shore of the river in the village of Montmorency Falls, a road or way was necessary. But it was equally important that those employees should have a means of access to the public road above known as \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville\" which winding down the hillside led from the village known as St. Louis de Courville to Montmorency village. Otherwise they would be cut off from communication with the centres upon which they were dependent for the daily needs of themselves and their families. All their purveyors, such as the baker, butcher, etc. lived in those villages. To provide those necessary conveniences, a macadamized road 36 feet wide was built. This road started from the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville\" to the north and continued down below the houses built for the employees where it was connected with a plank boardwalk which in turn opened into a stairway leading down the steep hillside to the public road below. So that the company built a continuous way leading from one public road to another and which is proved to have been travelled for 14 or 15 years openly, freely and without objection during all seasons and at all hours of the day and night, not only by those who had business with the company's employees but also as a way of access to the villages of Montmorency Falls and St. Louis de Courville.\nThe plaintiffs, respondents, in their factum say that as originally built the road did not extend to the brink of the hill and that up to June, 1905, it terminated at a grassy ground where the children of the employees could play and amuse themselves at ease and that that construction of the stairs is posterior to 14th June, 1905.\nAdmitting this to be the fact, there may be a highway through a place which is no thoroughfare, as Campbell C.J. said in Bateman v. Bluck[9]. Take the case of a large square with only one entrance, the owner of which has, for many years, permitted all persons to go into and round it; it would be strange if he could afterwards treat all persons entering it, except the inhabitants, as trespassers. That case seems to be on all fours with the case which the plaintiff company present in their factum. But in fact it appears by the plans filed and from the description of the locality given by the witnesses that without the stairs the road would not give the employees the convenience of access to the mills; which was the chief object of the company. And one rather expects to hear such witnesses as Mailloux, the superintendent of the mill, Cot\u00e9 who actually built the stairs for the company, and Cur\u00e9 Ruelle who sold them the land, frankly say, when examined as witnesses, that the stairs were built at the same time as the houses, that is to say, 14 or 15 years before the suit was brought.\nWe have therefore a road built by the plaintiffs admittedly to connect the \"Cote \u00e0 Courville\" with another public road at Montmorency village having all the outward physical characteristics of a public highway, without a gate, barrier, sign-post or anything to indicate an intention on the part of the proprietor to limit its use. It is also in evidence that the road was used from the very beginning not only by the local public for their convenience but also by those who travelled by the electric railway to and from the City of Quebec. Leclerc, the instigator of this suit says, in answer to a question:\nIl vient des voitures de tout bord et de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nCur\u00e9 Ruelle says in effect, when examined for the plaintiffs, that this road is used by the public in preference to the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville,\" because it is a short cut, and without objection until these proceedings were started. It is also worthy of notice, as evidence of the intention of the owners of the land to dedicate to the public the highway they had opened, that they did not reserve the use of all the lodgings in the buildings for their employees. One of the tenements was rented to a grocer named Vachon, who did business with all those from the outside that he could reach, and it is proved that scores of people, who had no connection whatever with the company or its employees, used the road to come to his store. To the east of the highway in question, an hospital and a laundry had been built with access to the road, and those who had business with either used the road at will. The appellant Harvey had a blacksmith shop on the land he still occupies and he tells us that the public used this road without let or hindrance to reach that shop which was afterwards rented to Vachon, the company's tenant, and he, Vachon, used it as a storehouse to which his customers from the outside had access. It would be difficult to find a case in which a highway had been used more universally and for more varied purposes by the people of the neighbourhood. If, as the evidence establishes, the company built a road of the regulation width, of the material usually employed in the construction of public thoroughfares to connect two public municipal roads and permitted the general public to use it as of right for over 12 years, the presumption of dedication is in my opinion irresistible. In Dovaston v. Payne[10], eight years' user was held to shew sufficient acceptance and in the much litigated case to which I have already referred of Bateman v. Bluck[11], six years sufficed. The creation of a public lane in private land by informal dealings of the land owner with the public over as short a period as eighteen months, was held sufficient. In North London Rly. Co. v. Vestry of St. Mary[12], and in Reg. v. Petrie[13], the Court permitted a jury to find an instantaneous dedication. Mere occasional use had been held to support a title in the public, Mildred v. Weaver[14].\nThere is no evidence here that the company ever seriously objected to the use of the road by the public as of right. It is on the contrary established that this whole difficulty has arisen out of a conflict between one of the tenants of the company, not an employee, who complained of the business competition the defendant gave him.\nI am of opinion that there has been such evidence of user by the public of the right of way with the acquiescence of the owner as to justify the defendant's plea and that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial question between the parties to this appeal is whether a certain roadway running through plaintiffs' land was a public road or not.\nThere was much difference of judicial opinion in the courts below, the trial judge holding the roadway not to be a public way, the Court of Review reversing that judgment and holding it to be a public way and the Court of King's Bench (Pelletier J. dissenting) in turn reversing the latter judgment and restoring that of the trial judge.\nThe appellant relied largely upon the statute of Canada 18 Vict., ch. 100, sec. 41, sub-sec. 9, which he held applicable to the road in question and contained the law on the subject.\nThat section and the preceding one, which must be read with it, are as follows:\u2014\n8. Every road declared a Public Highway by any Proc\u00e8s-Verbal, By-law or Order of any Grand Voyer, Warden, Commissioner or Municipal Council, legally made, and in force when this Act shall commence, shall be held to be a Road within the meaning of this Act, until it be otherwise ordered by competent authority.\n9. And any road left open to and used as such by the public, without contestation of their right, during a period of ten years or upwards, shall be held to have been legally declared a Public Highway by some competent authority as aforesaid, and to be a Road within the meaning of this Act.\nThe question which immediately arises is not whether those sub-sections are in force for the purposes and objects for which they were passed but whether they were intended as a general law and operative as such until repealed expressly or impliedly.\nAs a fact they have not been expressly repealed but they do not appear in the later statute of 1860 which was an Act to consolidate the Act 18 Vict. ch. 100 and its amendments, or in any later Act as one would suppose they would if they were not merely temporary provisions but general ones.\nThey are both sub-sections of section 41 of the \"Municipal Road Act\" of 1855, and are connected together by the conjunction \"and.\" They deal with the same subject matter, roads, and, it seems to me, must be read and construed together.\nSub-section 8 enacted that every road declared a public highway by any proc\u00e8s-verbal, by-law, etc. legally made and in force when this Act shall commence, shall be held to be a road, etc.\nSub-section 9 enacts that any road left open to and used as such by the public without contestation of their rights during a period of ten years shall be held to have been legally declared a public highway by some competent authority as aforesaid. These last words \"as aforesaid\" clearly refer to the authorities expressly mentioned in sub-section 8. Under the one subsection the declaration of the proc\u00e8s-verbal in force when the Act began to run declaring a road to be a public highway was sufficient. Under the other sub-section (9) after ten years uncontested user by the public of any road it\nshall be held to have been legally declared a public highway by some competent authority as aforesaid.\nSub-section 8 was clearly a temporary provision having reference only to roads in existence at the date of the coming into force of the Act and, as I have said, I think subsection 9 should be read with it and construed as limited to roads which had on the 1st July, 1855, been left open and used as such by the public without contestation of their right for ten years and upwards. That view of the scope of their provisions would account for their non-appearance in subsequent revisions of the statute as also for their not having been expressly repealed. This was the view expressed by Mr. Justice Burbidge in the case of Bourget v. The Queen[15].\nSeveral Quebec authorities were cited as shewing that a contrary view was held as to the scope of sub section 9 of several judges. But I do not think that in any of the cases cited the express question I am now dealing with had been raised. The general character of the sub-section was assumed. Of course, if there had been decisions establishing a jurisprudence on the point in the province, I would not venture to challenge it. Mr. Taschereau, however, also relied upon arts. 749 and 750 of the Municipal Code of Quebec as a second string to his bow. He contended that these articles did not abrogate the 8th and 9th subsections of section 41 of the \"Municipal Act\" of 18 Vict., although they contain no limit as to time.\nHe was obliged however to concede that for the greater part of its length this road in question was not \"fenced on each side or otherwise divided from the adjoining land,\" as required by the statute to make it a statutory road. As I understood him, however, he contended that for the comparatively short distance it was so divided, the road would be held to be a public road. I cannot agree with such an interpretation and can see that it might if adopted lead to great injustice. It was suggested, but I do not think pressed, that the sidewalk would be such a division as the statute contemplates. I cannot accept the suggestion. The \"otherwise divided\" in the article means by fences, as expressed, or something equivalent to fences and having the same effect, such as buildings, etc.\nI will not labour this branch of the case further than to say that upon it I fully concur with the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Cross in his judgment in the Court of King's Bench.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of opinion that 18 Vict., ch. 100, sec. 41, sub-sec. 9, was not intended to be merely retrospective and is still in force and operative as each occasion or situation created by the development of facts fitting its terms arises; of which those bearing upon the existence of the road in question for the prescribed term of ten years seem to be such as to establish at least the greater part of the road now in question as a public road.\nThe law relative to dedication has always been somewhat difficult of application by reason of its requiring evidence of the intention in the mind of the owner to dedicate, and again of an acceptance thereof by some authority representing the public to establish dedication.\nThe said section seems designed to simplify the means of proof and by such an enactment to establish by way of prescription a road when it has been used by the public for ten years without contestation by the owner.\nIs it possible that the simplicity of the enactment so perplexed those judicially or legislatively concerned in its application as to render its efficacy a matter of doubt?\nHowever that may be, I think the enactment is not in conflict with articles 749 and 750 of the Municipal Code, and both standing together render the road in question a public highway.\nThe difficulty about it not being throughout a road over which teams can pass seems imaginary, for a public road may be a cul-de-sac, or its width capacity or utility be measured by that kind of traffic for which it has been used by the public without contestation for ten years and upwards.\nI think the appeal should.be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Court of Review be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014The question to be determined in this action is whether a road opened in 1900 by the Montmorency Cotton Company, the predecessors in title of the plaintiff company, on cadastral lot 59a, owned by them, is now of such a public character that the plaintiff company cannot control its use or exclude the public therefrom.\nThe Montmorency Cotton Company acquired lot 59a from Joseph Cauchon on the 23rd December, 1899, for the purpose of constructing dwellings thereon for the employees of its mills. It proceeded immediately to carry out that purpose and erected two blocks of apartments each facing on a cross road laid out by it. Each of these cross-roads debouches at its eastern end into the road in question. This latter road is 36 feet wide and runs southerly some 283 feet, along the eastern side of lot 59a, from the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville,\" a public highway, out of which it opens at its northern end. To the south it terminates in a field, part of lot 59a, about 125 feet north of the edge of a precipitous cliff. Beneath this cliff are situated the mills of the company, the church of the Parish of St. Gr\u00e9goire, the electric railway station and the \"Cote \u00e0 Courville,\" which descends from the point at which the road in question leads from it, sweeping in a semi-circle first easterly, then southerly and finally westerly. At some later date not distinctly shewn, but apparently shortly after its purchase from Cauchon, the Montmorency Cotton Company, in order to establish more direct communication for its employees between their dwellings on lot 59a and the company's mills, acquired from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation a right of way, together with the right of constructing a stairway down the face of the cliff. In June, 1905, the Montmorency Cotton Company sold its undertaking, including lot 59a, to the plaintiff company. To the north of the plaintiff's property and above the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville\" was the village of St. Louis de Courville, which had a population of some 200 to 300 families, and the Beauport Road. To the east of the road now in question and between it and the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville\" lay private property from which it was separated by a fence maintained with indifferent care.\nThe defendant Harvey is the proprietor of a grocery shop built facing the east side of the road in question on property purchased by him in 1907 from M. le Cur\u00e9 Ruel. With this property he acquired a lane or passage giving him access to the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville\" to the east. Used for a short time as a forge, Harvey's building was afterwards rented as a storehouse for several years to one Vachon, who kept a grocery shop on the plaintiffs' property on the opposite side of the road in question. Harvey resumed possession of his premises and opened a grocery business there during the fall of 1913. The entrance to his shop was from the road in question through a break in the fence between it and the plaintiff's property. One Leclerc subsequently leased the Vachon shop from the plaintiffs for a similar business. Wishing to destroy the competition of Harvey, through Paul Leclerc, his brother, one of its employees, he urged the plaintiff company to take steps to exclude Harvey from access to the road in question. The company first formally contested the right of user of the road by the public on the 30th May, 1914, by placing at its entrance in the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville\" a notice, \"Chemin Priv\u00e9,\" and about the same time it caused a barrier to be erected closing the opening in the fence opposite Harvey's shop. This action n\u00e9gatoire was begun on the 15th June, 1914, and the trial took place in October, 1914\nSuch, in outline, are the essential facts. While other facts which appear to be material will be noticed in dealing with the several aspects in which the defence is presented, for a more detailed and complete statement, reference may be had to the opinions in the courts below.\nThe plaintiffs having shewn that the property covered by the road was conveyed to them as part of cadastral lot 59a, the burden is on the defendant to establish his right to use it. Not alleging anything in the nature of a private right of way over it, he has undertaken to prove that the public has had from the time of its opening, or has since acquired, rights in the road of such a nature that the plaintiffs cannot now prevent their exercise. This he has endeavoured to do on three distinct grounds:\n(a) That dedication to the public has been shewn;\n(b) That under arts. 749 and 750 of the Municipal Code the road has become a municipal road;\n(c) That under art. 9 of sec. 41 of 18 Vict., ch. 100, (hereinafter referred to as art. 9) it has become a public road.\nAssuming that under the law of Quebec, notwithstanding the provisions of arts. 549 and 776 C.C., dedication of a road to the public may be proved by evidence of conduct and acquiescence, as some authorities entitled to great weight indicate, I need only refer to Chavigny de la Chevroti\u00e8re v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[16]; Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[17]; and Rhodes v. P\u00e9russe[18], any intention on the part of the respondent company or its predecessor to dedicate the road in question as a highway is, in my opinion, rebutted by the circumstances in evidence before us\u2014notably by the facts that the purpose of the company in opening the road was to afford to its employees for whom it had constructed dwellings on lot 59a direct and convenient access to and from the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville\" above and that its purpose in acquiring a right of way and constructing a stairway down the cliff on the property of the Episcopal Corporation was to afford the same employees a direct and convenient means of communication between their dwellings and the company's works; that the company constructed and has since maintained and cared for the road and the sidewalk upon it as well as the stairway down the cliffside at its own expense; and that a fence was erected and maintained shutting off the property on the east side of the road from access to it except where breaks were from time to time made, Roberts v. Karr[19], whereas it was left open and directly accessible from the\" remainder of lot 59a. There is in addition the cogent evidence of the appellant himself and of M. le Cur\u00e9 Ruel that until quite recently, when the idea was spread abroad that ten years' user had made of it a public road, the road in question was regarded by them as a private road, the property of the company, to which the one had not the right to take, or the other the right to give, an exit from the lot bought by Harvey from M. le Cur\u00e9, and the further important fact, not contested, that Harvey himself, as recently as 1914, took part with an official of the plaintiff company in defining the line between properties lying to the east of it, including his own, and the roadway in question for the purpose of having the fence separating them from the roadway rebuilt on the correct line of the eastern limit of the company's lands.\nWe have the authority of the Privy Council for the proposition that, although the law of Quebec as to the ownership of the soil of a road differs from the law of England (p. 159), in the matter of dedication to be presumed from long continued public user and absence of contestation evidencing an abandonment of right by those who might have disputed that user \"there seems to be no difference between the law of Lower Canada and the law of England and Scotland. Chavigny de la Chevroti\u00e8re v. Cite de Montr\u00e9al[20]. Long continued user by the public is only evidence of the intention to dedicate. Its value depends on the circumstances. Folkestone Corporation v. Brockman[21]; McGinnis v. Letourneau[22]. Abandonment or dedication to the public will not be lightly presumed. Chamberland v. Fortier[23]; Peters v. Sinclair[24]; affirmed in the Privy Council[25]; Corporation of St Martin v. Cantin[26].\nViewed most favourably to the defendant, the facts here in evidence are as consistent with an intention not to dedicate as with an intention to dedicate: and that will not suffice. Piggott v. Goldstraw[27]. But, as I have already said, the circumstances under which, and the manner in which the road was opened, I think, actually rebut an intention to dedicate it to the public, and the presumption to be drawn from long continued user is of \"a complete dedication coeval with the early user,\" Turner v. Walsh[28]. It must always be remembered that we are here dealing with a question of presumed intention, not with one of prescription. Dedication must rest upon intention. The clear and unequivocal proof from which intention to dedicate might properly be presumed in my opinion is not found in the record. Upon this aspect of the case I therefore agree with the views expressed in the Court of King's Bench by Mr. Justice Carroll and Mr. Justice Cross.\nNor does the evidence bring the case within arts. 749 and 750 of the Municipal Code. I find no difference, such as Mr. Justice Flynn suggested in the Court of Review, between the English and the French versions of those articles. \"Fenced on either side\" means not on one side or the other, but on each side, i.e., on both sides, and is the equivalent of \"cl\u00f4tur\u00e9s de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9.\" While the road in question was not habitually kept closed at its extremities,\" it was, in my opinion, not \"fenced on either side or otherwise divided off from the remaining land\" within the meaning of the articles under consideration. The fence on the east side of the road, though merely a line fence between adjoining properties of different proprietors, and not meant to define or separate it as a road from the adjoining lands but rather to exclude the owners of those lands from access to it, was possibly sufficient to meet the requirement of arts. 749 and 750 as to that side of the road. But on the west side, except possibly for a few feet at the extreme north end, there was no fence at all. The sidewalk was built on the roadway. The line of the buildings was not continuous, nor does it appear that they came out to the street line. There is no evidence of a ditch or other boundary mark. The road on this side was not \"fenced or otherwise divided off from the (company's) remaining land\" in any manner which met the requirements of arts. 749 and 750. On the contrary, it was enclosed as part of one property or holding with the remainder of lot 59a by the fence which separated it from the properties to the east. There is no suggestion of any separation of the southerly 25 feet, where a footpath or walk led across a field from the end of the defined roadway to the head of the stairway. Moreover, although those articles declare that lands or passages used as roads by the mere permission of the owner or occupant (chemins de tol\u00e9rance) are 'municipal roads\" if they fulfil the prescribed conditions it may not follow that the owners have lost all control over them or the right to close them. They retain the property in the soil and are subject to the obligation to maintain them. (Arts. 749 and 750 M.C.; compare arts. 748 and 752 M.C.) The municipality is liable for injuries sustained through defects in such roads (arts. 757 and 793 M.C.) and is, no doubt for that reason, empowered, not to close them itself, as it would probably have been authorized to do had they ceased to be \"chemins de tol\u00e9rance,\" but to order the owners or occupants to do so. Without further consideration I am not prepared to disagree with the view of Mr. Justice Malouin, Mr. Justice Carroll and Mr. Justice Cross that if the road in question was a municipal road within arts. 749 and 750 M.C., that fact would not prevent the owner exercising the right to close it or to forbid its use as a \"chemin de tol\u00e9rance.\"\nThe defence chiefly relied on, however, is that a prescriptive public right has arisen under 18 Vict. ch. 100, sec. 41, art. 9. The English and French texts of arts. 8 and 9 of sec. 41 of this statute are as follows:\u2014 8. Every road declared a Public Highway by any Proces Verbal, By-law or Order of any Grand Voyer, Warden, Commissioner or Municipal Council, legally made, and in force when this Act shall commence, shall be held to be a Road within the meaning of this Act, until it be otherwise ordered by competent authority.\n9. And any road left open to and used as such by the public, without contestation of their right, during a period of ten years or upwards, shall be held to have been legally declared a Public Highway by some competent authority as aforesaid, and to be a Road within the meaning of this Act.\n8. Tout chemin d\u00e9clar\u00e9 grand chemin public par un proc\u00e8s-verbal r\u00e8glement ou ordre d'un grand-voyer, pr\u00e9fet, commissaire, ou conseil municipal, l\u00e9galement dress\u00e9 et en vigueur au moment o\u00f9 cet acte entrera en op\u00e9ration, sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme chemin suivant l'esprit de cet acte, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il en soit autrement ordonn\u00e9 par l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente;\n9. Et tout chemin ouvert et fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 comme tel par le public, sans contestation de son droit, pendant l'espace de dix ann\u00e9es ou plus, sera cens\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement reconnu comme grand chemin public par quelque autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente comme susdit, et \u00eatre un chemin suivant l'esprit de cet acte.\nThree questions are involved in this branch of the case:\n(1) Is art. 9 still in force?\n(2) Does it apply to roads not already in existence for ten years when it was enacted?\n(3) Does the evidence establish a user by the public of the road as such for ten years prior to the 30th May, 1914?\nArt. 9 has not been expressly repealed and I find nothing in the Municipal Code or in any other Act to which our attention has been directed so repugnant to it or so inconsistent with it that repeal by implication would follow therefrom. I accept without hesitation the unanimous opinion of all the judges of the provincial courts who have dealt with this question in the present case, that art. 9 is still in force, which follows a practically uniform line of decisions extending from Parent v. Daigle[29], to Nolin v. Gosselin[30], if we except doubts expressed by Ramsay J. in Guy v. Cite de Montr\u00e9al[31], and by Boss\u00e9 J. in Fortin v. Truchon[32].\nThe other two questions cannot be so easily disposed of. For convenience I propose to deal with them in inverse order.\nI am, with deference, unable to accede to the \"consid\u00e9rant\" in the judgment of the Court of Appeal expressed in the following terms:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le public ne peut prescrire un chemin par l'usage qu'il en fait, en vertu de la loi 18 Vict. ch. 100, sec. 9, \u00e0 moins que cet usage ne soit exclusif de celui du propri\u00e9taire qui poss\u00e8de \u00e0 l'encontre du public.\nWe are now dealing not with a question of intention to dedicate, but with one of prescription. The statute does not exact a user exclusive of that of the owner of the soil and of his tenants as members of the public. For aught that appears there was nothing to distinguish their user of the road in the present case from the user by other members of the public. It did not amount to a contestation of the public right. All that the statute requires is a user of the road as such by the public without contestation of its right during ten years. I am, with great respect for the Court of King's Bench, in which the contrary view prevailed, of the opinion that the evidence fully establishes such a user.\nHad the traffic on the road been solely to and from the dwellings of the company's employees it might be urged with much force, notwithstanding its extent, that it was throughout a private user by permission of the company. I am not certain that traffic to and from Vachon's shop, since he was a tenant of the company, might not be viewed in the same light. But the traffic of the residents of St. Louis de Courville to and from the railway station and to and from the church was certainly not of that character. It was undoubtedly a user of the road as such by the public. There is a mass of evidence that this user has been very extensive and has been going on without let or hindrance for over fourteen years.\nFrom the wording of the transfer of the right of way down the face of the cliff in the deed from the Montmorency Cotton Company to the Dominion Textile Company Mr. Justice Carroll has drawn the inference that the stairway down the cliffside was built after that deed was executed (June 15th, 1905) and that the traffic to and from St. Louis de Courville therefore began within ten years before the present action was instituted. But, although if that were the fact it could have been readily established, there is not a tittle of actual evidence to that effect. The deed of the right of way from the Episcopal Corporation to the Montmorency Cotton Company is not in evidence. Even its date has not been given. The description of the right of way in the deed of June, 1905, was not improbably copied from the deed given by the Episcopal Corporation. It bears some internal evidence that it was. The words \"by the said company,\" if in the earlier deed, would there refer only to the purchasers, the Montmorency Cotton Company. No other company was a party to that deed. In the deed of 1905 the reference is ambiguous. It may be either to the vendor company or to the purchaser company. Both were parties to it. If the description was copied from the earlier deed the use of these words is accounted for and the presence of the words by a flight of steps or footpath to be made, placed and maintained thereon,\nin the deed of 1905, notwithstanding that the stairway had already been constructed, is also explained.\nBut any inference from the language of that deed cannot weigh for a moment against such positive and uncontradicted testimony as that of Philippe C\u00f4t\u00e9 who says that he has used the stairway for fourteen or fifteen years, that it was built at the same time as the block of dwellings, and that it was he who arranged the foot of the stairway where it joins the \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville.\" Antoine Mailloux, the plaintiff company's superintendent, though he cannot say just when the stairway was built\u2014a little after the block he thinks\u2014 says the public has made use of the road and stairway for fifteen years. M. le Cure Ruel says the road has been built as it now is for about fifteen years and has been used by the public with the stairway during that period in coming to and going from his church. There was no church at St. Louis de Courville until recently. The road and stairway were also used in going to and from a hospital which was situated for a couple of years on its east side near the north end. Vital Giroux says many people arriving by the electric cars used the stairs and road for fifteen years past and that they were also used by the public in going to church. J. W. St. Pierre says everybody (tout le monde) has used the road like any other public road since the stairway was built\u2014for fifteen years\u2014and he refers specially to the traffic of residents of St. Louis de Courville to and from the electric cars. Adelard Lortie, Mayor of the Village of Montmorency, says that for fifteen years the public has treated the road as a public road without any hindrance. Even Paul Leclerc admits that the road was used for traffic of all kinds publicly, openly and without obstruction, and that it was regarded as a public road.\nThese are all witnesses called for the company. Taken with the evidence given for the defendant their testimony puts beyond doubt the character and the extent of the user by the public of the road as a public road, without any contestation of its right, for a period upwards of ten years. On this point I find myself in accord with the conclusion of Mr. Justice Pelletier and the learned judges who sat in the Court of Review.\nIt therefore becomes necessary to decide whether art. 9 of sec. 41 of the 18 Vict., ch. 100, applies to a road first opened, as was that here in question, in 1899 or 1900. The appellant insists that it should be held that it does both upon the proper construction of its terms and because, as he maintains, that view has been taken of it in a long and unbroken series of decisions in the Quebec courts and has thus become a recognized rule in regard to public rights and property which should not lightly be broken in upon or disturbed.\nWithout questioning our right to review and, if thought proper, to overrule even a long series of provincial decisions based on an erroneous construction 'of a statute, Hamilton v. Baker, \"The Sara\"[33]; Maddison v. Emmerson[34]: having regard to the nature of the subject and to practical results, although the doctrine of stare decisis has not been accepted under the French system to the same extent as in English jurisprudence, I should probably have thought it the better course not to interfere with a uniform and unquestioned line of decisions which people had considered as having settled the law on a particular subject and had acted on for a long period. London County Council v. Churchwardens etc. of Erith[35]; Morgan v. Fear[36]; Cohen v. Bayley-Worthington[37]. But it is necessary to examine with some care the line of cases alleged to be numerous and uniform, because a decision, though followed, if it has been often questioned and doubted is clearly open for reconsideration in a court of superior jurisdiction. The \"Bernina\"[38]; Pearson v. Pearson[39]; (overruled on other grounds); The Queen v. Edwards[40]. I shall therefore briefly refer in chronological order to the cases cited in the judgments below and in the factums.\nIn Johnson v. Archambault[41], the Court of Queen's Bench dealt with a lane which it held to have been a public street long before 1834. No reference is made to art. 9.\nIn Parent v. Daigle[42], Meredith C.J. and Stuart J. treated art. 9 as in force and applicable to the road there in question, which, however,\nhad been used * * * as a public road for thirty years and upwards, in fact as long ago as the time to which the memory of the oldest witnesses examined in the case can extend.\nIn Th\u00e9oret v. Ouimet[43], the road dealt with had always served the purposes of the neighbouring proprietors and the court held that the defendant had obstructed this road without any right or title. No allusion is made to art. 9.\nIn Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[44], the Court of King's Bench, Dorion C.J. presiding, again applied the same statute (pp. 127, 128); but the road dealt with had been open and in public use for over sixty years and both the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Tessier, who alone delivered judgments, upheld the public right as having been acquired by prescription \"de droit commun.\"\nIn Guy v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[45], the decision rests on dedication and Dorion C.J. refers to Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[46], as an authority that for dedication a title in writing is not necessary. The street in question had been referred to as a highway in a petition made in 1831. In this case Ramsay J. who had sat in Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e946, questions whether art. 9 is in force, and is not prepared to say that he \"feels bound by the dictum in Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e946.'\nIn Chavigny de la Chevroti\u00e8re v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[47], the statutory provision dealt with is not art. 9 of sec. 41 of the 18 Vict., ch. 100, which does not apply to Montreal, but a somewhat similar provision of 23 Vict., ch. 72, which is the charter of the City of Montreal and applies to it alone. As such its non-inclusion in th revised statutes of course lacks the significance which attaches to the omission therefrom of art. 9 of sec. 41 of the 18 Vict., ch. 100. Their Lordships held that there was\nevidence of long user and an abandonment of right by those who could have disputed that user sufficient to sustain at common law the public right.\nThis case affords no assistance in the construction of art. 9.\nIn Bourget v. The Queen[48], Burbidge J. having held that dedication was established, added, at page 7, that in his opinion art. 9 was a temporary provision having reference to roads in existence at the date when it came into force and in public use for ten years theretofore. In Fortin v. Truchon[49], the Court of King's Bench held that the evidence did not establish a ten years' user without contestation of right. But Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, who alone appears to have delivered reasons for the judgment, said, in the course of his opinion,\nC'est une question fort douteuse que de savoir si la section cit\u00e9e de la 18 V., \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 en vigueur sous notre code municipal.\nIn Childs v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[50], Pagnuelo J. although he disposed of the case on the ground of dedication, refers incidentally, at page 398, to art. 9 as being in force and as having been reproduced in the charter of Montreal, 23 Vict., ch. 72.\nIn Leveill\u00e9 v. Cite de Montr\u00e9al[51], Mathieu J. at pages 419-20, makes a similar passing reference to the statute.\nIn Lavertu v. Corporation de St. Romuald[52], Andrews J. at page 260, cites Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[53]; Guy v. Cit\u00e9 de Montreal[54], and Childs v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[55], as authorities on the effect of user of a road opened in 1870\u2014a question, he adds, not before him.\nTown of Westmount v. Warminton[56], was also a case of dedication (destination). Blanchet J. who alone delivered reasons for the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, said, at page 114, that in his opinion art. 9, though not repealed, is restricted in its application to roads existing before the 1st of July, 1855, the date of its adoption.\nIn Banque Jacques Cartier v. Gauthier[57], Ouimet J. in giving the judgment of the Superior Court, at page 251, refers to art. 9 as applicable to a modern street on the authority of Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[58]; Childs v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[59]; Bourget v. The Queen[60]; Johnson v. Archambault[61]; Guy v. Cit\u00e9 de Montreal[62] and Town of Westmount v. Warminton[63]. His judgment was reversed, however, in the Court of Appeal on other grounds, and no allusion is there made to art. 9.\nIn Jones v. Village of Asbestos[64], Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice Sir Francis) Lemieux refers to art. 9 as not abrogated and an existing means by which the public may acquire a highway. The learned judge, however, held that dedication was established and the report does not shew when the user of the highway in question had begun\nIn Shorey v. Cook[65], Dunlop J. held a road to be established as a highway by dedication. He also expressed the view that art. 9 was in force and applicable to a street in use since 1892.\nThe King v. Leclaire[66], Lavergne J. says, at p. 219:\nThe prescription established by 18 V., c. 100, art. 9 of s. 41, as to possession during ten years by a municipal corporation must be restricted to roads existing before the 1st July, 1855.\nIn Rhodes v. P\u00e9russe[67], this Court held that there was complete, clear and unequivocal evidence of dedication, and there had been public user for over thirty years. No reference is made to art. 9.\nIn Nolin v. Gosselin[68], a road in public use for ten years after an attempt had been made in 1856 by the council of the municipality to abolish it was held by the Court of King's Bench to be a public highway, presumably under art. 9. But the Court also held that the road had not been in fact abolished within the meaning of art. 753 M.C. Mr. Justice Carroll was of the opinion that art. 9 was inapplicable, but agreed in holding that the road had not been abolished.\nIn applying the doctrine of stare decisis it must always be borne in mind that only that part of a judicial decision is binding as authority which enunciates the principle on which the question before the court has been actually determined, Kreglinger (G. & C.) v. New Patagonia Meat & Cold Storage Co. Ltd.[69], and that mere dicta, even in speeches of individaul members of the House of Lords, while no doubt entitled to the greatest respect, do not bind even the lowest courts. Latham v. Johnson[70].\nAn analysis of the Quebec cases in which art. 9 has been referred to shews that in only one instance\u2014 and that as late as 1912\u2014(Nolin v. Gosselin[71]), has the Court of Appeal held it applicable to a road opened after it was enacted. In two other Court of Appeal cases, Fortin v. Truchon[72] and Town of Westmount v. Warminton[73], the sole opinion delivered in each casts doubt on the point, Boss\u00e9 J. in the former questioning whether the provision is in force and Blanchet J. in the latter expressing the view that it applies only to roads existing before its enactment. In one of the two remaining cases referred to, Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[74], the question now under consideration did not arise, and in the other, Guy v. Cite de Montr'\u00e9al[75], Ramsay J. referring to the view expressed in Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e974, that the article in question is in force, as a dictum, was not prepared to say he felt bound by it.\nIn four cases in the Superior Court, art. 9 has been treated as applicable to roads opened since 1855\u2014 Lavertu v. Corporation de St. Romuald[76], (Andrews J.); Banque Jacques Cartier v. Gauthier[77], (Ouimet J.); Shorey v. Cook[78], (Dunlop J.), and Jones v. Village of Asbestos[79], (Lemieux J.). In Childs v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[80], Pagnuelo J. and in L\u00e9veill\u00e9 v. Cite de Montr\u00e9al[81], Mathieu J. dealt with it as in force but did not pronounce upon its applicability to roads opened since 1855. On the other hand, in Bourget v. The Queen[82], Burbidge J. and in The King v. Leclaire[83], Lavergne J. expressed positive opinions that art. 9 has no application to roads opened since it was enacted. The Privy Council case[84], and the early decision in Parent v. Daigle[85], throw no light on the question. In this state of the authorities, it is certainly not possible to say that the applicability of art. 9 to the road here in question is not open in this court.\nTurning to the consideration of the statute itself, we find art. 9 connected with art. 8 by the conjunction \"and,\" which affords at least an indication that the legislature understood that in these two articles it was dealing with cognate matters, viz., road conditions existing at the time when the statute was passed, to which art. 8 is explicitly restricted. The use in the descriptive terms of art. 9 of the past instead of the future-perfect tense (\"left open to and used,\" not \"which shall have been left open to and used\") points in the same direction, though not at all conclusively in view of the rule of interpretation that a statute is to be regarded as always speaking. In the Municipal and Road Act,\" 18 Vict., ch. 100, revised and consolidated by 23 Vict., ch. 61, and embodied in the Consolidated Statutes of 1860 as ch. 24, sec. 41 became sec. 40. Arts. 8 and 9 were entirely omitted therefrom and are not found elsewhere in these statutes. The Consolidating Act, 23 Vict., ch. 61, contained no repealing provision and the two articles, 8 and 9 of sec. 41 of the Act of 1855, were omitted, no doubt because the revisors and the legislature deemed them applicable only to roads which had been in existence and in public use for ten years before the 1st July, 1855. By the 34 Vict., ch. 68, the municipal laws of the Province of Quebec were consolidated in the Municipal Code. The repealing section (No. 1086) has, I think properly, been held not to have affected art. 9 of sec. 41 of the 18 Vict., ch. 100. Neither in the revision of the statutes of 1888 nor in that of 1909 has that article been reproduced, however, although it may fairly be assumed that the legislature was apprised of the conflict of judicial opinion as to its scope and application. If applicable to roads coming into existence since the 1st July, 1845, and if the prescriptive period which it provides is still current, the article should be found either in the Municipal Code or in the revised statutes. Its absence from both under the circumstances affords almost conclusive proof that the legislature has thrice recognized that the article was properly omitted from the 23 Vict., ch. 61, as spent or effete because applicable only to conditions existing on the 1st July, 1855. I agree with the view expressed by the late Mr. Justice Burbidge in Bourget v. The Queen[86].\nFor these reasons, expressed, I fear, at inordinate length, I would dismiss this appeal. Brodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une action n\u00e9gatoire de servitude institu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e contre le d\u00e9fendeur-appelant dans les circonstances suivantes:\nL'intim\u00e9e, la \"Dominion Textile Company,\" poss\u00e8de une usine pr\u00e8s des chutes Montmorency, dans le village de St. Gr\u00e9goire de Montmorency. D\u00e9sireuse \u00e9videmment d'am\u00e9liorer le sort de ses employ\u00e9s, elle a b\u00e2ti sur un terrain qu'elle avait achet\u00e9 en 1899, deux p\u00e2t\u00e9s de maisons pouvant donner logement \u00e0 environ une cinquantaine de familles; et elle a ouvert en face de ces maisons de magnifiques rues qu'elle a macadamis\u00e9es et sur lesquelles elle a fait construire des trottoirs. Elle a en m\u00eame temps ouvert et empierr\u00e9 une rue transversale pour communiquer avec un chemin public appel\u00e9 la \"C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville\" ; et, en outre de cela, comme ces maisons se trouvent sur un terrain \u00e9lev\u00e9, elle a construit, sur la pente de la falaise, un escalier qui conduit de cette rue transversale au village situ\u00e9 dans le bas, de sorte que les fournisseurs, les visiteurs et les amis des employ\u00e9s peuvent communiquer librement avec eux.\nCes rues servent non-seulement \u00e0 l'usage des employ\u00e9s de l'usine et de leurs visiteurs mais sont aussi utilis\u00e9es par les personnes qui demeurent plus haut sur la C\u00f4te \u00e0 Courville et sur le chemin de Beau-port et qui d\u00e9sirent aller au village en bas de la falaise. Elles sont devenues des rues publiques utilis\u00e9es par tout le monde sans aucune objection de la part de la compagnie et sans aucun indice qu'elles ne sont pas publiques.\nIl y avait \u00e0 l'est de cette rue transversale un terrain qui appartenait autrefois \u00e0 M. l'abb\u00e9 Ruel. Ce terrain connu sous le no. 63 du cadastre de Beauport fut vendu pour partie au d\u00e9fendeur en la pr\u00e9sente cause qui s'y est b\u00e2ti une maison priv\u00e9e et une boutique de forge.\nCette boutique donnait sur la rue transversale en question et il y avait communication constante de cette rue \u00e0 la boutique, \u00e0 pied et en voiture. Ily avait eu l\u00e0 autrefois une cl\u00f4ture qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9molie afin de pouvoir faciliter cette communication.\nC'est en 1907 que Harvey a acquis ce terrain-l\u00e0 et a construit cette boutique. Aucune objection dans le temps n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que Harvey fasse cette ouverture et sorte directement sur la rue.\nDeux ans apr\u00e8s, cette boutique fut lou\u00e9e pour servir d'entrep\u00f4t \u00e0 un marchand qui \u00e9tait l'un des locataires de la compagnie intim\u00e9e dans le p\u00e2t\u00e9 de maisons qu'elle avait construites sur son terrain. Ce marchand n\u00e9cessairement communiquait \u00e9galement de son magasin \u00e0 la rue sans aucune objection et sans aucune difficult\u00e9.\nPlus tard, Harvey a repris possession de sa boutique qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convertie en magasin et commen\u00e7a \u00e0 y faire commerce: et la compagnie, pour des raisons qui ne paraissent pas bien claires dans cette cause, a ferm\u00e9 la cl\u00f4ture qui s\u00e9parait la rue de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Harvey, et lui a enlev\u00e9 sa sortie. Ce dernier a de suite d\u00e9moli cette cl\u00f4ture et de l\u00e0 action par la compagnie contre Harvey.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur a plaid\u00e9:\n1. la prescription d\u00e9cennale \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la loi 18 Vict., ch. 100, sec. 41, sub-sec. 9;\n2. qu'il y avait eu abandon (dedication) de la rue en question en faveur du public.\nIl plaide, en outre, que sous les dispositions de l'article 749 du Code Municipal cette rue est devenue un chemin municipal auquel il peut avoir acc\u00e8s comme toute autre personne. La premi\u00e8re question qui se pr\u00e9sente est de savoir si cette disposition de la loi 18 Victoria est encore en force et si elle s'applique aux chemins ouverts depuis 1855.\nLa port\u00e9e de cette l\u00e9gislation a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Cour d' Appel en 1879, dans la cause de Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[87], et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par l'honorable juge Dorion, qui a rendu le jugement de la cour, que\nCette disposition d\u00e9termine la p\u00e9riode apr\u00e8s laquelle un chemin ouvert au public devient un chemin public * * *.\nL'on a pr\u00e9tendu, que cette disposition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e par Le Code Municipal. Il est possible que Ton ait eu l'intention de le faire, mais je ne trouve rien dans le Code Municipal qui, soit express\u00e9ment ou par inf\u00e9rence, ait eu l'effet de l'abroger. C'est aussi ce qu'a jug\u00e9 la Cour de Revision dans la cause de Parent v. Daigle[88].\nCette opinion n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par tous les juges: mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suivie, ainsi qu'on peut le voir en consultant les causes suivantes: 1880. Guy v. Montr\u00e9al[89]: 1887. Lachevroti\u00e8re v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[90] : 1888. Fortin v. Truchon[91]: 1890. Childs v. Montr\u00e9al[92]: 1890. L\u00e9veill\u00e9 v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[93]: 1898. Town of Westmount v. Warminton[94]: 1900. Banque Jacques-Cartier v. Gauthier[95]: 1901. Jones v. Village of Asbestos[96] : 1912. Nolin v. Gosselin[97]. Mais dans cette cause de Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e987, la seule question qui se pr\u00e9sentait \u00e9tait de savoir si la loi n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 implicitement rappel\u00e9e. On n'\u00e9tait pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si un chemin \u00e9tabli depuis 1855 \u00e9tait r\u00e9gi par cette loi: car le chemin dont il \u00e9tait question dans cette cause existait bien avant 1855. Dans le cas actuel, nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider non-seulement si la loi 18 Vict. est encore en force, mais m\u00eame si elle s'applique \u00e0 un chemin ouvert dans les vingt derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\nJe suis d'opinion que les chemins ouverts depuis 1855 ne sont pas r\u00e9gis par la loi de 18 Victoria.\nQuant \u00e0 la question d'abandon ou de destination, que les auteurs anglais appellent \"common law dedication,\" j'ai aussi des doutes tellement s\u00e9rieux que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ne pas exprimer d'opinion.\nLa \"common law dedication\" fait supposer la donation du terrain sur lequel est assis le chemin. Or, peut-on faire une donation d'immeuble sans titre? L'article 776 du Code Civil d\u00e9clare que les actes portant donations entrevifs doivent \u00eatre notari\u00e9s \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9. Il me semble que cette disposition formelle du Code Civil rendrait ill\u00e9gale la donation d'une route dans le cas o\u00f9 il n'y aurait pas de titre. Mais cela n'emp\u00eacherait pas cependant ce chemin de devenir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la corporation municipale si pendant 30 ans elle en avait eu l'usage par l'entremise du public et par elle-m\u00eame, car dans ce cas les relations l\u00e9gales des parties seraient r\u00e9gies par la prescription trentenaire \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'article 2242 du m\u00eame Code, qui n'oblige pas alors le donataire de montrer titre. Quant \u00e0 la prescription trentenaire, elle ne saurait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, vu que la possession du public ne remonte qu'\u00e0 15 ann\u00e9es au plus.\nReste la question de savoir si la rue en question en cette cause-ci est un chemin municipal sous l'article 749 du Code Municipal et si elle peut \u00eatre ferm\u00e9e.\nLes chemins se divisent en chemins publics et en chemins priv\u00e9s. Les premiers sont sous la surveillance de l'autorit\u00e9 municipale ou gouvernementale, tandis que les chemins priv\u00e9s sont ceux utilis\u00e9s par des particuliers et ne sont pas fr\u00e9quent\u00e9s par le public. On appelle aussi chemins priv\u00e9s des chemins de tol\u00e9rance parce qu'ils sont ouverts par la volont\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire sur le terrain duquel ils passent.\nLe chemin public est d'ordinaire ouvert par un pouvoir souverain, comme le conseil municipal. Il peut cependant devenir un chemin public par la prescription trentenaire, sous les dispositions de l'article 2242 du Code Civil qui d\u00e9clare que\nToutes choses, droits et actions dont la prescription n'est pas autrement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la loi se prescrivent par trente ans sans que celui qui prescrit soit' oblig\u00e9 de rapporter titre et sans qu'on puisse lui opposer l'exception d\u00e9duite de mauvaise foi.\nDans le cas d'usage, pendant trente ans, d'un chemin non-seulement le droit de passage sur ce chemin est acquis au public, mais m\u00eame la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du chemin lui-m\u00eame appartient \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 municipale (art. 752 C.M.).\nCette question de prescription trentenaire est admise g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par la doctrine et la jurisprudence.\nProudhon, Domaine public, vol. 2, p. 372, dit:\nQuand un chemin qui sert de communication entre plusieurs lieux habit\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 publiquement ouvert et librement pratiqu\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire paisiblement poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par l'\u00eatre moral et collectif que nous appelons le public, pendant plus de trente ans qui comportent aujourd'hui le terme extr\u00eame de notre prescription la plus longue, le droit en est acquis \u00e0 ceux qui se trouvent \u00e0 port\u00e9e de s'en servir.\nLes chemins deviennent donc chemins publics par l'action des autorit\u00e9s municipales ou par la prescription. Peuvent-ils le devenir autrement? Certainement: et c'est ce qu'\u00e9dicte l'article 749 du code municipal quand il d\u00e9clare que\nLes terrains ou passages occup\u00e9s comme chemins par simple tol\u00e9rance du propri\u00e9taire ou de l'occupant sont des chemins municipaux, s'ils sont cl\u00f4tur\u00e9s de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 ou autrement s\u00e9par\u00e9s du reste du terrain et ne sont pas habituellement ferm\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s: mais la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du terrain et l'obligation d'entretenir ces chemins continuent \u00e0 appartenir dans tous les cas au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 l'occupant.\nLe chemin de tol\u00e9rance est un terme assez vague et assez ind\u00e9fini dans la loi. Mais cette expression a rapport \u00e9videmment aux chemins ouverts par la volont\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire sur le terrain duquel ils passent. C'est un chemin priv\u00e9 sur lequel l'autorit\u00e9 municipale n'a aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ni aucun contr\u00f4le. Mais ce chemin peut perdre son caract\u00e8re de chemin priv\u00e9 s'il r\u00e9unit les conditions \u00e9dict\u00e9es par l'article 749 du Code Municipal, c'est-\u00e0-dire s'il est ouvert aux deux extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s et s'il est cl\u00f4tur\u00e9 ou autrement s\u00e9par\u00e9 du reste de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nProudhon, loc., cit., p. 373, nous dit que la solution de la question de savoir si un chemin peut \u00eatre caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 comme chemin public pr\u00e9sente beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s et il ajoute qu'on devra examiner, en tr\u2019autres choses,\ns'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferr\u00e9 ou recouvert en pierres, ce qui le mettrait hors de la cat\u00e9gorie des simples chemins de tol\u00e9rance.\nLe Nouveau Denisart, vo. Chemin, a tout un paragraphe sur les chemins de tol\u00e9rance. C'est un des rares auteurs qui traite la question \u00e0 fond. Les autres ne font que peu de commentaires et ce en passant, sans para\u00eetre approfondir le sujet. En parlant de ces chemins, Denisart nous dit que les chemins de tol\u00e9rance peuvent \u00eatre ouverts et ferm\u00e9s \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire et il base son opinion sur une d\u00e9cision du 10 juillet 1782, qu'il rapporte \u00e0 la page 527 de son volume 4, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 qu'un chemin de tol\u00e9rance entre des grilles qui traversait le parc du ch\u00e2teau de Champigny et allait du Pont de St Maur au port de Chenevi\u00e8res, bien qu'il f\u00fbt pav\u00e9, bien qu'il exist\u00e2t depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps, pouvait \u00eatre supprim\u00e9 \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire.\nLe principal moyen que M. 'de Champigny invoquait \u00e9tait que selon l'article 186 de la Coutume de Paris nulle servitude ne pouvait s'\u00e9tablir sans titre et que la possession m\u00eame imm\u00e9moriale ne suffit pas.\nIl est \u00e9vident par la doctrine et la jurisprudence moderne que le chemin sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne constitue pas une servitude.\nProudhon, dans son trait\u00e9 du Domaine public publi\u00e9 en 1833, dit au no. 631, p. 368, que si un chemin s'est form\u00e9 \u00e0 travers un fonds, qu'il serve de communication entre des lieux habit\u00e9s ou d'un village \u00e0 un autre village, il y a prescription acquisitive du chemin par la possession trentenaire et que l'article 691 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui correspond \u00e0 l'article 186 de la coutume, ne s'applique pas, que les chemins publics sont subordonn\u00e9s \u00e0 un tout autre r\u00e9gime que celui des servitudes.\nCette opinion est \u00e9galement enseign\u00e9e par Mass\u00e9 et Verg\u00e9 sur Zachariae, vol. 2, par. 336, note 2, et par Demolombe, vol. 2, no. 792.\nLa doctrine \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision rapport\u00e9e dans Denisart n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par les auteurs qui ont \u00e9crit au commencement ou au milieu du si\u00e8cle dernier.\nIl n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que nos r\u00e9dacteurs du code municipal aient jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de trancher la question en d\u00e9clarant dans l'article 749 quand un chemin priv\u00e9 pourra devenir un chemin public ou un chemin municipal. Cette l\u00e9gislation me para\u00eet d'ailleurs bas\u00e9e sur un jugement rendu en 1832 par la Cour d'Appel dans deux causes de Porteous v. Eno, non rapport\u00e9es, mais cit\u00e9es dans les notes du juge en chef, Sir A. A. Dorion, dans la cause de Mignerand dit Myrand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9[98] o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un chemin qui paraissait n'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d'abord qu'un chemin priv\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 \u00e0 ses extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s par des barri\u00e8res, mais dans lequel le public avait \u00e9t\u00e9 de temps imm\u00e9morial dans l'habitude de passer, ne pouvait plus \u00eatre ferm\u00e9 au public parce que depuis neuf ans les barri\u00e8res avaient disparu et que le propri\u00e9taire avait fait une cl\u00f4ture pour s\u00e9parer ce chemin du reste de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9(1).\nCet article me para\u00eet aussi conforme \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision rendue en 1864 par la cour d'appel dans une cause de Johnson v. Archambault[99].\nEn d\u00e9clarant ces chemins de tol\u00e9rance des chemins municipaux, le Code municipal se trouve \u00e0 les mettre sous le contr\u00f4le de la municipalit\u00e9 (art. 757 CM.) et rend cette derni\u00e8re responsable des accidents qui peuvent y survenir par manque d'entretien. C'est le devoir des corporations municipales de voir \u00e0 faire entretenir tous les chemins municipaux, qu'elles en soient propri\u00e9taires ou non et que ces chemins soient des chemins ouverts par la tol\u00e9rance du propri\u00e9taire ou par ordonnance municipale. C'est le devoir, dis-je, des corporations municipales de faire tenir ces chemins en bon ordre (art. 793 C.M.) : et si elles n\u00e9gligent de remplir cette obligation, elles sont passibles de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s et de dommages. Dans le cas du chemin de l'article 749 CM., ces corporations auront alors un recours en garantie contre le propri\u00e9taire: mais elles n'en sont pas moins directement responsables envers celui qui a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des dommages. Si elles trouvent cette obligation trop, on\u00e9reuse, elles peuvent faire fermer le chemin (art. 749 C.M. et arts. 525-527 C.M.).\nCes dispositions de la loi s'appliquent \u00e9galement aux rues des villages (art. 765 C.M.).\nIl ne faut pas oublier non plus que d'apr\u00e8s les dispositions de la loi, les rues des villages sont entretenues, dans le cas d'absence de r\u00e8glements, par le propri\u00e9taire du lot qui a front sur ces rues (art. 824 C.M.). Et alors il ne faut donc pas trouver exorbitante cette disposition qui met les chemins de l\u2019article 749 C.M. \u00e0 la charge de celui qui les \u00e9tablit sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nDans le cas actuel, le chemin est ouvert, \u00e0 ses extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s. D'un bout il communique \u00e0 la C\u00f4te de Courville, qui est un chemin municipal, et \u00e0 l'autre bout, au moyen d'un escalier, il rejoint une rue publique.\nPersonne ne pr\u00e9tendra que cela ne constitue pas une sortie conforme \u00e0 la loi.\nLes auteurs du Nouveau Denisart, vo. Chemin, par. 3, no. 4, disent que\nles simples sentiers * * * doivent aussi \u00eatre au rang des chemins publics quand le public est en possession de s'en servir depuis longtemps.\nQue la sortie ne puisse \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e que par les pi\u00e9tons, cela ne fait aucune diff\u00e9rence. Il n'est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire que les voitures y passent.\nLa rue est cl\u00f4tur\u00e9e d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 : et de l'autre il y a un trottoir qui la s\u00e9pare du reste de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nElle a donc toutes les conditions exig\u00e9es par la loi pour devenir une rue publique.\nJe puis ajouter que notre article 749 du Code municipal est dans notre loi ce qu'est la \"statutory dedication\" dans le droit anglais.

The grounds on which the minister refused the application do not appear, but his right to refuse to register is limited by section 11 of the Act. Having carefully considered the different subsections of section 11 I assume that the minister exercised the powers conferred by subsection (e) of that section to the effect that the trade-mark for which registration was sought did not contain the essentials of a trademark properly speaking. I am not quite clear as to what that language means but in any event both before and after the statute the office of a trade-mark was and is to point out the origin or ownership of the article to which it is affixed. In the words of the English Act, 1905, section 9, a trade-mark is something adopted to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the trade-mark from those of other persons. Our statute, section 5, enacts that all names adopted by a person in trade for the purpose of distinguishing an article manufactured and offered for sale by him shall for the purposes of the Act be considered as a trade-mark.\nThe evidence as I understand it, and I have read the affidavits with some attention, does not refer, as the judge below assumed, to the quality of the goods, but they establish that the word \"Horlick's\" has been used as a sign or symbol to indicate the origin or ownership of the goods to which it has been attached and, in the words of section 5, to distinguish the article manufactured and offered for sale. In these circumstances I fail to see how the application to register should be refused on the plain language of the sections of the Act. I do not think that Teofani & Co. v. Teofani[1], is applicable on the facts of this case. But in Teofani's Case1 it was held \"that a surname is not necessarily incapable of being a registrable trade-mark.\" It may be registered for instance where it is as in this instance an uncommon name and its use has been so extensive that in fact it has become distinctive. Here the affidavits shew that the trade-mark has been in actual use and that such user has been sufficient to render it distinctive; food products in packages bearing as a conspicuous identifying feature the word \"Horlick\" have been sold in the United States and in Great Britain and the Colonies for over forty years, the approximate number of packages sold each year amount to 7,500,000 and the annual cost of advertising has been almost $500,000.\nThis case is distinguishable on the facts from the case of In re R. J. Lea's Trade-Mark (1), and our statute differs from the British Act; but the Lea Case[2] is very instructive.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the prayer of the petition granted.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed. The use of names seems expressly provided for by section 5 of the Trade-mark and Designs Act, as one of the devices which may be adopted for use by any person in his trade, business, occupation or calling for the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture, etc.\nIndeed it may by long use have become the most distinctive mark that the product of a man's manufacture can be recognized by. The material before us indicates at least a prima facie right on the part of the petitioner to have this name registered as its trade-mark.\nThe Minister may find some objection upon facts brought to his knowledge in any way which would entitle him, and might indeed render it his duty, under section 11 of the Act, to reject the application. We can only speak from what is before us.\nThe reference to English decisions is certainly not very helpful. There is such a wide difference between the frame and express language of the English Act and ours, that decisions under the former are often more apt to mislead than help or to put us on our guard.\nIn that Act in its latter form the use of names seems expressly to require the authority of the Board of Trade.\nUnder either Act, of course, the use of a name may so tend to mislead that the history of its use as well as possibility of it being a very common name in the country where the trade-mark is to be used must be looked at to avoid misleading.\nThe Weekly Notes and Law Times come to, hand since this appeal was heard, contain notes of the decision of Mr. Justice Neville in Re William Crawford & Sons[3], where he held the application for registration should not proceed by reason of the name being a common one. He relied on the remarks of Lord Cozens Hardy M.R. in the Teofani Case[4].\nAll implied therein is very far from holding that the use of a name must be prohibited.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the result. Anglin J.\u2014We have not had the advantage of hearing counsel in support of the order made by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court refusing the petition of the applicants for registration of a \"specific trade-mark.\" After giving to the consideration of the appeal the utmost possible care I am, with great respect, of the opinion that it should be allowed. The learned judge apparently misconceived the purport of the evidence adduced. Its object was and its effect is not to establish that the products of the applicants \"have acquired a reputation on the market by reason of their excellence\" or \"by reason of the superiority of their manufacture,\" but to prove that the use in connection with the advertising, packing and sale of them of the word \"Horlick's\" has been so extensive, so conspicuous and of such duration and persistence that the word has become distinctive of those products. Having regard to the fact that the name itself is somewhat peculiar and uncommon and to the extent and nature of the user shewn, the objections usually made to the registration of the surname have not their customary force. The effect produced by the user made by the applicants of the word \"Horlicks\" is that it has become associated with them. It has became a name \"adapted to distinguish the goods as the goods of one particular maker.\" The facts in evidence appear to bring this case within the recent decisions in the cases of \"Cadbury\" and \"Muratti\"[5] which seem to me more closely in point than the two authorities cited by the learned judge. Reference may also be made to the Teofani Case[6]. \"The so-called trade-mark contains the essentials of a trade-mark properly speaking.\" (R.S.C. ch, 71, sec. 11 (e); Richards v. Butcher[7]. I am of the opinion that upon a case such as that made in the record before us the English courts under the somewhat narrower terms of their statute would direct that an application for registration should proceed. Having regard to the broader provisions of our Act\u2014that\nall * names * * * adopted for use by any person in his trade (or) business * * for the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture, product or article * * manufactured, produced, compounded, packed, or offered for sale by him, applied in any manner whatever either to such manufacture, product or article or to any package * * box or other vessel or receptacle of any description whatever containing the same, shall for the purposes of this Act be considered and known as trade-marks.\nI think we should really be doing a serious injustice to the applicants, not compensated by any advantages to the public, if we were not to allow the registration which they seek to be effected. In re Daimler[8].\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Murphy, Fisher & Sherwood.\nA trade-mark registered in Canada consists of an anchor in connection with the initials or full name of \"John de Kuyper & Sons\" to designate liquor sold by that firm. In the United States \"Bostons\" indicates goods sold by the Boston Rubber Shoe Co., and \"Bucyrus\" steel made in a town of that name.\nReporter.\n[1] [1913] 2 Ch. 545.\n1 [1913] 2 Ch. 545.\n[2] 29 Times L.R. 334.\n[3] [1917] 1 Ch. 550; 116 L.T. 440.\n[4] [1913] 2 Ch. 545.\n[5] 32 Cut, P.O. pp. 9 and 77.\n[6] [1913] 2 Ch. 545, 567.\n[7] [1891] 2 Ch. 522, 536.\n[8] 33 Cut.
