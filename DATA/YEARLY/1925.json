City of Toronto v. Lambert (54 Can. S.C.R. 200) and Sutton v. Dundas (17 Ont. L.R. 556) dist.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial as to the liability of the city to the plaintiff and reversing it as to the right of the city to claim indemnity from the third party dismissing such claim.\nThe two questions raised on this appeal are, whether or not the defendant is liable in damages for flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s premises during a heavy storm and whether or not, if liable, it had recourse over against the third party. Both depend on appreciation of the evidence on the record. The trial judge decided both questions in the affirmative. The Appellate Division reversed him as to the liability of the third party.\nR.S. Robertson and Bray for the appellant. The rainfall in this case was one which could not be expected and the city is not liable. Faulkner v. City of Ottawa[2].\nThe city can recover from the third party unless it is shown that its negligence was an active and proximate cause of the injury and was distinct from that of the third party. Sutton v. Town of Dundas[3].\nGideon Grant and Scellen for the respondent Kitchener. Robe Co. Act of God or vis major cannot be pleaded as a defence. Nitro-Phosphate Co. v. London and St Katharine Dock Co.[4] at pages 517-8.\nHattin for third party.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (the Chief Justice and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiffs are manufacturers of woollen goods, carrying on business at the S.W. corner of Foundry street and Hall\u2019s Lane in the city of Kitchener. They sue the city for damages sustained through the flooding of the cellar of their warehouse by surface water which, after crossing the sidewalk, forced its way through basement windows facing Foundry street, during a severe rainstorm on the evening of the 26th of July, 1921. In third party proceedings the city claims indemnity from the Standard Paving Company to whose wrongful act in obstructing the natural passageway for such surface water down Hall\u2019s Lane it ascribes the flooding.\nThe learned trial judge found the city liable for $2,069.87 damages and costs and held the third parties obliged to indemnify it and condemned them to pay the costs of the third party proceedings.\nThe Appellate Divisional Court upheld the judgment against the city but dismissed, with costs, its claim for indemnification[5].\nThe city now appeals against its condemnation and also, should its main appeal fail, against the discharge of the third parties. If there be liability the amount of the recovery is not questioned either by the appellants or the third parties.\nDuring heavy rainstorms the surface water of a considerable area which the storm drains could not carry converged from three directions, north, east and south, at the intersection of Foundry street and Hall\u2019s Lane. Owing to the paving of the city streets, and the recent construction of enlarged storm sewers under Foundry street, for which an inadequate outlet had been provided, thus causing a backing up of water through catch basins and manholes in the street, the rush of water towards the spot in question and the amount accumulated there during the storm of the 26th of July was increased. For this the defendant was responsible. But, on the whole evidence, it would seem to be highly probable that, but for the presence of the mound of earth thrown across the entrance to Hall\u2019s Lane by the third parties, notwithstanding the undoubted severity of the storm, the water which the storm sewers could not carry off would have flowed down that lane with such rapidity that flooding of the plaintiffs\u2019 cellar would not have occurred. That is what had happened for many years; and, as put by the learned trial judge,\nthere was no evidence to convince me that with a clear opening down the lane even the extremely excessive flow might not have been taken care of sufficiently to have saved the plaintiffs\u2019 premises.\nThe learned judge adds:\nThe mound must necessarily have obstructed the water until the sidewalk was flooded, and so soon as the flooding commenced the immediate cause of it must have been the mound. To what extent, had the mound not been there, the continued onrush of water might have been so fast that it would rise above the level of the curb and so overflow the sidewalk must be mere guesswork. * * * In my judgment the conclusion to be drawn from the established facts, as distinguished from those which consist of mere conjecture or are matters of calculation based upon conjectural premises is that the mound of earth and debris caused the flooding of the plaintiffs\u2019 premises. * * * The defendant corporation were fully aware of the fact that during some rainstorms the storm drains were not sufficient to carry off the water, and that Hall\u2019s Lane must necessarily be kept free from obstructions in order to carry off the surface water. The paving company\u2019s manager admitted that the danger of flooding at that corner was apparent. Under these circumstances it was, I think, the duty of the defendant corporation not to leave any obstruction in the lane which might block the flow of water and endanger the plaintiffs.\nThis concept of the facts is the fair result of the evidence. Notwithstanding Mr. Hattin\u2019s able attempt to demonstrate by expert evidence based on the testimony as to water levels in Foundry Street during the storm that the flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s cellar would have occurred had there been no obstruction in Hall\u2019s Lane, with the learned trial judge we regard that conclusion as at the most conjectural. One obvious fallacy in the premises on which it is based is that the water levels in Foundry Street given in evidence, assuming their accuracy, were those which obtained with the obstruction of the mound in full operation. How much lower they would have been had the entrance to the lane been clear does not appear. We are, therefore, in accord with the view of Mr. Justice Riddell that \u201cthe sole tortious cause of the damage (suffered by the plaintiffs) was the barrier\u201d placed across the entrance to the lane by the third parties and with that of the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas that \u201ceverything turned on that obstruction\u201d.\nWhile the storm was no doubt unusually severe, the evidence in our opinion falls short of establishing that the rain-fall was so torrential and unprecedented that it can be said to have amounted to actus Dei or force majeure, Greenock v. Caledonia Ry. Co.[6] But, though it were of that character, the defendant would not thereby be excused if the true cause of the flooding complained of was the obstruction of the mouth of the lane and if responsibility for its presence attaches to it. Nitro-Phosphate, etc., Co. v. London & St. Katharine Dock Co.[7] There is no suggestion here that a case could be made for any apportionment of the damages.\nWhile the paving of the city streets may have materially increased the accumulation of water at the intersection of Foundry Street and Hall\u2019s Lane, and the city\u2019s method of constructing storm sewers certainly cannot be commended from a common sense, and still less from an engineering, point of view, the conditions thus created were not the immediate and direct cause of the flooding. If they contributed to it, they were rather in the nature of a cause sine qua non. Indeed the circumstances in evidence make it probable that the obstruction across the entrance to the lane would have sufficed to cause the flooding even had the sewer outlet been adequate and that the only relevant effect of its inadequacy was that the invasion of the plaintiffs\u2019 premises by the water may have occurred a few moments earlier than it otherwise would have happened. Nevertheless the creation of conditions so apt to cause a sudden accumulation of rainwater was an obvious menace which undoubtedly made it the duty of the civic officials to be more than ordinarily vigilant in regard to the means of carrying off the additional volume of surface water thus gathered. Failure to discharge that duty, if that be the proper inference from the evidence as a whole, and responsibility for the tortious act of its contractors, would seem to be the true bases of the defendant\u2019s liability.\nMoreover, although the plaintiffs originally averred actionable negligence on the part of the city, both in its sewer construction and in regard to the obstruction of the lane, at the trial the former ground of claim was distinctly abandoned and the plaintiffs\u2019 case was rested solely on negligence both of commission and omission in regard to the mound of earth; and it was on that footing that the judgment against them proceeded. The third parties however, insisted on retaining any advantage to which they might be entitled from the proof of defective or improper sewer construction. By some of the members of the Appellate Division they were regarded as joint tortfeasors with the city and, as such, not liable to contribution; by others the indemnification provisions of the contract were held not to cover the case because the liability of the city rested on fault of its own officials.\nIn order to determine the governing legal principles it is necessary to have a correct appreciation of the facts in regard to the presence of the obstruction across the lane. The third parties were in the course of paving Foundry Street under a contract with the city. Enlarged sewers had already been constructed; the concrete foundation for the pavement had been laid; but the asphalt surfacing was still to be done. The plaintiffs had asked for what is known as a drop crossing () at Hall\u2019s Lane expressly to facilitate the flow of surface water into and down it. That request had been approved of by the city engineer. Either because proper instructions were not given or because, if given, they were overlooked, the contractors had put in a sloping crossing () somewhat similar to what had formerly been there, the ends of which, when finished, would be level with the sidewalk and the centre slightly depressed. Noticing this mistake the plaintiffs\u2019 manager called the attention of the city engineer to it. He ordered the contractors to make the necessary change, which required the cutting out of the concrete foundation and some additional excavation. This the contractors proceeded to do some five days before the storm. They piled the broken concrete on Foundry Street, but the rest of the material they threw across the mouth of the lane, forming a bank, probably about a foot in height, which the learned trial judge finds\nwas sufficient to obstruct the natural flow of surface water, even during a severe storm, down the lane.\nThe contractors\u2019 foreman says that he placed the pile of earth in the lane as a barrier to protect the concrete from traffic; that after long experience they had found such an obstruction more effective than the usual wooden barrier. The insistence of the plaintiffs on a drop crossing had brought to the immediate attention both of the city engineer and of the contractors the necessity of keeping Hall\u2019s Lane open to carry off the surface water in a heavy storm. Yet this dam of earth was placed across the mouth of the lane and kept there for five days and the foreman says similar barriers were placed at each street intersection. Notice to the city of the existence of the obstruction at the mouth of Hall\u2019s Lane seems, therefore, to be not merely a justifiable, but almost an inevitable inference.\nUpon this state of facts it is impossible to suggest that the contractors\u2019 act in placing the pile of earth across the lane was mere casual or collateral negligence. To protect their fresh concrete from traffic entering Foundry street from the lane was a necessary incident of the work they had undertaken. The specifications expressly imposed that obligation and required that barriers should be put up and maintained. To provide such protection by means of a dam of earth thrown across the lane instead of the customary open barrier, which would not have interfered with the flow of water into the lane, was, under the circumstances, very gross negligence. Such a method of carrying out an integral part of the work contracted for was palpably wrong and involved the city in liability. Hole v. Sittingbourne & Sheerness Ry. Co.[8] Having undertaken the construc- tion of the drop crossing at Hall\u2019s Lane in connection with the paving of Foundry street, it became incumbent upon the city so to dispose of the material necessarily excavated in the course of that work as not to cause injury to neighbouring property owners. For the performance of the work itself and the discharge of that incidental duty it was, no doubt, authorized to employ contractors. But their failure to fulfil their obligation to the city in regard to the safe disposal of excavated material left the latter responsible for the resultant injury. Its duty to the plaintiffs remained undischarged and the contractors\u2019 fault of omission was not mere casual or collateral negligence for which the city would not have been responsible. Upon that ground, therefore, the city is responsible for the damages thus caused. Vancouver Power Company v. Hounsome[9]; Dalton v. Angus[10]; Hardaker v. Idle District Council[11]; Holliday v. National Telephone Company[12]; Robinson v. Beaconsfield Rural Council[13], per Buckley L.J.; Ballentine v. Ontario Pipe Line Co.[14]; Penny v. Wimbledon Urban District Council[15]; Kirk v. Toronto[16]. But, if that were not so, on the ground that it had failed to require the removal of such an obvious cause of known danger, of which it must be held to have had notice, liability also attaches to it. Therefore, because of negligence both of commission and omission the municipal corporation was rightly held liable and the judgment condemning it must be upheld.\nBy their contract with the city the third parties had agreed that\nThe corporation will not in any manner be answerable for any injuries to any person or persons, either workmen or the public, or for the damage from any cause arising from the conduct or operations of the company or their workmen or any one employed by them, all of which injuries and damages to persons or property the company must guard against, and make good all damages, being strictly responsible for the same.\nThey had also covenanted to construct the works in accordance with and upon the terms of the specifications. Paragraph 7 of the grading specifications reads:\u2014 All surplus material not required by the city must be disposed of by the contractor off the line of work, but in such a manner as not to cause a nuisance, injury or inconvenience to the city or to public or private parties; otherwise the contractor must indemnify the corporation against all claims in respect thereof.\nThe material placed in the lane was \u201csurplus material not required by the city.\u201d In direct violation of the clause just quoted the contractors so placed it that it became the cause of injury to private parties. Why should they not indemnify the city for the present claim for such injury?\nIt is argued that the clause was not meant to apply to a case in which negligence of the city itself is found to have involved it in liability and such authorities as City of Toronto v. Lambert[17] and Sutton v. The Town of Dundas[18], are invoked by the third parties. In each of those cases an independent act of negligence of the party asserting the right to indemnity under a contractual provision, which may for the moment be taken to have been somewhat similar to clause 7 of the specifications above quoted, had been the immediate and effective cause of the injuries sustained; in neither of them had a wrongful act of the contractor who had undertaken the obligation to indemnify, in the carrying out of the work contracted for, been the primary and sole effective cause of the damage suffered. In the case at bar, on the contrary, the city\u2019s liability arises either because responsibility for the tortious act of its contractors is by law attached to it, or because it had failed to remove a known source of danger, which a tortious act of its contractors had created. Where, as here, a tortious act of the party covenanting to indemnify, of the very class against the consequences of which such indemnity has been stipulated for, is the primary cause of injury, that party cannot escape the liability to indemnify merely because that act itself, or neglect to provide against its consequences, has also entailed liability to the person injured of the party in whose favour the stipulation for indemnity was exacted. It is upon the very liability thus entailed that the claim for indemnification rests. As put by the late Mr. Justice Rose in Carty v. City of London[19]:\nI would be unable to find any case to apply the indemnity clause to if this be not one, and indemnity implies liability against which indemnity is sought. See too Mclntyre v. Lindsay[20], and Gignec v. Toronto[21]. Had the evidence established that the faulty construction of the city sewer was a proximate cause of the flooding, the authorities relied upon by Mr. Hattin might have been in point and the application of the indemnity clause might have been excluded.\nWe are for these reasons of the opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge holding the third parties liable to indemnify the respondent was right and should be restored. It is perhaps unnecessary to state that in affirming their liability we base our judgment solely upon the covenant for indemnification in their contract and not at all upon section 464 of the Municipal Act, or to add that the doctrine of the common law excluding contribution between joint tortfeasors does not apply to such a case as this.\nThe appeal of the City of Kitchener against the plaintiff will, therefore, be dismissed with costs. Its appeal against the Standard Paving Company will be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division and the judgment of the learned trial judge in the third party proceedings restored.\nThe defendant, however, is not entitled to recover from the third parties any costs which it may have to pay arising out of the appeals to the Appellate Division and to this court from the judgment in the main action.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent, the Robe & Clothing Co. Ltd., is a manufacturer of woollen goods carrying on business in the City of Kitchener in a factory fronting on one of the streets of said city, known as Foundry Street, and alongside it there has for many years been a lane fifteen feet in width running at right angles to said Foundry Street and known as Hall\u2019s Lane.\nOn the 26th of July, 1921, an unusually heavy rain storm occurred in said city which resulted in the water being more than the appellant\u2019s sewer pipes on Foundry Street could carry, and therefore the water on that street overflowed part thereof and ran down in the side ditches thereof to the said junction of Hall\u2019s Lane with Foundry Street and probably would have found an easy outlet at and over said lane (which had a fall of about four feet per hundred feet in length) as it usually did in cases of heavy rains, but for an obstruction put thereon by the respondent the Standard Paving, Limited, under circumstances which I am about to refer to.\nThe result was an overflow of water into the cellar of the said Robe & Clothing Company, which caused heavy damages to the goods of the said company.\nHence this action was brought against the said city to recover from it said damages.\nThe conflicting evidence given at the trial before Mr. Justice Orde, without a jury, was such as to lead to a change of opinion by those conducting the plaintiff\u2019s case at said trial, and to the diversity of judicial views we find expressed throughout the course of this case in the courts below.\nThe appellant, before pleading to the action so brought, served the said Paving Company with notice of bringing it in as a third party, bound by the terms of its contract with appellant to indemnify the latter against the results of the action.\nTo this it responded denying all liability.\nAn order was made by the local judge providing for such proceeding and its results as required by the practice in such cases in Ontario.\nThat resulted in all parties so concerned appearing at the trial and taking part therein before the learned trial judge.\nThe contention as between the defendant and the said third party was, of course, that the other fellow was entirely to blame.\nAnd as between each of them and the plaintiff, now a respondent, the respective contention of each was, by the plaintiff up to a certain point that both the original defendant, now appellant, and the third party were to blame and, conversely, each of the latter tried to shew that the other was to blame.\nAccording to the findings of fact by the learned trial judge his view of the law as applied thereto seemed to me absolutely correct.\nTherefore I decided to read the entire evidence and see if that justified his findings of fact being departed from and I am pleased to find that he had paid close attention to the case throughout and took pains, by questioning many of the witnesses, to have many points in the evidence cleared up instead of being left in the confusing condition in which it had been presented and possibly would have been left out but for his doing so.\nWhen one understands the actual facts and appreciates correctly their bearing the case is comparatively simple.\nThe junction of Hall\u2019s Lane with Foundry street is at the lowest point of said street, which is comparatively a short street crossing three blocks.\nThe more the streets are improved by paving or otherwise the more rapidly the rainfall moves, and what seems to have happened in the part of Kitchener, on Foundry street, by reason of the city\u2019s rapid growth, was that the pipes for carrying the water off had been found to be too small and along said street had been renewed and enlarged, but when it came to renewing and enlarging correspondingly the continuation thereof on and along said Hall\u2019s Lane, there was no need for haste in doing so inasmuch as the surplus water could find an easy outlet down that lane and be taken care of thereby without risk of injuring any one.\nThe title to that lane was in the respondent, the Robe & Clothing Company, Limited, and had been for many years past.\nEvidently there was a movement on foot by the appellant city to change that situation of things, for we are told on argument, in addition to what appears in evidence, that the offer, contained in the letter from said owner to the city, to sell said lane to the city, had been accepted by resolution of the latter\u2019s council shortly before the accident in question herein, but it was some months later before the title was completed.\nThe pipes had been found to be quite capable of carrying all the water for years past, except on the occasion of unusually heavy rains, which might be three or four times a year, and on such occasions the surplus water ran down the said lane and, on the occasion of the storm in question, beyond a shadow of doubt in my mind (despite the theory of an engineer witness based on the evidence of two witnesses, who spoke of what they had seen when unconsciously magnifying the severity of the storm) would have done the same but for the interference of the situation by the respondent, the Standard Paving, Limited.\nThe most convincing tests from actual facts, instead of many theories, is that given by Richardson, a witness living in another part of the city, who tells of a storm some seven or eight years before which brought the water from the streets in such a volume as to bring it into his cellar, but this storm did not. That storm did no injury to the premises now in question, though the buildings had been built before that time.\nThe Standard Paving, Limited, had entered into a contract with the appellant to do some paving for it, which included Foundry street, and when it came to Hall\u2019s Lane the manager of the Robe & Clothing Company, knowing the actual situation and the need of the entrance of surplus water into said lane being protected for the very purpose of meeting the requirements of the street drainage, explained this to those engaged in the work. Somebody forgot, or paid no heed, until a few days before the accident in question, and all concerned then met and agreed that the crossing from Foundry street (main part of the highway) over the sidewalk thereon into said lane, should be, when finished, so shaped as to provide for the anticipated possibilities of surplus water needing its outlet into the lane.\nThe men engaged in executing said work on behalf of the said Standard Paving, Limited, bungled it by throwing the refuse or debris of the old sidewalk, and earth and other materials under it, to make way for the new, on the lane, forming what proved to be a dam, when the storm came, and the old outlet for the surplus water being gone or impaired thereby, it ran into the cellar of the respondent, the Robe & Clothing Company, Limited, and did the damage for which the learned trial judge entered judgment against the appellant and gave it relief over against said respondent, the Standard Paving, Limited.\nThe latter had by its contract agreed with appellant to indemnify it against just such claims, in the following terms:\u2014\nThe corporation will not in any manner be answerable or accountable for any injuries to any person or persons, either workmen or the public, or for damage from any cause arising from the conduct or operations of the company or their workmen or any one employed by them, all of which injuries and damages to persons or property the company must guard against, and make good all damages, being strictly responsible for the same.\nThat seems comprehensive enough to cover all that is in question herein, and why the said company failed to respond thereto without litigation puzzles me.\nSeemingly the storm was looked upon as such an Act of God as to excuse the fulfilment of the said contract of indemnity. And hence I fear the gross exaggeration of the storm.\nNo judicial opinion seems to have countenanced that view, but the Appellate Division for Ontario seems to have looked upon the appellant and the Standard Paving, Limited, as joint tortfeasors, and it varied the said judgment so as to deprive the appellant city of its remedy over against said third party, the Standard Paving, Limited. Hence this appeal here.\nWith great respect I cannot agree with the view taken, either as to the facts or the law, by those who, in said court, have written opinions tending to allow said appeal.\nI have set forth as briefly as I can the relevant facts, and I submit that the learned trial judge was in much better position to hear and determine the facts than any one else judicially concerned in this case, and all the more so by reason of the somewhat confusing manner in which the evidence was presented and the tendency on the part of some of the witnesses apparently to magnify the storm.\nThe evidence of a witness who had an instrument for use in measuring rain-falls tells us it lasted for an hour and a half, and the total fall was a trifle over two inches which, if we apply common knowledge, is not so great as pretended.\nTurning now to the law governing the case, the learned trial judge seems to have taken, as his chief guide, the judgment of Lindley L.J. in Hardaker v. Idle District Council[22].\nIn said judgment he quotes from the opinion of Lord Blackburn, in Dalton v. Angus[23] as follows:\nEver since Quarman v. Burnett[24], it has been considered settled law that one employing another is not liable for his collateral negligence unless the relation of master and servant existed between them. So that a person employing a contractor to do work is not liable for the negligence of that contractor or his servants. On the other hand, a person causing something to be done, the doing of which casts on him a duty, cannot escape from the responsibility attaching to him of seeing that duty performed by delegating it to a contractor. He may bargain with the contractor that he shall perform the duty, and stipulate for an indemnity from him if it is not performed, but he cannot thereby relieve himself from liability to those injured by the failure to perform it Hole v. Sittingbourne and Sheerness Ry. Co.[25]; Pickard v. Smith[26]; Tarry v. Ashton[27].\nThese cases cited seem to support the proposition laid down in the foregoing quotation. And I submit that it is because of the relations between the appellant and the said contractor (The Standard Paving, Limited) by virtue of the contract between them and the duty resting upon the appellant to get said work done that appellant is at all liable herein, and not by reason of anything that the appellant itself did or did not do, that it should be held liable.\nFor if the learned trial judge is, as I hold he is, quite right in his findings of fact, there is, and can be, no ground for holding that the appellant is a joint tortfeasor.\nThe duty to protect the plaintiff herein rested in law upon the appellant, and the rule as to tortfeasor is not applicable to defeat the right of the appellant to look to and recover over as against the third party upon the latter\u2019s covenant for indemnity, which is perfectly legal.\nOn the facts as found nothing further need be said. But I would refer to the discussion of the principle involved as to the right to recover from him who indemnifies against his own acts, on pages 198 and 199 of Pollock on Torts, 12th ed., and cases there cited, and also the case of Moxham v. Grant[28], as a means of illustrating the modern and more reasonable doctrine than that so widely laid down in Merryweather v. Nixon[29].\nIn my opinion for the foregoing reasons this appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the appellate court below, and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nAppeal defendant v. plaintiff dismissed with costs.\nAppeal defendant v. third party allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Sims, Bray & McIntosh.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Scellen & Weir.\nSolicitors for third party: Clement, Hattin & Snider.\n[1] 55 Ont.

S. Chivers & Son v. S. Chivers & Co. (17 Cut. P.C. 420) fol.\nThough a tradesman cannot be prevented from honestly using his name in connection with the sale of his goods he has no right to use it with the intent of passing off his goods as those of another person of the same name or, without such intent, of so using it and wilfully persisting in such use that it will have that effect.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court ([1923] Ex. C.R. 136) Idington J. dissenting, that in this case neither such intent nor such effect was proved.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the appellant's application to have the respondent's trade-mark expunged from the registry.\nThe Hurlbut Co. had registered a trade-mark consisting of the word \"Hurlbut\" with the family crest and another of the name \"Hurlbut\" alone. These marks were stamped on shoes made and sold by the company. The Hurlburt Co. also registered a trade-mark, namely, the word \"Hurlburt\" with a device of bow and arrow. This company sold a special kind of shoe with its trade-mark stamped on it and the Hurlbut Co. brought action to have it expunged from the registry and for an injunction. The Exchequer Court refused the application but ordered a variation of respondent's mark by striking out the word \"Hurlburt\" and substituting \"Hurlburt Shoe Company.\"\nFetherstonhaugh K.C. and Fox for the appellant. An essential part of our trade-mark is infringed which is an infringement of the whole. See Partlo v. Todd[2]; Seixo v. Provezende[3], at page 196.\nAs to the amount of similarity necessary to constitute infringement see Davis v. Reed[4]; Leather Cloth Co. v. American Leather Cloth Co.[5]; Cash Ltd. v. Cash[6]; Brooks & Co. v. Norfolk Cycle Co.[7]; Landreth v. Landreth[8];, and Slater v. Ryan[9], were also referred to.\nArthur A. Macdonald for the respondent, referred to Teofani v. Teofani[10], and Guimaraens v. Fonseca[11].\nFetherstonhaugh K.C. and Fox for the appellant.\nArthur A. Macdonald for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (The Chief Justice and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The critical question in this appeal is whether the respondents are, by the use of the name \"Hurlburt\" in connection with the goods they sell, representing that these goods are the goods of the appellants. The law is quite clear that no man can acquire a monopoly of his own surname in such a way as to prevent another person of the same name honestly using that name in connection with his goods or his business, but that is subject to the important qualification that no man is entitled by the use of his own name or in any other way to pass off his goods as the goods of another, and if he is using his own name with that purpose, or even, without the conscious intention of doing so, with the effect of doing so, and if, when he becomes aware of the fact that such is the effect of his conduct, he persists in that conduct without taking reasonable care to qualify the representation implied in his conduct in such a way as to avoid deceiving persons who otherwise would be deceived by it, he cannot be said to be using his own name in good faith for his own legitimate business purposes. This general statement of the law is supported by a multitude of authorities, to some of which particular reference must be made later.\nThe appellant company is an incorporated company; the respondents are a partnership, the partners being Frank H. Hurlburt and his wife.\nThe appellant company has been manufacturing shoes at Preston, Ont., since 1902, and since that time the name of the principal proprietor, Hurlbut, has been associated with the shoes produced by them, and the appellants' allegation is that the name \"Hurlbut\" and the phrase \"Hurlbut Shoe\" have acquired a secondary meaning, which is that they denote a shoe made by them and by them alone. It appears that from 1907 to 1909 there is some reason to believe that the practice was discontinued. From 1909 down to the commencement of the action there is evidence that the name was used in increasing degree as a trade-mark or part of a trade-mark for their product. In 1913 a trademark was registered, consisting of the name Hurlbut with the family crest below, and particularly with regard to one class of goods, cushion sole shoes, it seems reasonably clear that this trade-mark has been stamped upon the inside of the sole almost invariably since it was registered. In 1920 another trade-mark was registered, consisting only of the name HURLBUT in block letters.\nThe respondents have a shoe shop in Barrie which they acquired from the Carey Shoe Company some six years before the commencement of the action, the respondent F. H. Hurlburt having acted as manager of the Carey Shoe Company for several years prior to that. Before that again he had been engaged either as clerk or manager or proprietor in buying and selling merchandise in general stores in Thornbury and Meaford, in which he says the sale of boots and shoes always constituted a very important part of the business. In 1919, he says, it occurred to him that a certain shoe known as Dr. Wirth's Cushion Sole Shoe, made by Ames, Holden & Co., which he had been selling, having become very expensive, it would be desirable to attempt to get a cheaper shoe of the same general description, and he conceived the idea of a shoe which he thought would meet the requirements he had in mind, and he then proceeded to register a trade-mark on behalf of the respondent firm, consisting of his own name with a device of a musket and a bow and arrow beneath it. Having obtained his trade-mark he entered into an arrangement with a manufacturing concern in Galt by which they were to manufacture shoes according to his specification and sell them under his trade-mark, the manufacturer allowing him a specified royalty. The appellants having complained of this and an action having been brought, the action was settled upon terms which included the abandonment of this arrangement, but which need not otherwise concern us, and thereafter Hurlburt had shoes made for him according to his specification by the Weston Manufacturing Co. That company having taken out a patent upon Hurlburt's process with improvements, the respondents sell the shoes made by it according to this specification, stamped with their trademark, and advertise them as Hurlburt's Cushion Sole Shoe.\nBefore the commencement of the present action the respondents offered to amend their \"commercial literature,\" as they called it, by stating in explicit terms that they had no connection with the Hurlbuts of Preston, and by adding to the mark stamped upon their shoes and containers any short phrase which might reasonably be suggested by the appellants to make it quite clear that their goods were not the appellants' goods. The appellants rejected the respondents' offers, demanding that they should eliminate from their advertisements and from the mark used in connection with their goods all mention of the name Hurlburt. This attitude was persisted in, both at the trial and before this court.\nIt may be said at once that the evidence adduced by the appellants falls far short of establishing their allegation that their name has acquired a secondary signification in the only relevant sense. It is indisputable and it is, in fact, undisputed, that the appellants have a considerable trade, and that their goods are favourably known to their customers, but the evidence is wholly inadequate to shew that the words \"Hurlbut's Shoe\" or the name \"Hurlbut\" has passed into common use as denoting the shoes made by the appellants and by them only. What the appellants must prove is shewn by the following passage from the judgment of Farwell J. in S. Chivers & Sons v. S. Chivers & Co.[12], at page 429:\nI have heard an argument from Mr. Hughes which seems to me to have, if it were sound, a very far-reaching effect; but I do not accept it. It is not enough, in my opinion, for a man to say that he has been the only manufacturer of his name of a particular article, and that his customers, therefore, necessarily only know that article, and that no one else of that name having ever traded in that article there can be no other name under which that article can be sold except his own, and, therefore, he has a right to the sole use of that particular name. It appears to me that the issue thrown upon the plaintiff in a case of this sort is to prove that the world has come to know that particular article associated with his name as meaning his manufacture., and that only. When I say \"the world\" I am using another phrase similar to that used by Lord Shand, I do not, of course, mean every human being in the kingdom, but I mean all persons whom it in any way concerns. A man's own customers know his own jelly and do not know other people's because they have never troubled themselves to ascertain whether there were such other persons at all. But in order to give the name \"Chivers Jelly\" that secondary signification which the plaintiffs desire to attach to it, and not to make it mean a jelly made by a person of the name of Chivers, they must, in my judgment, show first of all that that user has been locally universal, at any rate in the sense that it extends in any locality over the area in which the defendant has traded. If it were necessary for the decision of this case I should hold myself that the universality must be co-extensive, at any rate, with England and Wales. I leave out Scotland because there is a different system of jurisprudence there, and it might not be necessary to shew that it extended to Scotland; but I think you must at least shew that the universality was such that it extended to England and Wales, for this reason: it would be intolerable, to my mind, to allow a man by simply trading in the eastern counties, say, to acquire for himself a monopoly in his own name. The gist of it as decided in Reddaway v. Banham[13]. is that you take out of the dictionary of the English language, for the purpose of a particular trade, a word which bears a primary signification, and you attach to that word in the dictionary a secondary signification. To say that can be done at all is, I agree with Lord Shand, a very great step. But when you have once the finding of a jury, as you have in Reddaway's Case (2), that it had in fact been done with those words, it seems to me the law follows as a matter of course. The real difficulty is the finding of fact. Speaking for myself, I should never find the fact to be that the word had obtained that secondary signification unless it was proved to my satisfaction that the use had been locally universal in the sense I have attached to it\u2014universal in point of space. I think Lord Halsbury also would certainly not have decided Reddaway's Case (2) as he did otherwise than on the facts found, because he expressly guards himself by saying it is a question of fact. If it is found as a fact that the words \"camel-hair belting\" have ceased to mean belting made of camel's hair, and have come to mean for all persons whom it concerns to know it\u2014all persons in the trade and all persons buying camel-hair belting\u2014the belting made by Reddaway, and not belting made of camel-hair, the law follows as a matter of course.\nThe appellants, to repeat what has already been said, have quite failed to establish the existence of any such usage as that pointed to in these observations in relation to the words in which they claim to have a monopoly.\nIn great part the evidence adduced by the appellants in support of this allegation is inadmissible as being merely hearsay, and as to the residue it is, for the most part, too vague to be of any real value. There is little or no admissible evidence definitely pointing to an identification of the name \"Hurlbut\" or the phrase \"Hurlbut's Shoe\" with the appellants as makers. The absence of such evidence is in itself significant. If there were any substance in the allegation that the alleged signification had attached as a secondary meaning to these words, if the words had gained currency in the sense alleged, there should have been no difficulty whatever in establishing the fact by abundant evidence.\nThis, however, is only one branch of the appellants' case: Another contention is put forward, and that is that the respondents deliberately laid their plans with the object of capturing the appellants' trade or, at all events, of establishing a trade for themselves, by adopting as a trade-mark something that would convey to the public the impression that their goods were the appellants' goods. It is, perhaps, convenient, before discussing the facts, to state explicitly the law bearing upon the issue arising out of this allegation. The law appears, if one may respectfully say so, to be stated with accuracy in some passages in judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal, which had best be quoted verbatim. The first passage is from the judgment of Lindley M. R., in Jamieson & Co. v. Jamieson[14], at page 181:\nWe are asked to restrain a man from carrying on business in his own name simply. That is really what it comes to. I do not say that cannot be done. It can be done, and there are cases in which it has been done. I can refer to one\u2014the Holloway Pill Case, with which lawyers are familiar, which is reported in[15], in which the court did restrain a man of the name of Henry Holloway from selling pills with \"H. Holloway\" on them at the instance of the original Holloway, who started the sale of \"Holloway's Pills.\" There are, perhaps, one or two cases of that kind. There is that one certainly. There are other cases where a man, having a name which is useful in the trade, has been laid hold of by somebody who wants to carry on that business, and make use of his name, although he has nothing whatever to do with it, the object being to avail themselves of that name in order to unfairly obtain the benefit of the trade of somebody else of the same name. Now when we are asked to restrain a man who is carrying on business in his own name, we must take very great care what we are about. The principle applicable to the case, I take it, is this: The court ought not to restrain a man from carrying on business in his own name simply because there are people who are doing the same and who will be injured by what he is doing. It would be intolerable if the court were to interfere, and to prevent people from carrying on business in their own names in rivalry to others of the same name. There must be something far more than that, viz., that the person who is carrying on business in his own name is doing it in such a way as to pass off his goods as the goods of somebody else. We must not lose sight for a moment of the real question which we have to try\u2014the question of fact. The most recent case on that point is the \"Yorkshire Relish\" case, which came before the House of Lords, where Lord Halsbury read with approval that passage which Mr. Daldy has read from Lord Justice Turner's judgment in Burgess v. Burgess[16]. He says: \"The proposition of law is one which I think has been accepted by the highest judicial authority, and acted upon for a great number of years. It is that of Lord Justice Turner, who says, in terms: \"No man can have any right to represent his goods as the goods of another person. In an application of this kind, it must be made out that the defendant is selling his own goods as the goods of \"another.\" That is what we must look to; and what we have to satisfy ourselves upon is\u2014that the defendant has been selling his goods as the goods of the plaintiff.\nThen in Teofani & Co., Ltd. v. A. Teofani[17], at p. 456, Cozens-Hardy M.R., referred to the judgment of Turner L.J., in Burgess v. Burgess16. He said:\nLord Justice Turner put the case with his usual extreme accuracy. I will read what he said: \"Where a person is selling goods under a particular name, and another person, not having that name, is using it, it may be presumed that he so uses it to represent the goods sold by himself as the goods of the person whose name he uses; but where the defendant sells goods under his own name, and it happens that the plaintiff has the same name, it does not follow that the defendant is selling his goods as the goods of the plaintiff. It is a question of evidence in each case whether there is false representation or not.\" I do not think there is any case in which any doubt is expressed that this is the true principle of law. It is said in the present case that there is no evidence that the defendant has sold his goods or has threatened or intended to sell his goods in such a manner as to represent them as the plaintiff's goods.\nAnd at page 458, Kennedy L. J., says:\nAs I understand the law, there is nothing to prevent a person who is setting up in a trade in which there are already others of the same name from using his own name, but alike from the legal and from the moral point of view a person is forbidden to use his own name in connection with the goods in that business in such a way as to represent that the goods are the goods of somebody else of that same name. If he does that he is doing that which is wrong and which the courts, as it seems to me, have consistently through a long list of cases refused to allow him to do. He must carry on the business under his own name honestly, and he does not carry on the business in his own name honestly if he so uses his name in connection with the business or goods\u2014in this case it is the goods\u2014as to lead those who deal with him in that business as purchasers to believe that they are goods which are the goods of another trader of the same name.\nAnd again at page 459, there is this paragraph in the judgment of Swinfen Eady L. J.:\nThe law is that no man may pass off his goods as and for the goods of another; and that proposition of law may be amplified, and be perfectly accurate, if it is put in this way, that a man may not, by the use of his own name or otherwise pass off his goods as and for the goods of another.\n\/These passages exhibit an uninterrupted current of authority, beginning with the judgment of Turner L. J., in Burgess' Case[18], continuing through Reddaway v. Banham[19] in 1896, down to Teofani's Case[20] in 1913, in the same sence.\nIf the appellants had succeeded in establishing their allegation that the respondents have deliberately adopted a trade-mark with the object of representing to the public that the goods sold by them are goods produced by the appellants, which have acquired some reputation, then two results might follow; first, that design in itself, the respondents being persons of considerable experience in the trade of boots and shoe, would be some evidence to shew that in some degree, at all events, the name Hurlbut had become associated in the minds of people buying shoes with shoes of the appellants' manufacture; and, secondly, it would be some evidence to shew that the respondents were using their own name, not only in such a manner as to advance their own trade in a legitimate way, but in such a manner also as to represent that their goods were the appellants' goods.\nThe appellants place a great deal of emphasis, naturally and properly, upon a letter written by the respondent F. H. Hurlburt on September 12, 1919, in which the respondent makes proposals to a dealer in boots and shoes, and, in doing so, refers to the appellants' product in a way calculated to excite suspicion, to say the least, that he was contemplating pursuing that course of conduct which the appellants charge he has been pursuing. That letter, taken in conjunction with the circumstance that the respondent F. H. Hurlburt had acted for the appellants in selling their shoes in Barrie, had it stood alone would have required some better explanation than any which has been forthcoming. But the respondent F. H. Hurlburt was not in cross-examination pressed for an explanation of that letter, and when his conduct is looked at as a whole it seems very difficult indeed to say that the learned trial judge was wrong in acquitting the respondent of any deliberate design to steal the appellants' reputation and trade. There appears to be ground for the statement\u2014Mr. Weston, of the Weston Shoe Manufacturing Company, gives explicit evidence on the point\u2014that the cushion sole shoe designed by the respondent, or the shoe which developed ultimately from his design, is one which is free from the fault usually ascribed to shoes of that description, namely, the tendency of the cushion sole to become lumpy. As already mentioned, the respondent's design or process as improved by Mr. Weston has been patented, and Mr. Weston says that he manufactures and sell these shoes in large quantities, and that there is a large market for them. The respondent's shoe, he says, is of the same design as those which he sells to his other customers, but is made of the highest grade of material. There is, moreover, practical unanimity in the testimony upon the point that, as one witness put it, \"anybody who knows anything about a shoe\" would at once distinguish the respondents' make from that of the appellants. Then there is the conduct of the respondents already mentioned, on the eve of the litigation.\nThe respondents' course in offering to amend their advertisements and circulars and to modify their trade-mark for the purpose of distinguishing themselves from the appellants in almost any reasonable way short of abandoning the use of their own name does seem to lend a real corroboration to the contention that their design has been to manufacture a superior class of goods, to sell them under their own name, and to get a reputation and a trade in that way. At first sight the dealings with the Galt Manufacturing Company seemed to tell heavily against the respondents. The evidence of Mr. Weston, however, appears to put a different colour upon this transaction. It seems reasonable to think, in view of that evidence, that the respondent F. H. Hurlburt had conceived what he honestly believed to be a design according to which an exceptionally good cushion sole shoe could be made at a moderate price, and it is not incredible that he should have supposed, as he says he did, that the trade-mark gave him some sort of exclusive right in respect of which he was entitled to charge a royalty; and again it is a little difficult, in view of the circumstances, to accede to the contention that the trial judge's acquittal of the respondent on the charge of dishonesty should be reversed.\nAt all events, the appellants have quite failed to establish any case entitling them to inhibit the use by the respondents of their own name, nor have they made out a case which would justify the imposition upon the respondent's of any undertaking broader than the undertaking they offered before the commencement of the action. It is important to notice that apparently the respondents sell largely, if not exclusively, to the retail trade, and so far as the trade is concerned, as has already been said, there is no sort of duplicity whatever. Any possible risk of confusion in the minds of the ultimate customer would be entirely obviated by the measures suggested by the respondents.\nTherefore, upon the respondents undertaking to state in their advertisements and circulars that they have no connection with the appellants and to amend their trade-mark by attaching to it the name of the respondent, Frank Hurlburt, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is a joint stock company organized under the laws of the Dominion and doing business in the Town of Preston in the County of Waterloo.\nThe respondent is a partnership carrying on business in the Town of Barrie in the County of Simcoe.\nThe former carries on the business of a manufacturer and dealer in foot-wear in a somewhat large and extensive way throughout the Dominion and, in connection therewith, adopted and put into use, on or about the year 1902, a trade-mark consisting of the word \"HURLBUT\" used in connection with the manufacture and sale of foot-wear from thenceforward for many years, and at least until the 4th of August, 1913, when it registered its trade-mark by using the Hurlbut Arms, and below that the word \"HURLBUT,\" and surrounding it with the words \"Genuine-Welt-Patented.\"\nIt was sworn to at the trial that this surplusage was adopted because of mistaken legal advice that the name \"HURLBUT\" alone could not be registered, but this was corrected later and the name \"HURLBUT\" was registered as appellant's trade-mark on the 11th November, 1921.\nThe respondent meantime had registered, on the 5th of September, 1919, as its trade-mark, to be applied to the sale of foot-wear, a representation of a musket and of a bow and arrow, surmounted by the name \"HURLBURT'S,\" and underneath that, the word \"SHOE\".\nThe appellant brought this action on the 22nd of February, 1922, setting forth the foregoing facts and then alleging the following charges:\n8. The said defendant., knowing that the plaintiff had established a reputation in the business relating to the manufacture and sale of shoes and knowing that the word \"HURLBUT\" had acquired a distinctive trademark meaning, has for some time heretofore placed upon the market articles of footwear bearing the name \"HURLBURT,\" with the object of deceiving the public and of unfairly competing with your petitioner and trading upon its name and the reputation it has established.\n9. By reason of such actions of the defendant, the plaintiff has suffered great loss and damage.\n10. As a matter of fact the plaintiff was the first to make use of the word \"HURLBUT\" to be applied to the manufacture and sale of footwear.\n11. That there is a possibility of confusion between the said trademark registered by the said THE HURLBURT SHOE COMPANY, and the plaintiff's trade-mark \"HURLBUT.\" The plaintiff is aggrieved by the registration of the said trade-mark by the defendant and claims that the said registration was made without sufficient cause.\nThat was followed by the following prayer for relief:\n(a) That an order may be made asking that the \"HURLBURT\" contained in the said trade-mark registered in folio 25,255 of Register 106, of the Register of Trade-Marks, be expunged.\n(b) An injunction restraining THE HURLBURT SHOE COMPANY its servants or agents from infringing the plaintiff's said trade-mark and from using the word \"HURLBURT\" in connection with the sale of footwear.\n(c) Damages.\n(d) Costs. (e) Such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require and to the court shall seem just.\nThe case came on for trial before Mr. Justice Audette of the Exchequer Court who held as follows:\nTherefore the case is complicated by this very fact that the most conspicuous part of each trade-mark\u2014that part which appeals to the eye\u2014is the name of the respective parties.\nIt cannot be denied that any person has the undoubted right to use his own name for the purpose of his trade and that no one bearing a similar name has a right to arrogate to himself the exclusive use of the same.\nHowever, that rule must be qualified under numerous judicial decisions to the effect that where such person makes use of his own name for the purpose of fraud and satisfactory evidence of fraudulent intention has been produced, such unfair conduct will be restrained even though the free use of the man's own name may be thereby hindered.

Sun Life Ass'ce Co.[23]; Brinsmead v. Brinsmead[24], (and dismissed) action with costs, and furthermore ordering to vary the registration of the defendant's specific trade-mark No. 106, Folio 25,055, of the 5th September, 1919, by striking out therefrom the word \"Hurlburt's\" and substituting therefor the words \"The Hurlburt Shoe Company.\"\nWith great respect I cannot agree with either the conclusions of fact or of law reached by the learned trial judge.\nThere seems to me, in the history of the respondent's dealings in relation to what is charged against him, much clearer evidence of fraud than in many cases where such conduct as his, in trying to get an advantage over another who has used his own name, as a trade-mark, or an essential feature thereof, for a long period of time and that to the knowledge of the respective defendants, in such cases, has been held so fraudulent, or savouring of fraud, that relief has been granted such as appellant seeks herein.\nTake the case of J. H. Brooks & Co. v. The Norfolk Cycle Company and John Brookes[25]; or the case of Valentine Meat Juice Company v. Valentine Extract Company[26], or the case of Teofani & Co. v. A. Teofani[27]; or the case of John Palmer Co. v. Palmer-McLellan Shoe Pack Co.[28], each shewing a distinctly different angle, in the facts to be looked at, of what was held to be a fraudulent course of dealing which entitled the plaintiff to relief, and in these four which I cite the respective personal names were involved as herein, or more directly so.\nThese cases I have picked out of many because I wanted to present a variety, and also such cases as had involved a use of the trade-mark in question by the originator of it, or successor, for a quarter of a century or less, before seeking successfully relief against him infringing it.\nThat of the appellant herein going back to and including 1902, or part of it, being only a period of twenty years, it occurred to me that possibly that might not be supported as long enough to give that secondary meaning to a person's name to which we find importance so often attached in many decisions but, I submit, long enough to acquire, under the circumstances, a secondary meaning.\nI selected those approximately the same or less; for we so often find the Bass name, and the like, vastly longer in one than any I am now referring to.\nBut is proof of a fraudulent design necessary? From Millington v. Fox[29] down, there are cases such as Reddaway v. Bentham Hemp-Spinning Co.[30]; Johnston v. Archibald Orr Ewing[31], and Powell v. Birmingham Vinegar Co.[32], and J. & J. Cash v. Cash[33], in which it was pointed out that proof of fraudulent intent was not necessary to entitle plaintiff to relief, but proof that it might reasonably be made the foundation of fraud upon the public, and hence an injury to the plaintiff which would entitle him to relief.\nThe said case of Cash v. Cash33 turned upon the question of the use of the personal name of the defendant, and, apart from its probably misleading the public, presented no element of fraud.\nThere is far more evidence of fraud in this case than in that of Warner v. Warner[34], cited by appellant, which also points strongly in same direction.\nThe respondent's dealings with the Galt Shoe Company, and the imitation by it of making a shoe alike to the appellant's make of what the appellant had introduced to the market and called \"The Cushioned Sole Shoe for Children,\u201d which the appellant had used long before the respondent, and in the use of the skeleton foot design (which was designed and adopted by the appellant) the respondent has committed that class of fraud which Lord Justice Cotton, in the case of Turton v. Turton[35], referred to as \"garnishing the use of his name\" by imitating the get-up of appellant's goods.\nThe case of Burgess v. Burgess[36], and cases cited therein, may also profitably be considered.\nMany cases which also may well be considered are cited in the head-notes of the reprint of this case, on page 351 of vol. 43 of said reprint.\nThe appellant's factum contains a wealth of references which if followed out might suggest writing a treatise on the questions involved herein, but I do not intend to do so for the disposal of this case.\nI am tempted, however, to adopt its quotation from the judgment of Lord Justice James in the case of Levy v. Walker[37], which is as follows:\nIt should never be forgotten in these cases, that the sole right to restrain anybody from using any name that he likes in the course of any business he chooses to carry on, is a right in the nature of a trade-mark, that is to say, a man has a right to say: \"You must not use a name whether fictitious or real\u2014you must not use a description, whether true or not, which is intended to represent, or calculated to represent, to the world that your business is my business, and so, by a fraudulent misstatement, deprive me of the profits of the business which would otherwise come to me.\" That is the principle, and the sole principle on which this court interferes;\nand that from the judgment of Lord Alverstone M.R., in the Valentine Case[38] at page 680, as follows:\nA strenuous effort was made by Mr. Upjohn in his very able argument to draw a distinction in cases in which the word which has been used was the name of the defendant, that is the name of the person who was carrying on the business which is complained of. In my opinion there is no difference in principle. You still have to apply the test which the Lord Chancellor laid down in the passage I have read, namely, whether or not the goods of the defendant have been represented as the goods of somebody else. Of course it is more difficult to deal with cases where the name is the name of the person, or the name of both the persons, as distinguished from a fancy name which has been created for the purpose of the particular goods; but I can see no difference in principle between the two cases. as guiding principles in the relevant law needed to be applied in this case.\nI would adopt each of these expressions as applicable herein.\nFor the foregoing reasons I would allow this appeal with costs here and below and give the relief prayed for by way of injunction to be framed (if the majority of this court agree in the result I have arrived at), in settling the minutes of the formal judgment, if the parties cannot agree thereon so as to amply protect the appellant.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fetherstonhaugh & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Denton, Macdonald & Denton.\n[1] [1923] Ex.

Co. for building the Crow's Nest Line provided the company entered into an agreement for substantial reductions in the rates for carrying certain classes of freight over the railway between designated points and feeders and that no higher rates should thereafter be charged. The items of such reductions were set out in the Act and the company executed an agreement embodying these conditions. The reduced rates have since remained in force except as suspended by temporary measures during the war and after the war by power temporarily given to the Board of Railway Commissioners to revise railway tariffs notwithstanding any such statutes or agreements. When this temporary power ceased to exist the question of the reduced rates; came before the board which made an order disallowing tariffs filed under the Act and agreement of 1897 claiming the right to do so under the general authority over railway tariffs given it by the Railway Act. Held, that the said statute and agreement made in 1897 are binding on the board which has, therefore, no power to change the rates thereby fixed.\nHeld also, Idington J. dissenting, that the rates so fixed apply only to carriage of freight between said points and feeders as they existed in 1897. Against such restricted application the anti-discrimination provisions of the Railway Act cannot be invoked.\nThe Act of 1897 is a \"Special Act\" as that expression is defined in the Railway Act.\nIf said Act authorizes the agreement and prescribes its terms the obligations under said agreement are statutory and not merely contractual, just as if the agreement were confirmed by, and made part of, the Act.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners disallowing a tariff of freight rates filed by the respondent in conformity with the provisions of the Crow's Nest Pass Act and agreement.\nThe two questions submitted by the board in granting leave to appeal were: 1. Are the said Act and agreement binding on the board? 2. If not, are the rates established thereby confined in their applications to the traffic between points on the railway designated therein as they existed when the Act was passed or are they applicable to extensions thereof now existing?\nSymington K.C. appeared for the appellant.\nSydney Wood K.C. for the cities of Edmonton and Saskatoon.\nW. T. Henderson K.C. for the city of Brantford.\nG. G. McGeer K.C. for British Columbia.\nR. E. Finn K.C. for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\nTilley K.C. and E. P. Flintoft appeared for the respondent.\nLafleur K.C. for the Canadian Railway Association.\nA. Fraser K.C. for the Canadian National Railways.\nThe judgment of the majority (The Chief Justice and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014By the contract for the construction of the Crow's Nest Pass Railway, made in 1897, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company covenanted and agreed with Her Majesty, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals, inter alia,\n(d) That a reduction shall be made in the general rates and tolls of the company as now charged, or as contained in its present freight tariff, whichever rates are the lowest, for carloads or otherwise, upon the classes of merchandise hereinafter mentioned, westbound, from and including Fort William and all points east of Fort William on the company's railway, to all points west of Fort William on the company's main line, or on any line of railway throughout Canada owned or leased by or operated on account of the company, whether the shipment is by all rail line or by lake and rail, such reduction to be to the extent of the following percentages respectively, namely:\nUpon all green and fresh fruits, 33\u2153 per cent;\nCoal oil, 20 per cent;\nCordage and binder twine, 10 per cent;\nAgricultural implements of all kinds, set up or in parts, 10 per cent;\nIron, including bar, band, Canada plates, galvanized, sheet, pipe, pipe-fittings, nails, spikes, and shoes, 10 per cent;\nAll kinds of wire, 10 per cent;\nWindow glass, 10 per cent;\nPaper for building and roofing purposes, 10 per cent;\nRoofing felt, box and packing, 10 per cent;\nPaints of all kinds and oils, 10 per cent;\nLive stock, 10 per cent;\nWooden ware, 10 per cent;\nHousehold furniture, 10 per cent;\nAnd that no higher rates than such reduced rates or tolls shall be hereafter charged by the company upon any such merchandise carried by the company between the points aforesaid; such reduction to take effect on or before the first of January, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight ;\n(e) That there shall be a reduction in the company's present rates and tolls on grain and flour from all points on its main line, branches, or connections, west of Fort William to Fort William and Port Arthur, and all points east, of three cents per one hundred pounds, to take effect in the following manner: One and one-half cent per one hundred pounds on or before the first day of September, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and an additional one and one-half cent per one hundred pounds on or before the first day of September, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine; and that no higher rates than such reduced rates or tolls shall be charged after the dates mentioned on such merchandise from the points aforesaid.\nThe execution of the agreement containing these and other essential provisions by the company in terms prescribed therein was by the statute 60-61 Vict., c. 5, made the condition of an undertaking to grant a subsidy; and by s. 2 of the statute it was enacted:\u2014\n2. The company shall be bound to carry out in all respects the said agreement, and may do whatever is necessary for that purpose.\nTariffs in conformity with these rates were filed and maintained without serious complaint until 1917, when, owing to enormous increases in operating expenses occasioned by conditions arising out of the war, very substantial advances in railway freight rates were found to be inevitable. These were provided for chiefly by orders in council passed under The War Measures Act during 1917 and 1918, which disregarded all restrictions upon rates imposed by such special Acts and agreements as those with which we are now concerned. When the Railway Act was consolidated in 1919, these emergency orders in council were about to expire. Apparently it was felt that costs of operation were still too great to permit of a return to normal conditions. To provide for the interval until such a return might prove feasible, the following provision was then introduced into the Railway Act as s.s. 5 of s. 325:-\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section three the powers given to the board under this Act to fix, determine and enforce just and reasonable rates, and to change and alter rates as changing conditions or cost of transportation may from time to time require, shall not be limited or in any manner affected by the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, whether general in application or special and relating only to any specific railway or railways, and the Board shall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities, or of undue or unreasonable preference, on the ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by any agreement made or entered into by the company;\nProvided that this subsection shall remain in force only during the period of three years from and after the date of the passing of this Act.\nA further substantial increase in rates was made by the Board of Railway Commissioners in 1920 under the authority of this subsection; and a revision of rates in many important particulars was effected in 1922 after an exhaustive inquiry made by the Board with the purpose of acquiring the information necessary to enable it to fix fair and reasonable freight rates.\nThe temporary character of s.s. 5 of s. 325 is patent. When it was about to expire, Parliament extended its operation by c. 41 of the statutes of 1922, which reads as follows:\u2014\n1. Subsection five of section three hundred and twenty-five of The Railway Act, 1919, shall, notwithstanding the proviso thereof, remain in effect until the sixth day of July, 1923, and may be continued in force for a further period of one year by order of the Governor in Council published in the Canada Gazette; Provided that notwithstanding anything herein or in said subsection five contained, rates on grain and flour shall, on and from the sixth day of July, 1922, be governed by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant to chapter 5 of the statutes of Canada, 1897.\nContinuance for the further period of one year by order in council ensued. Further extension by legislation was sought, but ineffectually, and the operation of s.s. 5 of s. 325 came to an end on the 6th of July, 1924. In anticipation of this occurrence, the railway companies, apparently under the conviction that the rates fixed by clauses (d) and (e) of the Crow's Nest Pass agreement would become again operative, had filed tariffs in conformity therewith effective on the 7th of July\u2014the Canadian Pacific Railway presumably in fulfilment of its obligation, statutory or contractual, and the Canadian National Railway under the practical compulsion of meeting Canadian Pacific rates at competing points. The tariffs so filed by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company applied only to points which had been upon its system in 1897. Complaints of discrimination and unfair treatment from many points to which the system had been subsequently extended immediately began to pour into the Board's offices. The position taken by the complainants was that the Crow's Nest rates should be extended to all points within the designated areas touched by the Canadian Pacific Railway system as it now exists either because the agreement of 1897 should itself be interpreted as so providing, or because the anti-discrimination sections of the Railway Act require the board so to apply them. Hearing of these complaints took place in September. The railway companies then took the stand that the Crow's Nest Rates were no longer binding upon the Board because so to regard them would be inconsistent with the scheme of rate control inaugurated by The Railway Act, 1903, and with the powers by that Act and The Railway Act, 1919, committed to the board. For the Canadian National Railway it was further pointed out that the maintenance of the Crow's Nest rates indirectly, but most effectively, subjected that railway, although it was not a party to the agreement and was not intended to be bound or affected by it, to unfair and unjustifiable rates since it must either accept the Canadian Pacific Railway's reduced rates to and from points where it competes with that railway or entirely forgo traffic of all classes to which they apply.\nOn the 14th of October a majority of the Board (McKeown C.C., Nantel D.C.C., Boyce C., and Lawrence C.) McLean A.C.C., and Oliver C., dissenting, held that the rates stipulated in the Crow's Nest Pass Act and agreement were not binding upon the Board. In their opinion the Crow's Nest Pass Act was not a \"Special Act\" within ss. 2 (28) and 3 of The Railway Act, 1919; if it were such a \"Special Act\" it did not relate to the same subject-matter as the general Railway Act; its application was excluded because the sections in The Railway Act, 1919, respecting tolls (314 et seq.) have \"otherwise provided\" within the meaning of s. 3 of that statute; the Crow's Nest rates should be regarded as fixed by agreement and not by statute; and that agreement does not bind the Board, Regina Rates Case, Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Regina Board of Trade[1], and must not be allowed indirectly to control rates on competitive lines of a railway not a party to it. The order of the board accordingly disallowed, and directed the withdrawal within fifteen days of, the tariffs re-establishing Crow's Nest Pass rates.\nHolding these views the majority of the Board found it unnecessary to deal with the contention of the present appellants and other complainants that the operation of the Crow's Nest Pass rates should be extended to all points now on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's system and also to all points on the Canadian National Railway which might, under the clauses of the Railway Act which provided, against discrimination between different localities, be deemed entitled to the benefit of them. Mr. Assistant Chief Commissioner McLean in his dissenting opinion also refrained from passing upon this contention of the appellants, contenting himself with expressing in clear and forceful terms his reasons for dissenting from the board's decision upholding the contention of the railway companies. Mr. Commissioner Oliver, however, expressed with much vigour his views that:\u2014\n(1) The Crow's Nest Act applies to all lines and connections of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Canada, and, therefore, the rates as defined by that Act should be applied forthwith throughout the Canadian Pacific system.\n(2) In pursuance of the powers vested in this board to prevent discrimination in railway rates and services, the rates defined by the Crow's Nest Act should be applied to the Canadian National system and to all other railway lines in Canada.\nExercising the power conferred by s.s. 3 of s. 52 of The Railway Act, 1919, the Board of Railway Commissioners by order of the 10th of December, 1924, granted leave to the governments of the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to appeal to this court from its order of the 14th of October. By order in council, dated the 25th of December, 1924 (P.C. No. 2220), the operation of the board's order of the 14th of October was suspended until the decision of the appeal.\nSection 52 (3) requires parties seeking leave to appeal to state the grounds on which it is proposed to appeal, and, as is customary, the Board in its order granting leave formulated the \"questions of law and jurisdiction\" to be presented for the consideration of the court. They are as follows:\u2014\n1. Whether, as a matter of law, the board is empowered, under the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Railway Act, or otherwise, to authorize railway rates upon the railway of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in excess of the maximum rates referred to in the Crow's Nest Pass Act, being chapter 5, 60-61 Victoria, Statutes of Canada, and in the agreement therein referred to, upon the commodities therein mentioned.\n2. If the court shall be of opinion that the Crow's Nest Pass Act or agreement is binding upon the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, then, according to the construction of the Crow's Nest Pass Act, section 1, clause (d), and the agreement made thereunder,\n(c) Are the rates therein provided applicable to traffic westbound from Fort William and from all points east of Fort William now on the Canadian Pacific Railway company's railway; or, are such rates confined to westbound traffic originating at Fort William and at such points east of Fort William as were, at the date of the passing of the Act and (or) the making of the agreement, on the company's line of railway?\n(b) Are such rates applicable to traffic originating at points east of Fort William which were, at the date of the passing of the Act and (or) of the making of the agreement, on any line of railway owned or leased or operated on account of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company?\n(c) Are the rates therein provided applicable to traffic destined to points west of Fort William which are now on the Canadian Pacific Company's railway, or on any line of railway owned or leased or operated on account of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company? or\n(d) Are such rates confined to traffic destined to points west of Fort William which were, at the date of the passing of the Act or the making of the agreement, on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's railway, or on any line of railway owned or leased by or operated on account of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company?\n3. Whether, as a matter of law, the Board is empowered, under the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Railway Act, or otherwise, to authorize rates upon the Canadian Pacific Railway on grain and flour from all points on the main line, branches, or connections of the company west of Fort William, to Fort William and Port Arthur, and all points east, beyond the maximum rates specified in the Crow's Nest Pass Act and Agreement, and referred to in chapter 41, Statutes of Canada (1922).\nIn substance two questions are submitted:\u2014\n1. Is the board entitled to authorize rates upon the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in excess of those provided for in the Crows Nest Pass subsidy Act and agreement?\n2. If not, is the application of the rates so provided for confined to traffic in the specified commodities between points on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's lines as they existed at the date of the said Act and agreement to the exclusion of traffic originating at or destined for points to which that company's lines have been subsequently extended?\nWhen the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was incorporated and its charter granted, in 1881, The Consolidated Railway Act, 1879 (c. 9) was in force. By that Act, subject to provisions against discrimination, the power to fix tolls was vested in the railway company or its directors (s. 17). While such tolls were subject to approval by the Governor in Council, Parliament was empowered to reduce them only with the consent of the company and subject to the restriction that when so reduced they should produce not less than 15 per cent per annum profit on the capital actually expended in the construction of the railway (s. 17, s.s. 11). It would seem not unlikely that the exercise of the right of revision by the Governor in Council was by implication subject to a corresponding restriction. In so far as applicable and not inconsistent therewith The Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, was incorporated with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's charter by the statute 44 Vict., c. 1. The stipulation in s. 20 of that charter that the right of Parliament under the general Railway Act to reduce the company's tolls should be \"extended\" so that the profits of the company might be restricted to 10 per cent on the capital actually expended on the construction of the railway, with a corresponding limitation of the controlling power of the Governor in Council, was, perhaps, regarded as a concession in the public interest. But, however that may have been, the honour of the Parliament of Canada was thus pledged to noninterference with the tolls of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company so long as the net profit on capital actually expended by it for construction should not exceed 10 per cent.\nWhen the Railway Act was revised in 1888 (c. 29), while s.s. 11 of s. 17 of The Railway Act, 1879, purporting to restrict the right of Parliament to reduce tolls disappeared, rights conferred by special Acts, such as that of the Canadian Pacific Railway in regard to freedom within specified limits from control of its tolls, were preserved. (ss. 3 to 6).\nThis was the situation when the Crow's Nest Pass railway project came before Parliament in 1897 and it was asked to provide a subsidy for the construction of that railway by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Apparently the Government of the day thought the occasion opportune to secure, in the public interest, greater control over Canadian Pacific Railway tolls than Parliament had stipulated in 1881. It accordingly enacted the statute 60-61 Victoria, c. 5, whereby it appropriated a subsidy for the construction of the projected railway provided the Canadian Pacific Railway Company should enter into an agreement containing, inter alia, the covenants as to rates above quoted, around; which the present controversy centres. The statute sets out in extenso nine undertakings\u2014(a)-(i)\u2014to be given by the company, and they were embodied verbatim in the agreement executed between Her Majesty, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, on the 6th of September, 1897.\nClauses (a) and (b) are covenants for the construction and operation of the Crow's Nest Pass Railway.\nBy clause (c) all local tolls on the new railway itself and certain connecting lines and other lines in southern British Columbia and all tolls on traffic on the entire Canadian Pacific Railway system originating from or destined for any point on the new railway or on such connecting lines and lines in British Columbia were made subject to revision and control by the Governor in Council, or by a railway commission when established.\nBy clauses (d) and (e), above quoted, maximum rates for certain commodities moving in stated directions and between designated points are provided and it is covenanted that no higher rate shall be charged for such traffic after the dates specified. There is no reservation of any power of revision or control in regard to these maxima.\nBy clause (f) the granting of running powers is reserved to the Railway Committee of the Privy Council.\nBy clause (g) the new line and the specified connecting lines in British Columbia and the line between Dunmore and Lethbridge are made subject without restriction to the operation of the general Railway Act.\nBy clause (h) the disposition of any provincial land subsidy is made subject to regulation by the Governor in Council.\nBy clause (i) the company is required to surrender to the Dominion Government 50 per cent of any coal-bearing lands it may obtain from the Government of British Columbia to be dealt with on conditions to be prescribed by the Governor in Council.\nIt is noteworthy that in all these clauses, except (d) and (e), there is a reservation of control by the executive Government of Canada or by a body nominated by Parliament to exercise it. The contrast between clause (c) and clauses (d) and (e) is most striking and significant. All three deal with traffic rates; in clause (c) complete control and power of revision is stipulated for; in (d) and (e) there is an absolute and final fixing of certain maximum rates. It should also be remembered that, as indicated in clause (c), Parliament had before it the probability of the establishment of a railway commission. Nevertheless\u2014as we must assume deliberately\u2014it abstained from reserving to that body, or to its then existing predecessor, any control over the maximum rates fixed by clauses (d) and (e). The main question now before us is whether Parliament by its subsequent general railway legislation, including the creation of the Board of Railway Commissioners and the vesting in it of very broad powers of supervision and control over tolls and rates, as was undoubtedly competent to it\u2014and to it alone\u2014has relieved the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from the operation of clauses (d) and (e) of the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement, abrogating the maxima they prescribed so far as required to give to its delegate, the Board, unrestricted control of rates in respect to the traffic covered by them. On behalf of the respondent railway companies it was strongly urged at bar that the stipulations as to rates in clauses (d) and (e) are merely covenants in an agreement and, as such, not binding on the Board of Railway Commissioners. But the terms on which Parliament was prepared to grant the subsidy for the Crow's Nest Pass Railway involved an interference with a privilege in regard to tolls conceded to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in 1881, which, while not legally binding on Parliament, it no doubt deemed itself in honour obliged to respect. Hence, in all probability, the form adopted of offering the subsidy conditionally upon the railway company agreeing to a modification of that privilege\u2014not, however, in terms to be agreed upon, but in definite and precise terms formulated by Parliament itself in the statute providing for the subsidy. Parliament in effect said: If you, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, will assent to the proposed modification of a provision of your statutory contract of 1881 and will forgo pro tanto the control of rates which it gives you, we will grant you a subsidy on accepting which you will become bound to carry out the terms on which it is granted. That was, in substance and effect, granting a subsidy and imposing by statute the terms on which it was granted. In so far as the arrangement was contractual, while the contract is formally made with Her Majesty in Her executive capacity, it was in reality made with Parliament itself. It alone could grant the subsidy. It represented the people of Canada. Parliament speaks by statute. By statute it authorized the contract. It cannot make the slightest difference whether the statute, passed before the contract was in fact executed, authorized it, prescribed its very terms and declared that when made it should be binding; or, the contract having been already formally executed, the statute ratified and confirmed it and declared its terms binding as if enacted as part of the statute itself. A refinement which, while admitting that the terms would in the latter case be of statutory obligation, would treat them in the former as merely contractual in their nature and effect, does not commend itself either as sound in law or as consistent with common sense.\nBut, it is said, although the Crow's Nest Pass rates should be regarded as imposed by statute, and as such binding in 1897, and subject to be interfered with only by Parliament, they lost that status under The Railway Act, 1903, and then became subject to the control of the Board of Railway Commissioners by that Act created. That, it is argued, was the effect of the scheme of rate control there adopted and of the wide powers for carrying it out conferred on the new Board.\nOn the other hand, it is asserted for the appellants that, as provisions of a special Act relating to the subject-matter of tolls, the stipulations in question came within ss. 3 and 5 of The Railway Act, 1903, and accordingly overrode its provisions so far as was necessary to give effect to them. Clause (w) of s. 2, s. 3 and the concluding clause of s. 5 of The Railway Act, 1903, are as follows:\u2014\n2. (w) The expression \"Special Act\" means any Act under which the company has authority to construct or operate a railway, or which is enacted with special reference to such a railway, and includes all such Acts; and where such authority is derived from letters patent granted under any Act, such letters patent shall be deemed to form part of such Act.\n3. This Act shall apply to all persons, companies and railways (other than Government railways) within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and shall be incorporated and construed, as one Act, with the Special Act, subject as herein provided.\n5 * * * unless otherwise expressly provided in this Act, where the provisions of this Act and of any Special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada relate to the same subject-matter, the provisions of the Special Act shall be taken to override the provisions of this Act in so far as is necessary to give effect to such Special Act.\nAlmost every word of these several provisions was the subject of exhaustive argument and criticism before us, which it is quite impossible to review without writing at inordinate length.\nThe Crow's Nest Pass Act is unquestionably \"enacted with special reference to the Canadian Pacific Railway\" and, therefore, comes within clause (w) of s. 2 and is a \"Special Act\" within the meaning of that term as used in ss. 3 and 5. The suggestion that to bring it within the definition it must also be an Act conferring \"authority to construct or operate a railway\" involves an unjustifiable substitution of \"and\" for \"or.\" That the conclusion of the majority of the board that the Crow's Nest Pass rates were not imposed by a \"Special Act\" rests largely upon such a change in the text being made is apparent from the treatment accorded the corresponding section of The Rail- way Act, 1888, s. 2 (t) by the learned Commissioner who wrote the principal judgment delivered by the board[2], and whose conclusions as to the legal aspect of the case the learned Chief Commissioner unreservedly adopts, with the concurrence of MM. Commissioners Nantel and Lawrence.\nApart entirely from the ordinary rule of construction \"generalia specialibus non derogant\" and the provisions of section 3, in the application of which that principle must govern, we have the explicit saving language of s. 5:\u2014\"unless otherwise expressly provided in this Act,\" etc.\nWe regard it as incontrovertible that the subject-matter of clauses (d) and (e) of section 1 of the Crow's Nest Pass Act and the subject-matter of the sections of The Railway Act, 1903, which confer jurisdiction on the Board in regard to tolls, are the same in the sense required by section 5. The former deals with tolls on the Canadian Pacific Railway alone, as is to be expected in a special Act; the latter with tolls on Dominion railways generally, which, of course, include the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nCounsel for the railway companies pressed the contention that the provisions of s.s. 4 of s. 251 of The Railway Act, 1903, forbidding the taking of tolls by any railway company \"except under the provisions of this Act\" and other similar provisions\u2014especially when contrasted with other sections in which we find such language as \"subject to the provisions in this and the Special Act contained\" (s. 111)\u2014clearly evince an intention to exclude the application of any provision of any special Act inconsistent with giving to them the widest and most comprehensive operation and effect. But, at the most, they amount to a \"providing otherwise\" by implication, whereas section 5 declares that the provisions of the special Act must prevail \"unless otherwise expressly provided in this Act.\" When Parliament intended to exclude the application of the special Act in favour of the general Act of 1903, it said so in unmistakable terms, as, for instance, in section 52 and in subsection 8 of section 175. There is certainly nothing in The Railway Act, 1903, which expressly provides that the rate stipulations of the Crow's Nest Pass Act shall not override, but, on the contrary, shall be subject to the several provisions conferring control of rates on the Board of Railway Commissioners. The same observations apply to arguments founded on the inconsistency of the Crow's Nest Pass rate provisions with the scheme of The Railway Act, 1903, to prevent inequalities and discrimination, and on the fact that to maintain those rates involves subjecting other railway companies not parties to the Crow's Nest Pass agreement to corresponding rate restrictions at competitive points. Nothing short of an express provision abrogating or overriding clauses (d) and (e) of section 1 of the Crow's Nest Pass Act would justify subordinating them to any general provisions of The Railway Act, 1903. Parliament has explicitly so enacted.\nSince, then, we have in the Crow's Nest Railway Act of 1897 a statute which was enacted with special reference to the Canadian Pacific Railway and which relates to the same subject-matter as the toll sections of The Railway Act, 1903, and the latter Act does not expressly otherwise provide, it follows that anything in the provisions of The Railway Act, 1903, which is inconsistent with those of such special Act is thereby overridden so far as may be necessary to give effect to the special Act.\nThat this is not merely the intention expressed in sections 3 and 5 of The Railway Act, 1903, but that it was the actual purpose of Parliament becomes practically certain when we take into consideration two pieces of legislation in pari materia referred to by counsel for the appellants and the subsequent legislation of 1919 and 1922 temporarily suspending all statutory restrictions on the rate-controlling powers of the board.\nIn 1903, the very year in which it constituted the Railway Board and passed the general Railway Act defining its powers, Parliament enacted another railway subsidy Act (c. 7) which contains this provision:\n6. The rates and tolls to be charged for the transfer and carriage of freight and passengers upon the lines of railway so aided and upon all lines owned by the Canadian Northern Railway Company shall be under the control of the Governor-in-Council, or of such authority, commission or tribunal as is designated or constituted under any Act of the Parliament of Canada for the regulation or control of the business of railways; provided that the rates or tolls to be charged shall not in any case be higher than the rates or tolls which may be fixed in the contract to be made between the Government of Canada and the Canadian Northern Railway Company under this Act. Yet we are asked to hold that at the same session the proviso to this section, so obviously designed to prevent the Board, then about to be born, authorizing rates in excess of maxima to be fixed by contract between the Government and the Railway Company, was rendered nugatory by the very generality of the control over rates vested in the new board by The Railway Act, 1903.\nAgain in 1908, by section 6 of chapter 11\u2014another railway subsidy Act\u2014passed five years after the Railway Act, 1903, had come into force, Parliament enacted that:\nThe rates and tolls charged by the company upon any of its lines shall not in any case be higher than the rates and tolls fixed in the contract to be made between the Government of Canada and the Railway Company under this Act;\nanother piece of inconsistent legislation if it was meant that the Board should possess the overriding powers for which the respondent now contends.\nCould more convincing evidence be found that, notwithstanding the wide character of the control over rates vested in the Board of Railway Commissioners, its powers were not meant to extend to the authorization of tolls in excess of maxima which Parliament had seen, or should see, fit to fix by special Acts\u2014that, as stated in section 5 of The Railway Act, 1903, such provisions of special Acts were meant to override the general provisions of the Railway Act, unless otherwise expressly provided?\nA series of opinions expressed by successive chairmen of the Board\u2014Hon. A. C. Killam, Sir Henry Drayton and Hon. F. B. Carvell\u2014recognizing the Crows Nest Pass rates as binding, followed by action based thereon, is likewise not devoid of weight and significance.\nThe legislation of 1919 (c. 68, s. 325 (5)) and that of 1922 (c. 41) form important incidents in the history of railway rate legislation in Canada. These enactments seem to indicate with very great probability that in the view of Parliament the provisions of special Acts fixing maximum rates had not been superseded by the rate control powers conferred on the Board of Railway Commissioners\u2014a circumstance which, notwithstanding the tenor of section 21 of the Interpretation Act, may not be wholly disregarded. When all the circumstances are taken into account the case in favour of the appellants' contention that, upon the sus- pension effected by s.s. 5 of s. 325 of The Railway Act, 1919, expiring in July, 1924, the rates clauses of the Crow's Nest Pass Special Act immediately revived and were in their pristine force and vigour binding on the Board of Railway Commissioners, with the result that it was without jurisdiction to pronounce its order of the 14th of October, seems to us to be incontrovertibly established.\nBefore leaving this branch of the case, lest it be thought it had been overlooked, s. 3 of The Railway Act, 1919, should be noticed. In the revision of 1906 sections 3 and 5 of The Railway Act, 1903, were recast and combined. In their new form they became section 3 of The Railway Act (c. 37, R.S.C. 1906). The phrase \"unless otherwise expressly provided\" was retained intact and applied only to the provision of section 5 of the Act of 1903 carried into section 3 of the Revised Statute. In 1919 the word \"expressly\" is dropped and the phrase \"except as in this Act otherwise provided,\" with which it opens, is made applicable to the entire section, including the clause (a) taken from section 3 of the Act of 1903, replacing as to it the words \"subject as herein provided\" found in the Act of 1903 and the words \"subject, to the provisions thereof\" (i.e. of this Act) found in section 3 of c. 37 of the Revised Statutes, 1906. While it may be that in the change made in 1919 clarity and certainty are to some extent sacrificed to a desire for brevity it would, we think, be extravagant to attribute to Parliament, merely because of the omission under such circumstances of the word \"expressly,\" the intention of thereby effectuating such an important and far-reaching change in its legislative policy as would be involved in clothing the Board of Railway Commissioners with jurisdiction to disregard and override maximum rates prescribed by special Acts such as those of 1897, 1903, and 1908, to which attention has been drawn.\nIn holding the statutory maximum rates fixed by clauses (d) and (e) of the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement to be binding on the Board of Railway Commissioners we do not, as the learned Chief Commissioner apprehended, view the agreement as\nforever disabling the parties thereto from reconsidering their situation * * * or readjusting their relations. On the contrary Parliament, which was in reality one of the contracting parties stipulating the terms on which it would grant the subsidy, may to-morrow reconsider and readjust those terms and relieve the other contracting party from the obligations it incurred; and it is not to be supposed that Parliament would hesitate to exercise its powers for the correction or amendment of legislation which is found to operate prejudicially to the public interest. But Parliament alone can do this. Having made the obligations statutory, it must change or amend them by statute.\nWe now pass to the consideration of the second question: Do the Crow's Nest Pass rates apply exclusively to the designated traffic between points which were on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's lines in 1897? The terms in which the rate reduction clauses (d) and (e) were couched seem to afford a conclusive answer in the affirmative. Both clauses provide for a reduction in then existing rates and tolls\u2014clause (d) by deducting certain specified percentages from rates and tolls in respect to the carriage of certain commodities as now charged or as contained in the present freight tariff of the company, whichever rates are the lowest; clause (e) by deducting from the present rates on eastbound grain and flour 3 cents per one hundred pounds. It is obvious that the rates and tolls to be reduced whether those actually charged, or those contained in the freight tariff, were rates and tolls between points actually on the Canadian Pacific Railway as then existing. There were\u2014there could be\u2014no rates or tolls in existence to or from points not then on the system; and there could be no reductions in non-existing rates and tolls. Counsel for the appellants, therefore, very properly conceded that if question no. 2 were confined strictly to a construction of the Crow's Nest Pass Act and agreement he could not hope to succeed on this branch of the case. He requested, however, to be allowed to treat the question as if the Board had also asked the court to answer its several sub-interrogatories, (a), (b), (c) and (d), having regard to the anti-discrimination sections of the Railway Act. Counsel for the railway companies acquiescing, the court acceded to this suggestion believing it to be in the public interest that the whole question as intended to be submitted and discussed should be dealt with. It should also, perhaps, be observed that no disposition of this question having been made by the order appealed from, it may be doubtful whether it is strictly a proper subject-matter of appeal under s. 52 (3). But it was before the board on the applications of the appellants; it must necessarily be dealt with in view of the conclusion at which we have arrived as to question no. 1; and, if not properly submitted as a subject of appeal under section 52 (3), it was quite open to the board to submit it in the form of a stated case under section 43. We, therefore, think it should be answered regardless of the form in which it has been presented to us.\nFor the reasons fully stated in disposing of the first question we are of the opinion, after giving full consideration to the anti-discrimination sections of the Railway Act, that the provisions of the special Act and agreement must prevail and that effect must be given to the plain and unmistakable terms in which clauses (d) and (e) are couched notwithstanding any discrimination, inequality or unfairness that may ensue. It is quite within the power of Parliament to provide that on certain lines of railway rates and charges in respect of certain traffic shall not exceed stated amounts regardless of any discriminatory effect which the making of such rates and charges may produce. Such provisions are made in the Crow's Nest Pass Act of 1897 and in the two Acts of 1903 and 1908 above quoted. When such maxima are fixed by special Acts they must be regarded as exceptions intentionally made by Parliament from the application of its general policy against discrimination. Section 5 of The Railway Act, 1903, and section 3 of The Railway Act, 1919, apply quite as fully and quite as effectively to the anti-discrimination sections of those respective statutes as they do to the equally general provisions ordaining the control and supervision of tariffs by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThe alleged fact that, if applied to the limited extent for which clauses (d) and (e) distinctly provide, the maintenance of the Crow's Nest Pass rates will produce discrimination and inequality which would ordinarily be in clear violation of the anti-discrimination sections of the Railway Act would not justify an exclusion of their application such as the appellants press for. Discriminations so authorized by Parliament itself cannot be regarded as unjust or prohibited.\nWe, therefore, think it clear that the application of the Crow's Nest Pass rates is confined to traffic between points which were on the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1897.\nWe answer the series of questions submitted as follows:\nQuestion No. 1: No.\nQuestion No. 2:\n(a) Part one: No, Part two: Yes;\n(b) In order that the traffic provided for by clause (d) should fall under that clause it must originate at Fort William or some point east thereof which at the date of the agreement was \"on the company's railway\";\n(c) In order that the rates prescribed in clause (d) should apply the destination of traffic otherwise within that clause must be a point which was, at the date of the agreement, \"on the company's main line or on (some) line of railway throughout Canada owned or leased by or operated on account of the company \";\n(d) Yes.\nQuestion No. 3: No.\nThere remains to be noted a point raised by counsel for the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, namely that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had in the tariffs disallowed by the order of the 14th of October fixed Megantic, in the Province of Quebec, as the most easterly point to which it applied the Crows Nest rates, whereas, it is contended, those rates should be extended to the port of St. John in the Province of New Brunswick, the easternmost point on the Canadian Pacific Railway as it existed in 1897. Of this matter it need only be said that it does not fall within the scope of the questions of law and jurisdiction submitted, and, as indicated in the opinion of the learned Chief Commissioner, it would appear to be one of \"the other and manifold subjects remaining for consideration after the settlement of the main question\" and \"undetermined by the present decision of the board.\"\nIt is not before the court on the present appeal.\nIn appeals from the Board of Railway Commissioners the functions of the Supreme Court are very circumscribed. When it has declared and certified the law as it finds it and has accordingly allowed or disallowed the appeal for which leave is given, Can. Pac. Ry. Co. v. City of Toronto[3], those functions are exhausted. However grave, however disastrous the consequences, the court is powerless to afford a remedy. The Board of Railway Commissioners in its turn can only apply and administer the law as it exists. If, under the existing law, unreasonable rates must be imposed or unfair discrimination sanctioned, with the resulting chaos and other ill effects so graphically portrayed in the opinion of Mr. Commissioner Boyce, the remedy lies with the High Court of Parliament. By amending the existing law it may either itself do, or may empower and require its delegate, the Board, to do as full and complete justice as circumstances admit. Fortunately Parliament is presently in session. Whatever remedy, if any, it may in its discretion consider necessary or desirable can be speedily afforded.\nThe appeal will be allowed to the extent indicated, but, in view of the divided success, without costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada in regard to railway rates in respect of which said board submits as questions of law for the opinion of this court a number of questions of which the first reads as follows:\u2014\n1. Whether, as a matter of law, the board is empowered, under the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Railway Act, or otherwise, to authorize railway rates upon the railway of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in excess of the maximum rates referred to in the Crows Nest Pass Act, being chapter 5, 60-61 Victoria, Statutes of Canada, and in the agreement therein referred to, upon the commodities therein mentioned.\nI regret to find that there has been created such a concurrent jurisprudence since the constitution of the said board in 1903 under and by virtue of The Railway Act, 1903, of decisions by said board and the courts before which the same question has come and, lastly, the high court of Parliament itself by the respective enactments of 1919 and 1922, recognizing the provisions of the Crow's Nest Pass Act as predominant over the powers conferred on the board by virtue of said Railway Act of 1903, that such jurisprudence cannot now be properly overruled in answering said question.\nThere is much in the principles had in view in the creation of the board, and especially in relation to the powers given it over tolls or rates and in the determination thereof, to provide against improper or unjust determinations therein which I am, with due respect, afraid was not duly foreseen, or properly appreciated at the times or occasions on which the decisions constituting the jurisprudence I have referred to was being built up, as it were.\nIt is however, fundamental with us that when our jurisprudence has become thus settled it must remain so until Parliament sees fit to rectify the evils arising thereout.\nI am, therefore, constrained to answer or agree in answering the said question in the negative.\nI may be permitted to remark, however, that the appointment of a Railway Commission was distinctly anticipated by said Crow's Nest Pass Act, as appears by subsection (c) of section 1 thereof, and inferentially would have full power of revision of any toll and thus be enabled to avoid any unjust discrimination.\nThe clear implication rests in the provisions of the Railway Act of 1903, which provided for the constitution of the board that all unjust discriminations in fixing rates should be eliminated by the board as may happen to appear no matter from what cause.\nThe observance of the Act in question would not necessarily impose unjust discrimination under then existing conditions. But in the then rapidly developing condition of things in Canada, no one could foresee when, or in what direction, the observance of the agreement of 1897 might or might not produce unjust discrimination.\nI most respectfully submit that when that did develop, the board had the power, in my opinion, to duly consider the said Act and eliminate so much thereof, or the whole if need be, in order to remove all fair and reasonable grounds of complaint.\nThat point of view was unfortunately not taken and we cannot remedy it.\nIf appeal had been presented here when the board first felt unjust discrimination had developed and such a question as said no. 1, been submitted, I, for one, should, if feeling as at present advised, have answered \"Yes\" instead of \"No.\"\nThe Act merely authorized an agreement such as concluded.\nWe are asked in no. 2 the following questions:\u2014\n2. If the court shall be of opinion that the Crow's Nest Pass Act or Agreement is binding upon the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, then, according to the construction of the Crows Nest Pass Act, section 1, clause (d) and the agreement made thereunder,\n(a) Are the rates therein provided applicable to traffic westbound from Fort William and from all points east of Fort William now on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's railway; or, are such rates confined to westbound traffic originating at Fort William and at such points east of Fort William as were at the date of the passing of the Act and (or) the making of the agreement, on the company's line of railway?\n(d) Are such rates applicable to traffic originating at points east of Fort William which were, at the date of the passing of the Act and (or) of the making of the agreement, on any line of railway owned or leased by or operated on account of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company?\n(c) Are the rates therein provided applicable to traffic destined to points west of Fort William which are now on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's railway, or on any line of railway owned or leased by or operated on account of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company?\n(d) Are such rates confined to traffic destined to points west of Fort William which were, at the date of the passing of the Act or the making of the agreement, on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's railway, or on any line of railway owned or leased by or operated on account of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company?\nI unfortunately cannot agree with the opinion of the majority of the court that it is quite clear that the said Act only applied to the then existing lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway. We are not told what lines of said railway were then existent, or immediately to come into existence, or what other lines in western provinces such as the Canadian National Railway, and whether any of that line running near or through the Canadian Pacific Railway district and possibly might be indirectly involved by the express language of the Act.\nWe are told by the case admitted to us that the Canadian Pacific Railway has since the agreement in question doubled its then mileage.\nAlthough the express language used as to part of the lines in question may bear a then present tense, yet we should never forget that in order to escape unjust discrimination so far not only as its own used lines came into existence but also that of others, many of them might in actual fact come under the operation of the Crow's Nest Pass agreement and said Act.\nTherefore thus indirectly the absolute maintenance of the Crow's Nest tariff may draw with it the tariff to be fixed for such other lines.\nAgain we have in the agreement the 9th paragraph thereof, which reads as follows:\u2014 9. So soon as the said railway is opened for traffic to Kootenay Lake, the local rates and tolls on the railway and on any other railway used in connection therewith and now or hereafter owned or leased by or operated on account of the company south of the company's main line in British Columbia, as well as the rates and tolls between any point on any such line or lines of railway and any point on the main line of the company throughout Canada or any other railway owned or leased by or operated on account of the company, including its line of steamers in British Columbia, shall be first approved by the Governor in Council or by a Railway Commission, if and when such commission is established by law, and shall, at all times thereafter and from time to time be subject to revision and control in the manner aforesaid.\nThis puts the question in a light that leaves no doubt as to rates on the future parts of the road, as well as the present, being brought under the power of the board, and when the specific items of freight tolls mentioned in the 10th paragraph are compared with others a question may arise as to unjust discrimination from another angle of view.\nIt is beyond doubt, I imagine, that there always exists a discrimination of rates relative to different classes of goods but is this now Crows Nest tariff not likely, if left, to be made a standard in fixing rates for goods of some general nature in relation to other freight rates?\nAnd the rates specifically fixed by the agreement came into force on 1st January, 1898, not the previous September as set forth in the judgment of the majority.\nIn short I cannot see how the entire range of the effect of the Crow's Nest Tariff can, on the skeleton presented to us, be definitely determined.\n[1] 45 Can.

The city is situated on the river side, near Montreal; and in order to prevent flooding, a dyke with a roadway on the top was constructed and is maintained by the city. A pumping house not abutting upon any street or highway was erected behind a part of the dyke in order to prevent sewage from backing up in times of heavy rain. This pumping station was worked by electric power conveyed through the delivery system of the city. At a corner of the pump house was a small building known as the valve house having a flat roof somewhat lower than the top of the dyke and situated at a distance of about three feet six inches from it. Children were in the habit of playing about the dyke and in the vicinity of the pump house; and it was possible for them, descending the dyke in disregard of a by-law of the appellant posted at different places, to mount the roof of the valve house, jump on the sloping roof of the pump house and climb on hands and knees to its top, whence they would slide down. The evidence shows that the children engaged in this sport only when the pump house was not occupied and when policemen were not in sight. It was not proved that the city appellant knew, by its officials or otherwise, that children were in the habit of going upon the roof of either house, although it would appear that children were using the roof in the manner described upon favourable occasions. The respondent's son, on the day of the accident, had climbed to the top of the pump house roof and was sitting on the ridge awaiting his turn to slide, when he lost his balance, rolled down the slope opposite the side facing the valve house and the dyke and was arrested in his fall by one of the groups of electric wires at the eaves of the pumping station, whence he was rescued by a neighbour after sustaining the injuries in respect of which the action is brought. The jury found that the accident was \"due to the common fault\" of appellant and respondent; and that the fault of the appellant consisted \"in not having danger notices about the neighbourhood of the pumping station and some fences to prevent boys getting on the roof.\" Judgment by the trial judge for $10,000 was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench.\nHeld, that the case presented no evidence for the jury; that the boy was a trespasser upon the roof and that trespassers have no right to complain of the condition of the premises as they find them; that the electric wires which were the immediate cause of the boy's injury, although an incident of the case, were not an element in the cause of action, because they did not tempt or attract the boy, were not in the nature of a trap, and had nothing whatever to do with bringing the boy upon them, and that the case was therefore distinguishable from the Turntable Cases which have been considered both in Quebec and in England and the United States.\nHeld also that the law does not impose a duty upon proprietors to fence their buildings to exclude mischievous boys any more than it does with respect to natural objects such as growing trees which are no better known nor more familiar.\nPer Idington J. dissenting. The evidence adduced before the jury was such that the trial judge could not properly withdraw the case from the jury and therefore their verdict should stand.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge with a jury and maintaining the respondent's action for $10,000 damages. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLaurendeau K.C. and F. Fauteux for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Claxton for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) in his quality as tutor to his minor son, Walter Sydney Yeoman, recovered judgment against the defendant (appellant) in the Superior Court for $10,000 damages for injuries sustained by his son who fell from the roof of the city pumping station at Verdun upon electric wires which were used for the working of the pumps and was thereby badly burned and disabled. Upon appeal the Court of King's Bench confirmed the judgment, and the city now appeals to this court. The proof is not contradictory and there is no substantial dispute about the facts of the case. The accident occurred on 3rd July, 1922, when the respondent's son Walter, who sustained the injuries, was of the age of about 8\u00bd years. The city of Verdun is situated on the river side where the land is flat and low lying; and, in order to prevent flooding in times of heavy rain or freshet, a dyke was constructed and is maintained by the city along the north bank of the river. The dyke is of considerable dimensions, having a roadway on the top which is used as a promenade, and is broad enough also for the passage of motor vehicles and carriages. The north side of the dyke is a grassy slope, and at intervals steps are set into this for purposes of access to the promenade, and there is a city by-law, notices of which are posted along the slopes of the dyke at different places and near the pump house, whereby\nit is forbidden for any person to cross the embankment known as the dyke or levee at points other than where steps have been provided.\nThese notices are for the protection of the dyke and of the grass growing on the slopes. A sewer discharges opposite to the pump house. The pumping station stands behind the dyke and is worked by electric power conveyed through the delivery system of the city. Ordinarily the water in the river is low enough for the sewer to discharge by gravity, and this condition prevails at the usual rainfall, but in times of heavy rain it is necessary to work the pumps in order to prevent the sewage from backing up and causing an overflow. Mr. Wishart, the secretary-treasurer of the city, testifies that\nthe pumping station is never finally shut up. It is visited continually by the men in the winter time, from the month of December to the month of April we keep four men day and night in the pumping station, and in the summer time the men only go down there when we have a heavy rainfall.\nThe pump house does not abut upon any street or highway; it is reached by a foot path from Pacific Avenue, one of the city streets. The electric wires are introduced into the building on the north side at the eaves in groups of three, horizontally, and at a height above the ground of 14 feet. The pump house is rectangular but not square, the sides facing the north and south being the longer. The roof, which is of galvanized iron unpainted, is described as a hip-roof, having four slopes and is thus constructed somewhat like a pyramid; but, owing to the fact that two of the opposite sides are longer than the other two, the four sides do not meet at a point, and there is a ridge of some length at the apex of the roof running east and west. The perpendicular height from the peak to the eaves is 15 feet 6 inches, and the direct slope of the roof is described as of about 45 degrees. At the southeast corner of the pump house between it and the dyke is a small building known as the valve house. This building has a flat roof which is somewhat lower than the top of the dyke, and is distant from the north slope of the dyke at the nearest point about three feet six inches. Children were in the habit of playing about the dyke and in the vicinity of the pump house, and it was possible for them, in disregard of the by-law, descending the dyke, to mount the flat roof of the valve house. They were seen there on several occasions by city policemen who warned them and sent them away. It appears, however, that some of the larger and more adventurous of the boys who were accustomed to play about the place, had discovered that they could by running along on top of the valve house towards the pumping station, from which it was separated only by a narrow passage, jump onto the sloping roof of the pump house, and run up this roof for a distance on foot until their speed was overcome by the ascent, and then, by grasping the projection formed by the intersection of the south and east planes of the roof, clamber on hands and knees to the top, whence they would slide down, and, by the assistance of a guy-wire which was fastened to the top of the pump house, swing themselves back at the end of the slide on to the flat roof of the valve house. The boys engaged in this sport only when the pump house was not occupied, and when policemen were not in sight. Several policemen who patrolled the neighbourhood, and an employee of the city who had been engaged in the working and repair of the pumping station for twenty years, were called; they testify that they had never seen or heard of any boys being upon the roof of the pump house, although two of the policemen had seen children on the valve house and had sent them away. No report had been made to the secretary-treasurer of the city, and he had no knowledge that boys had been upon the roof of either house; he describes with emphasis his astonishment that an accident could have happened there. There is thus no evidence that the city authorities knew that boys were sliding, or had at any time been on the roof of the pump house, or of any danger connected with it, or of any complaint or accident which might have brought home to them the fact of the sliding, or the existence of any danger. It would appear, nevertheless, that during the season of 1922, and for the two previous seasons, boys had used the roof of the pump house in the manner described upon favourable occasions. The respondent's son, Walter, whose parents had moved into the locality only in the spring of 1922, was one of the boys who engaged in the sliding, and on the day of the accident he had climbed to the top of the pump house roof, and was sitting on the ridge with a companion awaiting his turn to slide, when unfortunately he lost his balance, rolled down the slope on the north side, and was arrested in his fall by one of the groups of electric wires at the eaves of the station, whence he was rescued by a neighbour after sustaining the injuries in respect of which the action is brought. The trial took place on 15th and 16th February, 1923; the boy was examined as a witness and gave his testimony very intelligently; he had been two years at school; he was nine years old on 8th December, 1922; he says that he had played on the pump house station roof pretty often; he describes how, after school, the boys used to climb there; he says that there was never anybody about to chase them away; he says that he never told his father or mother about his sliding, because he was afraid he would be punished for it, and he gives the following evidence:\u2014\nBy the court:\nQ. Did you know what you were doing was wrong?\u2014A. Yes\u2014well no, I didn't think there was any danger.\nBy defendant's counsel:\nQ. We don't ask you that, Walter. We ask you if you thought it was wrong to slide on that roof?\u2014A. No, I asked the other boys when I first went there if the man allowed them to slide on the roof, and they said they did not know, but they always slid on the roof.\nQ. Why would your mother give you a hiding for doing that? You were afraid though that you would get a hiding if you told your mother you would go there?\u2014A. Because some days I would come with my stocking rubbed and she would say where did I get my stocking rubbed and I would tell her I was down at the boats.\nQ. But you had been on the roof?\u2014A. Yes, I bad rubbed them sometimes.\nQ. Did you ever hear your mother say that children had been sliding there, and that she had turned them off?\u2014A. No, I never heard her say that.\nBy a juror: Could I inquire if it is known that boys slid down this roof in winter time?\nThe court: You might ask him.\nBy a juror:\nQ. Walter, do you know of any of your friends that ever slid down over that same roof in the winter time?\u2014A. No.\nBy defendant's counsel:\nQ. That is because the men are working in winter?\u2014A. The men are working in winter.\nQ. And the boys don't slide when they know there are men inside?\u2014A. No, they don't slide.\nBy a juror:\nQ. I am not sure whether you quite understand me. I want to know if your friends are aware of them sliding down there in the winter time?\u2014A. Well, all the boys that ever slid down there with me around there, they said they did not slide in the winter time, because the men were working in there.\nQ. And would not allow them?\u2014A. Would not allow them.\nSeveral of the boy's companions with whom he had been in the habit of sliding were called; the ages of the boys who testified were respectively at the time of the trial, 9, 12, 13 and 15 years, the respondent's son being the youngest of these. James Mills, 7 years of age, was called to prove the sliding; he had been at the place in company with the other boys, but he did not slide. They concur in the statement that they were never chased away from the building, but that they did not slide when the men were working there. One boy says he did not know whether the men were inside or not; that he never saw a policeman about there, and that he did not know it was forbidden to slide. It was admitted that a number of the other boys would, if called, have given substantially the same testimony as the boys who had testified.\nThe case was tried with a jury and the learned trial judge submitted questions upon which the jury found in effect that the accident was not\ndue solely to the fault, carelessness or negligence of the defendant and its employees;\nthat the accident was not\ndue solely to the fault, carelessness or negligence of the child or of his father;\nthat the accident was\ndue to the common fault, carelessness or negligence both of the defendant and its employees on the one hand, and of the father or his minor son on the other;\nthat the fault, carelessness or negligence of the defendant and its employees consisted\nin not having danger notices about the neighbourhood of the pumping station, and some fences to prevent boys getting on to the roof;\nthey found moreover that the father was not guilty of any negligence; and, in answer to the question\nin what the fault, carelessness or negligence of the child consisted\nthe jury answered\nhe had no business to have been on the roof at all, and must have known it was wrong, as he did not want his parents to know he had been there.\nThe jury assessed the damages at $20,000, deducting $10,000 by reason of the boy's fault, and the learned judge denied a motion on the part of the city for dismissal of the action notwithstanding the verdict, and entered judgment for the respondent for $10,000 damages as found.\nThe findings of the jury were returned in the light of the observations made by the learned trial judge during his charge, and it may be well to reproduce the material passages. Upon the suggestion that the boy was at fault in going on the roof, he said:\nNow you will have to decide, first of all, whether that boy was in fault or not in sliding down that roof. It was not his roof. He evidently knew there was something wrong about it, like all these boys, because you will have noticed that the occasions they took for sliding on that roof were when there were no policemen about. They evidently were of all ages, and most of them at all events would know that that action was not a correct action. As to the lack of notices or fencing:\nNow, there is no doubt whatever that the defendant put no kind of a notice to anybody not to go upon those premises, that there was no notice like \"private Property,\" \"No trespassing here.\" There was no fence between the dyke and the top of that shed. There was nothing to prevent anybody who was inclined to get on to the roof from doing so. At the back of the roof were electric wires, high voltage electric wires. Except for somebody doing what has happened in this particular instance they apparently would have been as safe as anything could be, because they were fourteen feet above the ground. There was no possible chance of anybody touching them, and in the position in which they were in seems to me they were quite secure. But you will have to make up your minds\u2014I don't see for myself that the presence of those electric wires were any danger in themselves, because it is perfectly clear that if a person grasps two of those wires at the same time that he runs a very good chance of being instantly killed.\nWith regard to the obligations of the city the jury were told that:\nThe city should have known that this roof was being used as a playground. There is no doubt about it, and the boys say they did use it as a playground. No single witness has been brought here connected in any way with the city who ever saw that roof used as a playground. The nearest approach is the statement of two constables. The last one examined in rebuttal, and another one examined in defence, who say that they had seen children on the little valve house and that they had ordered them away, and one of them never reported that to his superior officer. Of course, if he did not report it the city council could not very well take any steps, so that something could be done to alter things. The secretary-treasurer, who in all municipalities probably knows a good deal more about the affairs of the council, always ton the job, the secretary-treasurer told us that he had not the faintest suspicion that that roof was being used as a playground, as a slide by these children, until after the accident. We do know that a serious accident happened, and it is for you to say whether the city should have been able to foresee that such an accident could be possible, by children getting on the roof, and if they did foresee that such an accident was possible if they should not have taken some steps to make it impossible for children to get on to that roof. What strikes me in connection with that roof is not only the danger of the electric wires, which seems one of the smallest dangers to me, but it would be the danger to children idling from the roof down some fourteen feet below. This boy might just as well have broken his neck instead of having burned his arm off if he had slid off that roof. Well now, seeing the position that that roof was in, in regard to that dyke, seeing the comparatively easy access there was to it, seeing the fact that the children used to frequent that dyke, it is for you gentlemen to say whether or not the city was negligent in not fencing that house off in some way.\nThere was no possible danger that could take place, to my mind, with those electric wires in any other way provided access to that roof was rendered impossible from the dyke side. If some fence had been used, had been put up there, which children could not scale, and possibly barb wire in some way or other, because it would take a good deal to keep characters of the stamp of these boys from getting on the roof, if there was any possibility to do it it would take a great deal of ingenuity, to plan a barricade that would keep them out, I should fancy: but there, it is for you gentlemen to decide whether such a barricade of some kind or another should have been put up.\nFinally upon the suggestion of counsel that the judge should instruct the jury to consider the capacity of the boy to discern between right and wrong, and as to whether he was capable of fault, the judge, having stated his impression that this was a pretty bright lad, told the jury that if they thought he was old enough to know what he was doing to be wrong, if he was old enough and intelligent enough to be conscious of the danger of going on the roof, then they would be in a position to find that it was careless and imprudent on his part, and that there was fault in going on the roof.\nThe evidence points only to the conclusion that the boys were trespassers upon the building. Although the learned trial judge said in his charge that the city should have known that the sliding was going on, it is noteworthy that when the building was occupied the boys did not slide; when the policemen were in sight the roof was deserted; the building was on the water side and the only witnesses who testify to seeing the boys on the roof, except the boys themselves, are five residents of Pacific Avenue, a street which terminates on the flats in the immediate vicinity of the pump house. One of these was the mother of the injured boy. There is no suggestion of a report by any of these to the city authorities; it was known that the city did not allow children to play on the flat roof of the valve house, that when they had been seen there by the police they had been sent away. Constable McCaskill testifies that he had seen children on the roof of the valve house two or three times and he adds:\nOf course when you are in uniform, when the youngsters see us around there they will certainly get off and get away home. I had occasion to bring one down to his mother and I warned her about the danger the child was in in falling off the roof perhaps.\nTrespassers have no right to complain of the condition of the premises as they find them. The law is stated by Sourdat, 6th ed. vol. I, 661, as follows:\nNul ne doit s'introduire sur l'h\u00e9ritage d'autrui sans son consentement. En le faisant, on s'expose \u00e0 toutes les cons\u00e9quences des accidents qu'on peut y rencontrer. Ainsi je p\u00e9n\u00e8tre dans une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 close, m\u00eame sans intention malveillante, peut-\u00eatre seulement pour \u00e9viter un circuit de la route qui m'obligeait \u00e0 tourner autour des murs, tandis que je puis traverser en ligne droite. Le propri\u00e9taire chasse ou s'exerce au tir. Un coup de feu, parti de l'\u00e9paisseur du bois, m'atteint et me blesse. La faute est tout enti\u00e8re de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9. On ne pouvait point soup\u00e7onner ma pr\u00e9sence en cet endroit.\nLa jurisprudence autorise m\u00eame l'emploi de moyens de d\u00e9fense, tels que chiens de garde, pi\u00e8ges, appareils explosibles, pour prot\u00e9ger les habitations et leurs d\u00e9pendances contre les incursions des animaux, ou des personnes qui tenteraient de s'y introduire ind\u00fbment.\nUpon appeal the Court of King's Bench considered that there was evidence for the jury, and that the findings and judgment at the trial ought not to be disturbed, but Dorion J. dissented upon the ground that the city did not know and was not bound to know of the use which the boys were making of the roof, and that it could not have been reasonably anticipated that an accident of the kind might occur; he maintains that the jury have attributed fault to the city where there was none.\nOne cannot approach the consideration of this case without realizing the aptitude and truth of an observation of Lord Justice Farwell in Latham v. R. Johnson & Nephew, Ltd.[1], a case which proceeded upon the assumption that the infant plaintiff was a licensee, where he said:\u2014\nIt is imposable to hold the defendants liable unless we are prepared to say that they are bound to employ a groundkeeper to look after the safety of their licensees, and the result of such a finding would be disastrous, for it would drive all landowners to discontinue the kindly treatment so largely extended to children and others all over the country. We must be careful not to allow our sympathy with the infant plaintiff to affect our judgment; sentiment is a dangerous will-of-the-wisp to take as a guide in the search for legal principles.\nThe case is perfectly distinguishable from the class of cases of which the Turntable Cases, which have been considered both in Quebec, in England and in the United States, are types, where proprietors have been held responsible for injuries caused to young children incapable of negligence, who were permitted to be upon the premises, by machines placed within their reach and capable of being operated by them in a manner to cause them injury, and in which it has been held that a duty rests upon the proprietor to protect the child against artificial contrivances which embody a peril unknown to him and unexpected. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Coley[2] ; Cooke v. Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland[3] ; Railroad Co. v. Stout[4]; also United Zinc & Chemical Co. v. Britt[5]; New York, New Haven & Hartford Rd. Co. v. Fruchter[6]. We are concerned here not with a vehicle, nor with any sort of machine with which it is in itself dangerous for children to meddle, but with an ordinary and usual object in a city, a building with a pitched roof, the use and purpose of which is well known to every school boy, and with the misuse of it for a dangerous sport by school boys who it is impossible to suppose had not a perfect realization of what they were doing and of the dangers incident to their sport.\nThe case should be cleared of the confusion which is imported by reason of the electric wires ; these enter the building at the eaves on the north side, fourteen feet from the ground, where they could not be reached without the use of a ladder, or by the extraordinary method by which this unfortunate boy came there, climbing the roof on the opposite side and descending upon them; the wires were not and are not alleged to have been in anywise an object of attraction or curiosity; they possessed no lure; they did not tempt or fascinate; they had none of the properties belonging to a trap, and they had nothing whatever to do with bringing the boy upon them; as said by Dorion J., this came about in consequence\nd'un accident r\u00e9sultant d'un autre accident,\nand such an occurrence, the possibility of which is demonstrated by the event, was a contingency too remote to be reasonably anticipated, Horsburgh v. Sheach[7]. The boy Yeoman immediately before his fall was sitting on the ridge of the roof to which he had climbed in company with another boy who sat beside him. If at the same time the latter had also lost his balance and, escaping the wires, had fallen to the ground and sustained injuries by his fall, I can see no reason to suppose that he would not have every right of recovery which Yeoman has; or if the respondent's son had fallen to the ground and broken his arms without touching the wires, is it possible that he would be any the less entitled to compensation? I should think not. These wires are an incident of the case, not an essential; they contribute perhaps to the damages, but they are not an element in the cause of action. The boys were able by the exercise of considerable agility and some ingenuity to climb the roof of the pump house, and thence to slide off on to the flat roof of the valve house by means of the guy-wire, which, in a manner that is not clearly explained by the evidence, was used to direct the course of the sliding and the off take from the sloping roof to the flat underlying one. These were uses for which it is needless to say the roof was not designed or intended and nobody knew this better than the boys themselves. Indeed it would appear that the case was of the class which was excluded by Lord Atkinson in Corporation of the City of Glasgow v. Taylor[8], which is cited to elucidate, where he said:\u2014\nThere is in my view, no resemblance between this case and those cases where mischievous boys sustain injury by interfering with or misusing natural objects, such as trees in public parks up which they may be tempted to climb, or water, ornamental or other, into which they may accidentally fall or be tempted deliberately to enter. The appearance of such objects as these is well known and unmistakable. There is nothing deceptive or misleading about them. They cannot well be mistaken for things other than, or different from, what they really are.\nIn the same case, p. 60, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline says in his speech:\nIn grounds open to the public as of right, the duty resting upon the proprietors, or statutory guardians like a municipality, of making them reasonably safe does not include an obligation of protection against dangers which are themselves obvious.\nIt is maintained that evidence is presented here for the consideration of the jury and that effect should be given to their finding. It is true that the question whether or not the defendant was negligent is for the jury, but behind that is the question of law for the court as to whether the negligence alleged constitutes a ground of legal liability. The allegation of fault in the plaintiff's declaration is as follows:\u2014\nDefendant is in fault and responsible for the damages suffered by the said Walter Sydney Yeoman because it did not take precautions to prevent the said Walter Sydney Yeoman and other children from playing on the roof and in the neighbourhood of the pump house which was dangerous, and to protect people, and particularly the said Walter Sydney Yeoman, from the danger of being injured by coming into contact with the electric wires running into the pump house.\nThe faults found against the defendant are the absence of danger signals about the neighbourhood of the pumping station, and of fencing to prevent boys getting on to the roof. The Lord Chancellor (Cairns) had occasion to consider in the well known case of Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Jackson[9], the distinction between the functions of the court and of the jury, and, having explained the respective duties which fall to be discharged by the judge and by the jurors, he concludes with the statement that:\nIt is indeed impossible to lay down any rule except that which at the outset I referred to, namely, that from any given state of facts the judge must say whether negligence can be legitimately inferred, and the jury whether it ought to be inferred.\nThe rule is the same in the province of Quebec; it is provided by Article 469 of the Code of Civil Procedure that\nwhenever the judge is of opinion that the plaintiff has given no evidence upon which a jury could find a verdict he may dismiss the action.\nIf therefore the learned trial judge had adopted my view of the case he would have found no evidence from which negligence on the part of the defendant could have been properly inferred, and he would have dismissed the action; and, if the judge should have done this, the plaintiff's case is not established or improved by the verdict, for it does not rest upon a legal foundation. Canadian Pacific Railway v. Frechette[10].\nMoreover, as to the faults found against the city, they are not faults. The danger of falling off the roof, to which the boy voluntarily exposed himself, and from which he suffered, was one which was apparent, and which is common to all buildings. As to the wires, there was no risk from them that could be seen, or reasonably foreseen. There was no place from which the boy could legitimately view the wires except from the ground, and there he was in no danger from them. I do not interpret the jury's finding as meaning that the notices should have suggested that there were electric wires on the north side of the building which would increase or aggravate the danger to people falling from the top of the roof, when of course nothing was further from the thought of the proprietor, nor less within the region of anticipation or conjecture, than that any climbing of the roof should be permitted or take place. As to the fencing, it is, as the learned judge told the jury, a difficult project to build a fence high enough and tight enough to exclude mischievous boys of the capacity and ingenuity manifested by the evidence in the case, and in my judgment the law does not impose that duty upon proprietors any more as to their buildings than as to natural objects, which are no better known nor more familiar; the case of negligence would have been the same if in the place of the pump house a tree had been growing where the building was, and the boy, indulging his desire to climb, had fallen from the branches and injured himself. The alleged liability is founded upon article 1053 of the Civil Code which declares that\nevery person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of still.\nLiability in cases of this sort is founded upon fault, but no precedent has been cited, and I have not been able to find one, either in the jurisprudence of the province or in the decisions in England or in the United States, where fault or liability has been judicially found upon facts such as those presented in this unfortunate case.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action should be dismissed with costs throughout.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent in his quality as tutor brought this action for damages suffered by his minor son resulting from an accident which took place on the 3rd of July, 1922, at the Verdun pumping station whereby the boy lost one arm and the use of the other.\nThe case was tried by Mr. Justice Lane, with the assistance of a special jury who brought in a verdict of $20,000, founded on their answers to questions submitted to said jury, presumably with the assent of the respective counsel for either side.\nBy reason of the jury finding that the boy was guilty of contributory negligence and that the verdict should be reduced to half said amount, the judgment is only for $10,000.\nThe judge and jury, by consent of counsel, visited the scene of the accident and thus had exceptional means of appreciating correctly the evidence adduced on either side.\nThe learned trial judge's charge to the jury was eminently fair and no exception has been taken thereto. The questions submitted brought out all that could have been reasonably desired in such a case, and were so fully explained in the charge of the learned judge to the jury that there can, I submit, be no mistake in their answers as covering the whole ground involved.\nThe counsel for appellant made a motion, after the jury retired, for a judgment non obstante veridicto and, from what transpired in regard thereto, it is quite clear that the learned trial judge, who was in a better position than we are to appreciate the correctness of the jury's findings and the proper result flowing therefrom, fully approved of the verdict and entered judgment according therewith.\nThe defendant appealed therefrom to the Court of King's Bench and, after hearing said appeal and fully considering same, the learned Chief Justice Lafontaine, Mr. Justice Gu\u00e9rin and Mr. Justice Howard, each wrote at length their respective reasons for dismissing said appeal and Mr. Justice Tellier concurred with Mr. Justice Howard's views.\nTo my mind they covered between them the entire ground most effectively; and I so entirely agree with their reasoning (save that of the learned Chief Justice in some remarks of minor importance as to the responsibility of the boy's mother, with which I cannot agree in view of the jury's entire exoneration of the respondent), that I can see no useful purpose to be served by repeating their reasons here.\nMr. Justice Dorion briefly dissented.\nI may observe in parting with this case that there assuredly was such substantial evidence for the consideration of the jury that, in my humble opinion, no one would be justified in withdrawing this case from their consideration.\nAnd, lest it be suggested that the rule in that regard differs in Quebec from that applied here and in England, I submit the following quotation from the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Company[11]:\u2014\nIn Quebec, when an unsuccessful party after verdict moves for judgment or a new trial, the function of the court under the Code of Civil Procedure is the same as the function of a court of appeal in this country in similar circumstances. It is not the province of the court to retry the question. The court is not a court of review for that purpose. The verdict must stand if it is one which the jury, as reasonable men, having regard to the evidence before them might have found, even though a different result might have been more satisfactory in the opinion of the trial judge and of the court of appeal.\nFor the foregoing reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fauteux & Fauteux.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Claxton & Claxton.\n[1] [1913] 1 K.B. 398, at p. 407.\n[2] [1907] Q.R. 16 K.B. 404.\n[3] [1909] A.C. 229.\n[4] [1873] 17 Wallace Sup.

Comme la question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider ne se pr\u00e9sente pas de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re dans chaque esp\u00e8ce, il sera pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de les envisager s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\nPremi\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce. Les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ce proc\u00e8s peuvent se raconter assez bri\u00e8vement.\nEn 1912, Xavier Martin et Alfred Martin, l'intim\u00e9, \u00e9taient copropri\u00e9taires par indivis de deux terres dans le canton Caron qu'ils avaient achet\u00e9es le 10 avril 1909, d'un nomm\u00e9 Napol\u00e9on Gagn\u00e9.\nLe 12 avril 1912, les nomm\u00e9s Alphonse Aubin et Georges Perron se mirent en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour le terme de 99 ans, sous la raison sociale de \"Aubin & Perron\", pour la construction et l'exploitation d'un aqueduc dans les paroisses de St-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, H\u00e9bertville et Ste-Croix du Lac \u00e0 la Croix. L'acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clarait que le capital de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 serait form\u00e9 des sommes per\u00e7ues des divers cultivateurs ou autres personnes qui, pour avoir l'eau \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9, donneraient une somme variant avec la grandeur de leur terre, la base \u00e9tant de $350 par lot de cent acres. Ce capital devait aussi comprendre les sommes per\u00e7ues pour loyer de robinets et le montant que les associ\u00e9s devaient fournir par parts \u00e9gales pour terminer la construction de l'aqueduc, si les fonds ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas suffisants.\nApr\u00e8s la formation de leur soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Aubin & Perron cherch\u00e8rent \u00e0 se procurer le capital requis en obtenant des cultivateurs une contribution en argent en consid\u00e9ration du service de l'aqueduc projet\u00e9. A ces fins, le 26 mai 1912, ils sign\u00e8rent avec quarante-cinq cultivateurs de St-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, d'H\u00e9bertville et de Ste-Croix un contrat devant notaire contenant les conventions suivantes, pour ne citer que celles qui importent \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la cause. Aubin et Perron s'engag\u00e8rent \u00e0 construire un aqueduc jusqu'\u00e0 la limite des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des parties de seconde part (les cultivateurs), \u00e0 leur fournir l'eau \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 et \u00e0 entretenir l'aqueduc en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9parations moyennant le paiement de $250 pour un demi-lot, de $300 pour trois quarts de lot, de $350 pour un lot de 100 \u00e0 135 acres, de $400 pour un lot et demi et deux lots avec une seule b\u00e2tisse, et de $500 pour deux lots b\u00e2tis et plus. Les cultivateurs s'engag\u00e8rent \u00e0 verser cette somme et, \u00e0 l'expiration de vingt-cinq ann\u00e9es, \u00e0 payer annuellement deux pour cent sur le montant de leur contribution. Il y avait d\u00e9fense pour les cultivateurs de d\u00e9penser l'eau inutilement ou de permettre de prendre l'eau \u00e0 ceux qui n'y avaient pas droit. Parmi les parties de seconde part, Xavier Martin entreprit de payer la somme de $350, qu'il a effectivement vers\u00e9e, et de payer les deux pour cent apr\u00e8s les vingt-cinq ans. Aubin et Perron d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent hypoth\u00e9quer l'aqueduc jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $20,000 en faveur des parties de seconde part pour leur garantir le bon fonctionnement de l'aqueduc. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, pour les fins de cette cause, de se prononcer sur la valeur de cette hypoth\u00e8que portant sur un aqueduc projet\u00e9, qui, au demeurant, n'est pas d\u00e9crit au d\u00e9sir de la loi.\nLes sommes ainsi promises par les parties de seconde part se montent \u00e0 $15,850, et nous verrons dans la cause de La Compagnie d'Aqueduc du Lac St-Jean v. Fortin qu'il y a eu d'autres contributaires.\nLe 4 ao\u00fbt 1916, Alfred Martin, l'intim\u00e9, achetait de Xavier Martin la part de ce dernier dans les deux terres qu'ils avaient acquises de Napol\u00e9on Gagn\u00e9. Dans l'acte de vente il \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le vendeur transportait \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur toutes ses parts dans la compagnie d'aqueduc Aubin & Perron.\nLe 17 mars 1917, Georges Perron vendait \u00e0 Euclide Perron tous ses droits dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aubin & Perron. Le 15 septembre 1917, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aubin & Perron vendait \u00e0 l'appelante tous ses biens meubles et immeubles, et notamment l'aqueduc en question et ses accessoires, comprenant\nses privil\u00e8ges, droits et permis, pouvoirs hydrauliques, installations, concessions, syst\u00e8mes d'aqueduc, servitudes actives, revenus, exploitations, choses et contrats d\u00e9pendant de l'aqueduc appartenant \u00e0 la dite venderesse dans le canton Caron, comt\u00e9 du Lac St-Jean, en rapport avec le dit aqueduc.\nLe 14 mai 1923, l'appelant a intent\u00e9 cette action contre l'intim\u00e9 lui r\u00e9clamant la somme de $358.45 pour service de l'aqueduc depuis le 31 ao\u00fbt 1916. L'intim\u00e9 en d\u00e9fense a invoqu\u00e9 le contrat sign\u00e9 par Xavier Martin, son copropri\u00e9taire.\nDans sa d\u00e9position, l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare qu'il exploitait les deux terres en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avec Xavier Martin, qu'il avait fourni l'argent pour la part d'aqueduc acquise par ce dernier, qu'il \u00e9tait absent de la maison quand on a fait signer Xavier Martin, sans cela il aurait sign\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, et que la signature de celui-ci devait compter pour les deux.\nEtant donn\u00e9 que l'appelante a acquis avec l'aqueduc les\nchoses et contrats d\u00e9pendant de l'aqueduc * * * en rapport avec le dit aqueduc,\nce qui mettait l'appelante \u00e0 la place d'Aubin & Perron quant \u00e0 ces contrats, et que Xavier Martin a transport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 toutes ses parts dans la compagnie d'aqueduc Aubin & Perron, nous sommes d'avis que l'appelante a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 aux obligations assum\u00e9es par Aubin & Perron \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Xavier Martin, et que l'intim\u00e9 a acquis les droits de ce dernier et peut exiger de l'appelante le service d'eau conform\u00e9ment aux stipulations du contrat du 26 mai 1912. Il y a de part et d'autre un lien contractuel, et il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de se demander quelle est la nature du droit que le contrat a cr\u00e9\u00e9.\nA l'audition, M. Belcourt, conseil de l'appelante, a pr\u00e9tendu que Xavier Martin aurait d\u00fb payer une plus forte somme que $350, les deux terres dont il \u00e9tait copropri\u00e9taire ayant une superficie sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 de 100 \u00e0 135 acres.\nCe moyen, soulev\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 l'audition, ne peut \u00eatre accueilli, et il ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante, sur l'action telle que prise, un suppl\u00e9ment d'indemnit\u00e9. L'appelante demande que l'intim\u00e9 soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer le service d'eau d'apr\u00e8s un tarif qu'elle a adopt\u00e9; et l'intim\u00e9 lui oppose le contrat du 26 mai 1912. Ce serait changer la nature de l'action que l'appelante a intent\u00e9e que de lui permettre maintenant de faire valoir l'insuffisance de la contribution primitive de Xavier Martin. S'il y a eu erreur quant au montant de cette contribution, l'appelante n'est peut-\u00eatre pas sans recours, nous ne nous pronon\u00e7ons pas sur ce point, mais elle devra exercer ce recours, s'il y a lieu, par une autre action.\nL'appelant a aussi pr\u00e9tendu qu'il s'agit dans l'esp\u00e8ce d'un droit d'usage et partant incessible aux termes de l'art. 494 C.C. Nous croyons cette pr\u00e9tention absolument inadmissible.\nL'appel est visiblement mal fond\u00e9 et doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nDeuxi\u00e8me esp\u00e8ce. Le cas de Joseph Fortin n'est pas d'une solution aussi facile.\nEn 1912, Joseph Guay \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de la terre au sujet de laquelle l'appelante r\u00e9clame $449.20 de Fortin pour service de l'aqueduc depuis le 31 ao\u00fbt 1914, conform\u00e9ment au tarif qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 pour ses abonn\u00e9s. Le 25 ao\u00fbt 1912, Joseph Guay et une vingtaine d'autres cultivateurs ont sign\u00e9 avec Aubin & Perron un contrat devant notaire par lequel, en consid\u00e9ration du paiement de $175 par Joseph Guay, et d'autres sommes plus ou moins fortes par les autres signataires, le total \u00e9tant de $3,790, Aubin & Perron se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 leur fournir et livrer l'eau \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9. L'eau doit \u00eatre conduite jusqu'aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des cultivateurs au moyen d'un ma\u00eetre tuyau et les raccordements jusqu'\u00e0 ce tuyau sont aux frais des cultivateurs. Le contrat ne contient pas la clause de deux pour cent, au bout de vingt-cinq ans, comme dans le contrat analys\u00e9 dans la cause d'Alfred Martin. L'acte, du reste, est moins complet que celui produit dans l'autre cause. On n'y trouve pas l'\u00e9chelle des prix que les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s devaient payer, lesquels, dans le cas de Xavier Martin et consorts, \u00e9taient calcul\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9tendue de leurs terres. Il appert suffisamment cependant que la part contributive de chaque int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e9tait r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la grandeur de son terrain. Cela devient \u00e9vident quand on consulte la clause de l'acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Aubin & Perron o\u00f9 il est dit que la contribution des cultivateurs variera avec la grandeur de leurs terres. Et c'est du reste ce que reconna\u00eet express\u00e9ment, dans sa d\u00e9position, Alphonse Aubin, g\u00e9rant de l'appelante et membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aubin & Perron. Il \u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame partie \u00e0 l'acte du 25 ao\u00fbt 1912, et il dit que la diff\u00e9rence des prix dans cet acte \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur la grandeur des terres.\nLe 28 ao\u00fbt 1914, Joseph Guay vendit \u00e0 Joseph Fortin, l'intim\u00e9, la terre au sujet de laquelle il avait fait le contrat du 25 ao\u00fbt 1912, avec tous les animaux, voitures et instruments d'agriculture se trouvant sur la terre vendue, sauf certaines r\u00e9serves qui sont sans int\u00e9r\u00eat dans cette cause. Par le m\u00eame acte, Guay a vendu d'autres immeubles au p\u00e8re de l'intim\u00e9, le nomm\u00e9 Mars Fortin, et il y a une stipulation d'usufruit en faveur de Mars Fortin de la terre vendue \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Il appert cependant, \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de l'intim\u00e9, que c'est lui qui se sert de l'eau et c'est de lui que l'appelante en r\u00e9clame le paiement. La stipulation d'usufruit ne para\u00eet donc pas affecter les droits des parties au proc\u00e8s.\nDans l'acte de vente de Guay \u00e0 Fortin il n'y a pas, comme dans l'autre cause, cession expresse des droits r\u00e9sultant du contrat entre les cultivateurs et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aubin & Perron. Alphonse Aubin admet dans sa d\u00e9position que si Joseph Guay \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de sa terre, il ne lui aurait rien r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour le service d'eau. Il dit que la compagnie reste engag\u00e9e envers Joseph Guay, mais sa pr\u00e9tention est que Joseph Fortin ne peut r\u00e9clamer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette stipulation faite par son auteur, Joseph Guay.\nNous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans l'autre cause que l'appelante a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 aux obligations assum\u00e9es par Aubin & Perron \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des cultivateurs. Il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la stipulation faite par Joseph Guay peut \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par son ayant cause \u00e0 titre particulier, l'intim\u00e9, \u00e0 qui ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment c\u00e9d\u00e9.\nIl est clair que Joseph Guay a fait cette stipulation comme propri\u00e9taire de sa terre et au profit de celle-ci, puisque cette terre et les b\u00e2timents y \u00e9rig\u00e9s devaient b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'approvisionnement d'eau dont on ne pouvait se servir ailleurs. La stipulation que l'eau serait fournie \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 le d\u00e9montre, car un engagement perp\u00e9tuel ne peut se concevoir qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce qui dure toujours. Du moment que Joseph Guay vend cette terre, il cesse d'avoir int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l'approvisionnement d'eau, et partant ne peut plus le r\u00e9clamer pour lui-m\u00eame. Ce n'est donc pas un droit exclusivement personnel, ou attach\u00e9 \u00e0 sa personne, que Joseph Guay a acquis de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aubin & Perron. D'autre part, l'acheteur de cette terre, l'intim\u00e9, a la m\u00eame prise d'eau ainsi que les m\u00eames chantepleures qu'avait Joseph Guay; il n'a fait que continuer la jouissance de ce dernier.\nVoil\u00e0 donc une stipulation concernant l'approvisionnement d'eau \u00e0 une terre et aux b\u00e2timents y \u00e9rig\u00e9s faite par un propri\u00e9taire pour l'utilit\u00e9 de son fonds. Il vend ce fonds. L'acqu\u00e9reur peut-il, sans une cession expresse, r\u00e9clamer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette stipulation?\nIl le pourrait sans aucun doute s'il y avait servitude r\u00e9elle. Mais, au sujet du contrat m\u00eame dont il s'agit ici, la cour d'appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas eu cr\u00e9ation d'une servitude r\u00e9elle: La Compagnie d'Aqueduc du Lac St-Jean v. Tremblay[2].\nLes raisons qu'invoque le juge Rivard en rendant le jugement de la cour d'appel sont assur\u00e9ment bien graves, mais il importe peu que le droit au service de l'aqueduc au profit de la terre de Joseph Guay ait ou n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis \u00e0 titre de servitude, s'il est constant que le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la stipulation passe \u00e0 tout acqu\u00e9reur de cette terre m\u00eame sans une cession expresse.\nOn peut envisager le droit au service de l'aqueduc comme un droit accessoire qu'on ne saurait s\u00e9parer de la terre qui en jouit, ou comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une stipulation faite par le propri\u00e9taire de cette terre et dont profiterait, comme son ayant cause, tout acqu\u00e9reur subs\u00e9quent de la terre.\nAu premier point de vue, il suffirait de citer l'article 1499 C.C. aux termes duquel\nl'obligation de d\u00e9livrer la chose comprend ses accessoires et tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 destin\u00e9 \u00e0 son usage perp\u00e9tuel.\nEt si on envisage en elle-m\u00eame une stipulation de ce genre, il semble qu'on peut lui appliquer l'article 1030 C.C. qui dit:\nOn est cens\u00e9 avoir stipul\u00e9 pour soi et pour ses h\u00e9ritiers et repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, \u00e0 moins que le contraire ne soit exprim\u00e9, ou ne r\u00e9sulte de la nature du contrat.\nLa seule diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 noter entre cet article et l'article 1122 du code Napol\u00e9on, c'est que notre code emploie les mots \"repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux\", tandis que le code Napol\u00e9on se sert de l'expression assur\u00e9ment plus fran\u00e7aise, \"ayants cause\". Il est clair cependant que les auteurs du code ne voulaient pas innover. Ils citent l'article 1122 C.N. et le copient textuellement, sauf la substitution de \"repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux\" \u00e0 \"ayants cause\" et de \"contrat\" \u00e0 \"convention\". Dans leur rapport, ils disent qu'il n'y a, dans les quatre articles de la section V, que des changements d'expressions. D'autre part, les mots \"repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux\" sont d'un sens \u00e9quivoque. Ils sont \u00e9videmment d'origine anglaise, et on les trouve surtout au titre Des obligations (voy. les arts. 1028, 1030, 1085, 1113, 1122, 1123, 1127, 1128, 1129 et 1130 C.C.) qu'on peut croire avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 d'abord en anglais, car c'est sous le texte anglais du rapport des r\u00e9dacteurs du code que se trouvent les renvois aux autorit\u00e9s. Quelle port\u00e9e peut avoir une telle expression quand elle est accompagn\u00e9e du mot \"h\u00e9ritiers\"? Dans un sens, on peut se demander s'il y a d'autres \"repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux\" que les h\u00e9ritiers, et \"h\u00e9ritier\" se dit de l'h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gal comme de l'h\u00e9ritier testamentaire (art.597 C.C.). Dans le droit anglais, ce mot est \u00e9galement un peu \u00e9quivoque et s'interpr\u00e8te de diverses fa\u00e7ons (Stroud, Judicial Dictionary, vo. \"Legal representatives\"). Dans le droit civil, on serait bien en peine de le d\u00e9finir, \u00e0 moins de dire qu'il a le sens de \"successeurs\" ou \"ayants cause\". Il para\u00eet \u00e9vident qu'on peut l'interpr\u00e9ter d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s restreinte, selon le contexte de l'article o\u00f9 il se trouve, comme du reste dans le cas des mots \"successeurs\" et \"ayants cause\". C'est ainsi que dans l'article 1028 C.C. il se confond avec \"h\u00e9ritiers\", car il est clair que nul ne peut engager un tiers sans son consentement. Dans l'article 1030 C.C., comme on peut toujours stipuler pour autrui, il faut ou bien entendre les \"repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux\" largement, comme signifiant les ayants cause de toute cat\u00e9gorie, ou bien les confondre avec les h\u00e9ritiers et rendre ainsi l'expression sur\u00e9rogatoire ou inutile. Nous croyons qu'il serait t\u00e9m\u00e9raire de donner \u00e0 l'article 1030 C.C. un autre sens que celui qu'on pr\u00eate \u00e0 l'article 1122 du code fran\u00e7ais. Pothier, comme nous le verrons, \u00e9tait d'avis qu'un ayant cause \u00e0 titre singulier repr\u00e9sente son auteur.\nCette interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 1030 C.C. est d'ailleurs conforme \u00e0 la tradition. Pothier, le guide ordinaire des r\u00e9dacteurs du code civil, surtout au titre Des Obligations, s'exprime clairement \u00e0 ce sujet, Obligations, nos 67 et 68:\n67. Ce que nous stipulons par rapport \u00e0 une chose qui nous appartient, nous le pouvons valablement stipuler, non-seulement pour nous et nos h\u00e9ritiers, mais pour tous nos successeurs \u00e0 titre singulier \u00e0 cette chose, lesquels sont compris sous le terme d'ayants cause, usit\u00e9 dans les contrats; ce n'est point en ce cas stipuler pour un autre. * * * Par exemple, je puis valablement convenir \"que vous ne ferez jamais valoir contre moi, ni contre mes h\u00e9ritiers ou ayants cause, les droits de la substitution qui pourrait \u00eatre un jour ouverte \u00e0 votre profit par rapport \u00e0 un tel h\u00e9ritage\"; et cette convention a effet, m\u00eame par rapport \u00e0 ceux qui acquerraient par la suite de moi cet h\u00e9ritage \u00e0 titre singulier * * *\n68. Dans cette convention et les autres semblables, que nous faisons par rapport aux choses qui nous appartiennent, non-seulement nous pouvons stipuler valablement pour nos ayants cause, mais nous sommes cens\u00e9s l'avoir fait, quoique cela ne soit point exprim\u00e9; soit que la convention soit concue in rem, comme lorsqu'il est dit par une transaction pass\u00e9e entre nous, \"que vous vous engagez \u00e0 ne jamais faire valoir les pr\u00e9tentions que vous pourriez avoir par rapport \u00e0 un tel h\u00e9ritage,\" sans dire contre qui; soit que la convention soit con\u00e7ue in personam, comme lorsqu'il est dit \"que vous vous engagez \u00e0 ne jamais faire valoir contre moi vos pr\u00e9tentions par rapport \u00e0 un tel h\u00e9ritage.\"\nEn l'un et l'autre cas je suis cens\u00e9 avoir stipul\u00e9 pour tous mes successeurs, m\u00eame \u00e0 titre de donation. Pactum conventum cum venditore, si in rem constituatur, secundum Proculi sententiam, et emptori prodest.\u2026 Secundum autem Sabini sententiam, etiamsi in personam conceptum est, et in emptorem valet, qui hoc esse existimat, etsi per donationem successio facta sit; L. 17, 5, ff. de Pact. La raison est qu'en stipulant pour moi, je suis cens\u00e9 stipuler pour tous ceux qui me repr\u00e9sentent: or, non-seulement mes h\u00e9ritiers, mais tous ceux qui me succ\u00e8deront m\u00e9diatement ou imm\u00e9diatement, et \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit, \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritage qui a fait l'objet de la convention, me repr\u00e9sentent par rapport \u00e0 cet h\u00e9ritage (Les italiques sont de l'auteur).\nAu n\u00b0 69, Pothier donne un exemple qui se rapproche un peu de l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe. Il suppose une convention faite avec le seigneur de n'exiger qu'une pistole lorsqu'un fief tomberait en rachat. Cette convention, dit-il, profiterait \u00e0 un acqu\u00e9reur \u00e0 titre singulier.\nCette doctrine est suivie dans le droit moderne. Ainsi Aubry et Rau (5e \u00e9dition), tome 2, p. 97, par. 176, disent:\nLe successeur particulier jouit de tous les droits et actions que son auteur avait acquis dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat direct de la chose corporelle ou incorporelle, \u00e0 laquelle il a succ\u00e9d\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire des droits et actions qui se sont identifi\u00e9s avec cette chose, comme qualit\u00e9s actives, ou qui en sont devenus des accessoires.\nOn peut, du reste, consulter les autorit\u00e9s suivantes: Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, Verbo Contrats et Conventions en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, nos 238 et suiv.; Baudry-Lacantinerie & Barde, Obligations, tome 1er, nos 223, 224, 225 et 226; Demolombe, Contrats, tome 1er, nos 278 et suiv.; Paris, 8 juin 1889, Dalloz, 1899, 2.477, et surtout la note.\nCeux qui s'int\u00e9ressent \u00e0 cette question bien difficile de la transmissibilit\u00e9 aux ayants cause \u00e0 titre singulier du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des stipulations faites par leur auteur, aimeront sans doute \u00e0 lire un article que publie la Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil de 1924, p. 481. Cet article a pour auteur M. Jean Lepargneur et porte le titre: De l'effet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'ayant cause particulier des contrats g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs d'obligations relatifs au bien transmis. A la page 504, l'auteur donne la m\u00eame solution \u00e0 une esp\u00e8ce qui est presque identique \u00e0 celle dont il s'agit en cette cause.\nNous adoptons cette interpr\u00e9tation traditionnelle de l'article 1030 C.C. Nous n'ignorons pas que quelques commentateurs modernes restreignent beaucoup le champ d'application de l'article 1122 C.N. s'ils ne le rendent pas \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s inutile. Nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons nous en tenir \u00e0 la doctrine de Pothier, l'inspirateur de cet article. Il n'y a rien, du reste, dans le contrat dont il s'agit ici qui s'oppose \u00e0 la transmissibilit\u00e9 du droit au service de l'aqueduc; ce droit, par sa nature, est transmissible \u00e0 tout acqu\u00e9reur de la terre et aurait pu \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une servitude r\u00e9elle s'il y avait eu d\u00e9signation d'un fonds dominant et d'un fonds servant (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Chauveau, Biens, n\u00b0 1075, et la note). Nous croyons donc que l'intim\u00e9 peut invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la stipulation faite par son auteur Joseph Guay \u00e0 l'encontre de l'action de l'appelante lui demandant le paiement du montant exigible en vertu de son tarif pour l'approvisionnement d'eau.\nL'approvisionnement d'eau a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 d'avance par Joseph Guay. C'est tout comme si le propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble payait d'avance la totalit\u00e9 d'un imp\u00f4t qui aux termes du r\u00e8glement qui l'impose est payable par versements d'ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e pendant un terme convenu. Il en serait de m\u00eame d'une exemption de taxes accord\u00e9e \u00e0 une usine. Il est clair qu'un acqu\u00e9reur subs\u00e9quent de l'immeuble ou de l'usine (continuant \u00e0 \u00eatre exploit\u00e9e comme usine) b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierait de ce paiement ou de cette exemption.\nC'est tout ce qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider en cette cause. L'action de l'appelante demande paiement en vertu d'un tarif \u00e9tabli pour les abonn\u00e9s de son aqueduc, et l'intim\u00e9 invoque en d\u00e9fense le contrat intervenu entre son auteur et les auteurs de l'appelante. Cette derni\u00e8re n'a pas attaqu\u00e9 le contrat pour la raison qu'il comporterait un engagement perp\u00e9tuel. Nous n'avons donc pas besoin de nous prononcer sur la possibilit\u00e9 de faire un tel contrat; tout ce que nous d\u00e9cidons, c'est que, vu les stipulations de ce contrat, l'action de l'appelante ne peut \u00eatre maintenue.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appelant: T.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSale of goods\u2014Contract price\u2014Increase or decrease\u2014Repudiation\u2014Damages\u2014Price determined or determinable\u2014Art. 1472 C.C.\nThe respondent, a fur manufacturer in Montreal, bought in December, 1919, from the appellant, a manufacturer of silks in New York, ten pieces of brocade silk as specified to be delivered \"as ready.\" The agreement of sale contained the following clauses: \"If at the time of making delivery raw silk has advanced or declined five per cent or more from $12 for Double Extra B. grade, a percentage equal to one-half of this advance or decline shall be added to or deducted from the price. If at the time of making delivery pay-roll and other labour costs have increased or decreased five per cent or more, a percentage equal to one-half of this increase or decrease shall be added to or deducted from the price. This contract ceases to be binding on either party as to goods not shipped by December 31, 1920.\" The appellant proceeded to manufacture goods ordered, shipped them and sent invoices for same, adding to the contract prices a percentage according to the increase at the date of delivery in the costs of raw silk and labour. The respondent declined to accept such increase; but the appellant insisted upon its interpretation of the contract and continued to make more shipments. On the 20th of March, 1920, the respondent sent written notice to the appellant refusing acceptance of the goods and remitting invoices for same. The appellant discontinued producing, but shipped to the respondent the goods in course of being manufactured at that date. On April 15, the respondent returned the goods, which were sold at auction by the appellant on respondent's account, after due notice to him. The appellant then brought action for $3,956.99, being $345.86 for goods retained by respondent, $1,184.85 for difference of price for the returned goods sold at auction and $2,426.28 for damages on the unexecuted part of the contract.\nHeld, Rinfret J. dissenting, that the terms of the contract must be construed as meaning that it is the percentage of advance or decline in the price chargeable for the complete article which is governed by the advance or decline in the price of material or labour costs and not the percentage of the value of the silk used in manufacturing the quantity of the complete fabric.\nHeld also that, although repudiation by a party to a contract of sale entitles de facto the other party to recover damages thus incurred, the vendor has the right to insist on preserving the integrity of the contract and to tender the goods for delivery according to the terms of the sale, in which case his claim for damages will be more easily and readily assessed upon refusal to accept by the buyer.\nHeld further that the appellant had no right to claim damages in respect of loss of profit on the uncompleted part of the contract. Idington J. contra. Rinfret J. dissenting. The contract of sale is not binding upon the parties, as in order to validly stipulate a price based on certain conditions prevailing at the time of delivery the contract must fix the date of such delivery; in other words, a price which can vary at the will of the vendor is not a price \" certain et determine \" (Art. 1472 C.C.) which is an essential element of the contract of sale.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant's action.\nDe Witt K.C. and Harold for the appellant.\nDessaulles K.C. and iSt. Jacques for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault and Newcombe JJ.) was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The radical question in controversy in this appeal concerns the true meaning of two clauses in the agreement between the appellants and the respondent contained in an order signed by the respondent, addressed to the appellants.\nThe appellants manufacture silks in New York. In November, 1919, one of their travellers, Hanford, called on the respondent, who was a fur manufacturer in Montreal, and there received from him an order for silk brocade, according to samples in his possession. Later, a more formal order, containing the stipulations to be considered, was sent by the appellants to the respondent for signature, and was signed by him and returned to the appellants on the 8th of December, 1919. Admittedly the stipulations in question were discussed by the respondent and Hanford, and agreed to by the respondent at the interview in Montreal. These clauses are in the following words:\u2014\nIf at the time of making delivery raw silk has advanced or declined five per cent or more from $12 for Double Extra B grade, a percentage equal to one-half of this advance or decline shall be added to or deducted from the price.\nIf at the time of making delivery pay-roll and other labour costs have increased or decreased five per cent, or more, a percentage equal to one-half of this increase shall be added to or deducted from the price.\nThe appellants proceeded with the manufacture of the goods ordered, and shipments were made on the 7th and 20th of February, 1920, and on the 2nd of March. Invoices covering these shipments were prepared by the appellants, in accordance with their interpretation of the contract, and sent to the respondent; and almost immediately a dispute arose as to the proper method of determining prices under the clauses quoted.\nThe appellants' procedure may be illustrated by reference to the prices charged in the invoice for the shipment of the 7th of February. On that date raw silk of the grade mentioned in the first of the paragraphs given above was selling at $17.30; that is to say, at an increase of forty-four per cent over the datum price of $12 mentioned in that paragraph; and the labour costs had been advanced approximately twenty per cent. The appellants accordingly added to the prices of the goods furnished a percentage in each case of the price nominated in the contract equal to one-half of forty-four per cent plus one-half of twenty per cent of that price. Thus, brocade of which the price specified in the contract was $5, was charged to the respondent at $6.50, and goods quoted at $3.50 were charged at $4.50. This procedure was repeated in compiling the invoices of the 20th of February and on the 2nd of March.\nOn the 5th of March the respondent wrote to the appellants, observing that the invoice prices did not correspond with the contract prices, and requested an explanation, and that shipments be discontinued meantime. The appellants replied on the 8th of March, explaining the procedure sketched above. On the 10th of March the respondent replied in the following letter:\u2014\nMontreal, March 10, 1920.\nMessrs. The Brilliant Silk Mfg. Co.,\n387 Fourth Avenue,\nNew York.\nDear Sirs,\u2014In reply to yours of the 8th, wish to state that at the time our Mr. Kaufman gave his order to your Mr. Hanson, Mr. Kaufman understood that the increase would not exceed 5 per cent, if there should be any increase at all.\nProbably our Mr. Kaufman has misunderstood, but at any rate, you know fully well that we are not in the raw silk business, and therefore do not understand anything in this line, and cannot be bothered to the learning of this now, nor can we be bothered watching the changing market.\nWe shall receive the balance of our order at the prices of our original order given to your Mr. Hanson, and at no other prices.\nWe on our part feel that we are fully justified and more so, in our actions in this matter, and expect that you in turn will act justly; otherwise we shall surely not accept any shipments from you under the circumstances.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) J. Kaufman.\nPer E.R.H.\nP.S.\u2014Kindly note that although the prices increase or decrease, we shall keep to the prices of our original order.\nTo this letter the appellants rejoined, insisting upon observance of the terms of the contract, and stating that four more pieces were being shipped under it. Again, on the 23rd of. March, 1920, the respondent wrote the appellants in these words:\u2014\nIn reply to yours of the 18th, would say that my letter to yourselves has been dictated by myself and the substance of which is exactly as I desired and found correct in this matter.\nUnder the circumstances and for the various reasons already stated in my previous letter, I refuse acceptance of your goods and herewith remit your invoices for same.\nUnless you make such shipments as are correct and in accordance to my previous letter, I will, under no means accept any of your shipments.\nAfter receiving this letter the appellants discontinued producing for the respondent confining themselves to completing the pieces then in process of manufacture. Still further correspondence ensued, and on the 20th of March the respondent wrote, expressing his willingness to accept the shipments already made, on the condition that the residue of the order should be cancelled; and to this the appellants replied, declining to cancel the order except on the terms of being reimbursed for their expenses and loss of profit. Finally, on the 6th of April, 1920, the respondent wrote to the appellants, declaring that the letter of March 23, quoted above, evinced his final decision.\nIn the meantime, the appellants had been proceeding with the completion of goods which had been in process of manufacture when the respondent's letter of March 23 was received, and these goods were shipped and invoiced according to the appellants' interpretation of the contract as explained above. Again there was an exchange of letters, and on April 15 the respondent returned the appellants' invoices for goods shipped on the 2nd of March, the 19th of March, the 7th of April and the 13th of April, and informed them that he had advised the express company to return the shipments. The appellants responded that they would receive the goods from the express company, but would hold them at the risk of the respondent, and on the 25th of May the respondent, whom the appellants had up to this time been urging to accept the shipments, was advised by the appellants that they would proceed to sell the rejected goods on the respondent's account, and hold him responsible for their loss on the unexecuted part of the contract. On the 7th of July, the respondent sent to the appellants a cheque for $982.22, in payment for the goods shipped on the 7th and 20th of February, at prices calculated according to the respondent's construction of the clauses in dispute. This cheque was expressed to be in full payment up to date for all claims.\nOn the 9th of July, the appellants replied, stating that the cheque would be applied in part payment. On the 18th of August, the appellants wrote to the respondent, enclosing a bill for expenses in connection with the rejected goods, stating that they were proceeding to sell them, and that the respondent would be liable for any loss, and for selling expenses, and that as soon as the goods had been sold, a bill would be sent for damages for the respondent's breach of contract in rejecting the tendered goods, and in respect of the uncompleted part of the order. They also asked for a cheque for $348.76, the amount which they stated was still due and unpaid upon the goods shipped on the 7th and 20th of February and accepted by the respondent. On the 30th of August the appellants again wrote to the respondent, making a demand upon him on all these accounts for $2,422.81, with $64.72 interest from the 23rd of March, 1920. Obviously, the dispute between the parties centres on the difference between them as to the proper construction of the contract. The clauses quoted deal with two classes of contingency; the first, an advance or decline in the price of raw silk; and the second an advance or decline in \"payroll and other labour costs\"; and their object is to provide for a variation in the prices nominated in the contract according to a stipulated rule when one of the designated contingencies occur. In the case of raw silk, a datum price of $12 is fixed, and the price of the delivered article is not to be affected unless the decline or fall of the price of that material equals or exceeds five per cent of that sum. When the percentage of advance or decline has passed that point, then to or from the price of the delivered article is to be added or deducted a percentage equal to one-half of this advance or decline.\nThe key to the meaning of this clause, if any key be required, seems to be in the words \"per cent,\" and \"percentage.\" The language of the clause seems rather evidently to contemplate an advance or reduction of the price chargeable as expressed in or defined by a percentage of something. The variation in the price of the finished article is to be a percentage of something which is determined by this; it is to be \"equal to one-half of this advance or decline.\" \"This advance or decline\" manifestly is the contingent advance or decline, already referred to, in the price of raw silk, which is conceived as expressed in or defined by a percentage of that price. It seems reasonably clear that the parties are speaking in percentages. One percentage governs another percentage; the second is one-half of the first. The second is a percentage of something; of what? It also seems reasonably clear that this must be a percentage of the price nominated in the contract. Speaking with the greatest possible respect for other views, it is rather difficult to suppose that a plain business man, unsophisticated by learning or dialectics, would attach any other meaning to the words employed. An analysis of the second clause produces a similar result.\nThis construction of the contract is opposed mainly on the ground that in the result the contract becomes in this view of it extremely unfavourable to the purchaser\u2014to such a degree, indeed, as to lead to the inference that no business man of any prudence would enter into such an arrangement. The respondent puts his argument in this way; the prices quoted in the contract are based upon calculated allowances for cost of materials and labour, overhead charges and profit. Admittedly, the element ascribable to overhead charges and profit is no inconsiderable part of the total, and yet, under the appellants' construction, an increase of the price of material or cost of labour produces in determining the price chargeable a proportional increase in this element.\nIt is not, however, a self-evident proposition that a competent manufacturer would think it unreasonable to augment his profit proportionately with the increase of the cost of material and labour, or even that the allowance in his prices for overhead costs should increase according to the same scale. At all events it seems impossible to affirm that such a procedure as a method of ascertaining prices is so manifestly absurd or unjust as to require the courts to refuse effect to the language of a contract adopting it according to what appears to be the natural and ordinary meaning of its words. But when it is considered that under the contract to be construed the same procedure is also followed in the case of a decline of the cost of material and labour, in which contingency the allowance for profit and overhead charges is proportionately reduced, it becomes apparent that the contention is without cogency.\nThe view taken by the learned trial judge and urged upon us by the respondent's counsel was that the second percentage, although to be added to the prices named in the contract, is a percentage of the value of the silk used in manufacturing the quantity of the completed fabric, in respect of which the contract price is quoted. Thus, in the case of the $5 quality, for example, it appears that 1.93 ounce of raw silk would be consumed in the manufacture of one yard of this material, which has a value, at the rate of $12 per pound, of about $1.50. On the construction adopted by the learned trial judge and the majority of the court below, the sum to be added to the contract price is a percentage of this sum of $1.50, the value according to the datum price of the material made use of.\nIt appears to be sufficient to say that there is not a word in the conditions under discussion about the quantity of raw silk consumed in the manufacture of the unit quantity of brocade; the stipulations deal with prices and the advance and decline of prices expressed in, percentages, and the natural reading of the language seems to be, as already mentioned, that it is the percentage of advance or decline in the price chargeable for the completed article, which is governed by the advance or decline in the price of material.\nIt follows that the respondent's refusal of the goods rejected and his refusal further to perform the contract which, as the correspondence already detailed demonstrates, was deliberate as well as intentional, cannot be justified; and that the appellants are entitled to recover for the goods delivered, as well as for non-acceptance of the goods tendered by them; and also damages, if they have suffered any, by reason of this wrongful repudiation.\nAdmittedly, renunciation by a party to a contract, by the law of Quebec, entitles the other party to recover damages equivalent to the loss he has sustained by reason of the failure of the repudiating party to fulfil his obligation. New England Paper Co. v. Berthiaume[1]; Morgan-Smith v. The Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[2]; Langlois v. Ennis[3]. It must be obvious, however, that upon a repudiation by a buyer of his contract to purchase and take delivery of goods in instalments, it is competent to the seller to insist on preserving the integrity of the contract and to tender the goods for delivery according to the terms of sale, in which case, if the buyer refuse to accept, his claim for damages may be more easily and readily assessed. The present appellants, when notified by the respondent, on the 23rd of March, of his repudiation of his obligation under the contract, did not at once treat that repudiation as bringing the contract to an end. They proceeded, as already mentioned, to complete the manufacture of pieces then in process of manufacture, and subsequently tendered them for acceptance to the respondent, and it was only by their letter of the 25th of May that the appellants brought to a termination their attempt to induce the respondent to withdraw from the position he had assumed and accept the goods; and for the purposes of this appeal it is on that date, or thereabouts, that the respondent's repudiation must be deemed to have taken effect. The appellants are, no doubt, entitled to recover such damages as they have shown to have arisen from the wrongful determination of the contract by the respondent as at that date. But what are these damages? Owing to the special terms of the contract, it might, in the event, have proved to be a profitable or an unprofitable arrangement, according (inter alia) to the fluctuations of the silk market and the labour market. It is conceivable that evidence might have been produced showing the probable dates at which the unfinished portions of the order would have been delivered which, with the actual records of the prices of silk and the costs of labour during the relevant period, might have enabled a judicial tribunal to arrive at some fair estimate of the appellants' probable loss. But such evidence has not been given. The appellants have based their case upon the theory that they are entitled to recover the amount of their loss, ascertained on the footing of the assumed execution of the unexecuted part of the order on the 23rd of March, which has been taken to be the date upon which the repudiation took effect. Apart from the difficulty arising from the fact already mentioned, that it was not until the 25th of May that the appellants decisively acted upon the letter of the 23rd of March, it is impossible, from the facts in this record, to affirm that damages calculated upon that footing would in fact correspond to the actual loss the appellants have suffered. Indeed, such a conclusion would be nothing better than surmise.\nOn the record before us, therefore, it is impossible to award damages in respect of loss of profit on the unexecuted part of the contract; and it has been necessary to consider whether an opportunity should be given to the appellants on proper terms to supply the deficiencies in the evidence through a further investigation of the facts. In view of all the circumstances and the course of the litigation, it appears, however, that this is an indulgence which could not with propriety be granted at this stage. The action was begun in December, 1920. The events giving rise to it occurred in the spring of that year. The facts to be considered under this head of the appellants' claim must, in no small degree, be facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the appellants. There was a protracted trial, at which the appellants had the fullest opportunity to present their case in the manner which they conceived to be most favourable to themselves, and all the evidence available in support of it. They deliberately elected to rest their claim upon the erroneous theory that they were entitled to be reimbursed as if delivery of the whole order had been completed on the 23rd of March. Probably this course was taken with full realization of the risks involved; and we can hardly assume that at the date of the trial the appellants were not in possession of the facts which would enable them to judge whether it would be worth while to shape their evidence in conformity with another and juster theory as to their legal rights.\nMoreover, regard must be had to the point of view of the respondent. In any such investigation he would manifestly be at an appreciable disadvantage, in view of the facts that the decisive evidence must be very largely in the possession of the appellants, and that the facts to be investigated occurred over four years ago.\nAs to the residue of the appellants' claim, it appears to be well founded. The only element upon which a serious question could arise is that based upon the appellants' right to increase the contract price by reference to the advance of labour costs. As to this, Mr. Frick, the assistant, general manager of the appellants, explained in a general way the method pursued in arriving at the rate of advance; and while it is true that the explanation might have been more precise, it seems clear enough that the real reason why the witness was not more explicit, and the explanation not more complete, is to be found in the lack of desire to pursue the subject au fond on part of the cross-examining counsel, who directed his interrogatories almost exclusively to the object of bringing out the ratio (among the elements constituting the contract price) between the constituents intended to provide for overhead costs and of labour; an investigation which counsel was pursuing with the object of buttressing his argument on the construction of the contract, and by no means unwisely.\nThe cardinal elements of the calculations of the witness were produced in tabulated form; the payrolls were in the possession of the appellants in court, and the fullest opportunity was given for the examination of them by the respondent.\nThere are two remaining questions which require a brief reference. The first concerns the question of exchange. Since the sums to which the appellants were entitled as prices for goods delivered under the contract or tendered for delivery were payable in New York, they were payable at the figure named in New York funds; and damages should therefore be calculated according to the rate of exchange ruling on the respective dates when such sums would have been paid in New York if the terms of the contract had been observed. In re British American Continental Bank Ltd.[4].\nThe other point concerns the contention advanced and accepted by the learned trial judge, that the cheque of the 7th of July, 1920, having been expressed to be in full payment to date for all claims,\nand having been accepted and cashed in that form, the appellants are concluded from asserting a claim for any larger sum in respect of the deliveries of the 7th and 20th of February.\nThe appellants made it quite clear by their letter, written on the receipt of the cheque, on the 9th of July, that they declined to accept the condition, and that letter appears to leave no room for doubt that this contention cannot prevail.\nThe rule laid down in Day v. McLea[5], has been adopted and given effect to in the Province of Quebec, first in a decision of La Compagnie Paquet v. Paquin[6], and more recently in Royal Trust v. White[7], when such a condition is indorsed upon or inserted in the body of the cheque, it is a question of fact in each case whether the creditor has, by words or by conduct, agreed to that condition.\nIt is assumed that the parties will be able to agree upon the sums due in respect of exchange, as well as the amount payable for interest under the express terms of the contract. In addition to these two items, the appellants are entitled to judgment for the sum claimed in respect of goods delivered and tendered for delivery, $1,184.85. They are entitled to four-fifths of the costs of the action and of both appeals.\nShould the parties be unable to agree as to the sums due in respect of exchange and interest, the points of disagreement may be mentioned.\nIdington J,\u2014The appellant is a corporation manufacturing silks in New York city. The respondent is a fur manufacturer in the city of Montreal.\nThe appellant's agent solicited from the respondent an order for silk brocade to be manufactured by appellant, and got same which he forwarded to appellant; and the latter drew up, in its printed form, one of its usual forms of contract at the time, and specified therein and thereby the contract conformable with said order, which was dated 28th November, 1920, and executed by both parties hereto.\nThe contract provided for the purchase by respondent from appellant of ten pieces of brocade silk, each piece to be sixty yards in length and thirty-six inches in width, and each to be of a different colour and a variation in prices, as specified, and to be delivered when manufactured but not later than the 31st. December, 1921.\nThree of the kinds specified were sold at the price of $5 a yard; two of the kinds specified were sold at $4.50 a yard; two of the kinds specified were sold at $4 a yard, and three others of the kinds specified were sold at $3.50 a yard.\nThere was set forth in the said contract the following provision for increase or reduction of the prices named:\u2014\nIf at the time of making delivery pay-roll and other labour costs have five per cent, or more from $12 for Double Extra B. grade, a percentage equal to one-half of this advance or decline shall be added to or deducted from the price.\nIf at the time of making delivery pay-roll and other labout costs have increased or decreased five per cent or more, a percentage equal to one-half of this increase or decrease shall be added to or deducted from the price.\nThere seems to have ensued much pretence on the part of the respondent of his having misunderstood these two paragraphs, which seem to me very clear and plain. I submit, with great respect for the learned trial judge and a majority of the Court of King's Bench, that they got possessed of a rather confusing conception of what is expressed thereby.\nMr. Justice Tellier, who wrote a dissenting opinion in the appellate court, seems to me to have correctly appreciated the true intent and meaning of said provisions for varying the prices named.\nMr. Justice Flynn also dissented but did not write. As he dissented I assume he probably had taken the same view as Mr. Justice Tellier.\nAt the time when said contract was entered into the prices of many kinds of goods and labour were liable to sudden changes in the market.\nThe market price of raw silk was evidently assumed to be $12 for double extra B grade at the time of making the contract.\nAnd the pay-roll and other labour cost was liable to change up or down between the date of signing the contract and the date of delivery.\nIf these variations did not exceed five per cent no change was to be made in the price, but if they were such as to exceed in either direction five per cent, then the price of the goods so sold must vary accordingly to the extent of a percentage of half the increase or decrease. Surely nothing could be fairer if carried out honestly.\nThere were two deliveries in February, 1920, and one on the 2nd of March, 1920, before the invoices therefor, made on the basis of such variation, were objected to.\nOn the 5th of March, 1920, the respondent wrote the appellant manufacturers in New York that the prices quoted in the invoice, covering said shipments, did not correspond with the prices of the contract; and asking them to stop further shipments until explanation made for such change.\nTo that appellant wrote as follows:\u2014\nNew York, March 8, 1920.\nMr. J. Kaufman,\n944 St. Lawrence Boulevard,\nMontreal, Canada.\nDear sir,\u2014Answering your letter of March 5, 1920, the price of raw silk on February 7, 1920, was $16.80, an advance of 40 per cent and labour costs had advanced 20 per cent which under the terms of the contract would average 30 per cent over the basic price of $5 which would make no. 3396 $6.50 and no. 3384 basic price $3.50, $4.55 as charged. On February 20, 1920, raw silk was $16.25 and the average increase was 28 per cent, making the $3.50 goods at $4.48; we charged same at $4.47\u00bd.\nWe trust this explanation is entirely satisfactory and we are making shipment to-day of goods just received from the mill, on the basis of $15 for raw silk.\nYours very truly,\nThe Brilliant Silk Mfg. Co. Inc.,\nPel J. B. Whitney,\nManager.\nThe respondent's letter in reply thereto was as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, March 10, 1920.\nMessrs. The Brilliant Silk Mfg. Co.,\n387 Fourth Avenue,\nNew York.\nDear sirs,\u2014In reply to yours of the 8th, we wish to state that at the time our Mr. Kaufman gave his order to your Mr. Hanson, Mr. Kaufman understood that the increase would not exceed 5 per cent, if there should be any increase at all.\nProbably our Mr. Kaufman has misunderstood, but at any rate, you know fully well that we are not in the raw silk business, and therefore do not understand anything in this line, and cannot be bothered to the learning of this now, nor can we be bothered watching the changing market.\nWe shall receive the balance of our order at the prices of our original order given to your Mr. Hanson, and at no other prices.\nWe on our part feel that we are fully justified and more so, in our actions in this matter, and expect that you in turn will act justly; otherwise we shall surely not accept any shipments from you under the circumstances.\nYours very truly,\nJ. Kaufman,\nper E. R. H.\nP.S.\u2014Kindly note that although the prices increase or decrease, we shall keep to the prices of our original order prices.\nThis clearly indicates an intention on the part of respondent to repudiate his contract. But as a matter of prudence and to make that repudiation clear beyond doubt, the appellant wrote to him, on the 18th of March, 1920, insisting that the contract must govern, and concluded by saying that four more pieces of the goods as ordered were being shipped according to the contract.\nThis shipment was made accordingly and an invoice sent therefor based on the terms of the contract according to the appellant's contention of its clear meaning, and showing, by the percentages given therein, the way in which the net amount was arrived at.\nOn the 23rd of March, 1920, the respondent replied to appellant as follows:\u2014 'Messrs. The Brilliant Silk Mfg. Co.,\n387 Fourth Avenue,\nNew York.\nDear sirs,\u2014In reply to yours of the 18th, would say that my letter to yourselves had been dictated by myself and the substance of which is exactly as I desired and found correct in this matter.\nUnder the circumstances and for the various reasons already stated in my previous letter, I refuse acceptance of your goods and herewith remit your invoices for same.\nUnless you make such shipments as are correct and in accordance to my previous letter, I will, under no means accept any of your shipments.\nYours truly,\nJ. Kaufman.\nHe returned the invoices therewith and, as soon as received, returned the goods to appellant, and, thereby, I submit, there is clear evidence of repudiation of the contract and such an anticipatory breach of the same as to entitle appellant to bring this action and to recover the damages as claimed herein.\nThe appellant replied and insisted upon the respondent carrying out his contract.\nA number of letters passed between the parties after this, for the appellant seemed to have imagined that it could persuade the respondent of the folly he was committing in taking the stand he had done.\nThe respondent simply defied the appellant and no useful purpose is to be served by repeating the later correspondence here.\nThe goods so returned were sold at auction, after due notice to respondent, and for all the losses incidental thereto, and the necessary expenses, the respondent is, in my opinion, liable.\nThese and all other items for damages for breach of the contract based on the situation thus created as of the date of 23rd of March, 1920, as claimed and I think, proven herein, the appellant is entitled to, as well as the balance due for the goods retained by the respondent on the prices determined by the terms of the contract as claimed and proven by the appellant, and that including the item of exchange on the draft sent in Canadian currency by the respondent.\nClearly as the payment had to be made in New York and the rate of exchange was at the time of payment against Canada, the respondent as to that item should make it good. The damages should bear interest from the said date of the breach; but, as I understand, there is practically no difference now in the rate of exchange between here and New York; that item must not enter further into the estimate of damages.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment entered for the amount of $3,956.99, and interest thereon from said breach of contract on March 23, 1920. I cannot see my way to allowing the 10 per cent claimed thereon. Indeed I may, for want of direct evidence on the point, err in allowing the items of difference in exchange on drafts before breach of contract, but there is slight incidental evidence relative to a notorious condition of things well known, that stands on a different footing from that which the learned trial judge ruled out.\nI was, at the argument, inclined to think that inasmuch as the price of silk, and possibly of labour, was for the balance of the year 1920, in a falling condition, the application of the rule of law requiring damages to be assessed as of the date of the breach might possibly be modified, but, on reflection, I am quite clear that there is no room for such modification in this case, if ever in any.\nThe market price differences between the date of the contract and the respective deliveries of goods, only provide for appellant's protection to the extent of one-half the rises beyond the prices stated in the contract, and we have heard nothing to shew that the fall was such as to reduce same below the prices fixed by the contract.\nIf there is any serious doubt as to proof of the percentage of rise in either prices of silk, or labour relative to the manufacture of the goods in question, I am inclined to hear and consider any argument tending to entitle the reconsideration thereof. I should be inclined, if on hearing it any serious doubt raised as to the correctness of the result, to give the opportunity of a reference as to such facts as determine the result on the basis of the construction I have put on the contract, but, of course, only at the risk of respondent, in any event, paying the costs of such reference.\nAt present the course pursued by respondent seems to me not to entitle him thereto, but he and his counsel seem to me to have been so obsessed with their own construction of the contract that possibly they paid no proper attention to learning the facts as to the market price of either silk or labour, at the respective dates in question.\nRinfret J. (dissenting).\u2014Appellant's traveller, Mr. Walter M. Hanford, came to Montreal and, on the 26th November, 1919, took from the respondent an order for thirty-four pieces of silk brocade of different colours and patterns at prices varying from $3.50 to $5 per yard, delivery to be made as follows; a few pieces as early as possible; balance as ready; no goods after December 31, 1920.\nHanford sent to the appellant, whose head office is in New York, a memorandum of the order. With this memorandum, the appellant prepared a contract in printed form and addressed it to the respondent in Montreal requesting him to sign a slip in confirmation of the contract, then tear it off and mail it to the appellant. This was done by the respondent in Montreal.\nIt follows that the contract between the parties was completed in Montreal and must be governed by the law of the province of Quebec.\nThis contract contained the following stipulation as to price:\u2014\nIf, at the time of making delivery, raw silk has advanced or declined 5 per cent or more from $12 for double extra B grade, a percentage equal to one-half of this advance or decline shall be added to or deducted from the price.\nIf, at the time of making delivery, pay-roll and other labour costs have increased or decreased 5 per cent or more, a percentage equal to one-half of this increase or decrease shall be added to or deducted from the price.\nAs soon as the appellant began to forward the first pieces of silk which were ready and invoiced them according to its method of calculation, the respondent at once complained that the prices asked by the appellant were not in conformity with the contract. In the correspondence which ensued it became apparent that the parties were not at one mind on the construction to be put upon the clauses quoted; and, as they found themselves unable to agree, by its letter of the 25th of May, 1920, the appellant abandoned its attempts at compelling the respondent to accept the goods at the prices invoiced and brought the contract to its termination, subject to the right of claiming all amounts due on the goods already manufactured and shipped and also of sending a bill for its expenses and loss of the profit on the unfinished portion of the order.\nBy that time, two shipments, respectively on the 7th and 20th of February, 1920, had been received by respondent, although accepted by him at prices calculated in accordance with his interpretation of the contract. For these, on the latter basis, the respondent sent to the appellant, on the 7th July, a cheque drawn for $982.22, but marked \"with New York funds\" (and accordingly representing an amount of $1,116.65 in Canadian money), which the appellant accepted on account.\nFour other shipments had been made by the appellant on the 2nd and 19th of March, the 7th and 13th of April, but refused by the respondent, because the appellant persisted in asking for them prices which, in respondent's view, were not called for by the contract. Whereupon, the appellant had notified the express company to return the goods and had advised the respondent that, when this was done, it would take them at respondent's risk and proceed to sell them for respondent's account.\nThe goods thus returned were later sold at auction at prices inferior to those asked by the appellant from the respondent, and, in this action, the former now claims the difference, with certain express charges in addition.\nThe balance alleged to be due on the goods shipped on the 7th and 20th of February which were received and kept by the respondent, the difference between the proceeds of the auction sale and the price claimed for the pieces of silk shipped on the four dates already mentioned in March and April, and the damages on the uncompleted part of the contract make up the sum of $3,956.99, for which the appellant sues the respondent, with interest from March 23rd, 1920, and a further sum to represent the rate of exchange between Montreal and New York funds.\nThe litigation centres on the two clauses already recited.\nIt should first be noted that, under these clauses, the price of each piece of silk is left to be determined by \"the time of making delivery,\" since it is according to the market value of raw silk and the cost of labour on that date alone that the \"percentage\" which forms the element of variation is to be established. The actual cost of raw silk or of labour to the appellant is immaterial; and, notwithstanding the fact that a yard of silk brocade goes through several and different processes such as winding, quilling, warping, twisting, weaving, picking, cleaning, throwing and dyeing, which must necessarily take place at different dates (when labour might well have gone up or down), it does not matter, under this ingenious contract, what the price of such labour was on the particular date when it was actually done; but it is the rate prevailing on the day of delivery which is to govern.\nNow there is nothing in the contract to fix the date of delivery. It is left at the will of the appellant. And it is rather apparent, by the record, that the price might be affected appreciably by the withholding of delivery for even one day. The price itself therefore is not fixed by the contract but is left in the hands of the vendor. To quote the trial judge:\u2014\nThe price of raw silk varies from date to date, and * * * it would enable plaintiff to choose a date of delivery when raw silk was at its highest price independently of what it might have actually cost,\nI do not think that such a contract is legal or binding under the law of Quebec\u2014and I say that quite independently of any element of fraud.\nUnder this law (Art. 1472 C.C.) it is essential to the existence of a contract of sale that the price should be either determined or determinable; but it must be determinable according to fixed conditions and may not be allowed to vary at the will or the caprice of the vendor.\nLe prix (says Pothier ed. Bugnet, vol. 3, no. 23), qui est de l'essence d'un contrat de vente, doit \u00eatre un prix certain et d\u00e9termin\u00e9. Il n'est pas n\u00e9anmoins n\u00e9cessaire qu'il soit absolument d\u00e9termin\u00e9: il suffit qu'il soit tel qu'il doive le devenir et qu'il ne soit pas laiss\u00e9 au pouvoir seul de l'une des parties.\nThe same principle is expounded in Carpentier & du Saint, R\u00e9pertoire du Droit Fran\u00e7ais, vo. Vente, no. 664:\u2014\nAux termes de l'art. 1591, \"le prix de la vente doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par les parties.\" Pour d\u00e9terminer le prix, les parties peuvent adopter le mode qu'elles jugent convenable; mais il faut que ce mode les lie l'une \u00e0 l'autre, car il n'y a pas de vente tant que la fixation du prix d\u00e9pend de la volont\u00e9 de l'une d'elles.\nHe refers to D. 1889, 2.62: Baudry-Lacantinerie & L. Saignat, no. 132; Planiol, t. 2, no. 1376.\nIn the case of Ville de Biarritz v. Broquedis[8], it was held:\u2014 Un contrat de vente est nul lorsque les parties ne sont pas d'accord sur le prix et que la fixation de ce prix est laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l'arbitraire de l'une des parties contractantes.\nA quotation from Planiol (loc. cit.) is unnecessary as it adds nothing to the proposition of Carpentier & du Saint; but the reference to Baudry-Lacantinerie is important:\u2014\n132. * * * Les parties peuvent d'ailleurs adopter tel mode de d\u00e9termination du prix qu'elles jugent convenable, pourvu qu'elles soient li\u00e9es l'une et l'autre par le mode de d\u00e9termination qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu : car il n'y a pas de vente tant que la fixation du prix d\u00e9pend encore de la volont\u00e9 de l'une des parties.\nAinsi, au lieu de d\u00e9terminer le prix en fixant le chiffre m\u00eame les parties peuvent le d\u00e9signer en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 un fait qui ne d\u00e9pende de la volont\u00e9 ni de l'une ni de l'autre pourvu que ce fait en procure la d\u00e9termination pr\u00e9cise: on pourra, par exemple, vendre un immeuble pour le prix pour lequel le vendeur l'a lui-m\u00eame achet\u00e9; s'il s'agit de choses ayant un cours, on peut les vendre au cours du jour de la vente ou de tel autre jour indiqu\u00e9. (Aubry & Rau IV, paragraphe 349, p. 388; Guillouard, Vente et \u00e9change. I.N.109: Huc, Comm. du Code civil, X, n. 36).\nHuc. (vol. X, n. 36) says:\u2014\nDonc il n'y a pas vente quand la fixation du prix est au pouvoir du vendeur seul ou de l'acheteur, car dans ce cas il n'y a pas encore consentement ni lien de droit. Mais le prix est d\u00e9termin\u00e9, quoique le montant ne soit pas encore connu des parties au moment du contrat, s'il n'est plus au pouvoir de l'une d'elles de l'augmenter ou de le diminuer.\nAnd Laurent, (3e \u00e9d., vol. 24, no. 73) :\u2014\nL'article 1591 veut que le prix soit d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par les parties. Cela veut dire que le consentement des deux parties doit porter sur le prix, comme sur la chose qui est l'objet de la vente. C'est un principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire qu'il n'y a point de prix si le vendeur s'en rapporte \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion de l'acheteur ou si l'acheteur d\u00e9clare qu'il paiera ce que le vendeur voudra; ce n'est pas l\u00e0 un concours de volont\u00e9, c'est la volont\u00e9 d'une seule des parties; il en r\u00e9sulte qu'il n'y a pas de consentement sur le prix.\nHe had already said at No. 72:\u2014\nMais si le prix est ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 et incertain, quand m\u00eame il ne le serait que dans l'un de ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments, on doit dire qu'il n'y a pas de prix, et partant il n'y a pas de vente.\nIt follows from this doctrine that the parties herein could validly stipulate a price based on certain conditions prevailing \"at the time of making delivery\" only if such time had not been left, as here, at the choice of the vendor. The appellant, in the present case, must make delivery \"as ready,\" but is not obliged, nor can he be compelled to be ready at any time before the 31st December, 1920.\nQuoting again from Pothier\u2014Bugnet Vol. 3) :\u2014\n16. La seconde chose requise pour former un contrat de vente, est qu'il y ait un prix convenu entre les parties: sine preto nulla venditio est. * * * 17. Le prix n\u00e9cessaire pour former un contrat de vente doit avoir trois qualit\u00e9s: 1. Il doit \u00eatre un prix s\u00e9rieux; 2. certain et d\u00e9termin\u00e9, ou du moins qui doive se d\u00e9terminer; 3. il doit consister en une somme d'argent.\nIn my humble opinion, a price which can vary at the will of the vendor, as in this case, is not that price \"certain et d\u00e9termin\u00e9,\" which is an essential element of the contract of sale. The consequence is that, lacking such essential element, the contract here nulla venditio est.\nFor that reason alone, the appellant had no standing before our courts on the agreement which he tried to have enforced. His only right was for the payment, on the basis of quantum meruit, of the goods received and kept by respondent. The action was not taken on that basis; but, the plea having alleged the bad quality of the goods, the parties had opportunity of submitting their evidence in that respect sufficiently to obviate the necessity of reopening the enqu\u00eate or of reserving the right of the appellant to recover, for the value of the goods actually delivered, any amount in excess of what has already been paid.\nThere is however, in my view of the case, yet another difficulty standing in the way of the appellant.\nIt is a rule derived from Pothier that:\u2014\nOn doit dans les conventions, rechercher quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la commune intention des parties contractantes, plut\u00f4t que de s'arr\u00eater au sens litt\u00e9ral des termes,\nwhich has been embodied in Art. 1013 of the Civil Code thus:\u2014\n1013. When the meaning of the parties in a contract is doubtful, their common intention must be determined by interpretation rather than by an adherence to the literal meaning of the words of the contract.\nWith due respect, I am inclined to the opinion that there never existed between the parties a \"commune intention\" as to the method by which the price was to be determined. This is not a case of error; but one where the minds of the contracting parties have failed to meet, the consequence being that there was no completed contract.\nThe trial judge has submitted the problem in this way:\u2014\nThe plaintiff's contention is that the percentage of increase in raw silk and labour must be added together, divided by two, and then applied to the price of the finished product.\nIt seems to us that the fair and reasonable interpretation of this clause is that half of the percentage of increase in the price of raw silk should be applied to the quantity of raw silk going into a yard of manufactured silk, and one-half the percentage in the increase of labour should be applied to the actual amount of labour, exclusive of profit and overhead expenses, required to make up a yard of finished product. The contrary view is expressed by Mr. Justice Tellier, in his dissenting judgment in the Court of King's Bench, thus:\u2014\nApr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance du dossier, \u00e9tudi\u00e9 soigneusement la clause dont il s'agit, et m\u00eame conf\u00e9r\u00e9 ou discut\u00e9 avec quelques-uns de mes coll\u00e8gues du Banc, il m'est impossible de trouver que la dite clause a le sens que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure lui a donn\u00e9. Je suis d'avis, au contraire, que c'est la demanderesse qui a raison. Du moment que la hausse de la soie brute s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 44 pour cent, \u00e0 la date de la livraison, la demanderesse avait le droit d'ajouter au prix de $5 fix\u00e9 dans le contrat un percentage \u00e9gal \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de cette hausse, c'est-\u00e0-dire un percentage de 22 pour cent. Il lui \u00e9tait \u00e9galement loisible d'ajouter au dit prix de $5 un autre percentage \u00e9gal \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de la hausse du co\u00fbt de la main-d'oeuvre. Or, c'est l\u00e0 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qu'elle a fait. Le d\u00e9fendeur a donc eu tort de s'opposer \u00e0 l'augmentation et de faire obstacle \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution pleine et enti\u00e8re du contrat.\nNow, the latter scale of advance of the price cannot, I submit, have been within the contemplation of the buyer\u2014(I am assuming that the vendor knew what he was at, when he drafted the clause)\u2014and, when such effect as suggested by Mr. Justice Tellier does not necessarily follow from the language used, I am constrained to the view that there is lacking in the present case the \"commune intention\" without which it is impossible to find that \"les deux volont\u00e9s se sont rencontr\u00e9es\" and which is essential to the formation of the contract.\nLe consentement (says Laurent vol. 24-no. 6, at p. 11), doit intervenir sur le prix. Si l'un entend vendre pour une somme plus grande que celle pour laquelle l'autre consent d'acheter, il n'y a pas de contrat de vente, faute de consentement; c'est un contrat inexistant, c'est le n\u00e9ant. Pothier, vol. 3, no. 36.\nSir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux, Chief Justice of the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, in Martineau v. Plante[9], quotes the above passage from Laurent and adds (p. 105):\nLe prix est donc une condition de l'existence de la vente. Or, si le consentement des parties fait d\u00e9faut sur un prix d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par les parties, ou s'il n'y a pas de concours de consentement sur le prix, il n'y a pas de vente. Les deux parties n'ont pas concouru dans le prix: l'un a cru vendre pour un prix \u00e9lev\u00e9 et l'acheteur a cru acheter pour un prix moindre. Les parties ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 en d\u00e9saccord sur le prix et ce d\u00e9saccord emp\u00eache la vente.\nThe result herein is aptly expressed in the following passage of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench:\u2014\nTout d'abord, le prix de vente * * * \u00e9tant ind\u00e9termin\u00e9, comme les parties ne pourraient s'entendre sur le mode de proc\u00e9der pour faire cette d\u00e9termination, il s'en est suivi qu'il n'y a pas d'accord de volont\u00e9 sur un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du contrat, \u00e0 savoir: le prix; et que, sans prix, il n'y a pas de vente, et, par cons\u00e9quent, pas de contrat entre les parties dont l'ex\u00e9cution pouvait \u00eatre exig\u00e9e; et, par cons\u00e9quent, pas d'action.\nSee Belaud v. The Quebec Southern Railway Company[10], where Mr. Justice Lamothe, afterwards Chief ; Justice of the province of Quebec, says:\u2014\nQuand un doute raisonnable existe sur la question de l'existence du consentement de l'une des parties, une cour de justice doit d\u00e9cider que ce consentement n'existe pas et ne peut \u00eatre mis \u00e0 effet.\nHowever, magis ut valeant quam ut pereant. Assuming therefore that the contract was valid and binding, and following the guidance of Sir Montague Smith in McConnel v. Murphy[11], \"in questions of difficult interpretation,\" I would, with the greatest respect, think that the \"true construction\" is that of the trial judge, with whom the majority of the Court of King's Bench concurred.\nSuch construction, in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duclos, is thus stated:\u2014\nIn our opinion, this clause means that the percentage of increase in raw silk should be applied to the value of the raw silk used in one yard; and the percentage in actual labour, exclusive of profits and overhead expenses, should be applied to the actual cost of such labour, and one-half of this percentage of increase should be added to the price.\nThe disputed clause has not acquired any recognized meaning in the province of Quebec, nor even in Montreal; and the proper construction to be placed upon it cannot be gathered from usage under the rule laid down in article 1016 of the Civil Code.\nEven in the United States, it is not a standard clause. Mr. W. R. Frick, the assistant general manager of the appellant in New York, tells us:\u2014\nI don't know that anybody else has it.\nSuch a clause is not known in the silk trade, for Mr. Reynolds, general manager of the Belding-Corticelli Ltd., large silk manufacturers of Montreal, testifies:\u2014\nWell, it is very hard to tell just what the meaning of that contract is. It gives two specific items and says that in case of either of those items changing there would be a change in the price. Now it says \"if at the time of making delivery raw silk has advanced or declined 5 per cent for double extra B grade the quantity equal to one-half of this shall be added to the price.\" It is very hard to state what was in the minds of the men who drew up this contract, whether they were adding that percentage to the total cost of the goods, or whether they were adding it only to the raw silk, which is the item that is specified in the paragraph. Then, on the other hand, the second paragraph says that \"if the payroll and other labour costs have increased or decreased 5 per cent a percentage equal to one-half of this increase or decrease shall be added to or deducted from the price.\" Now, I don't know whether they meant they are going to add or decrease this total price of the goods, or whether they are speaking only of adding this item to the labour cost. They mention labour cost and they mention the raw silk.\nNow, if the interpretation of the minority of the Court of King's Bench be adopted, \"by reason of this stipulation,\" as indicated by the trial judge, the plaintiff could add 30 per cent to its profits and to all its overhead expenses, merely because the value of raw silk and the labour costs have advanced from the basic price stated or assumed in the contract.\nThis is put very clearly and forcibly by Mr. Hope, an accountant called by respondent:\u2014\nThe invoices which were sent by the plaintiffs to Kaufman do not show any basis for the increased prices so that Kaufman would not be able to estimate what he ought to pay on those invoices, and I find that subsequently in the claim for damages filed by the plaintiff that there are two very manifest errors in figuring.\nIn the first place, he takes, according to the evidence of Mr. Frick that I saw there, he says he takes the increase of silk at 44 per cent and the increase of labour at 17 per cent, he adds the two together and divides them by two, and increases the basic selling price of say $5 by that one half, which is 30 per cent. That is manifestly wrong.\nJust to give you an illustration of how that would work out, taking Exhibit P.-29, items 1, 2, 3, and 4, showing the saving of labour and silk costs. Add those items together. You will find that the total silk is $1,838.56 and the total labour cost $993.70: in other words, the silk is twice too much if you divide your percentage into two. You are manifestly overcharging the defendant on your increased prices. I have no intention of interpreting the contract, but since a $5 quality is given as the base price and you put on this extra 30 per cent, if you get away from the condition of extra silk and extra labour on that $5, you are also paying that extra per cent on the overhead and profit that might be in the basic price.\nIt is not meant to pretend that the latter proposition is unreasonable; but it does not seem to be the intention which the reading of the clause in question naturally conveys.\nMany a contract, even calling for deliveries spread, throughout one year, stipulates a fixed price, calculated, by the parties on conditions as they exist at the date of the contract. If such conditions change, in course of performance, one or the other of the contracting parties stands to lose or to gain thereby. It is only natural that the appellant and the respondent herein should have been willing to share in the risk attending such a contingency; but it would seem that the usual way of providing against it was to stipulate for an increase or decrease in that portion of the price representing the elements of cost which were likely to vary. The two most important of those elements of cost\u2014if not the only ones\u2014were raw silk and labour. Both parties wished to be protected; and, for that reason, they agreed to a variation of the price based on half the increase or decrease of the value of raw silk or labour as it existed on the date of the contract. But there was no apparent reason why the overhead expenses and the profits should be greater or smaller in proportion to the increase or decrease in value of the raw materials and, it would not appear to be what the parties intended to contract for.\nOf course, the stipulation is expressed in percentages. But, as the trial judge says:\nThere is a wide difference between adding the percentage to this price, and applying the percentage to the said price;\nand, at all events, the percentage must always be converted into a sum and that sum be afterwards added to the price.\nTherefore, whether you apply the percentage only to the basic cost of raw silk and labour or whether you apply it to the price of the finished article, you add none the less to the price, in each case, a sum resulting from the calculation of a percentage. You add it to the price stipulated in the contract and the language of the clause is satisfied.\nSo that, for the purpose of confirming the judgment a quo, it is not necessary that one construction only should be possible. It is sufficient that the clause should be at least equally susceptible of the construction placed upon it by the trial judge and the majority of the Court of King's Bench, bearing in mind always that the rule of article 1013 of the Civil Code is that the \"commune intention\" of the contracting parties should be arrived at by interpretation rather than by the literal meaning of the words used. And, most respectfully, it would seem that such interpretation leads to the conclusion that it is a sum produced by applying the percentage to the amount included for raw silk and labour, which is to be added to the price stipulated for the finished article, and not a percentage of the total price of the finished article by which such price is to be increased.\nIn the latter case the price is augmented by a percentage of the price itself. In the first instance it is augmented only by a percentage of the value of raw silk and labour. That is what the courts below have held the clause to mean and with such a construction I agree.\nIt might, at all events, be conceded that a clause, such as this, is ambiguous and equivocal. This would flow from the evidence of MM. Reynolds and Hope already quoted and the difference of opinion in the Court of King's Bench. It took the appellant two continuous days of enqu\u00eate and the filing of numerous exhibits to establish the price according to his view. Apparently it is wanting in that element of certainty or of clearness as would meet with the requirements of the law.\nAnd I fail to see, under such circumstances, why the respondent should not have the benefit of the principle which was the recognized rule as early as the time of Ulpian, and is expressed in Dantoine, 46:\u2014\nLorsqu'il y a de Tobscurite au fait.dont il e'agit, on doit prendre le parti le plus doux, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il faut reduire la disposition au plus petit point o\u00f9 elle puisse aller.\nThis principle is the seventh rule laid down by Pothier (Trait\u00e9 des Obligations, Bugnet, vol. 2, no. 97):\u2014\nDans le doute, une clause doit s'interpr\u00e9ter contre celui qui a stipul\u00e9 quelque chose, et \u00e0 la d\u00e9charge de celui qui a contract\u00e9 l'obligation;\nand article 1019 of the Civil Code reproduces it practically verbatim.\nAmbiguitas contra stipulatorem est, and Demolombe (vol. 25, p. 29) is authority for the proposition that article 1019 C.C. applies equally to the lessor or to the vendor and that it is against them that obscure or ambiguous stipulations must be construed.\nHowever that may be, it is well established jurisprudence in Quebec (Rooney v. Fair[12]; Consolidated Car Heating Co. v. Came[13]; Canada Glue Co. v. Galibert[14]; Canestrari v. Lecavalier[15]; Guay v. Provident Accident & Guarantee Co.[16]; Desjardins v. Great West Life Assur. Co.[17]; that, in case of doubt, the contract is interpreted against him who has prepared or drafted it or, in the present case, the appellant.\nBy that rule, the judgments below have been guided:\u2014\nSi le contrat tel que r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le vendeur (says Chief Justice Lafontaine), est tellement obscur qu'il soit difficile de le comprendre et qu'il soit susceptible de deux interpr\u00e9tations, le doute est contre lui; et c'est le sens imposant la moindre obligation qu'il faut prendre, suivant la r\u00e8gle: id quod minimum sequimur.\nI have, for the above reasons, reached the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nI think there has never existed herein a valid and complete contract of sale, on account of the absence in it of the legal requirements with regard to the price. As for the two shipments of silk brocade received and kept by the respondent, the record does not warrant a reference back for the purpose of establishing quantum valebat, and I am satisfied on the evidence that the cheque sent by the respondent was sufficient to fully indemnify the appellant.\nOn the other hand, I would at least concur with the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Bang's Bench in construing the contract against the appellant. Upon such interpretation, there follows that the appellant has sought to overcharge the respondent; he has refused to carry out the contract according to its terms; and the respondent was justified in the stand which he has taken.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: DeWitt, Howard & Harold.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Dessaulles, Garneau, D\u00e9sy & St. Jacques.\n[1] [1892] Q.R. 1 S.C. 65.\n[2] [1906] Q.R. 30 S.C. 242.\n[3] [1899] Q.R. 16 S.C. 64.\n[4] [1923] 1 Ch. 276.\n[5] 22 Q.B.D. 610.\n[6] [1910] Q.R. 39 S.C. 58.\n[7] [1916] Q.R. 50 S.C. 277, at p. 280.\n[8] D. 89 2. 62.\n[9] [1916] Q.R. 50 S.C. 102, at p. 104.\n[10] [1917] 24 R.L.

Langlais K.C. and Paul Leduc for the motion. Gagn\u00e9 contra.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant moves before me for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Quebec Court of King's Bench of the 12th January, 1925, dismissing her appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in bankruptcy, which condemned her to pay to the respondents, in their quality of trustee to the insolvency, $23,555, for money she had received from the insolvent, her husband, and also to return to the insolvent estate certain movable effects which were in the house occupied by the consorts.\nA motion was also presented to me by the appellant to enlarge the time for applying to a judge of this court for leave to appeal, which time is fixed by rule 72 of the general rules under the Bankruptcy Act. The motion for leave to appeal was filed in the registrar's office on February 10 within thirty days after the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, with a notice to the respondent that it would be presented on the 19th of February. By consent of counsel, this latter motion was presented to me on the 20th of February to avail as if presented on the 19th. It is however obvious that it is outside the time prescribed by rule 72.\nAt the argument on both motions, an affidavit was filed on behalf of the appellant alleging that the trustee had not proceeded against her before the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, the only court having jurisdiction in reference to civil rights of persons not under process of liquidation; that the trustee proceeded in the court of bankruptcy not with a writ of summons but with a petition, and that she had been dragged before the court of bankruptcy and deprived of her natural jurisdiction and of her right to inscribe this case before the Supreme Court of Canada de piano and without leave to appeal; that she was in no way a party to the liquidation of the insolvent; that this question of jurisdiction was raised before the Superior Court and before the Court of King's Bench and was decided contrary to her contentions; that the judgment condemning her had interpreted Art. 1265 C.C. in a way which she contends is contrary to its meaning thus affecting her civil rights; that a federal law cannot deprive any citizen of the province of Quebec of rights granted him by the British North America Act and that the decision of this court will be of general interest to all the citizens of that province.\nThe first point to be determined is whether this application for leave to appeal is made within the time prescribed by bankruptcy rule 72. It is to be observed that these rules, provided they are not inconsistent with the terms of The Bankruptcy Act, must be judicially noticed and have effect as if enacted by the Act (s. 66 of The Bankruptcy Act).\nParagraph 1 of rule 72 is in the following terms:\nAn application for special leave to appeal from a decision of the appeal court and to fix the security for costs, if any, shall be made to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within thirty days after the pronouncing of the decision complained of and notice of such application shall be served on the other party at least fourteen days before the hearing thereof.\nThis rule is not inconsistent with the terms of the Bankruptcy Act for this Act merely provides (s. 74) that the decision of the appeal court upon an appeal to it shall be final and conclusive unless special leave to appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada is obtained from a judge of that court. The time for making application for leave is not determined by the Act and therefore could be fixed by the general rules adopted under s. 66.\nThe appellant relies on rule 108 of the Supreme Court Rules which states that\nin any appeal or other proceeding the court or a judge in chambers may by order, enlarge or abridge the time for doing any act, or taking any proceeding upon such (if any) terms as the justice of this case may require, and such order may be granted, although the application for the same is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or allowed. I am however of opinion that the time fixed by bankruptcy rule 72 for applying for leave to appeal goes to the jurisdiction of the judge to whom this application is made and who here acts as persona designata. Supreme Court rule 108 applies to delays of procedure in appeals already before the court and at all events could not prevail against \u00e2 statutory delay such as that provided by bankruptcy rule 72.\nIt is true that the petition for leave was filed in the registrar's office within the thirty days, but rule 72 requires that the application for leave to appeal shall be made to a judge of this court within thirty days after the pronouncing of the judgment complained of. This has not been done and I am now without jurisdiction to grant leave.\nIn my opinion therefore the application is made too late and cannot be entertained.\nI may add that I am also of opinion that the grounds of appeal alleged in the appellant's affidavit would not justify me in granting leave. The appellant was not dragged before a court which had no jurisdiction over her. The so-called court of bankruptcy is merely the Superior Court of the province of Quebec exercising jurisdiction under a statute which applies throughout Canada (s. 63 of the Bankruptcy Act as amended in 1922 by c. 8 of the statutes of that year, s. 8). The right of appeal from the Superior Court is restricted in bankruptcy matters by the Bankruptcy Act, as it is restricted in many other matters by provincial statutes. The circumstance that the appellant might have had a right of appeal de piano if the proceedings had begun by a writ instead of a petition\u2014and no opinion is expressed as to such right of appeal\u2014is certainly no reason to grant her in these proceedings a right of appeal to which she is not entitled under the statute and the rules.\nThe two motions should be dismissed with costs.\nMotions dismissed with costs.\n"

To an action by the wife for overdue instalments of her annuity breach of the condition as to the son was pleaded. In a paragraph of her reply the plaintiff set up facts which were scandalous and vexatious if not material and sought to justify such breach by alleging that she had become aware since the agreement was made that the character and conduct of the defendant was such that she would not be justified in taking his advice as to, or permitting him to associate with, their son on account of the bad influence that would likely result therefrom. On application of the defendant a judge in chambers struck out this paragraph from the reply as scandalous and irrelevant and the court en banc confirmed his order affirming the judgment of the Supreme Cour of Nova Scotia ([1925] D.L.R. 277).\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that such order was properly made; that the reply alleging the husband's bad character is no excuse for a breach of the conditions in the agreement; and that the only way in which she can avail herself of such a matter would be by producing a judgment or order of the court under the Custody of Infants Act giving her the custody of the son free from the father's right of access.\nHeld also, that she cannot in this action claim such judgment or order from the court. Order XIX, rule 16, of the court rules.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming an order of a judge in chambers which struck out a paragraph of the reply to the defence pleaded.\nThe material facts are stated in the head-note.\nJenks K.C. for the appellant.

Bliven[6] no excuse was pleaded for not allowing the visits of the husband as stipulated in the agreement. In Muth v. Wuest[7] the husband was to be allowed to visit the children weekly but the wife's action in taking them abroad for six months, without necessity, was held to be a good defence to an action for payment of her allowance.\nLafleur K.C. and J. McG. Stewart for the respondent. The appellant rests her case entirely on the authority of Besant v. Wood3 in which the court exercised its jurisdiction, as it was bound to do, in the best interests of the child.\nThe breach of the condition by the wife justified the husband in refusing to be longer bound by the contract. Hochster v. De La Tour[8]; Withers v. Reynolds[9].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (the Chief Justice and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nJenks K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and J. McG. Stewart for the respondent.\nNewcombe J.\u2014The parties are husband and wife who are living apart; the wife, under an informal separation agreement made in July, 1921, and evidenced by correspondence set out or referred to in the pleadings, claims as plaintiff to recover $3,854.14, being the sum of the monthly payments of $833.33 for the months of April, May, June and July, 1924, thereby conditionally promised by the husband to the wife, and for interest upon the aggregate amount at 5 per cent for the periods during which the respective payments were withheld. The agreement is admitted, and by its terms it is agreed that the parties shall, without prejudice to the rights of either, live apart, and that the husband will make to the wife an allowance at the rate of $10,000 per annum for herself, and $2,500 per annum on account of their son while he is living with his mother, \"upon the following understanding and conditions.\" Follows a statement of these terms and conditions, the first of which is that the payments shall be made in substantially equal monthly instalments; by clause 3 it is provided that the son, who was, at the time of the making of the agreement, under eight years of age, should be in the general care and custody of his mother, and supported and maintained at her expense, but that\nthe general conditions, the people in whose care he is placed, other than Mrs. McLennan, his education, the place or country where he shall be, etc.,\nshould be satisfactory to his father. Moreover, it was provided by clauses 4 and 5 that Mr. McLennan should have an opportunity to see his son with reasonable frequency, and for periods of reasonable duration and at reasonably convenient places; that the terms of the agreement, so far as it concerns the son, should be subject to reconsideration upon his reaching the age of eight years, and that nothing in the agreement should prejudice the rights of either party as to their son at that time. Other terms and conditions were also stipulated, and the agreement concludes with a provision that in case of any material decrease or increase in Mr. McLennan's income, the amount of the allowance may, after six months' notice, be reconsidered upon the footing that the amount intended for Mrs. McLennan is approximately one-third of his income. Then follow the words\notherwise this agreement shall, as long as the understanding and conditions are observed by the respective parties, continue in force until the death of either party, except that when their son John shall have reached the age of eight years, the arrangements, financial and otherwise, with regard to him, shall be subject to reconsideration, and the rights, of neither party shall be prejudiced by anything in this agreement.\nThe defendant pleaded in answer to the statement of claim among other defences paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 9 which read as follows:\n3. In breach of the said agreement referred to in paragraph 2 of this defence, the plaintiff has neglected and refused to consult with the defendant as to the general conditions where, or the people in whose care the said John S. McLennan, Jr., was or was to be placed, his education, and the place of country in which he was or should be. 4. In further breach of the said agreement referred to in paragraph 2 of this defence, the plaintiff has refused to afford to the defendant an opportunity to see the said John S. McLennan, Jr., with reasonable frequency or at all, or at reasonably convenient places or at all, or for period's of reasonable duration or at all, but that the said plaintiff at all times during the continuance of the said agreement refused to permit the said defendant to see the said John S. McLennan, Junior.\n5. In further breach of the said agreement set forth in paragraph 2 of this defence, the plaintiff has refused to reconsider the terms of the said agreement in so far as the same concern the said John S. McLennan, Jr., when the said John S. McLennan, Jr., attained the age of eight years, and the said plaintiff has notified the defendant in writing that she the said plaintiff will not at any time reconsider the terms of the said agreement in so far as the same concern the said John S. McLennan, Jr., or permit the defendant to see him.\n9. The defendant further says that he was on the 20th day of June, 1919, duly appointed guardian of the said John S. McLennan, Jr., by the Court of Probate at Sydney, in the county of Cape Breton, and that the plaintiff unjustly and unlawfully detains the said John S. McLennan, Jr., and refuses to permit the defendant to see him or to communicate with him and further neglects and refuses to consult the defendant in relation to the upbringing or education of the said John S. McLennan, Jr., or otherwise.\nThe plaintiff by the third paragraph of her reply, which refers only to the paragraphs quoted, alleges that the character and conduct of the defendant is such that the plaintiff would not be justified in consulting him or in affording him an opportunity to associate with their son or to reconsider the terms of the agreement, because of the bad influence which this would be likely to exert upon the boy, and therefore that the plaintiff is excused\nnotwithstanding the said agreement, in neglecting and refusing to consult with the defendant, and in refusing to afford the defendant an opportunity of associating with the said John S. McLennan, Jr. (their son), and in refusing to reconsider the terms of the said agreement as alleged, such consultation, association and reconsideration having been made impossible\nby reason of the defendant's bad character and conduct. I do not quote in the terms alleged the charges against which the motion was directed because they are admittedly scandalous and vexatious if not pertinent; and moreover, as the words have been stricken out by the court below as scandalous and vexatious, and as the judgment of this court will not restore them, they ought not to be republished.\nThe defendant applied to Chisholm J. in chambers to strike out the third paragraph of the reply upon the following grounds: 1. That the allegations contained and set forth in the said paragraph 3 of the reply herein are unnecessary, scandalous and untrue, and would tend to prejudice, embarass and delay the fair trial of this action.\n2. That the said allegations are frivolous and vexatious.\n3. That the said allegations constitute degrading charges which are irrelevant to the issue, and are in their purport prejudicial to the reputation of the defendant.\n4. That the said allegations do not, nor do any of them, constitute an answer at law to the defence filed herein or to any part thereof.\nThe defendant's affidavit was read in support of the motion in which, by paragraphs 2 and 3, he deposed that every one of the allegations set forth in paragraph 3 of the reply is contrary to fact, scandalous and untrue, and moreover that the plaintiff falsely stated and circulated each and every one of the allegations therein set forth on different occasions prior to the making of the separation agreement. The learned judge in chambers was of the view that the promises by the respective parties to the agreement were mutually dependent; that the payments promised to the plaintiff were to be made upon condition that the defendant should have reasonable access to his son and should be consulted with respect to him; that the plaintiff could not approbate and reprobate the contract, and therefore that the pleading in question was not relevant, and not an answer to the defendant's allegations, and should be struck out. The appeal was heard by the court en banc consisting of Ritchie E.J. and Rogers and McKenzie JJ. The two first named agreed with Chisholm J.; they held that the pleading was not relevant, afforded no answer to the defence and was scandalous and unnecessarily offensive. Rogers J. concluded his judgment with the observation that\nthe suggestions which the plaintiff desires to spread upon the pleadings with wholly unnecessary display or vulgarity are in my opinion as scandalous in the legal sense as defendant swears they are in fact, and they must be struck out as affording no answer to the case set up by the defendant.\nMcKenzie J. dissented, holding that the facts pleaded by paragraph 3 of the reply, if true, constituted a good answer to the defence, although they might be scandalous and regrettable; he reached his conclusion upon review of two cases, In re Besant[10], and Besant v. Wood[11], considering, as I apprehend, that the facts alleged by the reply would be material in determining the right to the custody of the infant.\nThe allegations of the pleading in question are introduced by the words \"the plaintiff says that it having come to her knowledge that the character of the defendant is,\" (followed by the statements alleged to be scandalous), and concluded with the submission that the plaintiff is therefore justified in her refusal to comply with the stipulated conditions. The order of Chisholm J. contains a recital that upon the hearing of the motion he was pleased to reserve his decision, and that subsequently, having pronounced it, the plaintiff moved to amend the words last quoted by adding immediately after the word \"knowledge\" the words \"after the making of the said agreement,\" and the order proceeds thus:\nsaid amendment being allowed; but notwithstanding the allowance of such amendment, upon motion it is ordered and adjudged that paragraph 3 of the plaintiff's reply herein be and the same is hereby struck out as being scandalous and irrelevant and as disclosing no answer to the defendant's defence herein.\nFrom this it follows that the amendment which is said to be allowed never became effective, because the pleading was struck out by the same order which allowed it; but the amendment, such as it is, becomes of no material consequence when it is considered that the pleading, even as amended, would be satisfied by proof that the alleged knowledge came to the plaintiff immediately after the making of the agreement. The date of the agreement was 28th July, 1921, and it appears from the statement of claim that it was not until April, 1924, that the plaintiff ceased to receive the stipulated allowances. Therefore upon the pleadings the case must be considered on the assumption that although the plaintiff was aware of the alleged vice in her husband's character and conduct at a time immediately following the making of the agreement, 28th July, 1921, she was not disposed on that account to rescind the agreement or to renounce the payments which had been thereby promised to her, and which had been undertaken and made only conditionally upon her affording to her husband reasonable opportunities of intercourse with their son, and consultation as to his upbringing and education and the arrangements which should be made for him after he became eight years of age. The agreement, it will be perceived, is not only strictly conditional but it is expressed to continue in force only\nso long as the understanding and conditions are observed by the respective parties.\nIf Mrs. McLennan knew the facts which she alleges when the separation agreement was made she could not now set up her knowledge for the purpose of avoiding the conditions subject to which the promise, upon which she claims, was given, and she is in no better position if, having acquired the knowledge which she possesses after the making of the agreement, she continued to abide by it and to receive the payments, as she did for many months. There is no question involved in the case as to the $2,500 a year payable on account of the son; that annuity has apparently been paid? the action is brought solely for the benefit of the wife who pleads for her personal advantage the knowledge which she claims to possess.\nThe Besant cases are material, not to justify the reply, but because they enunciate a principle upon which the court proceeds in the application of agreements between husband and wife affecting the custody of infants. It is there laid down that one of the parties might so misconduct himself or herself that a Court of Equity would refuse to enforce specific performance at his or her instance. The Master of the Rolls[12] referring to the Act of Parliament, 36 V. c. 12, s. 2, an enactment which is reproduced in the revised statute of Nova Scotia, (1923) The Custody of Infants Act, c. 138, s. 5, says:\nAs I read that statute, it refers to an agreement between the father and mother, and to that extent says that they may agree\u2014it says no deed shall be void. It appears to me there entirely to confirm: the view of the law which I think is the correct view, but it does introduce a proviso that the court shall not enforce the agreement as regards the children unless it be to the advantage of the children.\nAnd, at page 629, having stated that before the Act of Parliament the covenant which the husband had made committing the custody of his children to his wife was void by the policy of the law, but that afterwards it became a covenant controlled by the Act, he proceeds to say:\nIt is a covenant, though it is not to be enforced by the High Court, unless the court is of opinion that it would be for the benefit of the infant that it should be enforced. The deed therefore stands precisely in the same position as if the words of the Act of Parliament had been put into the deed that she shall have the custody unless the court takes the custody away. That is really the contract between the parties. She knew he could not covenant absolutely by law, he could not give away absolutely and forever the custody of these children, and there was always a power in the court to intervene and take them away, and that being so, and the court having intervened-, how can I say that that act of the court is a breach on his part of the covenant, because he happened to be of the same opinion as to the custody of the infant as the court? The covenant being a covenant subject to the interference of the court, and the interference having been made, it does not appear to me to be possible for her to say that is a breach of covenant on his part which will destroy the effect of the deed or prevent his enforcing it.\nIt is thus the interference of the court in appropriate proceedings, not the will or knowledge of either party to the agreement, which may be pleaded to justify non-compliance with the terms which have been made competent to the parties by the legislature. If Mrs. McLennan were alleging a judgment of the court denying the rights of her husband as defined by the conditions of the agreement, there would be a question for the opinion of the court appropriate to be considered at the trial; but upon the case as it stands, if, as contended on her behalf, the promise made by her husband upon which she sues does not depend upon performance of the conditions, it is nothing less than scandalous that she should introduce the allegations pleaded by the third paragraph of her reply; while if, as was the view of the court below, the defendant's promise and the plaintiff's promises, the latter expressed as conditions, are inter-dependent, it would appear that the reply is defective for lack of an averment of any determination of the court to interfere with the performance of the agreement; and, when the wife is endeavouring to recover the payments stipulated by the agreement and at the same time refusing to perform the conditions upon which the promise was made, she is in conflict with well established principles.\nMoreover, the appellant cannot, by her reply, claim for the benefit of her son that the court should interfere with the father's right of custody, or order that the conditions of the agreement respecting the son are not to be enforced. If that be the object of the reply it offends against Order XIX, Rule 16, and is bad for that reason; it would appear indeed that if the reply is designed to be useful for any purpose it is to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to take away that measure of intercourse, control or custody which by the agreement of the parties was to remain with the father, and in that view it constitutes a departure. It is no answer of course for the appellant to plead that the respondent is such a bad man that a contract made with him is not binding or may be ignored. While the contract by its express terms requires that the conditions respecting the boy shall be observed, it is by implication of law a further term that the court may for the advantage of the boy otherwise order, and the appellant can be excused from performance of the conditions only by showing an order of the court to justify her neglect or refusal to comply with them.\nRogers J., in his judgment, outlines the provincial practice; he refers to the revised statute above cited respecting the custody of infants; it provides that the mother may have access to her infant child, subject to such regulations as the court or judge deems proper; or that the infant may, by authority of a court or judge, be delivered to the mother and remain in her custody or control, or may, if already in her custody or under her control, remain therein until he attain his majority, or such age as the court or judge may direct, subject to such regulations as regards access by the father or guardian and otherwise as the court or judge may deem proper; the learned judge indicates the procedure under this statute as apt for the purpose of enabling the court to exercise its authority with regard to the operation of an agreement between husband and wife for the custody and control of their infant offspring. It is by this means that the legislature in Nova Scotia has provided for the determination directly of such questions as the apppellant attempts by her reply to bring forward collaterally. If Mrs. McLennan be not content that her husband shall have the limited opportunities to converse or associate with his son which the separation agreement provides for, she may invoke the statutory jurisdiction of the court, but paragraph three of her reply serves no purpose except that of scandal and vexation and is in both senses of the word impertinent.\nIn the result I find myself substantially in agreement with the learned judges who constitute the majority of the court below and I would dismiss the appeal with costs; execution to be limited in a manner corresponding to that directed by the judgment of the court below.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014There is an implication, binding I think, upon the respondent that he should be (at least from the time when the separation agreement in question was entered into), a person whose habits and principles were such that in law he would be entitled to have access to his son, and a voice in the direction of his training and education, and continue worthy of such confidence and trust.\nIf, on the contrary, his conduct, habits and principles were, at the time of said agreement being entered into, or thereafter, such that in law he might, by the court having to pass thereupon, be debarred from either the custody of his son or access to him, or any right to direct, or have a voice in the direction of, his training or education, then the appellant had the right to reply, in the sense so indicated, and thus answer and avert the assertion of the conditions respondent sets up by way of debarring her of her rights under the agreement in question, and the pleading in question should not, in such alleged circumstances, have been struck out.\nIt is absolutely necessary in a case such as presented to protect the appellant's rights under the separation agreement.\nHowever I can conceive that the pleading as first presented, as many do, goes further than necessary, but a pleading so interpreted and entitling appellant to adduce evidence thereunder excusing her from the non-observance of the condition respondent sets up as a release from his said agreement, should be allowed plaintiff as she is in law entitled, I submit, to set up if the facts warrant it.\nIt is for the learned trial judge to guard against abuse of the rights plaintiff has to set up the reply.\nI agree so thoroughly with the reasoning of the Honourable Mr. Justice McKenzie in the appellate court below, that I need go no further than to say that I think this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: N.

Hamill and Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1925: February 27; 1925: March 27.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nPartnerships-Real or nominal\u2014Notaries\u2014Loss by a client\u2014Reimbursement\u2014Liability of partners\u2014Joint or joint and several\u2014Arts. 1128, 1712, 1730, 1732, 1850, 1851, 1854, 1856, 1857, 1863, 1869 C.C.\nThe liability of a notary practising his profession in real or nominal partnership with another notary to reimburse money of a client entrusted to the firm and converted by the latter to his own use is under article 1854 C.C. a joint liability imposing upon the former an obligation to contribute one-half of the loss, and not a joint and several liability involving an obligation for the whole.\nThe effect and application of articles 1730. and 1869 C.C. considered.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 34 K.B. 500) varied.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondents' action for the full amount claimed by them.\nGeoffrion K.C. and Languedoc K.C. for the appellant.\nLaurendeau K.C. and St. Germain K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014When on 28th November, 1916, the late William J. Rafferty of Montreal was confined at the Hotel Dieu in his last illness, his wife, at his request, communicated by telephone with the firm of notaries known as Stuart, Cox, McKenna & P\u00e9rodeau, practising at Montreal, and requested Mr. McKenna of the firm to come to the hospital to transact some business for her husband. Mr. Rafferty desired to change his will and also to make provision for the immediate discharge of a balance of purchase money to the Montreal Realty Company upon a deed of sale of immovable property at the city of Westmount, which was to fall due two days later. Mr. McKenna came immediately to the hospital in response to this message and he had an interview there with Mr. Rafferty and his wife, who was also representing her husband under power of attorney. At this interview Mr. McKenna received instructions to see to the discharge of Mr. Rafferty's obligation to the Montreal Realty Company. It would appear that Mr. and Mrs. Rafferty had not at the moment the information necessary to determine the precise amount which would be required, but that Mr. McKenna prepared a cheque payable to the order of his firm, Stuart, Cox, McKenna & P\u00e9rodeau, for $6,069 which Mrs. Rafferty signed in her husband's name, the cheque being drawn against the Dominion Bank in which Mr. Rafferty carried his account. Mr. McKenna explained that there was some interest or other particulars to be ascertained and adjusted, but he took away with him the cheque which he had received, and, on 1st December following, he obtained from Mrs. Rafferty a cheque for the further sum of $900 to make up the exact balance payable to the company. The body of this cheque was written by Mrs. Rafferty's daughter, under her instructions, and Mrs. Rafferty signed it in the same manner as the former cheque and sent it to Mr. McKenna; the cheque was, however, by some accident or for a reason which is not explained, made payable to the order of Stuart, Cox & McKenna. Mrs. Rafferty was asked in her re-examination at the trial how it was that the cheque was made payable to the order of the firm of Stuart, Cox & McKenna, but the court, upon the objection of defendant's counsel, would not permit the witness to answer, and so the reason for the omission of the name of P\u00e9rodeau in the later cheque is left to conjecture. Mr. McKenna indorsed both these cheques, the first in the firm name of Stuart, Cox, McKenna & P\u00e9rodeau and the second in the firm name of Stuart, Cox & McKenna, adding in each case his own individual indorsement after that of the firm. Upon these indorsements he drew the money, but he did not pay the company, neither did he give credit in the books of the firm for the money received. Mr. Rafferty died on 17th May, 1917, and Mr. McKenna died on 25th June in the same year; it was not until the day of the latter's funeral that Mrs. Rafferty ascertained that the money had not been applied in accordance with her instructions; it was by letter from the Montreal Realty Company of 26th June, 1917, demanding payment, that she became aware that the obligation was still outstanding. The usual occurrences followed; inquiries were made; the defendant disclaimed responsibility; the Rafferty estate paid off the charge, and Mrs. Rafferty, as the executrix of her husband's will, and their two children, son and daughter, having accepted the succession, brought this action in the Superior Court against Mr. P\u00e9rodeau, claiming an account of the sum of $6,969, and in default of account to recover that amount with interest.\nAt the time of the transaction, the Stuart firm consisted of only two members, McKenna and P\u00e9rodeau, the appellant. Stuart and Cox were dead and McKenna and P\u00e9rodeau were carrying on under the name, style and firm of Stuart, Cox, McKenna & P\u00e9rodeau. There is room for some question as to the appellant's actual status in the firm\u2014whether he were in reality a partner or only a nominal partner, as he claims to have been. The learned trial judge finds that\nthe said firm was composed of one McKenna now deceased and the present defendant ;\nalso that\nit appears from the evidence that the defendant and the late F. E. McKenna practised together as notaries and commissioners in the city of Montreal under the firm name of Stuart, Cox, McKenna & P\u00e9rodeau, which name was on the sign at their office door, in the telephone directory and on the ledger kept by them * * * that in the books of account indorsed with the said firm name, the entries concerning the business done by the defendant and the said McKenna N.P. were duly entered, inducting charges concerning administration, commissions on real estate and loan transactions as well as the notarial work performed by each of the said parties, and the bank account was kept in the said firm name, controlled by the signatures of said McKenna and defendant.\nIt is found that defendant's share of the profits was limited to the sum of $150 per month paid as salary. It is also found that\nthe said firm name was used by McKenna and defendant in order to obtain credit.\nThe learned judge finds moreover that the association of the defendant with McKenna\nand their manner of carrying on business without any apparent limitations as regards each other or the public, tacitly indicated the willingness of each of them to accept and ratify the acts of the other in the transaction of the business for which they were associated and to accept responsibility therefor. There is some variety of opinion expressed by the learned judges of the King's Bench who heard the appeal as to whether the respondent were actually or only in name and appearance a partner. But in the result the judgment of the Court of King's Bench is founded upon the\nconsid\u00e9rant qu'il n'y a pas mal jug\u00e9 dans le jugement rendu par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure,\nand for the purposes of this appeal it is not necessary to express any finding more definite as to whether the obligations of the respondent were more than those which are incident to nominal partnership.\nThe trial judge, having found for the plaintiffs, condemned the defendant to render an account to the plaintiffs within fifteen days and in default to pay the plaintiffs $6,969 with interest. The Court of King's Bench consisting of the learned Chief Justice and four of the judges was unanimous in upholding the judgment. Upon appeal to this court two principal points were submitted. First, it was said that the appellant was only a nominal partner, and therefore, under Art. 1869 C.C., liable as a partner only to third parties dealing in good faith under the belief that he was a partner, and that the evidence, far from establishing belief, pointed rather to the conclusion that neither the deceased William J. Rafferty nor his wife entertained any belief as to P\u00e9rodeau's association in the business, or as to whether he were or were not a partner. Secondly, it was argued that having regard to the true interpretation of Arts. 1854, 1856, 1712, 1732 and 1128 of the Civil Code, if the appellant be subject to any liability, it is not joint and several, and that the appellant as a partner contributes only one-half, or in equal shares with the estate of McKenna, his deceased associate.\nUpon the question of liability, the evidence shows that Mr. Rafferty, when he had occasion to consult a notary, had been in the habit of going to the firm of notaries with which the appellant became or was connected. It would appear, if I do not misunderstand the proof, that Mr. Stuart, whose name stood first in the firm, died before Mr. McKenna joined it. It was some time after the death of Mr. Cox that the partnership was formed, such as it was, between Mr. McKenna and the appellant. Mr. Lonergan was a notary preceding Mr. Cox who acted in his notarial capacity for Mr. Rafferty, but whether associated with Mr. Stuart or Mr. Cox does not appear. Then for a good many years after Mr. Lonergan's death Mr. Rafferty used occasionally to consult Mr. Cox, and after Mr, Cox's death it was his successor Mr. McKenna whom Mr. Rafferty consulted; he was the notary who, on 30th September, 1914, passed the deed of sale in the case.\nPreviously to the time when Mr. McKenna came to the hospital to see Mr. and Mrs. Rafferty the latter did not know either Mr. McKenna or the appellant, but she knew that their firm transacted her husband's notarial business, and she knew that the appellant was \"in the firm.\" She gives the following answers in her cross-examination:\nQ. At the date of your husband's death you did not know Mr. P\u00e9rodeau, did you?\nA. I knew he was in the firm but I did not know him personally.\nQ. How did you know he was in the firm?\nA. I knew at the time he was taken into the firm by the talk that was going around.\nQ. What do you mean by \"talk that was going around\"?\nA. I heard people saying that Mr. P\u00e9rodeau was taken in by Mr. McKenna.\nQ. Did you know Mr. McKenna at that time?\nA. Only by name.\nQ. As your husband's notary?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Prior to taking in of Mr. P\u00e9rodeau?\nA. What do you mean?\nQ. Did you know Mr. McKenna was your husband's notary before he took Mr. P\u00e9rodeau in?\nA. Yes.\nArticle 1869 of the Civil Code enacts as follows:\n1869. Nominal partners, and persons who give reasonable cause for the belief that they are partners, although not so in fact, are liable as such to third parties dealing in good faith under that belief.\nIt is admitted that the appellant was a nominal partner. The article, as I interpret it, provides in effect that nominal partners are liable as partners to third parties dealing in good faith under the belief that the nominal partners are in reality partners, and the learned counsel for the appellant very justly did not hesitate to concede that everything has happened requisite under the article to establish the appellant's liability, except proof of belief; but he contends that there is no finding, nor evidence to justify any finding, that the belief existed which is essential to establish the liability of a nominal partner. It is, I think, a just inference from the facts that Mr. Rafferty dealt with the firm in ordinary course, although his transactions were not unnaturally and most conveniently carried out through the agency of a single member. Indeed, by the law, notaries practising together cannot sign deeds or contracts passed before them in the name of their firm, although they may sign in that name their advertisements, notices and documents, other than notarial deeds (R.S.Q. 1909, art. 4621), and so a client is likely to come into contact with only one of the members of a firm. Upon cross-examination the following information was elicited from Mrs. Rafferty referring to time subsequent to the death of Mr. Cox:\nQ. The late Mr. Rafferty was subsequently a client of Mr. McKenna's?\nA. He was a client of the firm; he was not personally acquainted with Mr. McKenna.\nQ. He did not know him?\nA. No, not any more than the other members of the firm, but the firm was a good firm, and he dealt with them.\nThe appellant, if not an actual partner, was such according to all appearances. He had caused his name to be published as that of a member of the firm. It appeared upon the door plate and upon the letter heads and bill heads of the concern, and it may be assumed that it would have been inconsistent with the arrangements existing between Mr. McKenna and the appellant, and with their purposes, that information should have been handed out to clients disclosing the fact, if it were a fact, that there was in reality no partnership, or to rebut the inferences which would naturally and legitimately be drawn by clients from the representations appearing by the advertisements of the firm; there is moreover nothing suggested in the proof on either side of the case to give rise even to a conjecture that either Mr. Rafferty or his wife had at any time, previous to the discovery of the misappropriation of the money, any knowledge or reason to suspect that the relations between Mr. McKenna and Mr. P\u00e9rodeau were otherwise than as so represented. It is reasonable therefore to conclude that Mr. Rafferty, in going to the office and transacting his business there, in the course of his transactions, had acquired and accepted as matter of belief those particulars with reference to the constitution of the partnership which it was an object of the associates to make known in the manner described. At the time when Mr. McKenna received the money and instructions for its payment to the ; Montreal Realty Company, Mrs. Rafferty held her husband's power of attorney, and the cheque for $6,069 which she was asked to sign by Mr. McKenna, and did sign at his request, was by his hand made payable to Stuart, Cox McKenna & P\u00e9rodeau, and thus there was a direct request and representation by one of the nominal partners to the client that she should entrust her money, or her husband's money, to the firm in the name of which Mr. McKenna was practising, and which was described by the latter in a manner to indicate no difference in quality or status as between Mr. McKenna and the appellant, except that the name of the latter followed that of the former. Belief or intention or state of mind is proverbially difficult of proof but inferences may be drawn from the facts and circumstances of the case. Lord Blackburn said in the well known case of Smith v. Chadwick[2]:\nI think that if it is proved that the defendants with a view to induce the plaintiff to enter into a contract made a statement to the plaintiff of such a nature as would be likely to induce a person to enter into a contract, and it is proved that the plaintiff did enter into the contract, it is a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the statement.\nThe parties here were engaged in a serious transaction of some magnitude, a sum of upwards of $6,000 was being entrusted to a notary to apply for Mr. Rafferty's benefit, and it is, I should think, extremely unlikely that in these circumstances Mrs. Rafferty would be apt to reject, or to accept with any degree of credence less than belief, a statement made to her by the notary, as in effect it was made, that he had a partner in the execution of the business, Mr. P\u00e9rodeau, who assumed with him the responsibilities which the law imposed upon partners in the like circumstances; and of course it was entirely within the scope and intent of the nominal partnership that the one partner should bind the other in such a transaction by the representations which they had publicly announced and were holding out. I think that the belief of Mr. Rafferty and his wife in the existence of a real partnership is involved in the findings; and, for the reasons which I have stated, I do not think that the findings should be disturbed. I come now to the question as to whether the liability of Mr. McKenna and the appellant was a joint liability, imposing upon the latter only an obligation to contribute one-half of the loss, or a joint and several liability, involving an obligation for the whole. The answer depends upon the interpretation of several articles of the Civil Code. It is provided by art. 1857 that partnerships are either civil or commercial, and, by art. 1863, as follows:\n1863. Commercial partnerships are those which are contracted for carrying on any trade, manufacture or other business of a commercial nature, whether general or limited to a special branch or adventure. All other partnerships are civil partnerships.\nPartnership between notaries for the practice of their profession is not of the character here described as commercial, and is therefore a civil partnership. The general subject of partnership is regulated by the 11th title of Book III of the C.C. \"Of Partnership,\" and, in the 3rd chapter of this title, there are two articles, 1854 and 1856, to be considered, which read as follows:\n1854. Partners are not jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership. They are liable to the creditor in equal shares, although their shares in the partnership may be unequal.\nThis article does not apply in commercial partnerships.\n1856. The liabilities of partners for acts of each other are subject to the rules contained in the title of mandate, when not regulated by any article of this title.\nNow referring to the title of Mandate, which is the 8th title of Book III of the Civil Code, it is provided by the 2nd chapter, which regulates the obligations of the mandatary, article 1712, that:\n1712. When several mandataries are appointed together for the same business, they are jointly and severally liable for each other's acts of administration, unless it is otherwise stipulated.\nAnd, moreover, it is provided in the 4th chapter, \"Of advocates, notaries and attorneys,\" article 1732, that\nadvocates, attorneys and notaries are subject to the general rules contained in this title, in so far as they can be made to apply.\nThis article is relevant only as showing that notaries may be subject to the general rules of mandate, but it throws no light upon the question as to how far these general rules can be made to apply. One other article was referred to at the argument; it is art. 1128 of the 3rd title of Book III, \"Of obligations,\" and it is as follows:\n1128. The obligation to pay damages resulting from the non-performance of an indivisible obligation is divisible. But if the non-performance have been caused by the fault of one of the co-debtors, or of one of the co-heirs or legal representatives, the whole amount of damages may be demanded of such co-debtor, heir or legal representative.\nThis article might be of some importance in ascertaining the amount of the liability of Mr. McKenna's estate, but it does not assist in the case of the appellant. The obligation is, for present purposes, divisible or not, depending upon the application of the other articles to which I have referred.\nAssuming that Art. 1869 may be applied to determine the liability, and it was upon that assumption that the case was argued, there seems to be no occasion for invoking the provision of art. 1856. By arts. 1850 and 1851, which belong to the second chapter of the title of partnership, bearing the description \"Of the obligations and rights of partners among themselves,\" it is provided that when several of the partners are charged with the management of the business of the partnership generally, and without a provision that one of them shall not act without the others, each of them may act separately; that partners are presumed to have mutually given to each other a mandate for the management, and that whatever is done by one of them binds the others. The relation of agency or mandate in which the persons carrying on a joint business stand to each other is a material subject of inquiry upon the question of partnership; and so, for the regulation of the liabilities of partners for the acts of each other, resort must be had to the rules of mandate, and these are conveniently and naturally introduced into the partnership articles of the code by reference to the rules contained in the title of mandate. But in this case the appellant's liability is not for the act of his partner or nominal partner; it arises by reason of the fact that the partnership has failed to account for, or to apply to the purpose directed, the money which was received by the partnership for that purpose. The money was paid to Mr. McKenna who had authority to receive it and did receive it on behalf of the firm to be applied in accordance with the instructions which were communicated to him, and there can be no doubt that in this he was acting within the scope of his authority. Hence arose at least a debt of the partnership to repay the money, if the mandate were not executed, and for this art. 1854 declares that the partners are liable to the creditor not jointly and severally, but in equal shares; this article regulates the measure of the appellant's liability, because it is a partnership liability, and because, with respect to partnership liabilities, the article is not controlled or qualified by the provisions respecting mandate. Moreover, upon the only assumption upon which art. 1856 can be considered to apply, namely, if the liability be that of a partner for the act of his copartner, it will be perceived that such liabilities, in so far as they comprehend debts of the partnership, are regulated by art. 1854, and therefore expressly within the exception to art. 1856. It seems consequently to be clear, subject to what I am about to say, that, upon the true interpretation of the relevant articles of the Civil Code, the appellant is liable, not, as found by the learned trial judge and the court of King's Bench, for the entire debt, but only for one-half.\nThere are some other considerations however which should not be overlooked and which were suggested, although they were not discussed, at the hearing. It is declared by art. 1854 that this article does not apply in commercial partnerships. The partnership between these two notaries was admittedly not a commercial partnership; it was a civil partnership. Commercial partnerships are divided into four classes, the first of which is called general, and in the fascicle of articles descriptive of general partnerships is placed art. 1869, which provides for the liability of nominal partners; unless therefore it is to be supposed that this article has been misplaced, and reason for that supposition may be found in the aptitude of the provision as affecting every partnership, it would be necessary to confine the article to partnerships of the general commercial variety. It will be realized however that, if it be assumed that the apparent partnership between Mr. McKenna and the appellant was no more than a nominal partnership, there was as between Mr. McKenna and the appellant in fact no mandate, although they had concurred in representing in the manner which has already been explained that each was the mandatary of the other; such a condition of fact would admit of the application of art. 1730 of the Civil Code, which is to be found under the title of mandate in section II, \"Of the obligations of the mandator towards third persons\"; the article provides that:\n1730. The mandator is liable to third parties who in good faith contract with a person not his mandatary, under the belief that he is so, when the mandator has given reasonable cause for such belief.\nAnd, by the application of this article to the present case, the appellant, as the mandator, became liable to the third party, Mr. Rafferty, because the latter in good faith contracted with Mr. McKenna, a person who, upon the hypothesis, was not the appellant's mandatory, under the belief that he was so, the appellant having given reasonable cause for such belief. If therefore the appellant can escape liability under art. 1869 upon the pretension that that article does not apply to civil partnerships, he is nevertheless held to liability upon the same state of facts under the provisions of art. 1730; but, even so, the measure of his ability would be regulated by art. 1854, because his liability would be shown by proof of his holding himself out as a partner; and, if he is bound by his representation of partnership, it would be strange indeed if, by reason of so representing himself, he would incur a responsibility greater than that to which he would have been subjected as a true partner. Therefore under art. 1869, if it apply, or under art. 1730, if the former article do not apply, the result is the same, and the extent of the appellant's liability is in either case measured by the same rule.\nIt was said that however the case might stand as to the first payment of $6,069, there could be no liability for the second payment of $900, because that payment was made by a cheque signed by Mrs. Rafferty in which the firm of Stuart, Cox & McKenna is named as the payee, and moreover that the fact that the name of P\u00e9rodeau did not appear among those nominated by the drawer as payees of the latter cheque was strong evidence to show that Mrs. Rafferty was not engaging the credit of the appellant in the transaction. I am not disposed however to permit this circumstance to effect the case in the one way or the other. There can be no doubt that the second cheque was supplementary to the first, nor that it was intended to pass through the same channel and to be applied for the same purpose, and therefore the appellant became responsible in like degree for the application of both cheques. It is found that the firm name was used by McKenna and the appellant in order to obtain credit, and the fact that Mrs. Rafferty's daughter happened to omit the name of P\u00e9rodeau in describing the firm in the cheque for $900, which she drew at her mother's request, might reasonably have been explained, if it required explanation, in a manner which would exclude any thought of ignoring the appellant's responsibility. The explanation may be imagined; it is not stated; but the objection now comes with little propriety from the appellant, seeing that it was through the interposition of his counsel that the testimony which Mrs. Rafferty would have given upon the subject was rejected.\nAccording to the views expressed by the French commentators, members of a civil partnership are not severally liable. See Bugnet's 3rd ed. of Pothier, vol. 4, Trait\u00e9 du Contrat de Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, par. 96; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, 3rd ed. par. 349; Laurent, vol. 26, pars. 348 and 349. The decisions in the province of Quebec are not uniform. The Court of King's Bench has followed a decision pronounced by that court in 1878 in the case of Ouimet v. Bergevin[3], in which Chief Justice Sir A. A. Dorion, pronounced the judgment, and it is very briefly stated as follows:\nThis is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the Superior Court (Mackay J.) at Montreal, on the 12th of February, 1877, condemning the appellant, as having been a member of the professional firm of attorneys, Messrs. B\u00e9langer, Desnoyers & Ouimet, to pay to the respondent certain moneys collected by said firm and claimed by respondent to be payable to her. The only question raised under this appeal is, whether practising attorneys who carry on business as such under a firm name, are jointly and severally liable to their clients for moneys collected by the firm. We are all of opinion that they are liable just as solicitors in England are. (Troplong, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, No. 373; Plumer v. Gregory[4]. The judge below so found and we therefore confirm his judgment.\nThere is no further explanation of the facts; they are not stated. The passage in Troplong to which the learned Chief Justice referred has to do with the practice of holding out, and Plumer v. Gregory4 is an English decision by Malins V.C. which is not an authority for the province of Quebec. It would not be inconsistent with the statement of the case that the attorneys although practising under a firm name were not partners, and that they were acting under a joint mandate unaffected by any question of partnership, actual or represented. When a question of partnership liability came before the Superior Court in 1881, in Loranger v. Dupuy[5], Johnson J. who pronounced the judgment said:\nArt. 1854 only creates a joint liability between partners and not a several one, except in commercial partnerships; but the Court of Appeals held in Ouimet & Bergevin[6], that there was solidarity between the members of a firm of attorneys.\nBut he found that the partnership which he was considering was commercial, and it was for that reason that he held the partners jointly and severally liable. In Julien v. Pr\u00e9vost, decided by the Circuit Court[7], where the defendants were practising the profession of advocate in partnership, Loranger J., pronouncing the judgment, said:\nIl est admis que les associ\u00e9s sont responsables solidairement pour l'argent re\u00e7u par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La question a \u00e9t\u00e9 le sujet d'une longue controverse, mais la Cour d'Appel l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans la cause de Bergevin v. Ouimet6, et cette d\u00e9cision est devenue la jurisprudence. On a pr\u00e9tendu que cette cause ne s'appliquait pas. J'ai lu les factums, et je trouve que le principe d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Bergevin s'applique \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause. Le vice-chancelier Wood, dans la cause de Plumer v. Gregory[8] dit clairement: \"Each partner is the agent of the other and bound by his acts and representations.\" L'article 1712 du Code Civil dit: \"Lorqu'il y a plusieurs mandataires \u00e9tablis ensemble pour la m\u00eame affaire, ils sont responsables solidairement des actes d'administration les uns des autres, \u00e0 moins d'une stipulation contraire.\nAnd he accordingly found joint and several liability. It would appear however from the judgment of the Court of Review in Baron v. Archambault[9] that, although the question was as to the nature of the liability of notaries who carried on their notarial business in partnership, it was nevertheless because their partnership business also embraced real estate and insurance agency, and because the transaction involved in the case was of a commercial character, that the partners were held to be jointly and severally liable. In Drouin v. Gauthier[10], the Chief Justice, Sir A. Lacoste, who gave the judgment of the King's Bench, held that a firm of advocates who, as a civil partnership, had made a promissory note in their firm name should be held not severally liable but in equal shares under art. 1854. No reference is made in this case to the decision in Ouimet v. Bergevin (1) or in Julien v. Pr\u00e9vost (2), but it appears to be the latest deliverance of the Court of King's Bench upon the subject preceding the judgment in the present case, and, curiously enough, it escaped reference upon this occasion.\nIn this state of the decisions one is forced to conclude that the jurisprudence cannot be regarded as established by the Bergevin Case (1); and, seeing that the liability of civil partners is regulated explicitly by Art. 1854 of the Civil Code, a legislative enactment which is not of doubtful meaning; that the partnership or nominal partnership existing between the notaries in this case is within the application of the article, and that it is the office of the judges to declare the expressed intention of the legislature, the liability must, in accordance with the legislative rule, be adjudged in equal shares.\nFor these reasons the judgment below should be varied by reducing the amount by one-half.\nIdington J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Greenshields, Greenshields & Languedoc.\nSolicitors for the respondents: St. Germain, Gu\u00e9rin & Raymond.\n[1] [1924] Q.R. 34 K.B. 500.\n[2] [1884] 9 App. Cas. 187 at p. 196.\n[3] [1878] 22 L.C.J. 265\n[4] [1874] L.R. 18 Eq. 621.\n4 [1874] L.R. 18 Eq. 621.\n[5] [1881] 5 L.N. 179.\n[6] 22 L.C.J. 265.\n[7] [1884] 8 L.N. 143.\n6 22 L.C.J. 265.\n[8] L.R. 18 Eq. 621.\n[9] [1900] Q.R. 19 S.C. 1, at p. 22.\n[10] [1903] 5 Q.P.R. 211; 9 Rev. de Jur. 176.\n"

(1922) c. 151, s. 19. The appellant was a mortgagee of goods but failed to file a renewal statement within the time required. The respondent purchased the goods from the mortgagor, paying full value. He knew that the mortgage was unpaid but considered he was entitled as a matter of law to rely upon the mortgagee's failure to file renewal, which fact he had ascertained by having caused a search to be made at the registry office. No collusion on respondent's part to protect the mortgagor was found.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division ([1925] 1 W.W.R. 1), Idington and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that the respondent was not a \"purchaser * * * in good faith\" within the meaning of s. 19 of the Bills of Sale Act.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\u2014A purchaser who knows that goods which he is buying belong to a third person and that his vendor has neither title to them nor right to sell them, but, on the contrary, is bound as between himself and such third person to protect the right and title thereto of the latter, and who also knows that any right or title he may acquire by his purchase must be in defeasance of that of such third person, cannot be said, either legally or morally, to be a purchaser \"in good faith\" and therefore cannot maintain his claim to the goods as against such third person.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Simmons J. at the trial [2] and dismissing the appellant's motion for an order allowing the removal and sale of certain chattels seized under a chattel mortgage, the respondent claiming the chattels as purchaser for value from the mortgagor.\nBennett K.C. for the appellant.\nMcGillivray K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The appellant bank held a chattel mortgage, bearing date of the 20th of April, 1921, from one Cline. There was due upon it for principal and interest, on the 29th of August, 1924, $4,602.17. Default was made in April, 1924, in filing a renewal of this mortgage as prescribed by s. 19 of the Bills of Sale Act (R.S.A. 1922, c. 151), with the consequence that, while it remained effective inter partes, the mortgage\nceased to be valid as against the creditors of the person making the same and as against purchasers and mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\nCline sold the mortgaged goods to the respondent Munro by bill of sale for $2,000 on the 31st of May, 1924, and received payment in full by cheque on the 4th of June, 1924. This bill of sale was recorded as prescribed by the statute. On the 30th of August, 1924, the goods were seized By a sheriff's bailiff acting under a distress warrant issued by the appellant. This seizure is contested and the issue to be determined is whether the respondent was a purchaser of the goods \"in good faith for valuable consideration.\"\nThe learned trial judge found that the price paid by Munro to Cline represented the full value of the goods. That finding, accepted on appeal, is not now challenged. The sale, therefore, was not simulated and Munro was a purchaser \"for valuable consideration.\"\nThe learned judge was unable\nto say that Munro entered into the bargain with Cline collusively with the object of protecting the mortgagor.\nBut it was clearly found that, when he purchased, Munro knew of the mortgagee's claim and appreciated the fact that his purchase, if upheld against the mortgagee, would deprive it of its security on the chattels for the debt owing to it. While there is no \"specific finding\" by the trial judge that Munro knew or believed that Cline intended dishonestly to appropriate the purchase money and not to pay it, or any part of it, to the bank, he makes this significant statement:\nIt is suggested that he (Munro) was entitled to assume that the purchaser (sic)\u2014obviously the vendor is meant\u2014would use the money to pay off the liability to the bank. It is a fact, however, that he went to the bank with Cline, immediately after the sale, cashed the cheque for $2,000 given for the goods and that the same was drawn in currency by Cline.\nThe only fair inference from this statement seems to be that the learned judge was satisfied that Munro, when carrying out the transaction, was fully alive to the fact that \"the obvious result would be to defeat the claim of the bank.\"\nOn the other hand, it would seem to have been assumed that Munro believed that the statute would protect the title he acquired from Cline against the claim of the mortgagee. Having searched the record and found that the mortgage had not been renewed, to use his own words, he \"took the chance.\" Was he a purchaser in good faith?\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (Stuart J. dissenting), reversing the judgment of Simmons C.J., has held that he was. The ground for that judgment appears to be that if the purchase is real, i.e.) not simulated, and if the motive of the purchaser is to acquire the pro perty sold and is not to aid the vendor to defeat the claim of the mortgagee, he meets the exigency of the phrase \"in good faith,\" although he has full knowledge that his vendor has no title or right to sell the goods, that the title is in the mortgagee, and that the mortgage debt is unpaid and believes that his purchase will defeat the mortgagee's claim and destroy his title.\nWith great respect, we cannot accept that view of the law.\nThe sole authority cited for the majority judgment of the Appellate Division is Sydie v. Saskatchewan Land Co.[3], considered and distinguished in Ross V. Stovall[4]. Counsel for respondent supported the judgment, however, by reference to Moffatt v. Coulson[5]; Vane v. Vane[6]; Roff v. Krecker[7]; Ferrie v. Meikle[8], and Assets Company Limited v. Mere Roihi[9]. It is, perhaps, desirable that these cases should be examined.\nSydie v. Saskatchewan Land Co. (1) and Ross v. Stovall (2) were cases under the Land Titles Act of Alberta (c. 24, 1906), which absolutely protects certificates of title (s. 44) and dealings with registered owners (s. 135), except in cases of fraud, and provides that\nknowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud (s. 135).\nThe court took the view that in the former case there was, in the latter case there was not, \"actual fraud\" on the part of the transferee. Obviously decisions based on a statute which admits only fraud as a ground of relief and declares that proof of actual knowledge of an adverse interest \"shall not of itself be imputed as fraud,\" afford little assistance in determining how far, without such a statutory exclusion, that knowledge would affect a purchaser's good faith. In passing it may be observed that knowledge that the owner had agreed to sell to another person and that by taking a transfer of the property he would deprive that other person of his right, was held in the Sydie Case (1) to be fraud. It may be that the case at bar falls within this authority. In the Ross Case (2) the transferee honestly believed that his agreement for the purchase was prior to that of the plaintiff of which he had knowledge when he took his transfer. Nothing more need be said of these Alberta decisions. But the statute on which they rest shows that the Alberta Legislature regarded mere knowledge of an adverse interest as something from which fraud might be inferred and excluded that inference in unmistakeable terms when it meant that it should not be drawn.\nIn Moffatt v. Coulson [10] the purchaser was not informed by the vendor of the existence of the chattel mortgage and, although a witness deposed that the purchaser had told him he knew of it when he bought, he added that he believed that, either by reason of expiration of the mortgage or by arrangement with the mortgagee, the vendor had a right to dispose of his property. Actual knowledge of an unpaid existing mortgage and intent that by purchasing from a vendor who had no right to sell he should defeat the mortgagee's title was, therefore, lacking. In the course of his judgment Robinson C.J., undoubtedly uses language which imports that in his opinion notice (presumably actual notice) of the adverse title of the mortgagee would not affect the good faith of the purchaser. But such observations were obiter. Knowledge by the purchaser that an unsatisfied adverse interest was outstanding in the mortgagee was not shown. Moreover, the Chief Justice apparently held the view that the chattel mortgage had not passed the property in question to the mortgagee because the description of the goods was insufficient. Edwards v. English[11], cited by Mr. Justice McLean is not in point. The claimant there was an execution creditor as to whom the statute imposed no requirement of good faith. Edwards v. Edwards[12], was also the case of a seizure under execution. McLean J. also rested his judgment on the plaintiff mortgagee's lack of title.\nThe observations of James L.J., in Vane v. Vane[13], at p. 399, afford little or no assistance. It was held in that case that a person whose agent bought with knowledge of a fraud was not a\nbona fide purchaser for value who at the time of the purchase did not know or had no reason to believe that any such fraud had been committed (s. 26). James L.J. expressed the view that in this context the words \"bona fide\" meant a real purchaser and not merely a donee taking under the guise of a purchase; these words\nwere not meant to include and cover all, and more than all, that is afterwards expressed in the remainder of the proviso.\nThere is no difficulty in regarding the words \"bona fide\" used as an adjectival phrase preceding the word purchaser, especially when accompanied by such a context, as meaning merely \"real\" or \"actual\" as distinguished from \"feigned\" or \"simulated.\" Thus a \"bona fide traveller\" means merely a traveller. Atkinson v. Sellers[14]. But it is something quite different to place a like limitation on the purport of the words \"in good faith\" in the Chattel Mortgage Act, following the word purchaser and unaccompanied by any such context as James L.J., had before him. On Moffatt v. Coulson[15], and Vane v. Vane[16], rest very largely the decisions in Roff v. Krecker [17] and Ferrie v. Meikle[18].\nIn Roff v. Krecker [19] the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench (Taylor C.J., Dubuc and Killam JJ.) purporting to overrule King v. Kuhn[20], likewise a decision of the full court (Wallbridge C.J., Taylor and Killam JJ.) held that\na second mortgage made in good faith and for valuable consideration has priority over a prior unregistered chattel mortgage of which the second mortgagee had actual notice and that where a mortgage is taken for valuable consideration and not for a collusive purpose the mortgagee is \"in good faith\" within the meaning of the Chattel Mortgage Act (Con. Stat. Man., 1880, c. 49, 48 Vic., c. 35) although he has notice of a prior unfiled mortgage.\nKing v. Kuhn (6) was a case of failure to refile, with a statement of the debt, as prescribed by the Chattel Mortgage Act, Con. Stat. Man., 1880, c. 49. The Manitoba court unanimously held that a purchaser who had actual knowledge of the unrenewed mortgage was not \"in good faith,\" citing the well-known passage from LeNeve v. LeNeve,\nthe taking of a legal estate, after notice of a prior right, makes a person a mala fide purchaser\u2014not that he is not a purchaser for valuable consideration in every other respect. This is a species of fraud and dolus malus itself; for he knew the first purchaser had the clear right of the estate. Roff v. Krecker [21] was a case of competing chattel mortgages, the prior in time being unregistered. Much weight was attached in the judgments to the fact that the words \"without actual notice\" found in both sections of the Con. Statute of 1880 (c. 49) had been dropped in 1885 from the section of the Act dealing with chattel mortgages, whereas they were retained (whether intentionally or inadvertently does not appear) in the section dealing with Bills of Sale. This was apparently regarded by the court as tantamount to a legislative declaration that in the case of an unregistered chattel mortgage actual notice by a subsequent mortgagee or purchaser of the prior right it conferred was immaterial. After indicating this view Taylor C.J. proceeded on the authority of Moffatt v. Coulson[22], Tidey v. Craib[23], presently to be noted, and Vane v. Vane[24], to hold the title of the second mortgagee to be unaffected by his notice of the prior encumbrance. It may be observed that the notice in this case was probably only to an agent and that personal knowledge by the second mortgagee was not established.\nBoth Dubuc and Killam JJ. stated that if they felt at liberty to dispose of the case as res Integra on general principles and apart from the language of former statutes and the history of the law they would have held the second mortgage not in good faith. After expressing a view as to the effect of the deletion of the words \"without actual notice \"similar to that of Taylor C.J., Dubuc J., citing Moffatt v. Coulson (2), Tidey v. Craib (3), and Marthinson v. Patterson[25], concludes that notice of the prior unregistered mortgage did not affect the good faith of the second mortgagee.\nMarthinson v. Patterson (5), a decision of the Queen's Bench Divisional Court (vide p. 728 in fine) was reversed on appeal[26]. The question now before us is not there disposed of, although notice of a prior unregistered mortgage was treated as immaterial by Burton and Maclennan JJ.A. Osier J.A., however, refers without disapproval to the view of Esten V.C., in Fisken v. Rutherford[27], that actual notice of an unregistered incumbrance binds a subsequent mortgagee or purchaser. The same learned judge (Osier J.A.) delivering the judgment of the court (Burton C.J.O., Osier, Maclennan, Moss and Lister JJ.A.) in Winn v. Snider[28], at least impliedly indicates his opinion that proof of actual notice of a prior purchase might be fatal to a subsequent purchaser's claim that he had bought in good faith.\nKillam J. in Roff v. Krecker [29] came reluctantly to the conclusion that the second mortgagee was \"in good faith\" within the meaning of the Manitoba statute. The only authorities he cites are Vane v. Vane [30] and Moffatt v. Coulson[31]. He regarded the course of the Manitoba legislation\u2014the fact that the statute originally (1874, 38 Vic., c. 17) did not contain the words \"without actual notice,\" their insertion in the Consolidated Statute of 1880, both in s. 3, dealing with Bills of Sale, and in s. 2, dealing with chattel mortgages, but not in the renewal provision (s. 8), and their deletion in 1885 from the chattel mortgage section, but not from the bills of sale section\u2014as sufficiently indicating an intention that actual notice of an unregistered chattel mortgage should not affect the good faith of a subsequent mortgagee or purchaser, though it would be otherwise in regard to actual notice of an unregistered bill of sale. It should also be noted that towards the close of his judgment Killam J. seems to express the view that, inasmuch as the mortgagor still had an equity of redemption upon which the second mortgage might be considered a real and valid charge, in the absence of any suggestion of an object or desire to defeat the prior mortgage, except in so far as that might lawfully and properly be done, there was good faith on the part of the second mortgagee.\nThere has been no such insertion and deletion of the words \"without actual notice\" in the legislation of the North West Territories and of the province of Alberta regarding bills of sale and chattel mortgages. These words do not appear ever to have had a place in this legislation: vide 0. 5, 1881, N.W.T. ss. 3, 5, 9; 0. 7, 1887, N.W.T., ss. 5, 7, 11; Rev. O., N.W.T., 1888, c. 47, ss. 5, 7, 11; 0. 18, 1889, N.W.T., ss. 5, 7, 11; Con. 0., N.W.T., 1898, c. 42, ss. 6, 9, 17, 19; Con. 0., N.W.T., 1905, c. 43, ss. 9, 17, 19; R.S. Alta., 1922, c. 151, ss. 6, 9 (3), 18, 19. We are not presently concerned with the Conditional Sales Act referred to by counsel for the respondent.\nFerrie v. Meikle[32], seems to have been decided on the authority of Roff v. Krecker[33]. It was a decision upon unregistered lien notes, not upon a chattel mortgage, and was governed by the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.S. 1909, c. 145, s. 1. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to express an opinion on the correctness of this decision. We would, however, require to give it very careful consideration before accepting it. It may be noted that the original N.W.T. Ordinance (no. 8 of 1889) avoided unregistered hire receipts, etc., as against \"any mortgagee or bona fide purchaser without notice.\" These terms were changed in 1897 (O. No. 39). The statute now reads (R.S. Sask. 1920, c. 201, s. 1)\nas against any purchaser or mortgagee * * * in good faith for valuable consideration.\nReferring to this change, Mr. Justice Duff, in Lanston Monotype Machine Co. v. Northern Publishing Co.[34], says at p. 498,\nthe legislation has substituted the condition of the existence of good faith for the condition of the want of notice.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan in the Lanston Case [35] would seem to have taken\nthe view that when a purchaser relies upon these provisions of the statute it is in every case a question of fact to be decided under the circumstances in evidence whether or not the purchaser did in fact act in good faith, and that if he failed to establish honesty in fact then his plea under the statute must fail,\nVide Lanston Case[36].\nAssets Co. Ltd. v. Mere Roihi [37] is not in point. Effect was there given to a statute making a registered title conclusive, except in a case of fraud.\nIn Morrow v. Rorke [38] the absence of the words \"in good faith\" from s. 9 of the Chattel Mortgage Act (C.S. U.C. c. 45) was the ground on which a purchaser for valu- able consideration of goods, which, after registration of the chattel mortgage, had been removed into another county, was found entitled to hold them free from the mortgage of which he had notice.\nIn Tidey v. Craib[39], Ferguson J., a very careful judge of undoubted ability, held an unregistered chattel mortgage void as against subsequent mortgagees who had knowledge of it when they took their security.\nWe find it impossible to accept the view that a purchaser who knows that goods which he is buying belong to a third person and that his vendor has neither title to them nor right to sell them, but, on the contrary, is bound as between himself and such third person to protect the right and title thereto of the latter, and who also knows that any right or title he may acquire by his purchase must be in defeasance of that of such third party, can be said, either legally or morally, to be a purchaser \"in good faith.\" He is knowingly taking part in a dishonest dealing. He is assisting his vendor to commit a fraud. He cannot establish in regard to such a dealing that \"honesty in fact\" which is prescribed by the words \"in good faith\" Those words import the requisite of honesty in the transaction and not merely that it be real and not feigned or simulated. Munro's mala fides in abetting Cline's illegal transfer to him of the bank's property is not purged by any opinion he may have held that the statute would protect the title Cline purported to give him. On the contrary, his belief that the success of Cline's \"machinatio ad circumveniendum\" was thus assured would rather seem to establish complicity in his vendor's attempt to defraud the bank. In so far as the judgments in Roff v. Krecker [40] and Tidey v. Craib (1), may be contrary to these views, these decisions must be overruled.\nThis conclusion is in accord with English and American judicial opinion. As instances, Jones v. Gordon[41], and Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. v. Hendrickson[42], may be referred to.\nWe are, for these reasons, of the opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge was right and should be restored. The plaintiff is entitled to its costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014One Cline, a farmer in the Calgary District of Alberta, having become indebted to the appellant, gave it a chattel mortgage by way of security therefor, on the 20th April, 1921.\nThe appellant failed entirely to keep same renewed, as required by s. 10 of c. 151 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, known as the Bills of Sale Act, which provides as follows:\u2014\nEvery mortgage filed in pursuance of this Act shall cease to be valid as against the creditors of the persons making the same and as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration after the expiration of two years, from the filing thereof unless, within thirty days next preceding the expiration of the said term of two years, a statement exhibiting the interest of the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns in the property claimed by virtue thereof and a full statement of the amount still due for principal and interest thereon and of all payments made on account thereof is filed in the office of the registration clerk of the district wherein the property is then situate together with an affidavit of the mortgagee or of one of several mortgagees or of the assignee or one of several assignees or of the agent of the mortgagee or assignee or mortgagees or assignees, as the case may be, stating that such statements are true and that the said mortgage has not been kept on foot for any fraudulent purpose, which statement and affidavit shall be deemed one instrument.\n(2) Such statement and affidavit shall be in Form C of Schedule 1 hereto or the \"like effect.\nThereafter said Cline offered the respondent the goods which had been so mortgaged for sale and they arrived at a bargain by which the said respondent bought same for the sum of $2,000, paid Cline in cash, for which he got a bill of sale under said Act, dated the 31st May, 1924, and that with the necessary affidavits was duly registered in conformity with the requirements of said Act, within the thirty days prescribed thereby.\nThereafter the appellant brought an action against Cline to recover judgment for his indebtedness to it, and upon the recovery thereof, issued execution, and examined Cline, and it ensuing that an issue seems to have been directed to test the validity of the seizure of said goods, made under a distress warrant, issued by the appellant, presumably.\nThat issue was tried as directed before Chief Justice Simmons, said appellant being the plaintiff therein and respondent the defendant. The said learned Chief Justice having tried the said issue, by hearing the evidence of respondent and of said Cline, of whom the latter called by the appellant says he had told the respondent that he, Cline, had given a mortgage some three or four years ago to the appellant and that he imagined he told him it was not cleared off but tells nothing of the amount of it. Nothing was said between them about any renewal of said mortgage being filed or not. He testified also that the price of two thousand dollars paid him by respondent for the goods when he give him the bill of sale was the full value of the goods so sold; and further that he, Cline, did not, at the time of selling to respondent, know how much he owed the appellant.\nRespondent testified that when negotiating with Cline for the purchase and figuring out that it was good business and hearing from the said Cline that he had given a mortgage to the respondent, he caused a search to be made. That part of his examination-in-chief, reads as follows:\u2014\nQ. What led up to your purchase of these chattels?\nA. Well Mr. Cline came along and wanted to sell them to me, he was hard up and I figured it was good business so I just bought them.\nQ. He mentioned something to you about the bank having a mortgage on these chattels?\nA. Yes, he told me that, or had had. And I had it searched.\nQ. What did you discover?\nA. That the mortgage had run out.\nQ. You had it searched?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And the result of that search was brought to your attention.\nA. Yes.\nQ. You were told that the mortgage had run out?\nA. Yes.\nQ. How much money did you pay Mr. Cline?\nA. 82,000 by cheque.\nQ. Have you your cancelled cheque for the amount, is it here?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Let us see it.\nIn cross-examination he was asked quite a number of questions evidently directed to his good faith\u2014such as to whether he had intended farming, and he answered that he had a farm in Manitoba, but in fact he had figured on another farm proposition, but it blew up when the crops went bad; and again as to being indemnified in any way against the $2,000, and he positively denied any such thing and tells further through what channel he made the search and names the office in Calgary, and that it was one he had previously done considerable business through, naming the proprietor and assistants there. Whether they were members of the legal profession or ordinary conveyancers is not expressly stated, but I infer from the examination that counsel knew them well and hence did not press for further details as to that.\nThe respondent is very positive as to the parties he names, or one of them, assuring him that search had been made, and telling him that the property was clear of the mortgage to the appellant, and that it had run out and, thereupon, that he directed the bill of sale in question to be prepared.\nUpon the evidence the learned Chief Justice sets forth fully his view of the facts, and in no way suggests any doubt of the veracity of either of the witnesses who had testified.\nHe expressly finds as to the question of good faith, as follows:\u2014\ni am bound to say I am not able to go so far as to say that Munroe entered into the bargain with Cline collusively with the object of protecting the mortgagor. He paid the full value of the goods; he knew of the mortgagee's claim but he considered he was entitled as a matter of law to rely upon the failure of the mortgagee to register the renewal and that he was under no obligation to concern himself as to whether the bank was paid or not.\nThe Chief Justice, however, gave judgment for the appellant solely on the basis of respondent having been told of Cline having given a mortgage, even though that had run out as above set forth. He does not seem to have understood, as counsel for appellant herein seems (I respectfully submit) to have understood, the actual grounds upon which Lanston Monotype Machine Company v. Northern Publishing Co. Limited [43] was decided, but refers to some obiter dicta of myself and others in disposing of that case \u2014to which I shall advert presently.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowed the appeal to that court, and unanimously\u2014saving Mr. Justice Stuart who dissented\u2014reversed the said judgment of Chief Justice Simmons.\nHence this appeal herein.\nThere is an aspect of the law which I am afraid and very sorry to find was overlooked by me in the observations I made in the Lanston Monotype Company Case (1) brought before us by the factum of counsel for respondent, and that is the history of the legislation bearing on the question raised herein and, I submit, accounts for and justifies the ruling in a number of cases decided in the western provinces.\nThe grounds upon which the majority of this court proceeded in deciding the Lanston Monotype Case [44] were clearly and explicitly upon the peculiar terms of the bargain therein in question, and could not fall within the protecting terms of the statute herein in question even if the parties concerned had been honest though counsel sought to bring it thereunder\u2014and the decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in the case of Ferrie v. Meikle et al [45] was relied upon.\nThat led to the obiter dicta I have referred to. No one really went into the history of the legislation or presented that in such a way as it has been presented in the course of this appeal, especially in the excellent factum of counsel for the appellant herein.\nThe legislature of the province of Manitoba, shortly after it was created, passed, in 1880, by c. 49, s. 1, a statute (which I may abbreviate as follows) dealing with mortgages of goods and chattels and not accompanied by immediate and continued change of possession, requiring an affidavit of the mortgagee, as usual in such like enactments, verifying the alleged indebtedness and good faith, and for the express purpose of securing payment of the money and not to the prejudice of creditors. Then by s. 2 thereof it provided as follows:\u2014\nII. In case such mortgage or conveyance and affidavits be not filed as herein provided, the mortgage or conveyance shall be absolutely null and void as against creditors of the mortgagor and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration without actual notice.\nThere were later amendments but nothing material to what we are concerned with, until 1885, when there was an amendment (48 Vic., c. 35) in which the words \"without actual notice\" were left out.\nPrior to 1892 there had been decisions of the Manitoba courts holding that the man having \"actual notice\" was not protected, but in that year, after the change leaving out the words \"actual notice,\" the case of Roff v. Krecker [46] came before the Manitoba Court of Appeal and the appeal was allowed, the court evidently agreeing that effect must be given to such an important amendment. Mr. Justice Killam seemed inclined to think that the enactment as it stood with the words \"without actual notice\" was the better legislation, but was too good a lawyer to allow himself to be led to discard, or fail, to give effect to, the change made by the elimination of these words, and agreed with the other members of the court that, despite the actual notice as in that case there was to the appellant's agent taking the mortgage attacked, the change in language used by the legislature must be observed and acted upon.\nThere is a curious episode just there for the Manitoba Revised Statutes of 1891, falls back to the use of the words \"without actual notice\" (of course that could not affect the case before them which had arisen out of transactions which happened a year or more earlier), and when revised in 1902 these words \"without actual notice\" are dropped out, as appears by 63-64 Vic., 1900-1901, c. 31, s. 5, as follows:\u2014\n5. Every mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels hereafter made in the province of Manitoba, which is not accompanied by immediate delivery and an actual and continual change of possession of the things mortgaged, shall be registered, as by this Act provided, within fifteen days from the execution thereof, together with an affidavit of a subscribing witness thereto of the due execution of such mortgage or conveyance, and with an affidavit of the mortgagee or his agent that the mortgagor therein named is justly and truly indebted to the mortgagee in the sum mentioned in the mortgage, that it was executed in good faith, and for the express purpose of securing the payment of money justly due or accruing due, and not for the purpose of protecting the goods and chattels mentioned therein against the creditors of the mortgagor or of preventing the creditors of such mortgagor from obtaining payment of any claim against him, otherwise such mortgage or conveyance shall be absolutely null and void as against the creditors of the mortgagor and as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for good or valuable consideration.\nThis short bit of history shews how the question has been threshed out in at least one province.\nAre we to set aside, by our confidence in ourselves, the law so declared and acted upon since 1902, and, in such an important province as Manitoba, where people have got accustomed to so acting upon the law? Indeed I am inclined to think from what the respondent testifies to in his evidence as to owning a farm in Manitoba, that it is quite probable he had lived there, and learned there, as a man of business, that he was quite within his rights in searching the office in Calgary to see if the appellant's mortgage had been renewed, and acting upon the results so found. He did that of his own motion, or that of his adviser, for Cline and he never alluded to it between them.\nI am, from the consideration I have given the matter, quite clear that the great majority of those who have to do business of the kind in question, are better served and the general public also, by such an interpretation of the words used, as the court below has given, than by leaving the business to turn upon \"actual notice\" or \"notice\" given. Why should people, and above all bankers, who have the facility for keeping before their eyes records of need for filing on such and such a date as required by a renewal, not observe the law in that regard? Why should all the rest of the world be worried by reason of their neglect and the lawyers have a chance to still add to the worries over distinctions between notice, actual notice and constructive notice?\nThen again to call what the respondent did a fraud under such circumstances of the law as declared, not only for so long a time now past in Manitoba, but ever since 1915, at least, in the province of Saskatchewan, seems to me rather a peculiar conclusion. With all due respect I submit that is not what the public are entitled to expect from this court which has to determine such far reaching consequences. For my part I am far more concerned as to that aspect of this case than aught else in it.\nThe history of the law in question in the North West Territories, out of which Saskatchewan and Alberta were carved, in 1905, is briefly as follows:\u2014\nI cannot find any Act of the Council of the North West Territories especially dealing with chattel mortgages earlier than June, 1881. That Act seems clearly to have been founded upon the lines of the statute of Ontario as it appeared in the then last Revision (1877) of the statutes of the province, c. 119; having been in great part copied therefrom. Section 4 of the said Ontario statute is as follows:\n4. In case such mortgage or conveyance and affidavits are not registered as hereinbefore provided, the mortgage or conveyance shall be absolutely null and void as against creditors of the mortgagor, and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\nAnd s. 5 of the said Ordinance of June, 1881, is identical in its language and leaves no question to be raised by the use of the word \"notice\" or \"actual notice\" such as appeared to disturb the legislators and judges of Manitoba. It does appear, however, in the next Ordnance of a like nature, passed in 1889, being No. VIII of the North West Ordinances, sec. 1, and which is as follows:\u2014\n1. From and after the first day of February, A.D. 1890, receipt-notes, hire-receipts, and orders for chattels, given by bailees of chattels subsequent to the said date, where the condition of the bailment is such, that the possession of the chattel should pass without any ownership therein being acquired by the bailee, shall not be entitled to any precedence or priority and shall be of no effect whatsoever as against judgments or attachments, in any court of record or against any mortgagee or bona fide purchaser without notice, unless the said receipt-note, hire-receipt, or order shall have been within thirty days from the date thereof registered in the office of the registration clerk of the registration district, as defined by c. 47 of the Revised Ordinances, within which the maker of the said receipt-note, hire-receipt, or order is resident, by filing in the office of such registration clerk a copy of the said receipt-note, hire-receipt or order for the chattel or chattels, together with the endorsements thereon, verified by affidavit of the owner or his agent as to its correctness and as to the bona fides of the transaction; and for filing the same the said clerk shall be entitled to have and receive at the time of filing a fee of ten cents.\nIt is to be observed that that contains the words \"without notice.\"\nThe said ordinance seems to have been blended with chattel mortgages in 1897 by an ordinance no. 39, of that year, which is as follows:\u2014\nSection 3. The seller or bailor, his executors, administrators or assigns, or his or their agent, shall within 30 days next preceding the expiration of two years from the date of such registration, file with such registration clerk a renewal statement verified by affidavit shewing the amount still due to him for principal and interest (if any) and of all payments made on account thereof, and whether or to what extent the condition (if any) of the bailment is still unperformed, and thereafter from year to year a similar statement similarly verified within the 30 days next preceding the expiration of the year from the filing of the last renewal statement, and in default of such filing the seller or bailor shall not be permitted to set up any right of property or right of possession in the said goods as against the creditors of the purchaser or bailee, or any purchaser or mortgagee of or from the buyer or bailee in good faith for valuable consideration of the goods. That seems necessarily to have continued the law in Saskatchewan, save as to minor changes not important in this connection, until changed by its own legislature by an Act respecting Mortgages and Sales of Personal Property, being c. 144 in the legislation of 1909, s. 19 of which is as follows:\u2014\n19. Every mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage filed in pursuance of this Act shall cease to be valid as against the creditors of the persons making the same and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration after the expiration of two years from the filing thereof unless within thirty days next preceding the expiration of the said term of two years a statement exhibiting the interest of the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns in the property claimed by virtue thereof and a full statement of the amount still due for principal and interest thereon and of all payments made on account thereof is filed in the office of the registration clerk of the district where the property is then situate with an affidavit of the mortgagee or of one of several mortgagees or of the assignee or one of several assignees or of the agent of the mortgagee or assignee or mortgagees or assignees duly authorized for that purpose, as the case may be, stating that such statements are true and that the said mortgage or conveyance has not been kept on foot for any fraudulent purpose which statement and affidavit shall be deemed one instrument.\nThe law so enacted contained no reference to the question of notice or actual notice, nor were these words resorted to in any future legislation that I can find, so far as Saskatchewan was concerned.\nThe Act under which Ferrie v. Meikle [47] above referred to, was decided by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, on a statute substantially the same as that first quoted above, as being the Alberta Act which must govern the decision of this case, and, so far as Alberta was concerned there was no resort back to the words without notice or actual notice, and I can find no substantial difference from the Act I have referred to above, as having been taken from the Ontario Act.\nHaving as result of most careful search thusdemonstrated the history of the legislation in said three prairie provinces, and that there was a most distinct feature of the same kind in discarding in the later legislation the condition or the qualification of actual notice or mere notice of prior mortgage, and that has been given effect to by each of the appellate courts respectively of each of said provinces. Therefore I conclude it is our duty to observe such concurrent jurisprudence. I do not think any number of mere decisions upon other statutes of other countries can be of any avail herein, except to mislead.\nIf I am correct in my appreciation of the result of tracing the legislation in question and the jurisprudence of the said provinces ensuing upon the changes in said legislation ultimately discarding the question of actual notice or notice of any prior bill of sale or chattel mortgage as having any bearing upon the question of good faith, or such like question as raised herein by appellant, then I see no useful purpose to be served by such citations as counsel for appellant present in their factum.\nI think, however, the opinion of such eminent jurists as Lord Justice James, when speaking in Vane v. Vane[48], where he points out that a bona fide purchaser means that the purchasers should be really purchasers and not merely donees taking gifts under the form of purchases, is entitled to great weight.\nThe view expressed by the late Mr. Justice Ferguson in the case of Tidey v. Craib[49], when he discarded the claims set up by counsel in a somewhat similar case to this, upon a similar Act of the Ontario legislature, is well worthy of giving to it great weight.\nOther Ontario judges evidently held the same opinion.\nIn good faith means nothing more than bona fide as expressed in many ways in many Acts, and to restrict or enlarge the meaning to be attached thereby and impute fraud when, as the learned trial judge finds, there was none intended, I most respectfully submit, in face of the jurisprudence I have referred to, should not be the attitude assumed towards the grave question raised herein.\nThe case of Fernie v. Meikle[50], as well as a decision of Walsh J. preceding this in Alberta and the decision of the Appellate Division in this case have doubtless ere this been relied upon in cases which never reached the appellate courts, much less here, should therefore be followed as well as the case of Roff v. Krecker[51], above referred to. Moffatt v. Coulson[52], is also an outstanding decision upon an Act similar to this, when stripped of any reference to actual notice or notice in the statute.\nThat was a court of common law not afflicted with the equity jurisdiction and therefore expressing that what the statute said must be held to govern.\nThe decision in the case of Marthinson v. Patterson[53], raised so many points and involved so many questions that I omitted reading it through before I had written the foregoing, assuming that it might not throw much light upon the question presented to us herein. I find, however, that the evidence clearly disclosed that the second mortgagee there had full knowledge of the existence of a prior mortgage and that if the several courts hearing that case had taken the view of the law that appellant asks this court to take and uphold the learned trial judge, the said several courts hearing that case then could easily have saved themselves a lot of trouble by ruling that such an objection was fatal.\nThe first court of appeal from the learned trial judge, however, could not, but ruled distinctly that they were bound by the case of Moffatt v. Coulson (1), to hold otherwise.\nThat court was composed of the late Chief Justice Armour and the then Mr. Justice Falconbridge, later on promoted to the Chief Justiceship of said court.\nTrue the judgment was reversed in appeal, but again, not on the ground taken by appellant herein that the knowledge by the second mortgagee of the first mortgage was such as to render him fraudulent and not acting in good faith and his security thereby voided. They need not have worried over the manifold intricacies of the case if such had been their view.\nI submit, that such being the case, we must assume this as some of them expressly declare against it being a correct view.\nWe have thus a body of Ontario judges, well conversant with the law, evidently against appellant's contention herein, and, I may be permitted to say, we of Ontario have long been proud of such judges. The action of Mr. Justice Osier referring to another learned judge who had passed an opinion on facts arising under former legislation, repealed by said 20 Vict., c. 5, is just what a judge might do out of deference to argument of counsel, but Mr. Justice Osier never indorsed such a J. contention as set up herein.\nI was not aware until to-day (when it occurred to me while tracing up the North West legislation, and I then verified it as I point out above) that the Act in question there was taken from Ontario legislation so far back as 1877. I have traced it back beyond that date to the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada and that really shews it was presented to the several judicial authorities cited as it remained in the essential feature in question herein to 20 Vict., a period antedating the case of Moffat v. Coulson[54],\nThat fact renders the judicial opinions from cases there decided of great weight, and that obviously against appellant's contention.\nIt certainly is most remarkable that such a contention as set up by appellant upon such phraseology as that used in the legislation in question has not succeeded in being upheld after sixty-five years of opportunity.\nMoreover I find that the ultimate judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, in Marthinson v. Patterson[55], when reversing the Divisional Court judgment of Armour C. J. and Falconbridge J. rested their judgment finally upon the fact that the second mortgagee had taken possession of the goods before the first mortgagee interfered and hence as between two manifestly defective for other reasons than knowledge by the second mortgagee of the existence of the first (but including that considered of no consequence) was entitled to succeed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Street was restored.\nThat reason is open clearly to the respondent herein who had taken possession of the goods in question long before the appellant herein moved, and, as a sequel thereto, issued the distraint warrant above referred to.\nIt is quite clear that, in Marthinson v. Patterson (2), the entire number of the judges in Ontario (including the late Mr. Justice Street, one of the best lawyers we ever had in Ontario on the bench) and the said Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal have decidedly refused to accept, in such like circumstances as presented herein, the contention of the present appellant.\nThe legislation in question therein was substantially the same as we have to pass upon herein and, in the essential features in question, almost the exact wording as taken from that sixty-five year old statute.\nThe reversal of such jurisprudence would entail the like consequences in Ontario to that I have already pointed out in three of the prairie provinces.\nFor the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014The question with which we are concerned in this case is whether the respondent, when he purchased from one Cline some live-stock and farm machinery, was a purchaser \"in good faith for valuable consideration\" within the meaning of s. 18 of c. 151 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, 1922. That the respondent gave valuable consideration, indeed full value, for the goods was found by the learned trial judge and is admitted by the appellant. The only controversy is whether he was also \"in good faith.\"\nIt would be pretentious, and it might be futile, to attempt dogmatically to define \"good faith.\" Some things are better understood than they can be adequately expressed. There is moreover the added consideration that the question is not one which should be approached in any dogmatic spirit. For our conceptions of good faith are not the criteria we should follow, but rather should we seek to discover what was in the mind of the legislature when it protected, against the assertion of a non-registered right, \"subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\"\nThere is no controversy as to the facts. Cline had previously granted to the appellant a chattel mortgage affecting the goods, and he so informed the respondent. This mortgage had been registered but the appellant had subsequently failed to file a renewal statement in the office of the registration clerk of the district where the property was situate as required by the statute. Under these circumstances, the respondent agreed to purchase the chattels for a price representing their full value, but only after he had caused a search to be made at the registry office and had ascertained that no renewal statement had been filed.\nFrom these facts should we conclude that the respondent was a purchaser in good faith, for it is admitted that he was a purchaser for valuable consideration?\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Trial Division (who tried the case) expressly excluded any fraud on the part of the respondent. He said:\u2014\nI am bound to say I am not able to go so far as to say that Munro entered into the bargain with Cline collusively with the object of protecting the mortgagor. He paid the full value of the goods; he knew of the mortgagee's claim, but he considered he was entitled as a matter of law to rely upon the failure of the mortgagee to register the renewal and that he was under no obligation to concern himself as to whether the bank was paid or not.\nHe added, however, and on this the appellant relies:\nI am of the opinion that the purchaser here cannot successfully maintain his claim for the goods, when he had reason to believe that the obvious result would be to defeat the claim of the bank if Cline was dishonest.\nIn terms this is not a finding that the respondent was not a purchaser in good faith, although it may be a possible inference from the remarks of the learned Chief Justice. Certainly all idea of collusion with Cline must be dismissed from our minds for the learned judge himself rejected it.\nThe Chief Justice relied on the views expressed by the majority of this court in Lanston Monotype Machine Co. v. Northern Publishing Co.[56]. That case is, however, entirely distinguishable from the one under consideration, the circumstances were different, and there was no determination by the court of the point with which we now have to deal. I may add that I see no reason to depart from the view I personally expressed as to the law, while differing on its application to the facts from the other members of the court, except Mr. Justice Brodeur.\nI do not construe the finding of the learned trial judge as meaning more than that Munro, who was aware of the unregistered chattel mortgage, had reason to believe that if Cline did not pay the bank out of the purchase monies, the latter would be unable to assert its mortgage against the goods and its claim would be defeated. This however is the penalty of non-registration or of non-renewal of registration where the subsequent purchaser has paid a valuable consideration for the goods and has purchased them in good faith.\nIf good faith within the meaning of the statute is excluded by knowledge of the non-registered chattel mortgage, however adequate may be the price which the subsequent purchaser has paid, then the statute will apply only where the purchaser was ignorant of the chattel mortgage, and mere notice of the incumbrance will be equivalent to its registration.\nI have been unable so to construe this statute. The historical development of the law as to chattel mortgages and liens to which I referred in Lanston Monotype Machine Co. v. Northern Publishing Co.[57], shews that the legislature intended to depart from the equitable doctrines with respect to the effect of notice on rights acquired by subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration. Thus in Ordinance no. 8 of the North West Territories for 1889, the language was \"bona fide purchaser without notice.\" This ordinance was repealed by Ordinance no. 39 of 1897. and the words \"without notice\" were dropped, the expressions used in sections 1 and 3, and which in substance have been repeated in subsequent enactments, being\nany purchaser or mortgagee of or from the buyer or bailee in good faith for valuable consideration.\nWith regard to land, there is an express provision in the Land Titles Act (R.S.A., 1922, c. 133, s. 175) that\nknowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\nThis enactment in pari materia shews what is the policy of the legislature when it requires registration of titles or deeds conferring ownership or creating liens. It is not bad faith, within the intendment of the statute, to rely on such a statute and to purchase goods under its protection. Here it is inconceivable that the respondent would have paid full value for the live-stock and farm machinery had he not considered that he could safely rely on the protection of the statute. I certainly do not wish to say that only persons ignorant of prior unregistered rights can depend on the statute; as a rule they do not require the statute for their protection. And I think the intention clearly was to put an end to the controversies to which the equitable doctrines of notice and constructive notice had given rise.\nAs I observed in the Lanston Monotype Machine Co. Case (1) in three provinces, to which should now be added the province of Alberta, the law appears settled in the sense that mere knowledge of a prior unregistered right does not deprive a purchaser of the protection of the statute where an adequate consideration has been paid for the goods, and I would be extremely reluctant to overrule the long standing decisions by which the statutes have been so construed. It is more important that the policy of the law should be carried out, than that a negligent lien owner should be saved from the consequences of his own negligence. I may perhaps add that if I have misconceived the policy of the registration law, the last word rests with the legislature which can place its meaning beyond the possibility of further question.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1925] 1 W.W.R. 1.\n[2] [1924] 3 W.W.R. 229.\n[3] [1913] 6 Alta.

Mcewen (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1925: February 12, 13, 26.\nPresent:\u2014Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nCompany\u2014Powers of directors\u2014Managing director\u2014Power to give chattel mortgage for past indebtedness\u2014The Companies Act, R.S.A. (1922) c. 156, art. 55 of table A. Even independently of the express provision of art. 55 of table A. of The Companies Ordinance, the directors of a company constitute its governing and managing body, and, except to the extent that their powers are expressly restricted by statute or the articles of association or the by-laws and regulations they possess authority to exercise all the powers of the company. When a board of directors of a company appoint one of them \"managing director,\" they may be taken to have ipso facto delegated to him their powers as a board of directors, subject to such direction and control as it is their duty to exercise.\nA board of directors can validly execute chattel mortgage securing a past due indebtedness without the sanction of the shareholders and the company cannot use as a valid ground of dismissal the fact that a managing director, whose powers have not been restricted by the resolution appointing him, has executed such a mortgage without the express authority of the directors or shareholders.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (20 Alta. L.R. 472) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge and maintaining the respondent's action for wrongful dismissal.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nBennett K.C. for the appellant.\nMcGillivray K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014This action was brought to recover a balance of salary and expenses due to the respondent by the appellant company arising out of a contract for services, or, in the alternative, damages for wrongful dismissal. There was added a claim of $400 and interest for money loaned by the respondent on the 31st October, 1921.\nMr. Justice Ives, of the Supreme Court of Alberta, gave judgment in favour of the respondent for the sum of $7,793.55. In this sum were included the capital and interest of the money loaned, the salary earned by the respondent and an agreed commission of 10 cents per ton for every ton of coal sold by the appellant up to the date of dismissal, moneys paid by the respondent as travelling expenses or freight charges and spent by him in the course of his employment, and finally damages equivalent to the salary and commission to which, but for his dismissal, the respondent would have been entitled under his contract, which was held to have been wrongfully terminated by the company. The Appellate Division unanimously confirmed this judgment.\nOf the several reasons advanced by the appellant company as a justification for dismissing the respondent, all of which were held bad by the judgment appealed from, one only was seriously pressed before this court and need now be considered. It was alleged that the respondent, without authority of any of the shareholders or directors, mortgaged and charged the entire assets of the company to the Bank of Montreal, at Drumheller.\nThis chattel mortgage was given to the bank with whom the company carried on its banking business. There is no room for doubt that, at the time when the respondent was appointed, the financial position of the company was somewhat desperate. This appears to be manifest by the minutes of meetings of the directors and of the shareholders held on 7th March, 1922.\nThe following extracts from the evidence accurately represent the situation. O'Connor, the secretary-treasurer, is speaking and he says:\nThe mine could not possibly open; we were in that position where we could not possibly open. We could not get funds unless we were put in some position by somebody that would immediately * * *\nQ. Command confidence?\nA. Yes, or put us in a position where we could get money to open the mine.\nAnd a little further:\nWe could not raise five cents and we were being threatened. The directors were on a bond with the Bank of Montreal and the Merchants Bank and they were threatening certain action.\nMcEwen explains why he came to give the chattel mortgage:\nThe pressure by Mr. Prest (the bank manager) became so great that when we were getting cheques from Bowman-Thayer on Saturday mornings, on pay day, and when we would take that cheque in the morning Mr. Jones (accountant) and I had got to the point where it was questionable whether Mr. Prest was going to place that to our credit or apply it to a payment of the debt. With this hanging over me, with the possibility of having to close our mine, I felt that it was the part of wisdom and good judgment to protect the company by giving a mortgage and particularly in view of having the information after having conferred with the secretary of our company and he having conferred with * * *\nQ. No, no you don't know whether he did or not. But you did have the benefit of the advice of the secretary-treasurer of the company.\nA. Yes.\nQ. Who incidentally is a barrister and solicitor?\nA. Yes. The fact that the respondent consulted the secretary-treasurer is confirmed by the latter, who also states that he advised him that he had the right to give the mortgage.\nThe evidence has failed to show that what the respondent did was detrimental to the company's interest, and, moreover, is clear that it was done only under pressure of necessity.\nWhile, however, affording a good answer to a complaint that the respondent acted improvidently and contrary to the company's welfare, necessity alone might not be found a sufficient excuse, if the respondent in fact exceeded his authority. In this case, the rights of third parties are not in issue; the question concerns a mere matter of internal management. What is to be determined is whether the directors in fact purported to clothe the respondent with the authority which he exercised; for the company cannot be heard to assert as a ground for dismissal or to brand as misconduct the making use of the very powers which its directors professed to vest in its officer; nor can it urge here the illegality of their acts, as a ground of relief from the damages consequent upon such dismissal.\nNow there was no formal resolution defining the extent of the powers of the respondent. It was moved at a directors' meeting\nthat we proceed to the election of a general manager for the ensuing year; then \"that James C. Nostrant be manager\" and, this motion being withdrawn, it was moved and carried \"that T. M. McEwen be appointed managing director.\"\nLeaving aside for the moment the true meaning of the resolution, which will have to be considered later, the mere appointment of a manager by directors\nwill only operate as a delegation of the ordinary commercial business of the company\n(Palmer's Company Law, 12th ed., pp. 45 and 272); while the authority of a managing director may be implied from the power to delegate vested in the body by which he was appointed (Buckley on the Companies' Act, 10th ed. p. 656).\u2014By the 68th article of Table A of The Companies Ordinance (18 Ord. of N.W.T., c. 20), which was embodied in the appellant's articles of association, the directors could delegate any of their powers to \"committees consisting of such member or members of their body\" as they thought fit. It would appear that by appointing McEwen as they did, the directors intended thereby to delegate their powers to him under this article, subject of course to such direction and control as it was their duty to exercise (Montreal Public Service Co. v. Champagne[2]. But, on this point, the record affords much more conclusive evidence of the intention of the meeting. We may look (Lindley on Companies, 6th ed. p. 433) at the answer given on the examination for discovery by James K. Valance,\nselected by the (appellant) company, for the purposes of making admissions to be used against the company at the trial.\n609. Q. Well it was understood by everybody at the meeting that he was to have full authority and control of everything during his office?\nA. Yes.\nNow, generally speaking, unless otherwise provided by the Act under which the company was incorporated, by the articles of association or by the by-laws and regulations, the directors possess authority to exercise all the powers of the company (Hovey v. Whiting[3]; and Art. 55 of Table A says so in explicit terms. Strong J., later Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of this court in Bickford v. Grand Junction Railway Co.[4], said at p. 730:\nNo enabling power is requisite to confer the authority to mortgage, but prima facie every corporation must be taken to possess it;\nand he cites abundant authority in support of his proposition.\nThis power is not limited to the object of securing a loan, in which case \"the sanction of a resolution of the company must be previously given in general meeting\" (Companies' Ordinance, c. 20, Ords. of N.W.T. 1901, s. 98); but it may be exercised for other purposes, such as securing a debt which is an outstanding valid liability of the company, and for that the confirmatory vote of the shareholders is not required. Barthels v. Winnipeg Cigar Company[5].\nIn the case of The Corporation of the Town of St. Jerome v. The Commercial Rubber Company Limited[6], the town had voted a bonus to the company and granted it exemption from taxation on condition that the company establish a factory in the municipality and operate the same for ten years without intermittence. The company gave a hypothec on its real estate as security for the fulfilment of its obligations. The town brought action to recover the bonus paid, alleging breach of the conditions, and prayed for the enforcement of the hypothec. The plea was that the deed of hypothec was illegal, null and void because the directors of the company had no power to authorize its president or any other officer to hypothecate the immovable properties without the formality of a by-law passed in due form and previously submitted to the shareholders of the company and approved by them.\nThe Privy Council held that the directors of a joint stock company incorporated under the Revised Statutes of Canada of 1888, c. 119, had the power under the \"general powers\" clause, s. 35 of the Act, to accept a conditional bonus and to hypothec the immovable property of the company to the municipality, without the approval of the shareholders.\nThere is no substantial difference between Art. 55 of Table A of the Companies' Ordinance and section 35 of The Companies Act of 1888, under which the case of Town of St. Jerome v. Commercial Rubber [7] was decided by the Judicial Committee. And the cases are made more similar by the circumstances that the federal Act of 1888 (s. 37), like the Companies' Ordinance (s. 98), also contained provisions requiring the approval of the shareholders for authority to borrow money with incidental authority to hypothecate or pledge the real or personal property of the company as security therefor.\nIt follows that the directors could have executed the chattel mortgage here in question without the sanction of the shareholders. After the board had vested the respondent with full authority and control, the least that can be said is that the company cannot urge as a valid ground of dismissal the fact that he has executed this chattel mortgage securing a past due indebtedness to the bank.\nBut the appellant further says that the articles of association contain no provision enabling the directors to appoint a managing director.\nIt is not quite clear, from the three successive resolutions of the 7th of March, to which reference has already been made, whether the directors really intended to make McEwen a managing director or whether he is so styled in the minutes merely because he happened to be a manager chosen from amongst the directors.\nAlthough a director, McEwen could, under clause 53 of the articles of association,\nhold any other office of profit in service of the company, in conjunction with the office of director, and that on such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the directors may arrange.\nWe see however no reason to disagree from the view taken by the learned trial judge that, as the directors could, under art. 68 of Table A, delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they thought fit, \"a committee of one so named is tantamount to naming one as managing director,\"\u2014 especially when the Companies Ordinance (s. 94) contemplates the existence of a managing director; and it is common ground that there were managing directors in the company during the previous year, with the acquiescence of the shareholders (Phosphate of Lime Company v. Green[8]; Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company v. Riche [9] ).\nCounsel for the appellant submitted the further contention that a managing director is not a \"servant\" of the company and that the remuneration for his services could, by virtue of clause 51 of the articles of association, be determined only by the company in general meeting. The question then would be whether, under the present circumstances, the respondent may yet maintain a claim for loss of salary and commission.\nIt might perhaps be said that clause 51\ndoes not contemplate special payments of the character here in question, which are not made by way of remuneration for services of a director as a director, but special allowances made on some other ground.\n(Fullerton v. Crawford [10] ).\nIt might also be argued, and with great force, that the true purpose and effect of the directors' resolution was to appoint the respondent general manager at the remuneration fixed, which it was within their power to do, and to delegate to him, qua director, their powers, which they were also enabled to do under Art. 68 of Table A. Under the circumstances, the name \"managing director\" may well have been used as a convenient and comprehensive description of the respondent's position as general manager exercising the powers of the directorate, qua delegated director, and the remuneration voted may not have required the sanction prescribed by clause 51 of the articles of association.\nBut the appellant having failed to raise any such point either in its statement of defence or in its notice of appeal, it should not be permitted to urge it for the first time before this court. If such an objection had been taken at the trial it would have been open to the respondent to show several reasons why it was not available to the appellant company. It is significant that neither in the special notice calling the shareholders together in extraordinary general meeting for the purpose of removing the respondent from office, nor in the letter notifying him of his dismissal as \"manager\" (sic) was this matter mentioned. The appellant appears to have treated the respondent throughout as if entitled to be paid; and, under all the circumstances of the case, it was necessary that a defence of that kind be clearly raised in the pleadings, so that the plaintiff should be squarely faced with the difficulty and given full opportunity of meeting it.\nThis ground of defence is therefore not open now to the appellant company and, as it has failed to make good its other grounds of appeal, our conclusion is in agreement with that reached by the courts below.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Having given all the consideration possible to the argument of counsel as well as factum for appellant I reached the conclusion that even if the respondent exceeded his actual powers in giving the chattel mortgage complained of to the bank to secure its arrears due and that under a pressing urgency, to save the appellant from possible disaster, and being advised by a member of the bar who happened to be secretary-treasurer of the company appellant there was no justification for the dismissal.\nThere may have been an error of judgment but no such misconduct as entitled, on the facts presented herein, the summary dismissal of respondent.\nI have never forgotten the fact that it was a general manager the directors had, by formal resolution, decided to ap point evidently meaning a manager of well known business capacity.\nAfter that was unanimously carried and a director nominated in strict accordance with the term \"general manager\", the director so nominated withdrew for private reasons.\nSomeone, instead of adhering to the terms of foregoing resolution, quite accidentally, I imagine, in nominating the respondent, erred out of courtesy no doubt and failing to realize the possible distinction in law between a general manager and a managing director, it passed.\nI, under all such circumstances, construe that as \"a general manager\" and quite believe nothing further was intended.\nI have, since coming to the foregoing conclusion, received a copy of my brother Rinfret's judgment herein and in the main agree with his reasoning, and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1924] 20 Alta.

L. having been declared bankrupt, his son, A.L., pretended that he had taken possession of a certain piece of land and had cultivated it by virtue of an authorization given by E.L., accompanied with a verbal undertaking by the latter to donate it to him. A.L. entered an action against the trustee of his father's bankrupt estate, declaring that he was abandoning the ownership of the piece of land in question, but claiming from the estate the value of his improvements thereon and praying for a declaration that, until he had been paid for same, he was entitled to retain the land in his possession.\nOn the municipal valuation roll, the father was entered as owner and the son as lessee of the Land in question. Not only had they never contested the entries thus made but the father had paid the municipal and school taxes as owner; while the son, having been sued for taxes due by him as lessee, had acquiesced and paid them. The insurance premiums were paid by the father, who, moreover, had always included the land as part of his assets in the financial statements which he handed over to his bankers. The father had granted a hypothec on the same land to one D.P.; and the land appeared in the father's name in the registry office.\nIn addition to that, on two successive occasions, the son had accepted hypothecary obligations from his father on the same land, thus acknowledging his father's ownership in deeds signed by him.\nHeld that, under the above circumstances, even if the conversation alleged to have been exchanged between the father and the son, when the latter took possession of the land, meant anything more than a vague promise or expectancy that the son would eventually become the owner of the said land (which was by no means certain), the conduct of the father and of the son was inconsistent with the idea that anything had taken place of a nature to vest in the son a \"juste titre\" sufficient to constitute him possessor in good faith within the meaning of art. 412 C.C.\nAt all events, verbal evidence of the alleged verbal gift should not be accepted to prevail in favour of the son as against the rights of the creditors of the father, and to give to his possession the character of good faith necessary to enable him to claim the benefit of the privilege granted by art. 417 C.C.\nHeld that a possessor, even in good faith, who has made any valuable improvements to a lot of land, cannot, under art. 417 C.C., bring a substantive action for the payment either of the value or of the cost of such improvements, nor to have his droit de retention determined; but he is entitled to raise such claims only when he is troubled in his possession and an attempt is made to evict him.\nHeld that the rights given to the possessor by art. 417 C.C. afford merely means of defence (\"moyens d'exception\") and may not be asserted until the real owner endeavours to revendicate the land (\"fonds\").\nHeld that the \"title\" which a possessor must hold in order to be considered \"in good faith,\" under art. 412 C.C., is not necessarily a deed or even a writing, but connotes the cause (\"cause\") which forms the basis of his right of possession. Moreover, it requires a title purporting to transfer ownership (\"translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9\"), which alone constitutes what is known as \"juste titre.\"\nHeld that a possessor in good faith is not obliged to cause his \"droit de r\u00e9tention\" to be registered in order to claim the benefit of art. 417 C.C. against the creditors of the owner.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 37 K.B. 376) reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nL\u00e9on Faribault K.C. for the appellant.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Anglin C.

Gagnon, syndic, de vendre, d'annoncer en vente la susdite propri\u00e9t\u00e9; * * *\nCe sont l\u00e0 les conclusions essentielles de l'action, qui n'y ajoutent que sous forme d'introduction la demande qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 est possesseur de bonne foi et que les am\u00e9liorations qu'il a faites sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires.\nCette intention de vente manifest\u00e9e par le syndic \u00e9tait donc la v\u00e9ritable raison d'\u00eatre de l'action. Chose \u00e9trange: malgr\u00e9 que le syndic e\u00fbt, par plaidoyer \u00e9crit, ni\u00e9 qu'il e\u00fbt cette intention, cette question principale a \u00e9t\u00e9, par la suite, compl\u00e8tement perdue de vue. L'on n'en trouve plus aucune trace dans tout le reste des proc\u00e9dures; et le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi (qui infirme celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure), constate que l'appelant n'a pas fait la preuve de l'avis de vente qu'il all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par le syndic \u00e0 la faillite d'Edouard Loublier\net ne maintient les conclusions de l'action qu'en faisant exception sp\u00e9ciale pour \"la partie relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de vente ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e,\" dont il d\u00e9clare qu'il \"n'y a pas lieu de s'occuper\".\nMais c'est que justement, s'il n'y a plus lieu de s'occuper de l'intention qu'on pr\u00eatait au syndic de vendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l'on peut se demander s'il subsiste un int\u00e9r\u00eat quelconque dans l'action de l'intim\u00e9. Il n'est pas tr\u00e8s facile de comprendre pourquoi l'intim\u00e9, en possession de la terre sur laquelle il d\u00e9clarait avoir fait certaines constructions et des travaux de d\u00e9frichement et dont il all\u00e9guait \u00eatre le propri\u00e9taire en vertu d'une donation verbale de son p\u00e8re, a cru devoir courir au-devant de ce proc\u00e8s, renoncer lui-m\u00eame au titre de propri\u00e9taire avant qu'on le lui contest\u00e2t, et s'adresser aux tribunaux pour obtenir un jugement d\u00e9claratoire \u00e0 l'effet qu'il \u00e9tait possesseur de bonne foi, qu'il avait fait des am\u00e9liorations n\u00e9cessaires et qu'il avait droit de retenir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il en f\u00fbt indemnis\u00e9. Il est \u00e9vident que la base de ces conclusions r\u00e9side dans l'article 417 du code civil. Or, cet article suppose que le propri\u00e9taire a \u00e9mis des pr\u00e9tentions aux am\u00e9liorations faites par le possesseur. Il fournit au possesseur ce qui para\u00eet \u00eatre essentiellement un moyen de d\u00e9fense. Il ne lui conf\u00e8re aucun droit de se faire payer ses am\u00e9liorations, tant que le propri\u00e9taire du fonds ne les r\u00e9clame pas. Comme le dit Laurent (vol. 6, n\u00b0 271) en commentant l'article 555 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui correspond \u00e0 l'article 417 C.C.,\nil s'agit d'un tiers \u00e9vinc\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire d'un tiers qui poss\u00e8de comme propri\u00e9taire, soit de bonne, soit de mauvaise foi, contre lequel le propri\u00e9taire revendique son fonds. Donc, quand le propri\u00e9taire agit, non en revendication, mais par une action personnelle naissant d'un lien d'obligation, nous ne sommes plus dans le texte de l'article 555. Et l'esprit de la loi n'est pas non plus applicable * * * car ce n'est pas un article de principes; il d\u00e9roge, au contraire, aux principes par des consid\u00e9rations d'\u00e9quit\u00e9; c'est donc une disposition sp\u00e9ciale, qui, par la nature des choses, doit \u00eatre renferm\u00e9e dans le cas pour lequel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nCela revient \u00e0 dire qu'un possesseur peut, dans les hypoth\u00e8ses de l'article 417 C.C., opposer, \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire qui revendique l'immeuble, la valeur ou le co\u00fbt des am\u00e9liorations dont il a droit d'\u00eatre rembours\u00e9; mais qu'il ne saurait, par une sorte d'action provocatoire, d\u00e9clarer qu'il en abandonne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et forcer son propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 entrer dans un d\u00e9bat judiciaire pour \u00e9tablir le montant que ce propri\u00e9taire sera oblig\u00e9 de payer pour les am\u00e9liorations, lorsqu'il jugera \u00e0 propos de les revendiquer.\nCe d\u00e9bat est d'autant plus inutile, que le code pourvoit \u00e0 toute une s\u00e9rie d'options en faveur du propri\u00e9taire dont Tune est qu'il peut\nforcer le tiers \u00e0 retenir le terrain en en payant la valeur suivant estimation\n(418 C.C.) et qu'il est \u00e9videmment oiseux de s'enqu\u00e9rir, \u00e0 la demande du possesseur, du montant qu'aurait \u00e0 lui payer le propri\u00e9taire, lorsqu'il appartient exclusivement \u00e0 ce dernier de d\u00e9cider d'abord s'il revendiquera son terrain. Il est clair que s'il ne le fait pas, le possesseur n'aura droit de rien r\u00e9clamer et que ce dernier, dans les circonstances sp\u00e9ciales auxquelles pourvoit l'article 417 C.C., n'a pas d'action directe pour le co\u00fbt de ses am\u00e9liorations. En l'absence de toutes pr\u00e9tentions de la part du propri\u00e9taire du fonds, le possesseur reste en possession et tout est dit.\nC'est l'effet de l'arr\u00eat re Montgomery v. McKenzie[2]. Ce jugement dit:\u2014\nAnd considering further that if plaintiff has as a person in good faith made any valuable improvements to said lot of land, he is entitled, when any attempt is made to evict him, to a droit de r\u00e9tention thereof until paid for the same, but cannot, until troubled in the possession thereof, bring, as he has done by his alternative conclusions, a substantive action to have such right determined, doth dismiss plaintiff's action with costs distraits, * * * reserving to plaintiff any rights he may have for any useful and valuable improvements he may have made on said lot over and above the value of the rents, issues and profits thereof since his occupation of said lot.\nLe juge-en-chef Johnson, parlant pour la Cour de Revision, qui a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, dit \u00e0 la page 477:\n* * * it is enough to make him possessor in good faith, and give him a right to his betterments, when proceedings are taken to evict him, for he has possession, and will have a right of retention till they are paid.\nVoir aussi Reed v. Belavance[3].\nD\u00e9pouill\u00e9 de son motif d\u00e9terminant : l'annonce d'une vente par le syndic, cette action manquait donc v\u00e9ritablement de fondement l\u00e9gal. Mais le syndic a, quand m\u00eame, engag\u00e9 la discussion sur les pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9. Il a contest\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re de sa possession et la nature de ses am\u00e9liorations; il lui a ni\u00e9 son droit de r\u00e9tention et il a demand\u00e9 le rejet pur et simple de l'action, sans toutefois, dans son plaidoyer, opter pour aucune des alternatives que les articles 417 et 418 C.C. laissent \u00e0 son choix.\nCette mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der de part et d'autre aurait certainement donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une foule de difficult\u00e9s si nous avions cru devoir concourir avec le jugement rendu par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui consiste \u00e0 dire que l'intim\u00e9 a droit d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 d'une somme de $4,700 et que, pour garantir le paiement de cette somme, il a droit de retenir la possession de l'immeuble du mis-en-cause.\nComme il s'agit seulement d'am\u00e9liorations utiles, mais non n\u00e9cessaires; comme, par ailleurs, la preuve d\u00e9montre surabondamment que ces am\u00e9liorations exc\u00e8dent de beaucoup la valeur du fonds; qu'elles sont, en proportion, tellement consid\u00e9rables et dispendieuses que le syndic pourrait bien n'avoir aucun d\u00e9sir de les rembourser, mais, au contraire, d\u00e9cider qu'il est de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des cr\u00e9anciers de forcer l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 retenir le terrain en en payant la valeur, nous n'aurions pu, comme l'a fait la Cour du Banc du Roi, juger que l'intim\u00e9 avait droit d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 de $4,700 et l'autoriser \u00e0 rester en possession jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il f\u00fbt ainsi indemnis\u00e9; il nous e\u00fbt fallu assurer \u00e0 l'appelant le choix que la loi elle-m\u00eame lui accorde.\nMais notre \u00e9tude du dossier nous conduit plut\u00f4t \u00e0 adopter les vues de la Court Sup\u00e9rieure, auxquelles se sont ralli\u00e9s deux des juges du tribunal d'appel. Dans les circonstances, suivant la suggestion du juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, il vaut mieux sans doute envisager les proc\u00e9dures comme\nmoyens de faire statuer, avec la faillite comme contradicteur, sur ses droits contre elle relativement aux am\u00e9liorations et aux constructions\nde l'intim\u00e9, afin d'\u00e9viter autant que possible aux parties l'inutilit\u00e9 d'un proc\u00e8s long et dispendieux.\nNous devions cependant indiquer que les droits du possesseur en vertu de l'article 417 C.C. sont des moyens d'exception \u00e0 l'encontre de l'action en revendication du propri\u00e9taire du fonds, et que, n'ayant pas fait la preuve que le syndic annon\u00e7ait la vente de l'immeuble et des constructions et am\u00e9liorations, l'intim\u00e9, en l'esp\u00e8ce, se trouvait sans motif pour continuer ses proc\u00e9dures.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis\nque la possession du demandeur n'a pas le caract\u00e8re et ne r\u00e9unit pas les conditions prescrites par la loi pour donner ouverture aux droits qu'il r\u00e9clame; (qu'il) s'est \u00e9tabli sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avec la permission de son p\u00e8re, et qu'il ne l'a jamais poss\u00e9d\u00e9 pour lui, animo domini, mais pour son p\u00e8re et \u00e0 titre de locataire ; * * * que le demandeur n'a invoqu\u00e9, ni produit aucun titre qui lui conf\u00e8re la possession ou propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dudit immeuble ou qui peut le justifier de croire qu'il le poss\u00e9dait pour lui et qu'il n'a jamais eu ni titre r\u00e9el, ni titre putatif.\nPour ces raisons et parce que, en outre, elle a trouv\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver que les constructions, am\u00e9liorations et impenses avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par lui, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure l'a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 des conclusions de son action. Deux juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi, en appel, ont partag\u00e9 sa fa\u00e7on de voir, sans toutefois se prononcer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des impenses, am\u00e9liorations et constructions. La majorit\u00e9 de cette cour cependant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait un possesseur de bonne foi, que les constructions et le d\u00e9frichement avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par lui, qu'ils repr\u00e9sentaient une plus-value de $4,700, que l'intim\u00e9 avait droit d'en \u00eatre pay\u00e9 et que, pour garantir ce remboursement, il avait droit de retenir la possession de l'immeuble.\nIl para\u00eet donc y avoir deux points \u00e0 d\u00e9cider: par qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites les am\u00e9liorations? Quelle est la position juridique de l'intim\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 ces am\u00e9liorations?\nAvec la Cour du Banc du Roi, nous pensons que la maison, la grange et la bergerie mentionn\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9claration ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construites par l'intim\u00e9 de ses deniers. Il est vrai que son p\u00e8re a pu requ\u00e9rir les services de certains ouvriers et payer certaines d\u00e9penses, mais ces derni\u00e8res furent charg\u00e9es \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 dans un compte tenu \u00e0 cet effet et qui se soldait par une balance en faveur de l'intim\u00e9.\nNous ne voyons pas non plus d'objection s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 adopter les chiffres de la Cour du Banc du Roi pour en fixer le montant. Il est vrai que la preuve sur laquelle ils sont bas\u00e9s ne parle que de la valeur actuelle et que le syndic, s'il veut les retenir, a le choix de ne payer que ce qu'elles ont co\u00fbt\u00e9. Il est peu probable toutefois que ces constructions aient augment\u00e9 de valeur. La supposition contraire est m\u00eame plus plausible, car l'augmentation dans le co\u00fbt des mat\u00e9riaux doit \u00eatre compens\u00e9e par la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration et la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation des constructions elles-m\u00eames. En outre, le syndic a eu l'opportunit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour offrir lui-m\u00eame une preuve contraire \u00e0 celle de l'intim\u00e9; et l'un des moyens de faire valoir ses pr\u00e9tentions \u00e9tait d'\u00e9tablir le co\u00fbt des constructions par opposition \u00e0 la preuve de leur valeur actuelle.\nDans les circonstances, nous ne voyons pas quel int\u00e9r\u00eat les parties auraient \u00e0 r\u00e9ouvrir le d\u00e9bat quant \u00e0 cette estimation; et, suivant le d\u00e9sir exprim\u00e9 plus haut de permettre \u00e0 l'appelant et \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de tirer parti, autant que possible, du proc\u00e8s qu'ils ont engag\u00e9, nous croyons devoir arr\u00eater l'estimation des constructions aux chiffres \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les notes du juge Rivard: la maison \u00e0 $2,500; la grange \u00e0 $600; la bergerie \u00e0 $50; total, $3,150. Ces sommes devront \u00eatre prises comme base dans les n\u00e9gociations ult\u00e9rieures entre les parties.\nQuant aux travaux de d\u00e9frichement et de culture, l'intim\u00e9 a clairement prouv\u00e9 que seuls lui-m\u00eame ou ses employ\u00e9s y avaient pris part. Mais nous ne trouvons rien dans la preuve pour fixer d'une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante la plus-value qu'ils ont donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'immeuble.\nCes travaux de d\u00e9frichement sont d'ailleurs d'une nature diff\u00e9rente des constructions. Voir l'\u00e9tude tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te de cette question et les notes \u00e0 la suite, dans la cause des Mathieu v. Berthiaume[4].\nLes articles 415 et 416 du Code Civil emploient les expressions \"constructions, plantations et ouvrages\", tandis que l'article 417 C.C. se sert du mot \"am\u00e9liorations\".\nD\u00e8s l'apparition du code, on s'est demand\u00e9 s'il fallait faire une distinction entre ces expressions. Les constructions ne sont pas, \u00e0 proprement parler, des am\u00e9liorations, mais des additions; elles ne s'identifient pas, ni ne s'incorporent au fonds comme des r\u00e9parations ou des travaux de d\u00e9frichement ou de culture. On peut enlever des constructions ; mais on ne con\u00e7oit pas qu'on puisse enlever des r\u00e9parations ou des am\u00e9liorations. (Laurent, vol. 6, p. 351).\nA cause de cela, nous nous contentons de d\u00e9cider que c'est l'intim\u00e9 qui a fait les travaux de d\u00e9frichement et de culture, mais nous ne pouvons fixer la plus-value qu'ils ont donn\u00e9e au terrain; et la meilleure solution nous para\u00eet \u00eatre celle qui est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par le juge Dorion: les droits respectifs des parties pourront \u00eatre \u00e9tablis comme ceux de tout autre cr\u00e9ancier sur r\u00e9clamation produite par l'intim\u00e9 dans la faillite. Il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la position juridique de l'intim\u00e9 relativement aux constructions et au d\u00e9frichement qu'il a faits, ou, en d'autres termes, \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s'il \u00e9tait un possesseur de bonne ou de mauvaise foi.\nIl s'agit ici, bien entendu, de la bonne foi l\u00e9gale, c'est-\u00e0-dire de la bonne foi telle qu'elle est d\u00e9finie par la loi; et\nil faut laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la notion ordinaire de la bonne foi, qui pourrait varier beaucoup d'apr\u00e8s les sentiments et les id\u00e9es, pour s'en tenir \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du code. Aubry & Rau, t. II, p. 268 et note 5.\n(Laurent, vol. 6, p. 278).\nLes am\u00e9liorations faites par l'intim\u00e9, tout le monde s'accorde \u00e0 le dire, n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires, mais simplement utiles, et il importe absolument, en cons\u00e9quence, de rechercher si, lorsqu'il les a faites, il \u00e9tait de bonne ou de mauvaise foi, puisque, suivant le cas, sa situation l\u00e9gale sera diff\u00e9rente et il aura ou n'aura pas le droit de r\u00e9tention.\nL'appelant soul\u00e8ve bien le point pr\u00e9liminaire que l'intim\u00e9 n'a fait enregistrer aucun privil\u00e8ge et il invoque l'article 2015 C.C.:\nEntre les cr\u00e9anciers, les privil\u00e8ges ne produisent d'effet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des immeubles qu'autant qu'ils sont publics, en la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et sauf les exceptions contenues au titre de l'enregistrement des droits r\u00e9els.\nOn peut ajouter que le droit que r\u00e9clame maintenant l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas mentionn\u00e9 parmi ceux qui \"sont exempts des formalit\u00e9s de l'enregistrement\" dans l'article 2084 C.C.\nD'autre part, si le droit de r\u00e9tention peut sans doute correspondre \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du privil\u00e8ge telle qu'on la trouve \u00e0 l'article 1983 C.C., il est reconnu comme privil\u00e8ge sur les biens meubles (1994 C.C) mais il ne figure pas dans l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration des cr\u00e9ances privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es sur les immeubles donn\u00e9e par l'article 2009 C.C.\nNous sommes d'ailleurs d'avis que, par sa nature m\u00eame, le droit de r\u00e9tention du possesseur de bonne foi peut, sans enregistrement, \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre des cr\u00e9anciers du propri\u00e9taire. Le texte m\u00eame des articles 417 et 419 C.C. implique que l'enregistrement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu. Il suppose que le possesseur se croyait propri\u00e9taire. On ne con\u00e7oit pas un propri\u00e9taire qui fait enregistrer un privil\u00e8ge ou un droit de r\u00e9tention sur son propre terrain.\nL'appelant nous r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 un arr\u00eat de cette cour (Great Eastern Railway v. Lambe[5]) et, dans cette cause, \u00e0 certains passages du jugement de l'honorable juge Taschereau (pp. 442 et 444) parlant au nom de la cour. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'un contrat de nantissement (\"lien or pledge\") que l'on a refus\u00e9 de faire pr\u00e9valoir contre les droits de cr\u00e9anciers ant\u00e9rieurs, qui invoquaient le d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement. Le cas est tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent de celui qui nous occupe et, comme par hasard, un des aspects de la distinction est soulign\u00e9 par l'honorable juge Taschereau lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 la page 444:\nHere also, it moist be remarked, it is not the disbursements incidental to their possession that the appellants claim, but the very debt for which the pledge has been given to them\nLe titre sur lequel un possesseur se fonde pour \u00e9tablir sa bonne foi et son droit de r\u00e9tention pour le paiement de ses impenses n'est pas soumis \u00e0 la formalit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement. (Dalloz, R\u00e9p. vo. Propri\u00e9t\u00e9, n\u00b0 440.\u2014Chinic Hardware Co. v. Dame Laurent[6]. Nous ne voyons pas en quoi le droit de r\u00e9tention du possesseur de bonne foi diff\u00e8re, sur cette question d'enregistrement, de celui du mandataire pour la cr\u00e9ance r\u00e9sultant de ses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s. Or, la Cour du Banc du Roi, dans la cause de Eddy v. Eddy[7] a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que\nce droit de r\u00e9tention ne l'autorise pas \u00e0 faire enregistrer, contre l'immeuble qu'il d\u00e9tient, un avis d\u00e9non\u00e7ant au public ce privil\u00e8ge qui n'est pas sujet \u00e0 enregistrement et dont le montant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli contradictoirement.\nEt cet arr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9[8].\nLe possesseur de bonne foi peut donc, sans qu'il l'ait fait enregistrer, invoquer son droit de r\u00e9tention, m\u00eame \u00e0 rencontre des cr\u00e9anciers du mis-en-cause qui sont ici repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le syndic.\nPassons donc \u00e0 la question du caract\u00e8re de la possession de l'intim\u00e9.\nL'on est d'accord pour dire que la bonne foi dont parle l'article 417 C.C. est celle qui est d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l'article 412 C.C.:\nLe possesseur est de bonne foi lorsqu'il poss\u00e8de en vertu d'un titre dont il ignore les vices.\nSi le mot \"titre\" voulait dire un acte ou un \u00e9crit, il ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire de pousser plus loin l'investigation, car l'intim\u00e9 n'a ni acte, ni \u00e9crit. Mais, avec le juge Rivard, qui s'appuie sur Baudry-Lacantinerie (Des Biens, n\u00b0 294), nous sommes d'avis que le mot titre ne d\u00e9signe pas un \u00e9crit, mais bien la cause en vertu de laquelle le possesseur d\u00e9tient la chose.\nC'est aussi le sens du jugement de cette cour dans la cause de St. Lawrence Terminal Company v. Halle[9] et de celui du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Price v. Neault[10].\nM\u00eame en entendant \"titre\" dans le sens qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la loi exige toutefois un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, sans quoi \"il ne peut servir de base \u00e0 la bonne foi\" (Mignault, vol. 2, pp. 484 et 485).\nC'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l'existence de ce que les auteurs appellent ce \"juste titre\" qui nous para\u00eet ici faire d\u00e9faut. Le juge du proc\u00e8s et deux juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas un possesseur de bonne foi. Nous nous rangeons de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nUn titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est une vente, un legs, une donation, etc. C'est ce dernier titre que l'intim\u00e9 invoque dans sa d\u00e9claration :\nLe mis-en-cause Edouard Loubier, le p\u00e8re du demandeur, donna verbalement * * *\nL'intim\u00e9 se heurte d'abord \u00e0 l'article 776 du code:\nLes actes portant donations entrevifs doivent \u00eatre notari\u00e9s et porter minute, \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9. L'acceptation doit avoir lieu en la m\u00eame forme.\nL'intim\u00e9 voudrait donc appuyer la bonne foi de sa possession sur un titre absolument nul. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans cette cause de Montgomery v. McKenzie[11] que le juge-en-chef Johnson dit \u00e0 la page 477:\nA promise to give land such as I hold was made here, though all the judges do not even go the length that I do upon the facts, is one to which no legal effect can be given. Our art. 776 C.C., is decisive upon the point. Our law and the law of France have both departed from the rule of the Roman law, which allowed donations scriptis vel non scriptis. The article of the French code analogous to our art. 776 is 931 C.N. Upon this article I would refer to Demolombe, Donations, vol. 3, nos. 8, 9 and 10.\nAdmettons cependant que l'article 412 C.C. soit assez large pour couvrir m\u00eame un vice r\u00e9sultant d'une nullit\u00e9 absolue, encore est-il\nde l'essence de la donation faite pour avoir effet entrevifs, que le donateur se dessaisse actuellement de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la chose donn\u00e9e (art. 177 C.C.).\nOr, il nous serait impossible de donner cet effet aux paroles \u00e9chang\u00e9es entre le p\u00e8re et le fils, lorsque ce dernier est venu demeurer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 supposer m\u00eame que la preuve testimoniale de ce fait essentiellement juridique soit admissible (Laurent, vol. 6, p. 333). Nous mentionnons la chose parce que le juge du proc\u00e8s n'a permis cette preuve que sous r\u00e9serve.\nSans doute, le p\u00e8re corrobore son fils, bien que les paroles prononc\u00e9es, qui sont rapport\u00e9es \u00e0 plusieurs endroits de la preuve, varient chaque fois qu'il y est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. Mais ces paroles, qui seraient des admissions dans la bouche du p\u00e8re, s'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendeur, ne sont plus qu'une d\u00e9claration int\u00e9ress\u00e9e lorsqu'il se trouve en balance entre son fils et ses cr\u00e9anciers. Or, comme le fait remarquer le juge Dorion,\nc'est une situation tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quente que celle d'un fils occupant un immeuble de son p\u00e8re, sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\nIl ne faut pas trop voir, ici, dans la possession du fils une circonstance qui rende vraisemblable l'existence d'une donation.\nSi toutefois cette preuve testimoniale pouvait \u00eatre admise \u00e0 la faveur d'un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, que nous h\u00e9sitons \u00e0 y trouver, nous r\u00e9p\u00e9tons que, comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et comme les juges dissidents en appel, nous ne pouvons voir dans les paroles plut\u00f4t vagues que le p\u00e8re et le fils pr\u00e9tendent avoir \u00e9chang\u00e9es, rien autre chose qu'une expectative, un espoir que, plus tard, probablement \u00e0 la mort du p\u00e8re, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 finirait par \u00e9cheoir au fils. En certains endroits, les d\u00e9clarations que l'on pr\u00eate au p\u00e8re sont plus pr\u00e9cises; mais c'est l'id\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui se d\u00e9gage des diff\u00e9rentes versions qu'on en a donn\u00e9es.\nAu surplus, l'interpr\u00e9tation que l'intim\u00e9 veut maintenant donner \u00e0 ces paroles, m\u00eame si l'on en admet la preuve, nous para\u00eet d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment incompatible avec la conduite du p\u00e8re et du fils apr\u00e8s que ce dernier f\u00fbt devenu occupant de la terre, et nous ne voyons pas comment il peut \u00eatre permis \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et au mis-en-cause d'opposer leur pr\u00e9tention actuelle \u00e0 l'encontre de leurs actes constants.\nSur le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation municipale, \u00e0 la connaissance du fils, le p\u00e8re \u00e9tait port\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire et le fils comme locataire; et cela depuis 1916 jusqu'\u00e0 la date de l'institution de l'action. Non seulement ils n'ont jamais contest\u00e9 le r\u00f4le, mais le p\u00e8re payait les taxes municipales et scolaires comme propri\u00e9taire, et le fils, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi pour les siennes \u00e0 titre de locataire, acquies\u00e7a et paya. Les primes d'assurance \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es par le p\u00e8re. Ce dernier mentionnait cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme lui appartenant dans l'\u00e9tat financier qu'il remettait aux banques. Il a consenti sur cette m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 une hypoth\u00e8que \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 David Poulin; et elle apparaissait en son nom au bureau d'enregistrement.\nEnfin, nous en arrivons au point o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 se trouve en contradiction avec ses propres \u00e9crits. Le 19 f\u00e9vrier 1917, il a sign\u00e9 un acte o\u00f9 son p\u00e8re lui consentait une hypoth\u00e8que sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question et o\u00f9 il reconnaissait par l\u00e0 que son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire. La m\u00eame chose s'est r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e le 13 octobre 1921. Enfin, il admet avoir fait dans la faillite une \"r\u00e9clamation pour du salaire \", pour son \"travail sur la terre\". V\u00e9ritablement, il a toujours agi comme un d\u00e9tenteur pr\u00e9caire, qui reconnaissait le droit sup\u00e9rieur de son p\u00e8re; et il ne saurait lui \u00eatre permis de prendre apr\u00e8s coup une position diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9e, surtout au d\u00e9triment des cr\u00e9anciers de son p\u00e8re.\nSi \"la bonne foi est la croyance qu'a le possesseur qu'il est r\u00e9ellement propri\u00e9taire \", il nous est impossible, en l'esp\u00e8ce, de concilier cette croyance avec la conduite et les \u00e9crits de l'intim\u00e9 et du mis-en-cause. Nous regrettons seulement d'avoir d\u00fb nous en expliquer aussi longuement.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que nous sommes d'accord avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et deux des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Comme eux, nous croyons que l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas un possesseur de bonne foi au sens de l'article 417 C.C. et qu'il ne peut par cons\u00e9quent r\u00e9clamer le droit de r\u00e9tention. Les conclusions de son action \u00e9taient prises dans le but de faire d\u00e9clarer qu'il \u00e9tait possesseur de bonne foi, que les am\u00e9liorations faites par lui \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires, qu'il avait le droit de retenir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'au paiement de ces am\u00e9liorations et d'obtenir de la cour un ordre d\u00e9fendant au syndic autoris\u00e9 de vendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avant d'avoir fait ce paiement. Aucune de ces conclusions ne pouvait \u00eatre maintenue; et c'est donc avec raison que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 des fins de son action.\nCependant, anxieux de donner aux parties tout le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu'il est possible de tirer du litige, nous croyons pouvoir traiter l'action du demandeur pro tanto comme une r\u00e9clamation produite par l'intim\u00e9 entre les mains du syndic autoris\u00e9, et nous d\u00e9clarons que la maison, la grange et la bergerie, que nous estimons \u00e0 $3,150, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construites par l'intim\u00e9, de m\u00eame que les travaux de d\u00e9frichement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par lui. Cette d\u00e9claration fera partie du jugement de la cour et sera de nature \u00e0 aider, dans une certaine mesure, au r\u00e8glement de la r\u00e9clamation de l'intim\u00e9. Comme l'enqu\u00eate en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure se trouve par l\u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 utile aux parties, nous croyons l\u00e9gitime que chaque partie en paie sa part respective.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, nous maintenons l'appel; et, sauf les d\u00e9clarations ci-dessus qui devront \u00eatre ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision de la cour, nous r\u00e9tablissons le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance avec d\u00e9pens contre l'intim\u00e9 dans toutes les cours, sauf que chacun paiera ses frais d'enqu\u00eate en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, et sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits respectifs de l'appelant \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 et de l'intim\u00e9, tel qu'il est plus haut expliqu\u00e9.\nIdington J.

M. Petrie imported beer into Sydney, N.S., which was seized by respondent Rideout, inspector, under the N.S. Temperance Act and Petrie was convicted by respondent Muggah, stipendiary magistrate, of a violation of the Act. The beer was ordered to be destroyed but appellant brought action to replevy it and obtaining judgment at the trial regained its possession. This judgment was reversed on appeal to the Supreme Court en banc but no order was made for a return of the beer or damages for its detention nor was such order asked for. An action was then brought against appellants on the replevin bond claiming a return of the beer or damages and at the trial before Mr. Justice Rogers judgment was given for respondents for $3,000 the beer having been sold or otherwise disposed of. By consent of parties an appeal was taken from this judgment directly to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the appellants. The defendant has satisfied the judgment against him and is no further liable. See The Queen v. Cameron[1]; Wright v. Reeves[2]; and Bauld v. Velcoff[3].\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the appellants.\nW. F. O'Connor K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (the Chief Justice and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The respondents (plaintiffs) recovered judgment in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against the appellants (defendants) for $3,000 damages for breach of the condition of a replevin bond, given in an action brought against them in the same court by the appellant, William M. Petrie, wherein he had caused to be replevied a quantity of light beer of the value of $3,000, as stated in his affidavit, which was made to lead the replevin order. By the obligation of the bond the appellants are bound jointly and severally to George B. Ingraham, Sheriff of the county of Cape Breton, in the penal sum of $6,000. There is a recital that the appellant, William M. Petrie, had obtained an order for replevin against the respondents to obtain possession of 137 barrels of beer, which he asserts to be his property, and the condition is expressed in the following terms:\nNow the condition of this obligation is such that if the said William M. Petrie shall prosecute his suit in which the said order was made, with effect and without delay, or if the suit is carried on and continued between the said William M. Petrie and Fred G. Muggah and George R. Rideout touching the said goods, and the court shall adjudge that the goods shall be restored to the Fred G. Muggah and George R. Rideout, with damages for detaining the same, then if the said William M. Petrie shall restore the said goods and pay and satisfy any judgment that may be obtained against him, as well as any other costs which the said George B. Ingraham may incur by virtue or on account of this suit, or of the said replevin, then this bond shall be void otherwise to remain in full force and virtue\nThe respondents by their statement of claim alleged that although the appellant, William M. Petrie, succeeded at the trial of the action of replevin, the judgment was reversed on appeal and the action dismissed by the Supreme Court en banc; moreover that the last mentioned judgment dismissing the action was affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of Canada; the respondents alleged as breaches of the bond that:\nThe defendants have not restored the said goods to the plaintiffs nor any part thereof, as adjudged by the said decisions, nor paid, nor satisfied the plaintiff for damages for detaining the same.\nThen it was further alleged by the statement of claim that the sheriff had assigned the bond to the plaintiffs, who had served notice of assignment upon the defendants, but that\nthe defendants have refused and neglected to restore the said goods, or to satisfy the judgment obtained against the said defendant, William M. Petrie,\nand the plaintiffs claimed\nreturn of the said goods set out in the statement of claim; damages for detention of same; payment of the value of the said goods, namely, $3,000;\nother relief as the court might order, and costs of the action.\nAt the trial it was admitted that the defendant, William M. Petrie, imported a car of beer containing 137 barrels which was marked \"Ale and Porter\" and that the car arrived at Sydney 30th April, 1921; that the plaintiff, Ride- out, was inspector under the Nova Scotia Temperance Act for the city of Sydney at the time, but had since left the city, and was at the time of the trial residing at Moncton; that the defendant, Muggah, was Stipendary Magistrate for the city of Sydney; that the plaintiff, Rideout, secured a search warrant and seized the 137 barrels of beer which he placed in the city warehouse, and laid information against the defendant, William M. Petrie, for importing the liquor contrary to the provisions of the Dominion Act, c. 19 of 1916; that the hearing of the prosecution began on 12th May and continued with several adjournments until 13th June, and that on 26th June, 1921, the magistrate convicted the defendant, William M. Petrie, and ordered that the beer should be destroyed; that the defendant, William M. Petrie, in the meantime, on 14th June, brought his action for replevin, gave the bond in question and caused the 137 barrels of beer to be replevied; that the action was not brought to trial until the June term of 1922, and that in the interval the County Court judge quashed the conviction against the defendant, William M. Petrie; that the trial judge decided the action in favour of the plaintiff, and that the appeal from his decision was heard in November, 1922, and allowed; that the costs of the action and of the appeals were paid by the defendant, William M. Petrie, prior to the commencement of the action upon the bond, but that he did not return the goods nor pay the value of them.\nThe appellant, William M. Petrie, testified that he had received from the sheriff in the replevin action 137 barrels of beer; that he had stored it pending the trial of the action; that while in storage about half of the quantity was frozen; that five or six barrels were stolen; that, after the judgment which he recovered at the trial, he had sold the remainder at retail or wholesale, the price at the former rate being 20 cents per bottle, and at the latter rate $20 per barrel, and that thus all the beer was disposed of in 1922 or in 1923; he says moreover that the beer being of a light variety would not keep indefinitely, but would turn sour. He estimates that the saleable quantity, upon which he realized, was 55 or 60 barrels.\nIn the replevin action the defendants did not claim return of the goods or damages, but they justified the taking, Ride-out as Inspector under the Nova Scotia Temperance Act for the city of Sydney, and Muggah, as the Stipendiary Magistrate for the same place, and they alleged that the beer was lawfully in their custody, in their respective capacities, as officers of the law. The case is reported upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc under the name of Petrie v. Rideout[4]. The judgment of the court was pronounced by Chisholm J., who came to the conclusion to allow the appeal and dismiss the plaintiffs' action for reasons which are stated as follows:\u2014\nThe beer having been properly brought before the magistrate\u2014as I think it was, the rule laid down in Lavie v. Hill[5], and The Mayflower Bottling Co. v. McCormick[6], that the magistrate should have a reasonable time within which to deal with the charge in the information has, I think, application. There is nothing in the case to shew that there was any undue delay on the part of the magistrate. When the action was commenced and the order to replevy was issued, the beer was in the custody of the court. The plaintiff was not entitled to possession of it, and the action was not maintainable. When he commenced his action he had, in short, no cause of action. The claim must be tried with reference to the state of things as they then existed, and not as they developed later. The action should be dismissed with costs to be paid to the defendants by both plaintiffs, and the defendants should have judgment for said costs when taxed. This decision does not in any way affect the judgment of the learned county court judge so far as the latter quashes the conviction. His decision is final as regards the conviction.\nFrom this judgment the plaintiff, William M. Petrie, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and upon the appeal it was adjudged that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc should be affirmed, and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was thus in the replevin action no judgment either for return of the goods or for damages for their detention; but there was upon the appeal an affirmation of the finality of the judgment of the county court quashing the conviction.\nThe action of replevin in the province of Nova Scotia was formerly regulated by c. 94 of the Revised Statutes, 4th series, respecting pleadings and practice in the Supreme Court, ss. 329 to 345, and it was provided by s. 2 of this chapter that the practice and proceedings of the court should conform as nearly as might be to the practice and proceedings of the superior courts of common law in force previous to the first year of the reign of King William IV, and that in all cases where the proceedings and practice of the superior courts of common law in England differ from each other those of the Court of Queen's Bench should prevail. Afterwards when the Judicature Act was enacted, followed by the adoption of the English Rules of 1883, which, with modifications, were brought into force in Nova Scotia on 1st October, 1884, the former statutory provisions with regard to replevin were embodied in these rules as Order XLV, comprising nine rules corresponding mutatis mutandis to ss. 331 to 336 inclusive, and 343 of the Practice, as enacted by c. 94 of the Revised Statutes, 4th series; and it was provided by s. 44 of the Judicature Act that, save as by that Act, or the Rules of Court, otherwise provided, the forms and methods of procedure which, immediately preceding 1st October, 1884, were in force, and not inconsistent with the Judicature Act, or any Rules of Court, should, as nearly as might be, continue to be used and practised in the Supreme Court in such and the like cases, and for such and the like purposes, as would have been applicable in the Supreme Court prior to that date. Thus the former practice respecting replevin, in so far as it is adapted to the general policy of the new rules of procedure, remains in force, and therefore the practice should now conform to the rules as adopted in 1884, and, in matters not therein provided for, to the former practice, so far as not inconsistent with the new rules.\nIt is provided by Rule 4 of Order XLV, which corresponds to section 333 (in part) of the former practice, that the sheriff shall not serve the order for delivery until he shall have replevied the property; and, by the next following rule, which is also derived from s. 333, that before replevying he shall take a bond in double the value of the property to be replevied as stated in the order, and that \"the bond may be in Form No. 51 in Appendix 'K,' with such variations as circumstances require.\" This form is reproduced as follows:\nWhereas, the said A. B., has obtained an order for replevin against C. D. to obtain possession of certain cattle (or goods) to wit..\u2026 which the said A. B. asserts to be his property.\nNow, the condition of this obligation is such, that if the said A. B. shall not prosecute his suit in which the said order was made, with effect and without delay, or, if suit is carried on and continued between the said A. B. and C. D. touching the property of the said cattle (or goods), and the court shall adjudge that the said cattle (or goods) shall be restored to the said C. D. with damages for detaining the same, then if the said A. B. shall restore the said cattle (or goods) and pay and satisfy any judgment that may be obtained against him, this bond shall become void.\nThere is no express requirement in the body of the statute or rules as to what the condition of the bond shall be, except the clause quoted from Rule 5 that the bond may be in that form, with such variations as circumstances require; but it will be observed that the form set out in the appendix contemplates that the court may adjudge not only a return of the goods to the defendant, but also damages for detaining the same.\nThe form does not in anywise contradict any enactment of the statute or of the rules; it is as much a part of them as any other part, Attorney General v. Lamplough[7], and it clearly evidences an intention to adhere to the former practice under which a successful defendant in replevin was generally entitled not only to a return of the goods, but also to recover damages for their detention. It is laid down in Tidd's Practice, 9th ed. 993, that upon a judgment in replevin for defendant the execution at common law is for a return of the goods; to which damages are superadded by the statutes of 7 Henry VIII, c. 4, s. 3, and 21 Henry VIII, c. 19, s. 3, or upon the statute 17 Car. II, c. 7, for the arrearages of rent, and costs; and, at page 1038, that\nwhen judgment is given on demurrer, for a return of the goods the avowant may immediately have a writ of retorno habendo, and inquiry of damages; and after verdict, or inquiry executed, he may have a retorno habendo, and fieri facias for the damages and costs, in the same writ.\nIn an anonymous case reported in 2 Mod. 199,\nit was the opinion of North, Chief Justice, that in replevin both parties are actors; for the one sues for damages and the other to have the cattle.\nBacon's Abridgement, vide tit. Replevin and Avowry. Therefore it is well stated in Mayne on Damages, 9th ed. 414 that:\nThe action of replevin is an anomalous one, in this respect, that both plaintiff and defendant are actors in the suit. In fact it consists of two cross actions; in which one party claims damages for having his goods seized, while the other party claims satisfaction for some demand out of which the seizure arose. One result of this peculiarity is that either party may obtain damages.\nAnd that this is true with regard to the action as regulated by the Nova Scotia Practice I see no reason to doubt. Comparison of the bond executed in the case with the form prescribed by the rule shews that the former contains some additions which perhaps are not material, principally a clause affording indemnity to the sheriff for any costs which he may incur on account of the suit. In Jackson v. Hanson[8], the form of the condition of a replevin bond was improperly expressed; namely, to appear at the then next county court and then and there to prosecute the suit with effect. Following the statute, the condition should have been to appear at the then next county court and prosecute the suit with effect and without delay, but Parke B. considered that he should nevertheless construe the condition in accordance with the statutory intention, because the object of the bond was that the question whether the goods were rightly taken should be properly litigated, in the ordinary way, but with reasonable speed, and that the condition ought to be interpreted in that sense. There is less difficulty in this case to interpret the condition of the bond in conformity with the statutory form. It is said in Perreau v. Bevan[9], following Morgan v. Griffith[10].\nthat in all replevin bonds there are several independent conditions; one to prosecute, another to return the goods replevied, and a third to indemnify the sheriff; and a breach may be assigned upon any distinct parts of the condition. And it is material that this should be the case, for, though a return of the distress may have been actually made, as well as adjudged, yet the avowant may and will still be damnified, by reason of his costs of suit, where the distress so returned is not of sufficient value to pay him his costs, as well as his arrears of rent.\nIt has been shewn that in the present case all these material conditions have been stipulated, and also that the costs of suit, the only indemnity adjudged against the replevisor, have been paid. In Perreau v. Bevan9 it is also said that there may be cases in which failure to prosecute the action to final success is a breach of the condition to prosecute with effect although there be no judgment for return; there is here no claim for damages for breach of that condition, and there is no authority cited, or which I have been able to discover, that, after judgment upon verdict which does not order a return of the goods or damages for their detention, the value of the goods or these damages can be recovered upon assignment of a breach of the condition to prosecute with effect. It is not unworthy of remark that the prosecution of the replevin action was not without effect in the sense that the plaintiff obtained by means of the replevin order the possession of the goods, and upon the final judgment dismissing his action was not ordered to return them; but as to whether or not this could be regarded as satisfying the condition to prosecute with effect, I express no opinion. The English form of condition, applicable to proceedings in the County Court, as set forth in Tidd's Forms, 571, requires that the principal obligor shall appear at the next county court and prosecute his suit with effect and without delay and make return of the goods and chattels \"if a return thereof shall be adjudged\"; if these conditions be complied with the obligation is to be void, or else to be and remain in full force and virtue. In the present case the condition in accordance with the form prescribed in the appendix to the rules is stated in the alternative; and it is thereby stipulated that if the said William M. Petrie shall prosecute his suit with effect and without delay, or, if the suit is carried on and continued between the parties, and the court shall adjudge that the goods shall be restored to the defendants with damages for detaining the same, then in the result the bond is to become void if the plaintiff restore the goods and pay and satisfy any judgment that may be obtained against him, as well as any other costs which the sheriff may incur by virtue or on account of the suit or of the replevin. Now there being no judgment for restoration of the goods, neither was there any judgment for damages for detaining them; the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs, and the plaintiff satisfied the second or alternative condition in so far as it was capable of performance by paying and satisfying the judgment for costs which had been obtained against him. The condition expressed by the words \"if the said William M. Petrie shall restore the said goods\" is, I think, subject to the qualification, such as appears in the English form, \"if a return thereof shall be adjudged\"; and of course if the alternative condition be satisfied the obligation becomes void, even though the plaintiff did not prosecute his suit with effect. The obligor is entitled to a reasonable and beneficial interpretation of the condition which is for his benefit; it is said in Shepherd's Touchstone, 8th ed. 376a, that:\nThe condition of an obligation, which is doubtful, is always taken most favourably for the obligor, in whose advantage it is made, and most against the obligee; yet so as an equal and reasonable construction be made according to the minds of the parties, albeit the words sound to a contrary understanding.\nCases may be imagined in which obviously there could be no order against the plaintiff for return of the goods or damages for detaining them, although the plaintiff fail to succeed; for instance if the defendant were to maintain a plea of non cepit; or if the defendant were to exercise the right which he has under Rule 9 to retain the possession by giving security to the sheriff for the restoration of the goods if adjudged. Evans v. Ross[11]. Therefore I think that while the first part of the condition provides for the event of a successful issue of the suit, the second or alternative part is intended to provide for a termination which is not successful, and that the object of it is to insure that the goods shall be returned if they are ordered to be returned, that damages shall be paid to the defendant if damages be adjudged, and that the defendant shall receive any costs which may be adjudged to him in the cause. In the present case it appears to have been considered by the Supreme Court en banc that the action of replevin failed because brought prematurely. It is said that when the plaintiff commenced his action the beer was in the custody of the court; that the magistrate was entitled to a reasonable time within which to determine the complaint, and that the claim should be tried with reference to the state of things which existed at the commencement of the action, and not as it developed later; but it is expressly affirmed that the decision in no way affects the validity of the conviction, which was quashed by the county court judge, whose decision is final. Whether in these circumstances the absence from the judgment of any term relating to the return of the goods was deliberate, upon the consideration that the defendants had not claimed a return, or that they were not entitled to a return; or whether the question of return was not submitted, and therefore not considered, does not appear; but I think it was for the defendants if they desired the return of the goods or damages for their detention, to have brought those questions forward for the determination of the court in the replevin action. If because the questions of return and damages were not submitted or determined in the replevin action the plaintiff in that action has secured an advantage, which cannot in the circumstances be affirmed, it was because the defendants failed to avail themselves of the opportunity which the cause afforded, and it is too late in the present action to set up, as the respondents now seek to do, the loss of the liquor as damages to be recovered for breach of the condition of the bond.\nIt may be observed that the breaches assigned, and for which the respondents recovered at the trial, are that the defendants did not restore the goods nor pay damages for detaining them, also it was averred that they did not satisfy the judgment obtained against the defendant, William M. Petrie. Upon the latter allegation the respondent by the admission and the findings failed in fact; and, as to the return of the goods and damages for detention, the parties were properly convened in the replevin action, and it was competent to the court in that action to have given the relief which is now sought. If in that action a return had been claimed, and if damages had been claimed, these claims would have been successful, if a claim for compensation for not returning the goods and for damages for their detention can now be successful. Serrao v. No\u00ebl, in the Court of Appeal[12], is a distinct authority that the plaintiffs are precluded from maintaining a subsequent action for the same cause. This was an action concerning the title of shares in a Mining Company which belonged to the plaintiff, but which had been lodged by the plaintiffs' broker with the defendant as security for an advance, and the plaintiff claimed to restrain the defendant from parting with the shares or registering them in the defendant's name, and for such further or other relief as the nature of the case might require. The defendants in that action consented to an order for the delivery up of the shares to the plaintiff forthwith, and the order directed that upon the delivery register should be stayed. When the shares were delivered they were sold at considerable loss, and the second action was brought to recover damages for the detention. It was held that the plaintiff was estopped. The first action had been brought in the Chancery Division and the second action was in the Queen's Bench Division. This led to some confusion at the trial, but it was explained on the appeal that the Court of Chancery no longer existed; that although there are two divisions, Queen's Bench and Chancery, they are divisions of one court which administers one law, and that the claim in the second action might therefore have been maintained in the first action. Bowen L.J. said:\nI too am of opinion that the defendant is entitled to judgment. The principle is, that where there is but one cause of action, damages must be assessed once for all. The plaintiff relies upon a certain cause of action; was this cause of action capable of being litigated in the suit in the Chancery Division? If that had been an action of detinue at common law, the jury in their assessment could have included, not only damages for the original wrongful detention, but also damages for the detention until the shares should be re-delivered; damages might have been assessed once for all. The suit in the Chancery Division was an application to the High Court of Justice for all kinds of relief, in order that the rights of the parties might be adjusted. As soon as the writ was issued and the claim delivered, the court was empowered to do what was right between the parties. It may be said that the plaintiff did not claim damages in the suit in the Chancery Division. I am not sure that he did; the primary object of the action was that it should be a proceeding to obtain the re-delivery of the shares, and perhaps it did not occur to the plaintiff to make it clear that he intended to include a claim for damages; but if an application had been made, the court would have amended the claim, so as to enable the plaintiff to claim damages, and therefore damages not only could have, but also would have, been assessed at the time of the trial in the Chancery Division. In the present case there was a re-delivery of the shares made upon an arrangement arrived at in the course of the suit; the cause of action now litigated is the detention of the shares; that cause of action was litigated in the action in the Chancery Division, and therefore the two actions are in respect of the same cause.\nIn Gibbs v. Cruikshank[13], the plaintiff in replevin recovered as damages the amount of the expenses of the replevin bond, and, having sustained further consequential damages by reason of the seizure of his goods, he subsequently brought this action to recover these damages, and it was held that the recovery in replevin was \u00e1 bar to the action inasmuch as the special damages were recoverable in that action. Brett J. at page 463 said:\nReplevin is a common law action for the taking of goods. By the course of procedure in that action the goods are returned in the course of the action. It was argued by Mr. Foard that the action was for the mere purpose of recovering back the goods. I do not think that can be so, for if so, the plaintiff could never have recovered what in every action of replevin he does recover, the expenses of the bond. It seems to me that wherever, in a common law action, the plaintiff can recover damages, he must be entitled to recover all the legal damages he has sustained. Some of these damages are called common and others special damages. There is no essential difference between the two, further than that the latter must be specially mentioned in order to give notice to the defendant that they are claimed. I can find no authority that special damages cannot be recovered in replevin.\nNow there can be no doubt that the return of the goods to the respondents, if they were entitled to a return, was enforceable in the replevin action and, having regard to the rules of the practice in Nova Scotia, it would seem that the damages, if any, which the defendants sustained by reason of the replevin were also recoverable, certainly if proper allegations had been made; and therefore I think upon the principle of Gibbs v. Cruikshank[14], which is an authority of high standing, the respondents (defendants in replevin) are precluded from setting up these damages in their action upon the replevin bond. It is said that an order for the return of the goods would have been of no value to the respondents because in the interval the beer had been frozen or spoiled or had been disposed of; but these are matters which would have come up for consideration upon the sheriff's return if restoration had been ordered, when, as is said in Tidd's Practice at page 1038, the defendant,\non the sheriff's return of elongata, may either have a capias in withernam, for taking other cattle and goods in lieu of them; or he may sue out a scire facias against the pledges, for a return, on the statute Westm. II (13 Ed-. I) c. 2; or, if the distress was for rent, and the sheriff has taken a replevin bond, under the statute 11 Geo. II, c. 19, s. 23, the defendant may take an assignment of it, and bring an action thereon against the pledges, if sufficient; or if the sheriff has omitted to take a replevin bond, or the pledges were insufficient at the time of taking it, he may proceed by scire facias, or action on the case against the sheriff for neglect of duty.\nThis was the ancient procedure, which was, as I have shewn, certainly continued by statute in Nova Scotia down to 1st October, 1884, and is still, I should think, available by reason of section 44 of the Judicature Act. But, in any case, if the plaintiff in replevin, having failed to prosecute with effect, and having been ordered to return the goods, neglected to comply, there could be no question as to breach of the alternative conditions of the bond. The learned trial judge suggests that the condition for return of the goods is inserted in the bond for the benefit of the plaintiff in replevin, who might prefer to return the goods and pay detention damages, rather than to retain them and pay their value as at the date of the replevin, and for this he cites a Pennsylvania case, Gibbs v. Bartlett[15]. But with the utmost respect I am unable to accept this view. It would seem strange that when the question of title is tried in the replevin action and found for the defendant it should be at the plaintiff's option to retain the goods by payment of their value as at the date of the action, or as fixed by the plaintiff's affidavit upon which the order was obtained. I prefer the view expressed by Brett J. that by the course of procedure in the action of replevin the goods are returned in the course of the action. Moreover, there is a considerable variety of opinion expressed in the State Reports of the United States, and it is not difficult to find cases there in which the doctrine that the judgment retorno habendo is intended for the benefit of the plaintiff is contradicted.\nThe Massachusetts' decisions were always regarded in Nova Scotia as sources of wisdom, although not, of course, as possessed of judicial authority; there was a case decided in the Supreme Judicial Court of that State, Whitwell v. Wells[16], in which it was held in substance that judgment for return of goods replevied did not follow ex debito justitiae upon dismissal of the action; that the order for return was discretionary; that the jurisdiction ought to be exercised as the ends of justice might require, and that a party should not be allowed to acquire a better title by unsuccessful proceedings in replevin than he had before; that it might happen that the facts upon which the pleadings were founded ceased to exist before the final judgment, and that in such case the court should receive evidence of the intervening facts and render judgment according to the justice of the case at the time,\nAs, if the defendant had a special property in the chattels and a right to possession of them which terminated before final judgment, the court would render judgment for the defendant for costs, but not for a return, because at the time of rendering judgment he had no right to the possession.\u2026 The law would not do so vain an act as to cause a return to the officer who would have been bound immediately to restore them (the goods) to the plaintiffs.\nThis appears to be a more reasonable view, and I cite the case because it appears to be founded on principles which are inconsistent with the view expressed in the Pennsylvania case, that the judgment for return by an unsuccessful plaintiff judicially depends in anywise upon his election.\nI am disposed therefore to conclude that although the appellant, William M. Petrie, may have failed to prosecute the replevin action with effect, he did nevertheless, seeing that there was no judgment for return or for damages, satisfy the alternative condition of the bond by paying and satisfying the judgment which was obtained against him.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action upon a replevin bond given the sheriff in an action of replevin. And as that action was dismissed said bond was assigned by him to respondents who sued thereon and were given judgment not for the penalty of $6,000 and damages assessed as usual in such like actions on a penal bond.\nThe condition of said bond is as follows:\u2014\n\"Now the condition of this obligation is such that if the said William M. Petrie shall prosecute his suit in which the said order was made, with effect and without delay, or if the suit is carried on and continued between the said William M. Petrie and Fred G. Muggah and George R. Rideout touching the said goods, and the court shall adjudge that the goods shall be restored to the Fred G. Muggah and George R. Rideout, with damages for detaining the same, then if the said William M. Petrie shall restore the said goods and pay and satisfy any judgment that may be obtained against him, as well as any other costs which the said George B. Ingraham may incur by virtue or on account of this suit, or of the said replevin, then this bond shall be void otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\"\nThe question upon which I think this appeal should turn is the true construction of said condition.\nThe appellants contend that there are clearly two alternatives in the said condition, the first one of which is that William M. Petrie, the plaintiff, shall prosecute his suit \"with effect and without delay.\" The second alternative is the remaining part of the said condition.\nAnd appellant contends that the second is all that is involved herein for there never was any judgment ordering the return of the goods, or judgment for damages and in as much as all the judgment provided for was the costs, and that all said costs have been paid, which is not disputed.\nI am not inclined to think there is so much importance to be attached to the use of \"or\" instead of \"and\" as some of the arguments addressed to us implied; but appellants are clearly entitled to such advantage as there is in its being taken literally.\nWith great respect I cannot think there is any room for the reading which the learned trial judge suggests of substituting \"and\" for \"or.\"\nThe purview of the entire condition is such as contemplates a judgment shall be expressed by the court relative to all that may happen to be involved in the questions arising in the trial of the case.\nI need not enlarge on that topic and point out how many divers things may occur in the course of a trial in a replevin action.\nIn this particular instance I fail to see what right the respondents had to the goods, which was a cargo of 1\u00b789 per cent beer.\nThere was a search warrant for it and a prosecution taken as the result of such a find by respondent Rideout, before respondent Muggah, a magistrate who heard the case and convicted the appellant W. M. Petrie, and ordered the goods to be destroyed.\nOn appeal from that conviction it was quashed. On such a state of facts how can damages be assessed?\nOf course the respondents had no property in the goods and may well rejoice that one half of them got frozen as might be expected of such a quality.\nBut even if such neglect led to half of the goods being destroyed, I fail to see why, under proceedings in a replevin suit ending as this did, the court should assess the full value of the goods. Indeed to my mind there never was any room for such an award to respondents. Accidentally, or otherwise, the active appellant was sufficiently punished already.\nI think, inasmuch as the courts dealing with the action did not see fit to make any assessment of damages, no other court can do so on a bond conditioned as this bond is.\nIn a penal action on a bond it is quite usual to give judgment for the penalty, and then assess the damages ensuing the breach.\nI could conceive of that way of rectifying any legal wrong in other cases, but here, where he suing had nothing to suffer but costs, and they are paid, it seems to me the matter should have been allowed to rest, but if, instead of that, he brought such an action, it should have been dismissed.\nI think this appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs throughout, and the action dismissed.\nI may be wrong in the foregoing view as to the dismissal of the action entirely (for which perhaps there is no direct authority, indeed there is no direct authority to meet the remarkable case that the respondents presented in bringing this action) but the English law may be found in Chitty's Archibald's Practice, 14th Ed. 1885, vol. 2, pages 1260 and following, and including 1264.\nI cannot find any authority for Nova Scotia decisions differing from the line of cases set forth in said pages.\nAnd if we turn to the work of Cobbey on Replevin which deals almost entirely with American decisions, there seems to be authority found in many States as to the consequences following an unsuccessful replevin action. These cases indicate that the practice is followed of having a replevin action accompanied with a replevin bond and, I would infer from references given us, that practically the same law as prevails in England and in many English provinces is, in its basic principles, identically the same, subject, however, to departure from the ancient English law as to the mode of dealing with a replevin bond.\nThe principles of replevin action and replevin bonds seem to be the same as the English law except the actual disposition of the assessment of damages, arising and recoverable under the bond in the case of a replevin plaintiff failing in his action. Of the many cases that I have referred to, the following seem instructive.\nLittle v. Bliss, 55 Kansas Reports, page 94; 39 Pacific Reports, page 1025; Crabbs v. Koontz et al, 13 Atlantic Reporter, page 591; 69 Maryland Reports, page 59; Stock-well v. Byrne, 22 Indiana Reports, page 6; Jones v. Smith et al., 79 Maine Reports, page 452; 10 Atlantic Reporter, page 256.\nThe last mentioned case perhaps is the most in point of any herein. It decides the question in that jurisdiction as to the right to recover damages where the defendant in replevin has no title, yet was held entitled to bring an action on the bond, but could not recover damages, except nominal ones.\nThe respondents herein have, I repeat, no title and never had any title to these goods, except the bare possession. In the Jones v. Smith case only nominal damages were allowed.\n[1] 12 N.S. Rep. 55.\n[2] 12 N.S. Rep. 563.\n[3] 54 N.S. Rep. 446.\n[4] 56 N.S. Rep. 82.\n[5] [1918] 52 N.S.

[1914] c. 192, s. 406 (10)\u2014Municipal bylaw\u2014Street declared residential\u2014Distance from street line for buildings\u2014Frontage\u2014Landowner affected by building\u2014Right of action.\nThe amount in controversy necessary to give the Supreme Court of Canada jurisdiction to entertain an appeal may be determined by the pecuniary loss that would be suffered as a result of the judgment appealed from.\nSec. 406 (10) of The Municipal Institutions Act (R.S.O. [1914] c. 192) authorizes the council of a city or town to pass a by-law declaring any highway or part of a highway to be a residential street and prescribing the distance from the street line in front at which buildings can be erected. No common law right of action is given to a person prejudicially affected by the erection of a building in contravention of such a by-law and sec. 501 provides that in case of contravention it may be restrained by action at the instance of the corporation. The city of Toronto passed such a by-law in respect of lands front- ing on the north side of Carlton street between Sherbourne and Homewood Av. R. proposed to erect an apartment house on the corner of Carlton street and Homewood Av. at a less distance from the street line than that prescribed by the by-law and fronting on Homewood Av. and a landowner on the north side of Carlton street who would be prejudicially affected by its erection and claimed that it would be a contravention of the by-law brought action for an injunction to restrain R. from building it.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (26 Ont. W.N. 401) that the action could not be maintained; it was no part of the scheme of the legislation to create, for the benefit of individuals, rights enforceable by action; remedies were provided by the Act but none under the general law; and the aggrieved landowner can only resort to those so provided.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial[2] which dismissed the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nA motion was made to affirm the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the appeal which was maintained for the following reasons.\nTHE REGISTRAR.\u2014This is a motion to affirm jurisdiction heard by me in Toronto some weeks ago. The facts as disclosed by the material filed are as follows:\nAn action was brought by the plaintiff, Orpen, to restrain the defendant, Roberts, from proceeding with the erection of an apartment house on Lot 84, Plan D, 30 Homewood avenue, in the city of Toronto, within less than 25 feet of the northern limit of Carlton street and to prohibit the city of Toronto from issuing any permit to Roberts authorizing him to proceed with the erection of said building. The motion for injunction was by consent of all parties turned into a motion for judgment on the affidavits filed and judgment was pronounced by Mr. Justice Lennox refusing the motion and dismissing the action and his judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division. The plaintiff has launched an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, deposited the necessary security and now moves to affirm the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe basis of the action is a by-law of the city of Toronto No. 7197, which provides as follows: No building shall hereafter be built or erected on the lands fronting on the north side of Carlton street, between Sherbourne street and Homewood avenue, at a point closer to the line of the street than the distance of 25 feet.\nThis by-law was based upon section 406, paragraph 10, Revised Statutes of Ontario, c. 192, which provides as follows:\nBy-laws may be passed by the councils of cities and towns * * * for declaring any highway or part of a highway to be a residential street and for prescribing the distance from the line of the street in front of it at which no building on a residential street may be erected or placed.\nThe land in question is a corner lot at the junction of Homewood avenue and Carlton street and the plaintiff\u2019s house is also a corner lot at the junction of Carlton and Sherbourne streets. The proceedings were amended by insertion of the words, after the plaintiff\u2019s name:\nSuing upon her own behalf and on behalf of all other interested land owners.\nThe first answer to the plaintiff\u2019s action is that it was not intended to have the front entrance of the proposed building on Carlton street but Homewood avenue and therefore he is not precluded from building within the 25 ft. area and the jurisprudence of the Ontario courts supports this contention. In re Dinnick and McCallum[3].\nThe second answer is that a private person cannot maintain an action for the violation of a municipal ordinance such as this. MacKenzie v. Toronto[4].\nThese decisions, however, do not in any way preclude the plaintiff from appealing from the present judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada. The only question involved on the motion before me is: Do the facts of this case entitle the plaintiff to an appeal under the Supreme Court Act? The judgment is a final one and is a judgment of the highest court of final resort in the province. But does the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceed the sum of $2,000 as required by the new section 39? The defendant\u2019s counsel naturally relies strongly upon a line of decisions of this court from Toussignant v. Nicolet[5], onward. But all these cases preceded the amendment of the Supreme Court Act made by 3-4 Geo. V, c. 51, which provides by sec. 49a: Where the right to appeal depends upon the amount or value of the matter in controversy and no specific sum is claimed, the amount or value of the matter in controversy may be proved by affidavit or affidavits.\nThat section although repealed in the amendment of 10-11 Geo. V, c. 32 was replaced by a similar sec. (40) and the provision is in force to-day. I am disposed to hold that in all cases of this character where no specific amount is claimed the principle applied by Mr. Justice Idington in Chamberlain Metal Weather Strip Co. v. Peace[6], June 8,1905, is applicable and that the damages which the appellant would suffer by the granting or refusing of the injunction, although such damage at the time had not yet been sustained, can be proved by affidavit and if so established the court has jurisdiction.\nThe order made by me, however, will not prejudice the defendant as the court will still have the power to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction when the case comes on to be heard on the merits, if of the opinion that there is no jurisdiction.\nIn short I would hold that in all quia timet actions relief can be given in this court, although the damages have not yet been incurred, if in consequence of the judgment in appeal they would amount to more than $2,000.\nAn appeal taken from the order made by the registrar was dismissed. The court said the subject matter of the appeal is the right of the respondent to build on the street line on Carlton street in the city of Toronto. \u201cThe amount or value of the matter in controversy\u201d (section 40) is the loss which the granting or refusal of that right would entail. The evidence sufficiently shows that the loss\u2014and therefore the amount or value in controversy\u2014exceeds $2,000.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the appellant.\nRobertson K.C. and Barlow for the respondent Roberts.\nW.G. Angus for the other respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (the Chief Justice and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014In March, 1924, the respondent applied to the municipality of Toronto for a permit for the erection of an apartment house on lots owned by him situated on Home- wood avenue at the corner of Carlton street, the situs of the building to be erected being in part upon a strip between the northern boundary of Carlton St. and a building line, twenty-five feet north of that, laid down by a by-law enacted under the authority of sec. 406 (10) of the Municipal Institutions Act, R.S.O. [1914] c. 192. The appellant, Mrs. Orpen, owns a dwelling house on the north side of Carlton street, a short distance from the site of the apartment house, which has since been erected; and while the application of the respondent was before the municipality she applied for an injunction to restrain him from proceeding with his building, and the municipality from granting a permit. The motion was by consent turned into a motion for judgment, and Lennox J., who heard it, dismissed the action. An appeal from his judgment was in turn dismissed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, and the appellant now appeals from the judgment of that court.\nThe enactment under the authority of which the by-law was passed (c. 192, R.S.O. [1914], sec. 406 (10), now 12-13 Geo. V, c. 72), is thus expressed:\n406. By-laws may be passed by the councils of cities and towns.\n10. For declaring any highway or part of a highway to be a residential street, and for prescribing the distance from the line of the street in front of it at which no building on a residential street may be erected or placed.\n(a) It shall not be necessary that the distance shall be the same on all parts of the same street.\n(b) The by-law shall not be passed except by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of the council.\nAnd the by-law itself is in these words:\nNo building shall hereafter be built or erected on the lands fronting on the north side of Carlton street, between Sherbourne street and Homewood avenue, at a point closer to the line of the street than the distance of twenty-five feet.\nThe Appellate Division, we are informed, dismissed the appellant\u2019s action on the ground that she had no status to complain of the respondent\u2019s infraction of the by-law. The learned trial judge held that the by-law must be construed by reference to the statutory enactment under the authority of which it was passed, and that, so construed, the respondent\u2019s building as he proposed to place, and ultimately did place it, was not obnoxious to its provisions.\nThe respondent\u2019s building, it appears, is situated upon lots which would be commonly described as \u201cfronting\u201d on Homewood avenue, and the principal entrance of the building is on that street, and in the opinion of the learned trial judge he was bound by the decision of the Appellate Division in Dinnick v. McCallum[7], to hold that the proposed building would not \u201cfront\u201d on Carlton street and would not be erected on lands \u201cfronting\u201d on that street. and consequently that no infringement of the by-law was contemplated.\nSince the view upon which, as we are informed, the Appellate Division proceeded in this case can be supported upon sound and satisfactory grounds, it is unnecessary to consider the decision of the Appellate Division in Dinnick v. McCallum7 and no opinion is expressed concerning that decision. For the purposes of this judgment it will be assumed that there was an infraction of the by-law. It is not disputed that the existence of the respondent\u2019s apartment house, situated as it is upon the twenty-five foot strip bordering on Carlton street, does prejudicially affect the appellant in respect of the amenities and the value of her property; and the question to be determined, therefore, is whether, being so specially damnified, she has a title to judicial relief.\nAs a general rule, where something is done to the general damage of the public in respect of which an indictment will lie, a private individual who, in consequence, suffers special damage has a right of action; though it appears that, even where the duty violated is a duty arising under the common law, if it is one existing in the interest of a class of the public only an action will not lie if the person specially damnified is outside that class. Bromley v. Mercer[8]. Where the offence consists in the non-performance of a duty imposed by statute or the non\u2011observance of a prohibition created by statute, then the rule, based upon the Statute of Westminster, 13 Edw. V, c. 50, is, as stated in Comyn\u2019s Digest (\u201cAction upon Statute\u201d (F)):\nIn every case where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage or for the recompense of a wrong done to him contrary to the law.\nObviously, this leaves it to be determined in each case whether the enactment relied upon was passed for the bene- fit of the person asserting the right to reparation or other relief; and, assuming that question to be answered in the affirmative, there may still be the general principle to be considered that, to quote Lord Selborne in Brain v. Thomas[9]:\nWhere a statute creates an offence, and defines particular remedies against the person committing that offence, prima facie the party injured can avail himself of the remedies so defined, and no other.\nBut the object and provisions of the statute as a whole must be examined with a view to determining whether it is a part of the scheme of the legislation to create, for the benefit of individuals, rights enforceable by action; or whether the remedies provided by the statute are intended to be the sole remedies available by way of guarantees to the public for the observance of the statutory duty, or by way of compensation to individuals who have suffered by reason of the non-performance of that duty. Atkinson v. Newcastle Waterworks Company[10].\nIn substance, the proposition advanced by the appellant is that any proprietor, whose property might suffer in value by reason of the failure of some other proprietor to observe the building restrictions established by a by-law promulgated under the authority of this enactment, has a right to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts to prevent by injunction the obnoxious act and to recover damages in respect of any loss actually suffered in consequence of it if wholly or partly completed. In effect, if this contention be sound, such a by-law creates in favour of any proprietor who may be prejudicially affected in his property by an infringement of any of the prohibitions of such a by-law, a negative easement (enforceable in the same manner as a restrictive covenant) over the property within the area where the by-law operates.\nIt is legitimate to observe that this construction if it were to prevail, would be an unfortunate construction. As Meredith C.J. said, in Tomkins v. The Brockville Rink Company[11], when one considers the different kinds of acts and conduct which municipal councils in Ontario are by statute permitted to prohibit or to regulate, and the multiplicity of duties they have authority to impose upon property owners and others within their jurisdiction, one is rather\nstartled by the proposition that in each case a duty is imposed for the failure to perform which an action lies by one who is injured owing to the non-performance of it;\nand it seems highly unlikely, as Farwell J., said in Mullis v. Hubbard[12], that the legislature contemplated as the result of this legislation that \u201cthe numerous individuals\u201d in the vicinity of a residential area, should be entitled to\nbring their private actions against a man who had built a few feet in front of the line allowed,\neven though the municipal authorities themselves should not consider it a proper case for interference.\nThe question to be decided might possibly have presented greater difficulties had it not been for the history of the enactment and the course of decision upon it and upon analogous provisions of the Act. The statute which was the parent of the legislation now under discussion was first passed in the year 1904; but before examining the language of the enactment of that year, it will be advantageous first to consider the decision in Tompkins Case[13] already referred to, and the judgment of Meredith C.J. which was delivered in the year 1899. The action was brought by a ratepayer, who complained that the defendant company, in violation of a fire limits by-law, was erecting a wooden building in the vicinity of his own property, alleging that, in consequence of this breach of the by-law, the premiums payable for the insurance of his own buildings would be increased, and the value of his property diminished. The action was brought to restrain the defendant from proceeding with its building, and for damages. In a judgment which contains an elaborate review of the pertinent decisions, Meredith C.J. held that the authority conferred upon municipalities to establish fire limits and to regulate the construction of buildings within those limits was an authority given in the interests of the public generally, and that the sole remedy in respect of any infraction of a by-law passed under it lay in proceedings for the enforcement of the penalties prescribed by the by-law under the authority of the statute, including, if the by-law so ordained, the liability to have the building removed. It was, as already mentioned, in 1904 that the legislature, in chapter 22 of the statutes of that year (by sec. 19) first dealt with the subject of establishing residential areas and regulating the construction of buildings in those areas. By the same statute, sec. 20, the legislature dealt also with the subject that had been discussed in Tompkins\u2019 Case13 and, in cases of infringement of prohibitions of the kind considered in that case, it was provided that either the municipal corporation or any ratepayer might bring an action, and jurisdiction was conferred upon the High Court to grant an injunction in such a proceeding. It is not immaterial to notice this section, because it seems to indicate that the legislature was legislating with a view to the state of the law ascertained by Tompkins\u2019 Case 13 as touching the effect of fire limits by-laws.\nSection 19 was in these words:\n19. The Consolidated Municipal Act, 1903, is amended by inserting therein the following as section 541a:\u2014\n541a. The councils of cities and towns are authorized and empowered by a vote of two\u2011thirds of the whole council to pass and enforce such by-law as they may deem expedient;\n(a) To regulate and limit the distance from the line of the street in front thereof at which buildings on residential streets may be built; such distance may be varied upon different streets or in different parts of the same street.\n(b) And in the case of cities only, to prevent, regulate and control the location, erection and use of buildings for laundries, butcher shops, stores and manufactories.\nThe location, erection, construction or use of any buildings in contravention of any such by-law may, in addition to any other remedy provided by law, be restrained by action at the instance of the municipality passing such by-law;\nProvided that this section shall not apply to any buildings now erected or used for any of the purposes aforesaid so long as they continue to be used as at present.\nIn the consolidation of 1913, subsection (a) of this section appears in altered form, as quoted above, as subsection (10) of sec. 406, ch. 43, which confers a variety of powers on the councils of cities and towns; while that part of the section which gave a right of action, at the instance of the municipality, for restraining breaches of by-laws passed under the authority of it, is replaced by sec. 501, which is in these words:\n501. Where a building is erected or used, or land is used in contravention of a by-law passed under the authority of this Act in addition to any other remedy provided by this Act and to any penalty imposed by the by-law, such contravention may be restrained by action at the instance of the corporation.\nSection 20 of the Act of 1904, which, as already mentioned, gave a special right of action in respect of the contravention of fire limits by-laws to the corporation and to any ratepayer, was not reproduced in the consolidation of 1913 and, indeed, was expressly repealed. The result, therefore, of the changes effected by the consolidation of 1913 was that by virtue of section 501, which appears in Part 22 of the statute under the heading of \u201cPenalties and Enforcements of By-laws,\u201d contraventions of by-laws regulating the erection or the use of buildings or land might be restrained by action at the suit of the corporation, while the right of action given by sec. 20 of the Act of 1904 to a ratepayer in respect of violations of the particular class of by-laws with which it dealt (fire limits by-laws) was abrogated.\nSection 501, it will have been observed, carefully preserves any other remedy provided by the Act and the liability to any penalty imposed by the by-law. But there is no mention of remedies under the general law; and it seems to proceed upon the assumption that in respect of such contraventions there could be no remedy except such as is given or authorized by the Act. This view is fortified by the inference to be drawn from the contrast between the language of sec. 501 and that of sec. 19 of the Act of 1904, which explicitly preserved \u201cany other remedy provided by law.\u201d The change in language is striking, and appears to be most readily explained on the theory that in 1913 the legislature accepted and proceeded upon the opinion to which Meredith C.J. had given effect in Tompkins\u2019 Case[14], namely, that, according to the scheme of the Act, as regards by-laws of the character to which sec. 501 applies, the remedial measures available to persons affected by a breach of them are those provided or authorized by the Act, and those alone.\nThis view of the section seems to have commended itself to Middleton J., when giving judgment in Mackenzie v. City of Toronto[15], although, as a decision on the point was not strictly required, he expressed no decided opinion concerning it; and to Orde J. in Preston v. Hilton[16]. It was after these judgments had been delivered and published that the Municipal Institutions Act of Ontario was again consolidated in 1922 as chapter 72 of the statutes of that year, and sec. 501 was re-enacted without change.\nAlthough by sec. 20 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. [1914], the legislature is not to be presumed by reason merely of having re-enacted a statutory provision without changing its language to have adopted a previous judicial construction of that language, nevertheless, the history of the legislation, when read in light of the course of judicial decision and opinion touching the effect of it, may, independently of the intrinsic weight of such decisions and opinions, afford convincing evidence of the intention of the legislature. There appears to be little room for doubt that in this instance the Appellate Division has accurately interpreted that intention.\nThe appeal should accordingly be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the appellant, as owner of a dwelling house fronting upon the north side of that part of Carlton street in Toronto lying between Sherbourne street and Homewood avenue complaining that the respondent Roberts, owning a block of land on the northeast corner of said Carlton street and Homewood avenue (in breach of the by-law of said city which I am about to present), proposed erecting an apartment house on said corner which would extend to a line ten feet from, instead of twenty\u2011five feet from, Carlton street, as provided by said by-law, and thus would be detrimental to the appellant and her said dwelling house, and seeking an injunction restraining said respondent Roberts from so building in breach of said by-law and the city architect from granting a permit therefor.\nThe said by-law was passed in November, 1914, and provides as follows:\u2014\nWhereas by The Municipal Act, the councils of cities are authorized and empowered to pass by-laws for prescribing the distance from the line of the street in front of it at which no building on residential streets may be erected or placed;\nTherefore the Council of the Corporation of the city of Toronto, by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of the council enact as follows: I\nThe north side of Carlton street, between Sherbourne street and Homewood avenue, is hereby declared to be a residential street.\nII\nNo building shall hereafter be built or erected on the lands fronting on the north side of Carlton street, between Sherbourne street and Homewood avenlue, at a point closer to the line of the street than the distance of 25 feet.\nIII\nAny person convicted of a breach of any of the provisions of this by-law shall forfeit and pay, at the discretion of the convicting magistrate, a penalty not exceeding (exclusive of costs), the sum of $50 for each offence.\nThe council of the said city had (under the Municipal Act of R.S.O. [1914], section 406 (10)) power to pass said by-law and no question is raised herein as to that, though much has been said as to the meaning of it in relation to respondents\u2019 property with which I cannot agree.\nThe sole question that has troubled me much is whether or not the appellant has in law the right to claim an injunction forbidding a breach of the by-law.\nThe penalty imposed therefor is only fifty dollars which, as regards the parties hereto, seems so trifling that I am unable to see therein any effective restraint.\nSection 501 of said Municipal Act, however, provides as follows:\u2014\n501. Where a building is erected or used or land is used in contravention of a by-law passed under the authority of this Act, in addition to any other remedy provided by this Act, and to any penalty imposed by the by-law, such contravention may be restrained by action at the instance of the corporation.\nThere are many actions which have been successfully maintained though founded, in the last analysis, upon what were merely by-laws provided for by statute and well founded thereon, but few, if any, upon our Municipal Acts.\nThis is one of the many cases in which I have had to turn to the judgment of Lord Cairns in the case of Atkinson v. Newcastle and Gateshead Waterworks Co.[17], where he indicated that the right to a remedy, claimed to be founded upon a statute, must to a great extent depend on the purview of the legislature.\nApplying that to the legislation herein in question, the said section I have just quoted seems to me to render it impossible to properly hold that the legislature ever intended that the appellant should have the right of action she claims herein.\nIf that conclusion, coupled with the apparent refusal herein of the city to assist appellant in maintaining its bylaw, renders the enactment of such a by-law rather farcical I cannot help it.\nThere are so many cases in which private individuals have unsuccessfully tried to found, upon mere municipal by-laws, actions seeking the like relief the appellant asks herein, that I do not propose to review them here; for the benefit of those seeking their law bearing upon the question raised, I may refer to the following, and the cases respectively referred to in the several judgments appearing therein. See Tompkins v. Brockville Rink Co.[18]; Preston v. Hilton[19]; Johnston v. Consumers Gas Co.[20]; McKenzie v. City of Toronto[21]; Mullis v. Hubbard[22].\nFor the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs to the respondent Roberts. I do not think the other respondents, under such circumstances, entitled to costs for if the city intended to abandon the by-law it should, I respectfully submit, have said so at the outset.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\nSolicitors for the respondent Roberts: Jones & Barlow.\nSolicitor for other respondents: William Johnston.\n[1] 26 Ont.

[1906] c. 71, s. 42.\nThe W.C. Co., manufacturers of confectionery in the United States had the words \"Oh Henry\" registered in the Patent Office at Washington as a trade-mark for chocolate bars and advertised it extensively in American papers and magazines having a substantial circulation in Canada but made no use of it there. The C. Co. in the same business in Kingston, Ont., registered these words in Canada as its own trade mark for the same goods.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court ([1924] Ex. C.R. 183) Idington J. dissenting, that the W.C. Co., while the Canadian registration stands, is prevented from making any use of said words in Canada in connection with the sale of their product, and is deprived of the benefit here of their extensive advertising; it is, therefore, \"a person aggrieved\" within the meaning of sec. 42 of The Trade Mark and Design Act and entitled to bring an action to have them expunged from the Canadian registry.\nHeld also, that the trade-mark of the C. Co. was \"calculated to deceive and mislead the public\" and should be expunged from the Canadian registry.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] ordering the appellant's trade-mark to be expunged from the registry.\nThe facts of this case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant. Prior user is not a condition precedent to registration. Spilling Bros v. Ryall[2]; In re Hudson's Trade-Mark[3] per Cotton L.J.\nThe appellant is proprietor of the mark if no one else in Canada has a better title. Prior user out of Canada does not affect his position. In re Meeus Application[4]; Smith v. Fair[5]. There can be no protection where no goods have been sold. Maxwell v. Hogg[6] at page 314; Batt & Co. v. Dunnett[7].\nAs to appellant's registration being calculated to deceive or mislead see In re Imperial Tobacco Company's Trade-Mark[8] at page 45.\nSmart for the respondent. The appellant had not used the trade-mark prior to registration nor did he adopt it in good faith. Consequently he was not the proprietor. See Wellcome v. Thompson[9]; Bayer v. American Druggists' Syn.[10]; Gorham Mfg. Co. v. Weintraub[11] at page 961.\nThe rights in a trade-mark are universal. See J. P. Bush Mfg. Co. v. Hanson[12]; In re Munch's Application[13] at page 13.\nThe Canadian registration was calculated to deceive. Though the respondent did not use it in this country its extensive advertising may be considered an equivalent. In re European Blair Camera Co.[14]; In re Poiret[15].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (the Chief Justice and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nSmart for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action is brought for the expunging of the trade-mark \"Oh! Henry\" registered by the defendant appellant.\nJurisdiction is conferred on the Exchequer Court by s. 42 of the Trade-Mark and Designs Act (R.S.C., c. 71) \"at the suit of any person aggrieved * * * by any entry made without sufficient cause\" in the register of trademarks to \"make such order for * * * expunging or varying any entry in such register as the court thinks fit.\" Section 23 of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C., c. 140) imports the like jurisdiction.\nThe plaintiff company are large manufacturers of confectionery. In 1921 they applied for, and, in 1922, were granted registration in the United States Patent Office of the words \"Oh! Henry\" as a trade-mark for chocolate bars which they produced. This trade-mark they advertised extensively in magazines and newspapers having a substantial circulation in Canada as well as in the United States.\nIn May, 1922, an officer of the defendant, a manufacturing confectioner at Kingston in Canada, attended a confectioners' convention in Chicago. He then learned of the plaintiff's trade-mark and of its great vogue and success. The defendant promptly applied for registration of the words \"Oh! Henry\" as a specific trade-mark in Canada for chocolate bars and biscuits made by it, and its application was granted on the 15th of June, 1922. In making the application there was filed a declaration of one of the defendant company's officers, in the form prescribed by s. 13 of the statute, that the trade-mark, registration of which was applied for,\nwas not in use to his knowledge by any person other than himself at the time of his adoption thereof.\nThe existence of the plaintiff's United States trade-mark and its user by them appears not to have been disclosed. A subsequent application by the plaintiffs for registration in Canada was refused.\nSection 11 of the statute provides:\n11. The Minister may refuse to register any trade-mark,\u2014\n(a) if he is not satisfied that the applicant is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of such trade-mark;\n(b) if it appears that the trade-mark is calculated to deceive or mislead the public;\nAlthough it may be that the failure of the plaintiffs to apply for registration in Canada within the time provided for by s. 49 of the statute (1.3-14 Geo. V, c. 28) and the defendant's adoption and user of the words \"Oh! Henry\" as its trade-mark will prove an obstacle to the plaintiffs' obtaining registration for themselves of those words as a trade-mark even if the defendant's registration should be expunged, that registration, while it stands, prevents the plaintiffs making any use of these words in Canada in connection with the sale of their product and deprives them of the benefit in this country of their extensive advertising. In our opinion it is obvious that they are persons whose legal rights would or might be limited by the appellant's trade-mark remaining on the register and they are, accordingly, \"persons aggrieved\" within s. 42 of the Trade-Mark and Design Act and have a status to maintain this action In re Powell[16]; In re Apollinaris Co.[17]; De Kuyper v. Van Dulken[18]; In re Vulcan Trade-Mark[19].\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court regards the exercise of the discretion given the Minister by s. 11 of the Act as subject to review by the Exchequer Court for the purpose of the jurisdiction conferred by s. 42 of the Trade-Mark and Designs Act. In this view we agree. In re Vulcan Trade-Mark19.\nThe learned President has held that the defendant's trade-mark as registered \"is calculated to deceive and mislead the public.\" That finding has not been successfully impeached. The evidence warrants it. It in turn fully supports the order made by the Exchequer Court that the defendant's trade-mark should be expunged as a trademark which the Minister in the exercise of his discretion could properly have refused to register.\nWe find it unnecessary to express any opinion on the further grounds on which the learned President rested his order, viz., that the defendant was not \"the first to use the mark to his knowledge\" within the meaning of s. 13 of the statute, and that it was not the proprietor of the trademark of which it obtained registration.\nIt follows that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent carried on the business of manufacturing and distributing confections and candy in Chicago, Illinois, and, in connection therewith, adopted and used the trade-mark \"Oh! Henry.\" On the 6th July, 1921, it applied for, and, on the 28th of February, 1922, was granted registration of said trademark in the United States Patent Office, but never at any time carried on said business in Canada.\nThe appellant carried on business in Kingston, Ontario, as candy manufacturers and sellers thereof and of other confections, and obtained, on the 15th of June, 1922, the following certificate of registration of a specific trade-mark:\u2014\nCanada\nThis is to certify that this trade-mark (specific) to be applied to the sale of Chocolate Bars and Biscuits, and which consists of the words \"Oh Henry!\" as per the annexed pattern and application, has been registered in The Trade-Mark Register No. 137, Folio 31320, in accordance with \"The Trade-Mark and Design Act\" by\nThe W. J. Crothers Company, Limited, of the city of Kingston, province of Ontario, on the 15th day of June, A.D. 1922.\nPatent and Copyright Office (Copyright and Trade-Mark Branch).\nOttawa, Canada, this 15th day of June, A.D. 1922.\nGEO. F. O'HALLORAN,\nCommissioner of Patents.\nThe respondent instituted this action against appellant in the Exchequer Court of Canada by a statement of claim filed on the 1st day of September, 1923, and alleged many things denied by appellant as defendant, and not proven, seeking to have the appellant restrained from using said trade-mark, and to have said trade-mark \"Oh! Henry\" registered by it (the respondent) in Canada.\nThe contention throughout has been that the respondent never did carry on any business in Canada, and never attempted to do so, or to register the said trade-mark until long after the appellant's registration thereof.\nI am unable to understand how it can claim any right to bring this action even if the grounds upon which the learned President of the said court proceeds in his judgment, now appealed from, might have (if the action had been brought by way of information by the Attorney General of Canada) led to expunging the appellant's registration, and, therefore, I confine anything I have to say to that single issue.\nI submit that the Trade-Mark and Design Act never was intended to be for the benefit of any one who never carried on business in Canada, as respondent never clearly did, unless by advertising in American newspapers and magazines\u2014the circulation of which was certainly not (unless we make a travesty of words) a carrying on of business in Canada.\nIts course of business as indicated thereby would seem to have been to the disturbance instead of benefit of Canada.\nThe amendments to the said Trade-Mark and Design Act by 13-14 George V, chapter 28, assented to 13th June, 1923, demonstrate, I most respectfully submit, that Parliament had an entirely different conception of the then existing state of the law from that upon which the learned trial judge proceeded herein: else why, especially, were the following sections, by the third section of said amending Act, added?\n49. An application for the registration of a trade-mark or industrial design filed in this country by any person who has, previously, regularly filed an application for the registration of the same trade-mark or industrial design in a foreign country which by treaty, convention or law affords similar privilege to citizens of Canada, shall have the same force and effect as the same application would have if filed in this country on the date on which the application for the registration of the same trade-mark or industrial design was first filed in such foreign country; provided the application in this country is filed within four months from the earliest date on which any such foreign application was filed.\n50. Any trade-mark the proprietor of which is an association, the existence of which is not contrary to the law of the country to which such association belongs, even if such association does not possess an industrial or commercial establishment, may be registered under this Act upon compliance with the requirements thereof, and on such particular conditions as may be established by regulations to be made by the Minister with the approval of the Governor in Council.\nSurely the imperative assumption or implication of these recent amendments is that the foreigner not carrying on in Canada any branch of its business had, until said amendments, no rights to registration in Canada and only can acquire them under such conditions as defined thereby, and by pursuing the method therein described.\nWhether or not such relations exist between Canada and the United States, as the fundamental requirements of said conditions specify, I know not. But evidently the time for respondent exercising the rights thus offered such as similarly situated, had expired before enactment and it is hereby excluded.\nI imagine from the reasoning of the learned trial judge in regard to the justice of some such recognition by reason of neighbourhood and intimate business relations without referring to said legislative amendments to the Act, that his attention had not been called to said amendments and the limitations defining the conditions upon which, and the consequent methods by which, such rights might be asserted had been overlooked.\nThese amendments had been enacted a year before his delivery of judgment herein.\nOf the numerous authorities cited by counsel in relation to the rights of non-resident foreigners acquired by this carrying on business abroad and using there their personal trade-marks, I may refer to the following cases as demonstrating that they had not acquired rights to register either in England or Canada by reason of such like facts.\nIn re Munch's Application[20], held that foreign user alone could not entitle the applicant to registration in England.\nIn the case of Jackson, etc. v. Napper[21], Sterling J. says:\u2014\nIt is said and I think rightly that in order to entitle you to register, there being a similar mark already on the register, you must make out that there was a user cf the mark in England before that date.\nIn re Meeus' Application[22], it was held that the whole trade-mark as used must be that upon which application must rest and that its use for importation and for transportation purposes only, is not a sufficient user to acquire a title in England.\nSee cases cited, besides these, in Kerly (5th ed.) on Trade-Marks, at page 238, and note thereto.\nSee also Smart on Trade-Marks and Designs, page 42, where the author expresses the opinion \"that the weight of opinion supports the view that the statute refers to use in Canada.\"\nSee also as to persons aggrieved the case of In re Riviere and Company's Trade-Mark[23].\nThese are dicta of a converse nature, as to the possibilities under the English Act but no case I have seen expressly decides the point that way.\nI respectfully submit that the amendments I have quoted to our Act, enacted before this action brought, put the question beyond doubt and prevent the respondent from claiming any right of action herein as a party aggrieved in law.\nSentimental grievances many people have, or suppose they have, which furnish no foundation for an action at law.\nFor example, the use of a pen name such as \"Oh! Henry\" may have been offensive to the personal representatives of the late writer, who assumed the name \"O. Henry\" for his short stories.\nIt looks to me as if the gentlemen contending herein may both have been offenders against good taste. I would allow the appeal herein with costs but if necessary without prejudice to the right of the Attorney General to take such action, if any, as he may be advised.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson & Herridge.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Featherstonhaugh & Co.\n[1] [1924] Ex.

Langlais K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by Duff J.\u2014This appeal raises a question that chiefly turns upon the scope and effect of s. 15 of 9-10 Geo. V, c. 13, which is in the following words:\u2014\n(1) Actions, suits or other proceedings by or against the company in respect of its undertaking or in respect of the operation or management of the Canadian Government Railways, may, in the name of the company, without a fiat, be brought in, and may be heard by any judge or judges of any court of competent jurisdiction in Canada, with the same right of appeal as may be had from a judge sitting in court under the rules of court applicable thereto. Any defence available to the respective corporations (including His Majesty) in respect of whose undertaking the cause of action arose shall be available to the company, and any expense incurred in connection with any action taken or judgment rendered against the company in respect of its operation or management of any lines of railway or properties, other than its own lines of railway or properties, may be charged to and collected from the corporation in respect of whose undertaking such action arose. Nothing in this Act shall affect any pending litigation.\n(2) Any court having under the statutes or laws relating thereto jurisdiction to deal with any cause of action, suit or other proceeding, when arising between private parties shall, with respect to any similar cause of action, suit or other proceeding by or against the company, be a court of competent jurisdiction under the provisions of this section.\nCliche was a person employed in the operation of the Canadian Government Railways, as defined by s. 10 of this Act, and certain moneys were owing to him as wages earned in his employment when the respondent, having recovered a judgment against him for $310.80, proceeded to take out a writ of garnishment attaching these moneys, in the Superior Court of Quebec.\nThe appellant company objected that the proceeding was not competent, inasmuch as it was an attempt to garnish the wages of an employee of the Crown, and that s. 15 did not authorize such a proceeding. The issue thus raised was decided in favour of the respondent by the unanimous judgments of the Quebec courts.\nThe Court of King's Bench, exercising the authority conferred by s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, gave leave to appeal to this court. It may be observed in passing that the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench appear to have been under an impression that their jurisdiction under that section was limited by certain rules supposed to be laid down in this court touching the exercise of that jurisdiction. This court has no authority, and, of course, never pretended to exercise any authority, to lay down rules restricting the scope of the jurisdiction or governing the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by s. 41 upon provincial courts of appeal. The statute gives a discretion to such courts, and, where a statutory discretion is conferred upon a court, it is not within the authority of any other court to give directions as to the manner in which the discretion is to be exercised. Attorney General v. Emerson[1]. On the other hand, one of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench would have refused leave to appeal because this case did not, in his opinion, fall within any of the sub-clauses, (a) to (f), of the proviso to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. That proviso, with its several sub-clauses, has to do only with the granting of special leave to appeal by this court where it has been refused by the provincial court of appeal, and in nowise affects the discretion conferred on the provincial court by s. 41. That discretion is untrammelled and free from restriction, save such as is implied in the term \"special leave.\"\nThe general object of the Act of 1919 is stated in the preamble, which, after reciting that His Majesty, on behalf of the Dominion of Canada, has acquired control of the Canadian Northern Railway Company and the various constituent and subsidiary companies comprising the Canadian Northern System, proceeds to declare it to be expedient\nto provide for the incorporation of a company under which the railways, works and undertakings of the companies comprised in the Canadian Northern System may be consolidated and, together with the Canadian Government Railways, operated as a national railway system.\nIn order to effectuate this purpose, the Governor in Council is authorized to nominate directors, not fewer than five and not more than fifteen, with such remuneration as may be determined by the Governor in Council, who, together with their successors, shall constitute the corporation known as the Canadian National Railway Company. Directors are removable for cause by the Governor in Council, by whom also vacancies are to be filled. The Governor in Council is authorized also to declare that the company shall have a capital stock, with or without shares, such stock being, unless otherwise ordered, vested in the Minister of Finance, on behalf of His Majesty.\nThe Act also provides that no director of the company shall be under any personal responsibility to any share- holder, director, officer or employee of the company, or to any other person, or, except with the approval of the Governor in Council, subject to any pecuniary penalty under the provisions of any statute, in respect of his office or any act done or omitted to be done by him in the execution thereof. By s. 11 the Governor in Council is authorized to entrust to the company\nthe management and operation of any lines of railway or parts thereof, and any property or works of whatsoever description, or interests therein, and any powers, rights or privileges, over or with respect to any railways, properties or works, or interests therein, which may be from time to time vested in or owned, controlled or occupied by His Majesty, or such part or parts thereof, or rights or interests therein, as may be designated in any order in council, upon such terms and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Governor in Council may from time to time decide; such management and operation to continue during the pleasure of the Governor in Council and to be subject to termination or variation from time to time in whole or in part by the Governor in Council.\nPowers are also given to the company, with the approval of the Governor in Council, to construct and operate railway lines, branches and extensions, and to issue bonds, debentures and debenture stock. By s. 13, the provisions of the Railway Act, with certain exceptions not material, are made applicable to the company and its undertaking; and by s. 14 it is declared that the provisions of the Railway Act respecting the operation of a railway shall apply to any of the Canadian Government Railways, the operation and management of which may be entrusted to the company, and by s. 9, where any consent or approval by shareholders of a company is required by the Railway Act, such consent or approval may be given by the Governor in Council.\nPrima facie, by force of the provisions of the Interpretation Act, the incorporation of the company itself invests it with the capacity to sue and to be sued in its own name Section 15 appears to proceed upon the assumption that the company, when acting within the scope of its powers, is responsible for the acts of its employees within the scope of their authority. The section, on any hypothesis, cannot be regarded as very happily framed, but there does not appear to be any satisfactory reason for limiting the scope of the word \"proceedings\" in the first sentence of it in such a way as to exclude the process of attachment.\nIt seems difficult to make good any distinction between, moneys payable by the company \"in respect of its undertaking\" and moneys payable in respect of the operation or management of the Canadian Government Railways.\nSection 15 recognizes the enforceability of the obligation in both cases alike. True, by s. 16 wages of the employees of the Canadian Government Railways are payable out of moneys which are furnished either directly out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or from the \"revenues and receipts\" of the Government Railways, and the surplus of these, after providing for the expenses incident to the operation and management of such railways, belongs to the Consolidated Fund; nevertheless, s. 15 does recognize, as already stated, an obligation on the company to pay. Payment of such debts is one of the purposes for which the fund provided for by s. 16 is put into the company's hands.\nThe real difficulty in attaching moneys payable by the Crown to a third person lies in the inability of the courts to make an order against the Crown. Generally speaking, moneys payable by the Crown are subject to equitable execution, the appointment of a receiver operating as an injunction prohibiting the judgment debtor from receiving the fund attached. The process involves no order against the Crown. Only by leave of the court and, of course, after fiat granted, can the judgment creditor proceed to enforce the judgment debtor's claim by petition of right. The position may be illustrated by reference to sequestration. Sequestration will lie to attach moneys payable by the Crown, subject to this, that no order against the Crown can be made. Willcock v. Terrell[2]. Here, again, the process operates only indirectly, by precluding the judgment debtor from receiving payment.\nNow s. 15, whatever its limitations, does contemplate judgments against the company for the payment of money in actions arising out of the operation and management of the Government Railways, as well as in other cases. Moreover, the use of the word \"suits\" in addition to \"actions\" indicates that equitable proceedings\u2014proceedings of that class which normally culminate in a judgment in personam\u2014are contemplated by the section. The necessary effect of s. 15 would, therefore, appear to be that it removes the impediment which normally prevents the attachment of public moneys owing to a judgment debtor; and it would therefore appear to be in harmony with the principle and policy of the section to attribute to the word \"proceedings\" a scope which would bring within the ambit of the section the kind of proceeding that is in question here.\nAs opposed to this view, an argument is based upon the presence in s. 15 of the words \"without a fiat.\" It is suggested that these words point to an intention to limit the operation of the section to proceedings of a like character with those which, according to the usual practice, would be competent to a suppliant, as against the Crown, on a fiat being granted. Now the phrase \"without a fiat\" grammatically applies to proceedings by the company as well as to proceedings against the company. As applied to the former, it seems, in this context, to be almost, if not quite, meaningless. Even as applied to proceedings against the company, it is not a very apt expression. The more probable inference seems to be that it was introduced ex majori cautela to quiet the apprehensions of some not very highly instructed person\u2014a not uncommon thing, as Lord Herschell observes in Commissioners of Income Tax v. Pemsel[3].\nIf the intention was to limit the scope of the section, as suggested, it seems strange that the meaning of the section should be left to be gathered by doubtful inference; and, on the whole, the better view seems to be that such was not the intention.\nIt has not been argued, it should be added, that by any rule of public policy the wages attached were inalienable, and no opinion is expressed upon any such question.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is a company incorporated by virtue of c. 13 of 9-10 Geo. V of the Dominion Parliament as an instrument of the Dominion Government to aid it in discharging duties devolving upon the said Government in relation to the management and operation of certain specified railways.\nThe respondent Croteau claims that Cliche, the above-named defendant in the Superior Court of Quebec, owes him and that he is entitled to garnishee the appellant in respect of wages due by the Intercolonial Railway, a Government-owned railway. The appellant objects to recognizing any such mode of execution against it.\nBy s. 18 of c. 35 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, which reads as follows\n18. Moneys in the hands of an officer, employees or servant of the Minister, as an officer or servant of His Majesty, due or payable by His Majesty to any person, or out of which any payment on behalf of His Majesty is to be made, and given to or being in the possession of such officer, employee or servant for the purpose of making such payment, shall not be subject to any execution, attachment or garnishee process.\n2. If any such officer, employee or servant is served with any execution, attachment or garnishee process in regard to such moneys, the same may be set aside, with costs, by any court of competent jurisdiction,\nit would seem clear that such a proceeding is expressly prohibited.\nThe respondent points to s. 15 of said Act, c. 13 of 9-10 Geo. V, which reads as follows:\n15. (1) Actions, suits or other proceedings by or against the company in respect of its undertaking or in respect of the operation or management of the Canadian Government Railways, may, in the name of the company, without a fiat, be brought in, and may be heard by any judge or judges of any court of competent jurisdiction in Canada, with the same right of appeal as may be had from a judge sitting in court under the rules of court applicable thereto. Any defence available to the respective corporations (including His Majesty) in respect of whose undertakings the cause of action arose shall be available to the company, and any expense incurred in connection with any action taken or judgment rendered against the company in respect of its operation or management of any lines of railway or properties, other than its own lines of railway or properties, may be charged to and collected from the corporation in respect of whose undertaking such action arose. Nothing in this Act shall affect any pending litigation.\n(2) Any court having under the statutes or laws relating thereto jurisdiction to deal with any cause of action, suit or other proceeding, when arising between private parties shall, with respect to any similar cause of action, suit or other proceeding by or against the company, be a court of competent jurisdicton under the provisions of this section.\nI cannot see that this section ever was intended to repeal the said s. 18, or touch upon such questions as therein referred to, or in any way to justify such a proceeding as the garnishee in question.\nThere was no fiat recognizing this proceeding and the local legislature of a province cannot give any power to its courts to interfere with the rights of the Crown on behalf of any work done under or by virtue of Dominion legislation beyond what that expressly empowers it to do as in and under, for example, such as above quoted, and which, as already stated, is not wide enough. Nor do I think the s. 14 of the said Act of 9-10 Geo. V, c. 13, helps respondent.\nI would therefore allow this appeal with costs throughout and dismiss said garnishee.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pentland, Gravel, Thompson & Hearn.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Langlais, Langlais & God-bout.\n[1] [1889] 24 Q.B.D. 56, at pp. 58, 59.\n[2] [1878] 3 Ex.

Pursuant to an order in chambers the issues of fact were first tried. A general verdict for the plaintiff was rendered after non-suit had been refused. On appeal to the court en bane a motion for non-suit, for which leave was reserved at the trial, or for a new trial was refused and the defendant obtained special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Before this appeal came on argument was heard on the demurrers but judgment was not rendered.\nHeld, that as long as the issues of law are undetermined the judgment on the issues of fact does not decide, in whole or in part, any substantive right of any of the parties and is not a final judgment.\nSec. 36 (b) of the Supreme Court Act provides that an appeal shall lie from \"a judgment upon a motion for a nonsuit.\"\nHeld, that the judgment of the court en bane refusing a nonsuit was right; that there can be no judgment of non-suit when the issues of law are not before the court.\nJudgment appealed from ([1924] 4 D.L.R. 259) stands.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island ([1]) maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs. The only question decided on this appeal was that of jurisdiction of the court to entertain it. The conditions under which it came before the court are set out in the above head-note.\nF. R. Taylor K.C. and J. D. Stewart K.C. for the appellant.\nJohnson K.C. and Bentley K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Maclean JJ.) was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The respondents (plaintiffs) in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island declared in two counts upon a contract of fire insurance against the appellant company (defendant). The appellant pleaded thirty-five pleas, twenty-six to the first count and nine to the second. The appellant also demurred to the first count of the declaration and the respondents demurred to four of the pleas which were pleaded to that count. By order of Arsenault J. of 8th January, 1924, it was directed that the issues of fact should be tried first, and a jury was summoned to try them and to inquire of and assess the damages. The issues of fact were accordingly tried before the Chief Justice and a jury on 15th, 16 and 17th January. The defendant at the trial moved for non-suit; the motion was refused with leave to move the full court; the jury found generally for the plaintiffs for $1,011.33; the defendant gave notice of motion, dated 26th January, to set aside the verdict as contrary to the evidence, against the weight of evidence and contrary to law, and for a direction that a non-suit should be entered, or that a new trial should be granted. This application was heard before the full court, consisting of Haszard and Arsenault JJ., in May, and on 14th July the court pronounced judgment refusing either a non-suit or a new trial. The appellant, on 29th July, obtained special leave from the Supreme Court of the province to appeal from this judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada; notice of appeal was given on 2nd August, and on 29th October the appellant deposited the requisite security and obtained an order of the Chief Justice of the provincial court allowing the security. There is a note in the record to the effect that on 29th July the court set down the demurrers for hearing at the ensuing Michaelmas term; that the demurrers were argued before the court en banc, consisting of the Chief Justice and Arsenault J., on 18th November, when the court reserved judgment, and that judgment had not been rendered.\nWhen the appeal came on for hearing in this court, counsel for the respondents moved to dismiss it on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction, because the judgment is neither a final judgment, nor a judgment upon a motion for a non-suit or directing a new trial, within the meaning of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act. The court then expressed grave doubts as to the right of appeal, and suggested to counsel the advisability of considering further steps in the court below to fortify the appeal so as to bring up the whole case upon final judgment, and thus to avoid the question of the court's jurisdiction to entertain an appeal at the present stage of the proceedings; but counsel preferred to proceed with the argument upon the case as it stands; and, as the situation had not been made perfectly clear by the preliminary discussion, the court permitted the argument upon all points, reserving the question of its jurisdiction.\nThe final judgment from which it is provided that an appeal shall lie is declared to mean\nany judgment, rule, order or decision which determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any party in controversy in any judicial proceeding.\nThe effect of the order under appeal is to deny the appellant's application in every particular\u2014for non-suit, or to set aside the findings implied in the general verdict for the plaintiffs upon the issues of fact, or to grant a new trial. The order determines nothing upon the issues of law which involve the question of liability as between the parties, and which are not before the court upon the appeal, but remain outstanding. It would appear indeed that, so long as the issues of law remain undetermined, the findings of fact are not decisive in whole or in part of any substantive right, and therefore it cannot be maintained that there is a final judgment. There is certainly no judgment directing a new trial; the court has refused to direct that the issues of fact shall be retried. Therefore upon neither of these grounds is the judgment appealable.\nBut it is said that there was at least a motion for a non-suit, and that an appeal has been asserted from the judg- ment which was pronounced upon that motion. The judgment of non-suit was in common practice and well understood before the introduction of the rules of procedure under the Judicature Act. These rules have not been adopted in Prince Edward Island, and so, in that province, a plaintiff retains his privilege of becoming non-suit, and the court the authority which it formerly possessed to direct a non-suit, if it be clear in point of law that the action will not lie, or to allow the plaintiff to take a verdict with liberty to the defendant to enter a non-suit if the court above should be of opinion that the action will not lie. In this case the latter course was adopted; but, although the jury found under the directions of the learned Chief Justice a general verdict, which must be interpreted as a finding of the jury in the terms of the issues referred to them, it must be realized that if the appellant's demurrer were allowed, the verdict, being general, could not stand in any particular, and if the respondents were to succeed upon the demurrers, seeing that the court was of opinion not to disturb the verdict, they would be entitled to move for final judgment in the case; but, inasmuch as a judgment of non-suit disposes of the action, and according to the general rule a non-suit for part is a non-suit for the whole (Bacon's Abridgment, tit. \"Nonsuit\") it is obvious that there can be no non-suit at the trial of the facts when the issues of law are by order of the court excluded, and therefore I think that, in view of the state of the cause, the court was right in rejecting the motion. Non-suit involves considerations of law having regard to the facts as they appear; the questions of law were not before the learned Chief Justice at the trial, and a judgment of non-suit was not in the somewhat unusual proceedings either appropriate or available.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs throughout.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of the following circumstances. The respondents, W. Warren Lord and J. Herbert Lord, carried on business at Cape Traverse in Prince Edward Island as general merchants and, in course thereof were insured in respect of their stock in trade there by appellant and others. One of the policies held by said partnership was later dropped, but another for $2,000, said to have been by its terms made payable to the Royal Bank at Summer side in said Island, as collateral security, was continued in force for many years. For carrying out that collateral purpose it seems to have 'been handed to said bank, but the bank was paid off, and the manager, having no further interest in the policy, seems to have forgotten it, when asked years afterwards, on an occasion when for carrying out the changes I am about to refer to, it was deemed necessary to formally transfer it. The partnership, named Lords Company, moved part of their goods to another shop at Carleton, a mile or so away, and in course of time moved the entire stock into that shop and proceeded to have the partnership along with other subscribers formed into a joint stock company, under the name of \" Lords Limited,\" and explained to one Brow, an insurance agent at Charlottetown, that it had done so; and it was, of course, desirable to have that change made in the policy.\nBrow was the local agent of the appellant for Prince Edward Island and, when the policy could not be found in the bank, it occurred to him that possibly he had it at his office in Charlottetown, and he made search there, but failed to find it.\nBrow was the agent through whom the yearly premiums were paid for renewals of said policy, and, in meeting one of the said Lords Company, he undertook to see that it was made all right, or words to that effect, and the said firm, known as the Lords Company, and registered as such, accepted his assurance and continued to pay through him the annual premiums.\nThis arrangement was testified to by one of said Lords Company, and set forth by Brow in a letter to appellant's St. John, New Brunswick, agents.\nThe said firm, on the 10th January, 1921, became incorporated under the name of Lords Limited, soon after opening up business in said Carleton shop. The said incorporated company included a considerable number of other shareholders than the said Lords, respondents herein; the latter, however, were the largest shareholders.\nThe entire assets of the said partnership including said policy of insurance, then passed to the incorporated company, whom it became operative. The renewal receipts were not only passed through the hands of the said Brow but in later years, from and including that of 1918, had, generally, the name of \"E. R. Brow, Agent, Charlottetown\" stamped thereon.\nThe last of these which is dated as of 24th January, 1923, reads as follows:\u2014\nSCOTTISH UNION & NATIONAL\nInsurance Company of Edinburgh, Scotland.\nHead Office for North America,\nHartford, Conn.\nRenewal Receipt No. 734451.\nAgency at St. John, N.B.\nPolicy No. 4,821,280 issued to Messrs.

J. H. Vreeland,\nManager.\nCountersigned 24th day of January, 1923\nSgd. C. R. Brow. Sgd. J. M. & C. W. Hope Grant,\nAgent.\nOn the night of the 19th of February, 1923, a fire took place which burnt up the whole shop and stock and led to the company passing into bankruptcy.\nOn the 23rd of February, Lords Limited made an assignment in bankruptcy, under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, to The Canadian Creditmen's Trust Association, Limited, an authorized trustee under The Bankruptcy Act, and under the provisions of The Bankruptcy Act, the assets of Lords Limited became vested in the Canadian Creditmen's Trust Association, Limited, as\nthe trustee of the property of Lords Limited, Authorized Assignor, for the general benefit of the creditors of Lords Limited.\nAnd at that time there was written (by pen) across said receipt above quoted, the following:-\u2014\nFebruary 23,\/23, assigned to Canadian Credit Men's Association.\nE. W. Manson,\nTrustee Lords Limited.\nW. W. Lord.\nThe appellants were notified of said fire loss and, as I hold, proofs of loss were clearly made out.\nThere were seven other policies on the goods in question besides that of appellant, and the goods in the shop were found by the adjuster to be reduced in value so much from what had been there that in fact the share of liability as fixed by the adjuster was about half of the insurance.\nHence the claim on this $2,000 was fixed by him at $1,011.23.\nEach of the other seven insurance companies concerned paid its respective share of the loss to the said respondent, the Assignee in Bankruptcy, but the agents of the appellant, at St. John, N.B., seemed inclined to pursue a devious course from the outset, and finally referred the claim to some superior, and appellant declined to pay anything.\nHence this action, which seems to me to have been fairly tried by the learned Chief Justice of Prince Edward Island, with a jury. No objection was taken to his charge to the jury by counsel on either side.\nCounsel for the appellant moved for a non-suit and that was overruled, but leave reserved to move before the court en banc.\nThe jury found for the respondents for the said sum of $1,011.33.\nThe appellant availed itself of the leave to move for a non-suit and at same time asked for a new trial, but it is asserted in respondents' factum that no exception was then taken to the admission or rejection of evidence or the learned trial judge's charge. And that seems amply borne out by reading the notice of motion which takes no such objection, though objections from (a) to (h) were taken at which I am surprised to see in (i) that it is objected no proof of the incorporation of the company and yet I find the certified copy of the original patent therefore amongst the exhibits and, in the evidence of Mr. Lord, a statement as to who were appointed the officers, in way of organization thereunder.\nI need not be surprised therefore that when dealing with such notice of motion it took five days to hear it.\nIt seems the trial took three days.\nThe appellant seems to have had ample scope given it to present its case. Yet it presented no evidence, though Brow was present under a subpoena duces tecum, issued by and served on him for the plaintiffs.\nI am sorry to find that for want of a stenographer we have not a sentence of the learned judge's charge, but must assume that he dealt properly with the mass of written evidence, as well as the oral evidence, and that the jury were given to understand its import in law if found by them true in fact.\nIf they were, then certainly there was ample evidence which the learned trial judge was bound in law to submit to the jury for its consideration to find upon and hence he could not properly have either ruled upon the motion for a non-suit, or directed the jury to find for the defendant as if in law no case made out.\nThe appellant pretends before us that its New Brunswick office never knew of the transfer of stock insured, from Cape Traverse to the Carleton shop, previously to the fire or of responsibility in respect of such loss.\nI submit that the correspondence on file amongst the exhibits herein demonstrates that this is quite unfounded.\nIts local agent, Brow, having been notified immediately after the fire of what had occurred, sent the appellant's agent at St. John, New Brunswick, a telegram on the 20th February, 1923, and immediately after, on same date the following letter of same date:\u2014\nCharlottetown, P.E.I.,\nFebruary 20, 1923.\nThe Scottish Union & National Insurance Company, St. John, N.B.\nGentlemen:\nRe 4821280 Lords Co.\nI beg to advise that a loss occurred about 11.30 last night under above policy, from cause unknown.\nIt appears that there was an open rink near the premises, and the assured allowed the skaters to take off their skates in his office, and while he was in the basement the fire originated in his office.\nI am sorry to report that it is considered a total loss.\nYours truly,\nE. R. Brow.\nAnd another of same date enclosing copy of the said telegram, and got in reply the following:\u2014\nSt. John, N.B.\n20th February, 1923.\nE. R.

Island.\nDear Sir,\u2014On receipt of your favour of 20th inst., advising origin of fire, we considered it advisable to wire you as follows, which we confirm:\u2014\n\"Letter received. Notify Beer not to compromise company, Lords Loss.\" We are of the opinion that the origin of fire and occupancy of premises should be first fully placed before the Head Office of interested companies.\nRe Pomeroy Loss:\nWe will be glad to receive particulars in connection with this claim. Is it the same loss in which an aged widow was burned to death?\nYours very truly,\nJ. M. & C. W. Hope Grant.\nPer J.M.G.\nOn the 1st of March, 1923, Mr. Brow, the local agent, wrote the St. John, New Brunswick agents the following letter:\u2014\nCharlottetown, P.E.I.,\nMarch 1, 1923.\nMessrs. J. M. & C. W. Hope Grant,\nSt. John, N.B.\nGentlemen,\u2014\nRe Lord & Company Loss.\nI have your wire stating \"notify Beer not to compromise company Lord loss.\" Am I to understand that the company repudiates the liability, owing to the office being used that night by the skaters for changing their boots? Or would you mind telling me what is the objection held by the company? At the same time I would be very much obliged if you would kindly give me Mr. Beer's instructions in the matter, as no doubt this week matters will be adjusted one way or the other.\nYours truly,\nE. R. Brow.\nAnd their reply thereto contains, in the first paragraph thereof, the following:\u2014\nYour esteemed favour 1st inst. to hand, contents noted. Our wire to you conveyed no advice as to the company repudiating liability, but simply asked you to advise Mr. Beer not to compromise the company. The custom among adjusters is when a case of a similar nature such as change in occupancy takes place, is to send his report to the head offices, giving full particulars of the occupancy of the building at the time of fire, origin of fire; then the Loss Departments go into the situation.\nand after explaining further, ends by saying they are practically ignorant of the particulars of the loss.\nI submit that the foregoing correspondence in which New Brunswick people were so prompt in responding and giving directions relative to the course to be pursued by Brow the local agent of the appellant, and Beer the adjuster, sheds some light upon the pretence that these New Brunswick agents should have known, but did not, that the stock had been moved to Carleton and a new business started there intended to be covered by appellant's policy herein in question. No inquiry made in course thereof as to what it meant that there had been a change in occupancy, though the expression in the quotation above, to my mind, conclusively demonstrated that the writer was quite conversant with the fact of change of occupancy itself.\nI have read all the remaining correspondence in evidence herein, including numerous letters, and find nothing inconsistent with my drawing the conclusion that I have just suggested; and I, therefore, am confirmed therein.\nI am, however, left in doubt as to what respective fields of authority the agents at St. John, New Brunswick, and Mr. Brow at Charlottetown, possessed.\nWe have no direct evidence bearing upon the point although Mr. Brow was in court during the trial and could easily have been called by appellant to explain definitely all relating thereto.\nHence we are driven by reason of the objections taken herein to consider the circumstances which are in, evidence.\nThe entire business of the appellant in Prince Edward Island, except the issuing of the policy of insurance and of receipts for premiums of renewals thereof, would seem in fact to have been entrusted to Brow, the local agent.\nAnd the sworn statement required by the provisions of the \"Companies Taxing Act, 1915, of the province of Prince Edward Island\" the appellant's manager at Hart ford shews that its head office, without the province, then was in Edinburgh, Scotland, and its chief office, within the province, at Charlottetown.\nThe provisions of said Act are continued in the Taxation Act of 1920, to which we have our attention called.\nIt continues, I think, the provisions of the Taxation Act of Prince Edward Island for 1915.\nBrow, according to the testimony of Mr. Newberry, the Assistant Provincial Secretary-Treasurer, was named in some letter he refers to, or seems to have referred to, when in the witness stand, as the agent of appellant.\nThen we have the provisions of the provincial Act, 11 Geo. V, assented to 27th April, 1921, which seem to render it imperative that a general agent must be appointed for the province for each of such companies, as of the appellant's class, to carry on business therein. Indeed it is so inconceivable that either Brow or his superiors could venture to do so and incur the penalties for its non observance, that it must be presumed the law was observed, and that Brow was appellant's general agent for Prince Edward Island.\nI am of the opinion that the evidence in this case on behalf of the respondents at the trial (including the written as well as oral evidence) presents such a case of holding out by appellant of Mr. Brow as the general agent for Prince Edward Island, ever since 1915, that his acts bind appellant, and that view is greatly strengthened by these enactments for the times over which they were in force.\nIt is to be observed that all that legislation was in force at the time in question when the respondents Lords and Lords Limited had to apply to Brow as appellant's agent in respect of the transfer of the policy in question from them to the Lords Limited, and failed to find it, but got the assurance above referred to.\nSince so writing of it I have found in the correspondence filed herein, the following letter from Brow to the New Brunswick agents:\u2014 March 10, 1923.\nMessrs. J. M. & C. W. Hope Grant,\nSt. John, N.B.\nGentlemen,\u2014\nRe 4821280\u2014 Lords & Co.\nYou will notice by the wording of above policy that the stock insured was located at Cape Traverse, while the fire was at Carleton, about a mile farther north. I called on Messrs. Lords in September last, and I have a memoranda made that day on a piece of wrapping paper on which I put the number of company \" Lords Co. to Lords Ltd., transfer to Carleton,\" meaning that this policy was to be transferred from Lords Co. to Lords Ltd., and transfer covering the policy to Carleton instead of Cape Traverse as formerly.\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter written to Lords Ltd., on my return home, dated 27th September, in which I stated that the policy might be in the Royal Bank as they could not find it for me on Saturday. This policy is still made payable to the Royal Bank and its location at Cape Traverse, but I presume the inference would be that the risk would be covered at Carleton, because as soon as the policy could be delivered to us the endorsement would be made.\nI may say that nothing further has been done in the matter of adjustment of claim, as Lords Ltd. made an assignment some days ago, and the meeting of the creditors is to be held next Wednesday. I have been served with attaching orders, and I am enclosing same herewith.\nAs soon as anything definite is arrived at, I will inform you.\nYours truly,\nSgd. E. R. Brow.\nThe reply of the New Brunswick office thereto was as follows:\u2014\nSt. John, N.B.,\n13th March, 1923.\nE. R. Brow, Esq.,\nCharlottetown, P.E. Island.\nRe Policy No. 4821280 Lords Co.\nDear Sir,\u2014We are in receipt of your favour under date 10th inst., with enclosures as noted. We hardly think it necessary to remind you not to in any way, under existing conditions, compromise the company.\nWe wrote you on the 7th inst., asking for Mr. Beer's report on. the situation and assume that it will come to hand at an early date.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd). J. M. & C. W. Hope Grant.\nP.S.\u2014Please return Pomeroy loss payment receipts mailed you 3rd inst., for stamp affixment and oblige.\nJ. M. & C. W. Hope Grant.\nIt is to be observed there is not a word of repudiation of Brow's authority to act, as he tells them what had transpired.\nThese gentlemen seem to have been inclined to hide everything lest the appellant company would be compromised, for they had tried the same expedient in a variety of ways with Beer, the adjuster, who, notwithstanding, in his report as such, refers thus to the matter:\u2014\nIn the meantime it transpired that a policy for $2,000, issued by the Scottish Union and National Insurance Company had not been properly endorsed to transfer the covering from Lords Company's store in Cape Traverse, where they formerly did business, to their store in Carleton, where the entire business had been removed some year or more ago. This endorsement had been asked for by Lords Limited of Mr. E. R. Brow, the Agent of the Scottish Union and National, and he had made a memorandum and agreed to the transfer, verbally, and asked Mr. Lord to send him the policy for endorsement, it being distinctly understood between Mr. Brow, the Agent, and Mr. Lord, the Manager, that the transfer had been made. Owing to the inability of Mr. Lord to find the policy, which apparently had been in the hands of the bank, the endorsement was never made, but the agent here claims that he considers the company was on the risk at Carleton and not at Cape Traverse, where the Lords Company had ceased to do business and had no goods.\nFollowing this, on the 13th day of February, this policy was renewed by a renewal receipt duly sent to the Lords Company which would shew that the company were still on the risk and as this was the only store and stock which Lords Limited owned the intention was to cover same notwithstanding the fact that the policy read Cape Traverse instead of Carleton.\nUpon presentation of the facts to Messrs. J. M. & C. W. Hope Grant, the General Agents of the Scottish Union and National, at St. John, N.B., and for whom Mr. Brow is a subagent, they after consideration declined to admit any liability under the policy. As Adjuster and after going into the matter carefully and thoroughly with Mr. Lord, the Manager, and Mr. Brow, the Agent of the company, I am convinced that the Scottish Union and National should be liable for their proportion of the loss, but they refuse to have claim papers completed including them in the adjustment.\nAt the meeting yesterday between the Trustee, Inspectors, Mr. Lord and the Adjuster the facts regarding this policy were explained and the Trustee and his Advisers suggested that inasmuch as the Scottish Union and National consider themselves not liable that the other insuring companies should contribute the total amount of the loss. As Adjuster I objected that this did not seem fair to the other issuing companies and I refused to make out claim papers on that basis and now wish to submit the matter to you and ask for instructions.\nThis from any one engaged, as he testified he had been, in the insurance business since 1890, and as adjuster since 1917 or 1918, should have been considered by appellant.\nIn connection with this I may as well advert to the evidence of Mr. Beer, where he says, incidentally, that the rate for Cape Traverse is lower than for Carleton; that the rate at the former seems to have been $35 on this policy and later moved up to $42.\nFor the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the first two grounds of this appeal, as to error of the court below, as stated in appellant's factum, are as follows:\u2014 (1) In failing to hold that the defendant did not insure the goods in the store at Carleton (unless the same was effected by an oral policy, which was not within the authority of the local agent).\n(2) In holding that there had been a waiver of conditions 3, 5 and 11a of the original policy.\n(3) In failing to hold that there was misjoinder of the parties plaintiff,\nand have been fully answered.\nAnd as to the third ground there is I submit, nothing involved but a question of procedure regarding which this court has uniformly refused to interfere, unless there has been some grave question of natural justice sure to be done to the appellant, which clearly is not this case.\nIndeed we have many times had to send cases back for a new trial because all the parties concerned had not been brought before the court.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs thereof and of the motion made to quash the appeal.\nI cannot imagine it ever was intended by the subsection (b) of the now section 36, to extend the operation of the Supreme Court Act to deal with such a record as this was at the date when the leave to appeal was given with two demurrers then still undisposed of.\nThe purview of the Act has always been held to be, and, I submit, still has to be, that the final decision of the last court of resort in the province has been reached before coming here. To allow an appeal with outstanding and undisposed of demurrers in the case is not desirable, and was never intended.\nI may be permitted to add that a motion to quash this appeal was fully argued at the opening of this case before us which I, at the close thereof, very firmly announced my opinion that the appeal should be quashed, but, as I seemed to stand alone in that view, I suggested, as has often been done in such like cases, that the hearing of the appeal be gone on with and both the motion to quash and the merits of the appeal be considered together, and the appeal was then argued fully by counsel for each side respectively.\nIt seemed to me then unlikely that the motion to quash would prevail and hence I fully examined the case on its merits, with the foregoing result, written prior to our final conference.\nAt our conference thereafter to finally consider the case I discovered that the majority had reconsidered their atti- tude to the motion to quash, and hence the result that will appear in the respective notes of judgment herein.\nWhen motions to quash and hearing of them and the appeal are left to be considered together, it has frequently happened heretofore that some members of the court adopt one ground and others another for disposing of the case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. D. Stewart.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J. A. Bentley.\n[1] [1924] 4 D.L.R. 259.\n"

Partridge v. Mallandaine[7]; Salt Lake City v. Hollister[8].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (the Chief Justice and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Audette in the Exchequer Court on a stated case which he directed the parties to submit on \"the questions of law arising upon the facts as stated in the pleadings.\" The appellant, describing himself as a garage proprietor carrying on business in the city of Windsor, Ontario, had appealed to the Exchequer Court from an assessment under the Income War Tax Act, 1917, and amendments, in the sum of $28,632.23, on his income for the year 1920 amounting to $92,020. On this appeal the learned judge ordered the filing of formal pleadings. The appellant's statement of claim, so called, alleged as grounds of his appeal that, in addition to his usual occupation, he had carried on the business of trafficking in liquor within Ontario, contrary to the provisions of the Ontario Temperance Act, and that profits so made by him were not taxable income within the proper interpretation of the Income War Tax Act. The respondent's statement of defence, also so-called, in substance denied that these profits were not taxable income under the Act. Upon these pleadings the learned judge ordered the preparation, under rule 161 of the Exchequer Court, of the stated case above referred to. Both the appellant and the\" respondent have concurred in this case which is in the following terms:\u2014 The following case is stated for the opinion of the court under an order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Audette, dated the 15th day of April, 1924, made pursuant to Rule 161 of the Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe appellant during the year 1920 gained certain profits within the province of Ontario by operations in the illicit traffic of liquor contrary to the existing provincial legislation in that respect. Upon the said profits the appellant has been assessed for Income Tax pursuant to the provisions of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, and amendments thereto. The validity of the assessment, in so far as it includes the said profit as a basis for computing the tax as assessed, is in dispute.\nThe question for the opinion of the court is:\n(1) Are the profits arising within Ontario from the illicit traffic in liquor therein, contrary to the provisions of the said existing provincial legislation in that respect, \"income\" as defined by section 3, subsection 1 of the Income War Tax, 1917, and amendments thereto, and liable to have assessed, levied and paid thereon and in respect thereof the taxes provided for in the said Act.\nDated this 15th day of May, A.D. 1924.\nGeo. D. McEwen,\nAppellant's Solicitor.\nC. F. Elliott,\nSolicitor for the Minister of Finance.\nThe learned judge, having answered the question submitted by the stated case in the affirmative, dismissed the appeal of the appellant. The latter now appeals to this court.\nThis appeal must be decided upon the case stated by the parties, in which both of them have concurred. The point therefore to be determined is whether the profits in question are \"income\" within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act.\nThe Act defines \"income\" as follows:\u2014\n3. (1) For the purposes of this Act \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be, whether derived from sources within Canada or elsewhere, and shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and, whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not, and also the annual profit or gain from any other source; including the income from but not the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent; and including the income from but not the proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the person insured, or payments made or credited to the insured on life insurance endowment or annuity contracts upon the maturity of the term mentioned in the contract or upon the surrender of the contract, and including the salaries, indemnities or other remuneration of members of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada and officers thereof, members of provincial legislative councils and assemblies and municipal councils, commissions or boards of management, any judge of any Dominion or provincial court appointed after the passing of this Act, and of all persons whatsoever whether the said salaries, indemnities or other remuneration are paid out of the revenues of His Majesty in respect of his Government of Canada, or of any province thereof, or by any person, except as provided in section five of this Act, with the following exemptions and deductions.\nIt is argued that the language of this definition is wide enough to include income derived from a business the carrying on of which is expressly prohibited by law. So would it be wide enough to comprise gains resulting from the commission of crimes, such as burglary or highway robbery, if such crimes, as often happens, be resorted to habitually as a means of making a gain or profit.\nThe real question however is whether we should place on the statute a construction which implies that Parliament intended to levy this income tax on the proceeds of crime or on the gain derived from a business which cannot be carried on without violating the law. Such a business should be strictly suppressed, and it would be strange indeed if under the general terms of the statute the Crown in right of the Dominion could levy a tax on the proceeds of a business which a provincial legislature, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, has prohibited within the province.\nMoreover what may be called the machinery clauses of the Act (sections 7 et seq.) clearly shew that it never was contemplated that an income tax would be levied on the gains derived from illicit businesses or from the commission of crime. Thus every person liable to taxation must make to the Minister, on or before April 30, in each year, a return of his total income during the last preceding year. If the Minister, in order to be able to make an assessment or for any other purpose, desires any information or additional information, he may demand it by registered letter and the taxpayer is obliged to furnish this information within thirty days. The Minister may also require the production of any letters, accounts, invoices, statements, books or other documents, or he may have an inquiry made by an officer thereunto authorized by him, and if the taxpayer fails or refuses to keep adequate books or accounts for income tax purposes, the Minister may require him to keep such records and accounts as he may prescribe. Any information thus obtained is treated as confidential and its divulgement is prohibited.\nI think the inference irresistible that the taxpayer's return of income, the additional information which may be demanded by the Minister, the books and accounts which may be inspected, and the accounts and records which the Minister may require the taxpayer to keep are all in respect of businesses which may be legally carried on. It is difficult to conceive of the Minister requiring criminals to furnish information as to profits derived from the commission of crime, or demanding from them the keeping of books or records of their illicit and criminal operations. Furthermore if the gains derived from crime are within the contemplation of the statute, then the expenses incurred in making these gains, e.g. in the employment of criminal agents, would be chargeable as deductions against these gains, and, as to all information furnished by the wrongdoer, there would be a promise of secrecy for his protection. It is impossible to believe that anything like this was contemplated by Parliament.\nOn the interpretation of this statute\u2014and no question arises as to the power of Parliament to impose income tax on the avails of crime\u2014I would therefore conclude that income tax is not imposed by it on such a business as that described in the stated case.\nThe learned trial judge relied on the case of Partridge v. Mallandaine[9], where it was held that persons receiving profits from betting systematically carried on by them throughout the year, are chargeable with income tax on such profits in respect of a \"vocation\" under 5 & 6 Vict., ch. 35 (the Imperial Income Tax Act), Sched. D. See also Graham v. Green[10].\nAt page 278 of the report in 18 Q.B.D., Denman J. said:\u2014\nI think the word \"vocation\" is not limited to a lawful vocation, and that even the fact of a vocation being unlawful could not be set up against the demand for income tax.\nIt is to be remarked however that this statement was not necessary for the decision of the case, for the betting in question was not considered as unlawful, although of course no action would have lain to recover the bets. Indeed Hawkins J. observed that \"mere betting is not illegal. It is perfectly lawful for a man to bet if he likes.\"\nBut the learned trial judge quotes the following dictum attributed to Denham J. in the report of Partridge v. Mallandaine in 2 Tax Cas. 179.\nBut I go the whole length of saying that, in my opinion, if a man were to make a systematic business of receiving stolen goods, and to do nothing else, and he thereby systematically carried on a business and made a profit of \u00a32,000 a year, the Income Tax Commissioners would be quite right in assessing him if it were in fact his vocation.\nThe fact that in the official reports of the Queen's Bench Division no such dictum is attributed to the learned judge, would tend to shew that, assuming he used that language, he did not wish it to remain on record as a deliberate statement of his opinion. Moreover it would clearly be obiter, for obviously it was not necessary for the decision of the case.\nThe learned trial judge also considered that the appellant should not be heard to invoke\nhis own turpitude to claim indemnity from paying taxes and to be placed in a better position than if he were an honest and legal trader.\nThis appeal, however, must be decided solely on the case stated by the parties. Both the Minister of Finance and the appellant have equally concurred in framing, as a question of law, the question whether profits derived from the carrying on of a prohibited business are \"income\" within the meaning of the Act. It is not open to us to avoid answering this question on the ground that the appellant's claim, as the learned trial judge regarded it, is tainted with illegality. It is not clear, moreover, that the illegality of the profits in question was first set up by the appellant. For aught that appears it may have emerged in the imposition of the assessment.\nThe only question for decision is whether profits earned under the circumstances described in the stated case are \"income\" within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, and amendments. This question should be answered in the negative.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and judgment directed for the appellant quashing and setting aside the assessment with costs of the proceedings in the Exchequer Court.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant is alleged to have been engaged, in and during the year 1920 (besides his ordinary business of keeping a garage) in an illicit trafficking in intoxicating liquors, contrary to the provisions of the Ontario Temperance Act, and thereby to have obtained a very large income.\nThis action in the Exchequer Court would seem to have been brought as a means of testing his liability to taxation under the Dominion Income War Tax Act. The parties hereto agreed upon a stated case in which the following question was submitted for the opinion of the said court.\n(1) Are the profits arising within Ontario from the illicit traffic in liquor therein, contrary to the provisions of the said existing provincial legislation in that respect,, \"income\" as defined by section 3, subsection 1 of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, and Amendments thereto and liable to have assessed, levied and paid thereon and in respect thereof the taxes provided for in the said Act.\nThe case so submitted was heard by Mr. Justice Audette of said court.\nThe said learned judge answered the said question in the affirmative and accordingly dismissed the action with costs. Hence this appeal therefrom.\nI, with due respect, cannot, after fully considering the arguments adduced before us, and the reasons assigned by the said learned judge in support of said judgment, agree with the conclusion so reached. I cannot bring myself to believe that Parliament ever had in its serious contemplation, in enacting the said Income War Tax Act, of 1917, or any amendments thereto, the conception of taxing any profits or money raised from such a criminal source.\nThe assertion of such an intention or purpose would.be such a novelty in the way of expressing income taxation Acts, here and elsewhere, that I should expect to find the intention or purpose expressed in such clear and unambiguous terms as the law has uniformly required all taxing Acts to be, so that there can be no doubt as to their meaning.\nThe rule in that regard is well stated in Hardcastle's Statute Law, at page 126, the 3rd ed. as follows:\u2014\nBut for certain purposes express language in statutes is absolutely indispensable, and of those specified the first-named is that imposing a tax. Numerous cases are cited by the author and are easily available.\nI do not intend to elaborate for the fact that this seems to be the first occasion of an attempt to place such an interpretation upon an Act which, in all the essential features in question herein, has been the same since its enactment in 1917, and the Ontario Temperance Act was first enacted a year previous to this taxing Act.\nWith all due respect for those promoting such legislation it was evident to thinking men that such a class as appellant ranks in would spring up.\nThe \"Bootleggers,\" as the profiteers under the Ontario Temperance Act are commonly called (though anticipated as I say by thinkers), may not have reached such prominence as to attract attention within the year I refer to, but they certainly became (if common report and knowledge thereupon is any guide), very prominent before the taxing Act was for a year or so in its actual operation.\nThe fact that it was not attempted to be applied till the year 1920, if then, demonstrates that it had not been expressed in the way required, as I have cited authority for. Hence I cannot see how it can be pretended to have fallen within the indispensable requirements of a taxing Act.\nAnd one curious feature about such profits being a source of taxable income, is the enactment in the Temperance Act, 6 Geo. V (Ont.) c. 50, section 57, which reads as follows:\u2014\n57. Any payment or compensation for liquor furnished in contravention of this Act or otherwise, in violation of the law, whether made in money or securities for money, or in labour or property of any kind, shall be held to have been received without any consideration and against justice and good conscience, and the amount or value thereof may be recovered from the receiver by the party who made the same.\nWhere could the profits come from if the price paid belonged to some one else?\nFor the foregoing reasons I would allow the appeal with costs and answer the question put in the negative.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: George D.

Board made an order directing that a part of the township of Sandwich W., comprising the whole of school section No. 11, should be annexed to the city of Windsor. The order was to take effect on Jan. 1, 1922, but by arrangement the former trustees continued to manage the affairs of the school section until April 1. At the end of 1921 the school section had a balance on hand and received in March, 1922, $4,000 from the township council on account of taxes for 1921, and in February, 1922, $200 the statutory contribution to teachers\u2019 salaries for 1921.\nHeld that as the school section became for all school purposes part of the urban municipality on January 1, 1922, and as the money in question was proceeds of or chargeable against the rates of 1921, the urban Board of Education was entitled to recover, the annexation operating to transfer the school to the city as a going concern.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the appellant.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note. A portion of Sandwich West comprising school section No. 11 having been annexed to the city of Windsor from Jan. 1, 1922, the trial judge held that the surplus moneys on hand representing the collection of taxes for 1921 should be paid to the City Board of Education. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division which ordered that moneys paid or advanced by the township council should be returned and the balance distributed among the 1921 ratepayers. The city appeals from the latter judgment.\nF.D. Davis K.C. for the appellant.\nJohn Sale for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (the Chief Justice and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The municipal corporation of the city of Windsor brought this action by writ of summons issued out of the Supreme Court of Ontario against the defendant Catherine C. Turner, the secretary-treasurer of school section no. 11, which formerly belonged to the township of Sandwich West, to recover the sum of $5,535.28, alleged to be money of the school section in her hands to which the plaintiff was entitled. There were no pleadings, but a consent order was made by the local judge in chambers directing the joinder of parties and the trial of an issue. The Board of Education of the city of Windsor was added as a plaintiff, and Parker Dickinson and the treasurer of the township of Sandwich West were added as defendants, Dickinson as representing the ratepayers of the school section. By this order it was directed that\nthe question to be tried shall be which of the said parties is entitled to the said moneys in the hands of the defendant Turner, being taxes collected from the ratepayers of the said public school section no. 11 and in the hands of the defendant Turner as hereinbefore stated.\nThe issue as stated by the plaintiffs in pursuance of the order, and which was tried, is expressed as follows:\nThe plaintiffs affirm and the defendants deny that the plaintiffs are entitled to the sum of $5,535.28 in the hands of the defendant Catherine C. Turner at the date of the issue of the writ in this action being moneys in her hands for school purposes of section number 11, formerly in the township of Sandwich West but now within the city of Windsor.\nSchool section no. 11, in the township of Sandwich West, was contiguous to the city of Windsor. The Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, under section 21 of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, c. 72, by order of 29th December, 1921, directed that a parcel or tract of land in the township containing 48.9 acres more or less, and being composed of part of farm lot 68 in the 1st concession of the township, which was more particularly described in the order, should be annexed to and should thereafter form part of the municipality of the city of Windsor. The area so described and annexed comprises the whole of the school section which therefore, on and after 1st January, 1922, when by the order it was declared that the annexation should take effect, became subject to section 27, subsection 1, of the Public School Act, 1920, c. 100, which provides that:\n27. (1) Where part of a township becomes incorporated as or is annexed to and becomes part of an urban municipality such part shall for all school purposes be deemed to be part of the urban municipality, provided that when the part incorporated or annexed comprises or includes part only of a school section the municipalities interested, unless determined by agreement after the incorporation or annexation, shall each appoint an arbitrator who, with the judge of the county or district court, shall value and adjust in an equitable manner the rights and claims of all parties thereby affected, and shall determine by which municipality or part thereof the same shall be paid or settled.\nThe order of annexation according to its recitals was made upon reading the petition of a majority in number of the ratepayers resident in the portion of the township sought to be annexed and the resolution of the council of the city in favour of the annexation. By the order it is provided that the assessment of the lands annexed shall, for a period of five years, remain the same as that for 1921, also that the net cost of a lot purchased by the township for the extension of Wyandotte street is to be taken into account in the adjustment of assets and liabilities, and moreover that the question of rearrangement of the amount payable by the township under the Consolidated Essex Borders Utilities Act is a matter to be settled upon the consideration and adjustment of the accounts between the township and the city. These are the only terms or conditions fixed by the order as to the adjustment of assets and liabilities, taxation, assessment, improvements, or otherwise. The treasurer of the township states that there was an informal arrangement between him and the city that the latter would refund the amount of the debentures for local improvements payable by the township during the ensuing seventeen years. There was no other adjustment of assets and liabilities under the provisions of s. 38 of the Municipal Act or otherwise. In a case of this kind, where the municipal records and accounts are or should be available, there should be no room for dispute about the facts, nor is there any reason why a case should be presented in the unsatisfactory and confusing manner in which unfortunately this controversy is submitted. It is possible, however, to reach a conclusion. It would appear that the affairs of the school section were in a prosperous condition; at the end of 1921 it had in hand a balance of $3,235.89; although the school section for all school purposes became part of the urban municipality on 1st January, 1922, its former trustees nevertheless continued to manage its affairs until 1st April following; there is a letter in evidence of 25th March, 1922, from the secretary-treasurer of the Board of Education of the city to the defendant Mrs. Turner, stating that it had been decided that the board would take over the school on 1st April, and that the trustees of the school section were to pay all expenses including salaries, up to that date; and so it happened that the secretary treasurer, the respondent Turner, in the interval received the revenues which were paid for the benefit of the school section. These comprised, according to the proof, $200 received on requisition from the township on 25th February, 1922; $4,000 received on requisition from the township on 11th March, 1922, and $10 received from the county for the use of a polling booth on 8th March, 1922, amounting in all, including the balance on hand at the end of 1921, to $7,445.89. As against this are set off the expenses of conducting the school from 1st January to 1st April, 1922, $1,910.61; leaving a balance in hand, which is the amount in controversy, of $5,535.28. The amount of $200 received from the township on 25th February is thought to be the contribution of the council of the township under s. 96 of the Public Schools Act, 1920, for teachers\u2019 salary, and the $4,000, received on 11th March, is a payment or advance made by the township to the school section of or against taxes collected or to be collected for the year 1921 for the maintenance of the school. It is said that the taxes for any year were usually not collected until the beginning of the following year, and it would appear that counsel agreed, at least at an early stage of the trial, that the latter sum represented taxes for the year 1921; evidence was however subsequently given upon the subject which tends to establish the fact.\nIt is shewn that taxes were collected in 1922, and it would seem to be true that the moneys used by the trustees for the upkeep of the school in 1921 were the proceeds of the rates assessed in the preceding year, and that the rates assessed in 1921 would constitute the fund out of which the expenses of the school for 1922 should be paid. Mrs. Turner says in her evidence: Q. These sums of money that you had in hand, were they part of the moneys received from the township of Sandwich West, or the treasurer of Sandwich West during 1921?\nA. There was a balance of three thousand and some odd left over after running the school at the end of 1921.\nQ. As shown by that statement?\nA. Yes.\nQ. From the moneys received in 1921?\nA. Yes.\nThere is a requisition in the evidence dated 17th October, 1921, directed to the clerk of the township by the trustees of the school section, by which the trustees ask for a grant of $4,000 from the township for 1922, and stating that the treasurer is authorized to pay the money to the secretary of the Board of Trustees. It was in pursuance of this requisition that the $4,000 was paid on 11th March, 1922, and at the foot of the statement evidencing this payment, which is one of the plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits in the case, there is a note to the effect that at a regular meeting of the trustees held on 17th October, 1921, the trustees signed a letter asking for this grant for 1922. I think it is not an unjust inference that the money was paid by the township authorities for the school purposes of the trustees of the school section out of the proceeds of the rates of 1921, and that the intention of the trustees in making the requisition was to provide in ordinary course, at the beginning of 1922, for the charges which would come in course of payment during that year out of the appropriations provided for and raised in pursuance of the outstanding annual levy. This view is also in accordance with the finding of the learned judge at the trial because, although his findings are not very explicit, he states that if the moneys in court were paid back to them (meaning the ratepayers who contributed the school taxes for 1921), they would virtually escape taxation for school purposes for 1921. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal were of a different opinion and they decided that the sum of $4,200 should be repaid to the treasurer of the township, and that the balance should be distributed among the ratepayers of the school section which had been annexed; but, with great respect, I do not think that this view of the case can be maintained. The money in dispute was provided for and exigible for school purposes during 1921, while the section belonged to the township, and, in view of the annexation, the right to the money cannot I think be affected by the fact that it was actually paid later than it should have been. Even if the law granted the delay for payment which took place, there can I think be no doubt that the levy and the taxes paid were for 1921. The township clerk gives the following evidence:\nMr. Sale: What time of the year do you collect your taxes?\nAnswer: In the fall of the year, never finish up until springtime.\nHis Lordship: That is the way all municipalities do, isn\u2019t it?\nMr. Sale: They do not usually send them over until the next year.\nHis Lordship: I do not know how it is down here, but they all extend the time for payment up till about the first of May.\nMr. Sale: You collected at the end of the year?\nAnswer: The roll is out at the end of the year.\nHis Lordship: But the actual collection is not made.\nAnswer: Is not made until spring. They have to finish up before the first of May as a rule.\nHis Lordship: The roll is made out in December, but collections are not generally completed until\u2014\nWitness: April or May. Sometimes the first of May.\nHis Lordship: Until some time afterwards, anyway.\nMr. Sale: The first of March I think it calls for.\nHis Lordship: The levy is the levy for 1921?\nAnswer: Yes, my lord.\nQuestion: You made the levy for that year?\nAnswer: 1921, yes, my lord.\nQuestion: As a matter of curiosity, do you finance your township so that you levy enough at the end of that year to pay everything in the next year, or do you borrow against the levy?\nAnswer: The levy is made like 1921. The requisition\u2014\nQuestion: Never mind the school; do you have your money in advance, or do you borrow against the levy and pay the bank back?\nAnswer: We borrow when we have not got any money.\nQuestion: Do you expect to have enough on hand at the first of the year to finance the year?\nAnswer: To finance the year.\nQuestion: So the tax levied in 1921 is really for the estimated expenditure of 1922?\nAnswer: 1921.\nQuestion: The same year?\nAnswer: The same year.\nQuestion: But you are levying at the end of the year. Where do you get the money in the meantime?\nAnswer: Borrow it.\nQuestion: You borrow against the levy?\nAnswer: Against the levy unless the township instructs money ahead.\nAnd in another place the same witness affirms that\nthe school taxes which were paid to Mrs. Turner were school taxes that had been levied for the year 1921.\nNowhere does it appear that the township borrowed the money, or any part of it, to make up the $4,200, and, if it did, there should have been no difficulty to prove the fact; moreover, if the money were borrowed, the only consequence would be that there would be an outstanding liability of the township to the amount of the borrowed money to be provided for. If the management of the school had been taken over when the district was annexed, and if the money in question had at that time been in the hands of the authorities of the school section to which it was appropriated, and for which it was levied, it would naturally pass upon the annexation to the Board of Education of the city, which became the trustee or administrator of the affairs of the school, and the destination of the money would not, I should think, be affected by the fact that the money was actually paid somewhat later; neither would it be material that the trustees of the rural school district actually carried on the school and paid its liabilities, out of moneys appropriated for the purpose, for several months after it was annexed to the city. I think that in the absence of any competent adjustment affecting the assets and liabilities the urban Board of Education becomes entitled by the declaration of s. 27 of the Public Schools Act, that the district annexed\nshall for all school purposes be deemed to be part of the urban municipality;\nthis means that the school is taken over as a going concern. The taxes which were the source of the payments in question were devoted by the law to the maintenance of the school, and they ought not to be diverted from this purpose merely because of a change in the administrative authority.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge; the appellants are entitled to their costs of both appeals.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The school section No. 11 of the township of Sandwich West, was, by an order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, dated 29th December, 1921, annexed to the city of Windsor, one of the appellants herein, to become operative from and after the 31st December, 1921.\nThe respondent Catherine C. Turner was then the secretary-treasurer of the said school section, and so continued till the first of April, 1922, pending arrangements with the school board of the public schools of Windsor.\nAt the time of the said order she had on hand as such secretary-treasurer a balance of $3,235.89, and received on the 25th of February, 1922, on requisition to be paid in respect of taxes for the year 1921, $200 from the treasurer of the township of Sandwich West, and, again from the same source, on the 11th March, 1922, pursuant to a requisition made in October, 1921, $4,000.\nThe moneys are conclusively proven to have been paid in respect of taxes for the year 1921.\nThe respondent township some time after set up the contention that all these moneys belonged to the said respondent; by virtue of what pretension I am quite unable to understand.\nOf course if the payments had been made in respect of taxes for 1922, an entirely different legal puzzle might have arisen.\nThe appellant city claims that they are school funds which belonged to said school section 11, so annexed to said city, and passed thereby, as the result of said order of annexation; which would seem to be a reasonable conclusion of law and was so held by the learned trial judge, who tried an issue directed by consent of counsel for the respective parties.\nThereupon an appeal was taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario. That court overruled the judgment of the learned trial judge, and directed the said moneys to be paid to the treasurer of the respondent township, to be distributed amongst the ratepayers of the defunct school section.\nWhy the said respondent township by its counsel failed to claim the school buildings and the furniture as well, I cannot see, for, on their pretension, it would have been just as reasonable.\nIt is alleged that this judgment of the appellate court below was the result of a mistaken statement by the counsel for said township that the moneys in question, at least as to $4,200, were out of taxes due and arising out of the assessment and levy thereof for the year 1922. Hence this appeal from said reversing judgment. And said counsel reiterated same before us notwithstanding the clear evidence of those knowing the facts being pointed out to him. He pretended to claim herein that Par\u00e9, the treasurer of said township, who had paid the $4,200 to the school treas- urer, was so ignorant that he could not understand what he was doing.\nYet he had called as witness for his clients at the trial, this same Mr. Par\u00e9 and examined him in regard to the adjustment of several other matters which had arisen between appellant city and the township, but did not venture, in such examination to touch upon the vital question of whether it was for taxes arising out of 1921 assessment, as had been sworn to by several other witnesses previously called.\nI cannot understand such a course of conduct on the part of counsel.\nI, suspecting the possibility that there might have been debentures issued by the township for the school section, asked him if he knew whether there had been such or not, and he replied thereto that he did not know. If there had been I assume that the charge therefor would have been brought forward at the time of the other adjustments.\nOn the foregoing state of facts I am with great respect unable to agree with the judgment appealed from, and would allow this appeal with costs here and of the appeal below, to be paid by the said respondent township to the appellant, and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nI am surprised that counsel could not refer to any specific enactment dealing with such annexations, and the results arising therefrom, but the general purview of the legislation dealing with the consequences ensuing upon such like annexations certainly imply that the school house and all other assets of the rural school board pass in such a case to the city\u2019s school board\u2014subject, of course, to any liabilities of said rural school board, for example, debentures, if any, or salaries.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Davis, Healey & Plant.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John Sole.\n"

V, c. 27\u2014S.s. (7) added to s. 95, 9-10 Geo. V, c. 40 s. 3.\nSubsec. 7 added to sec. 95 of The Canada Grain Act, 1912, by 9-10 Geo. V, c. 40, sec. 3, is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Anglin C.J.C. diss.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court ([1924] Ex. C.B., 176) affirmed.\nThe Canada Grain Act was passed in 1912 to control and regulate, through The Board of Grain Commissioners, the trade in grain. It provides that all owners and operators of elevators, warehouses and mills and certain traders in grain, shall be licensed; for supervision of the handling and storage of grain in and out of elevators, etc.; and prohibits persons operating or interested in a terminal elevator from buying or selling grain. It contains, also, provisions for inspection and grading. It was amended in 1919 by adding to sec. 95 subsec. 7 which provides that if at the end of any crop year in any terminal elevator \"the total surplus of grain is found in excess of one-quarter of one per cent of the gross amount of the grain received in the elevator during the crop year\" such surplus shall be sold for the benefit of the Board.\nHeld, Anglin C.J.C. dissenting, that this subsection is only a part of the scheme of the Act to control and regulate the business, local and otherwise, of terminal elevators which it is not within the competence of Parliament to enact.\nHeld, per Duff and Rinfret JJ., that the legislation is not warranted by the fact that three-fourths of the trade in grain is export out of Canada. If Parliament can provide for control of the local business under that condition it must have power to do so whatever may be the extent of the export trade.\nPer Mignault J.\u2014Nor can the legislation be supported as relating to agriculture (B.N.A. Act, 1867, sec. 85). The subject matter is only a product of agriculture and an article of trade. It is trade legislation and not for the support or encouragement of agriculture.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] holding that the amendment in 1919 to the Canada Grain Act, sec. 95 (7), is ultra vires.\nThe material provisions of the Act are outlined, and the substance of the amendment set out in the above head-note and both appear at length in the reasons for judgment published herewith. Symington K.C. and Varcoe for the appellant.\nHoskin K.C. for the respondent.\nSymington K.C. and Varcoe for the appellant. The legislation in question may be justified under one or more of several enumerations in sec. 91 of the B.N.A. Act and also as legislation ancillary to the objects of the whole Act. It is sufficient if it is reasonably, not necessarily absolutely, ancillary. City of Toronto v. Canadian Pac. Ry. Co.[2]; Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General of Quebec[3] at page 421.\nThe grain trade has achieved national dimensions and Parliament may regulate it for the good government of Canada. See The King v. Manitoba Grain Co.[4]. See also Gold Seal Co. v. Dominion Express Co.[5] at page 456.\nAnd see Attorney General of North Dakota v. Farmers' Grain Co.[6].\nHoskin K.C. for the respondent. The Parliament of Canada has no more power to enact subsec. 7 than it had in The Reciprocal Insurance Case, Attorney General of Ontario v. The Reciprocal Insurers[7].\nThe general power to make laws for peace, order and good government does not justify this legislation any more than in The Insurance Case7; The Board of Commerce Case[8]; or in the City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[9] nor does any of the provisions of sec. 91 B.N.A. Act.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I understand that a majority of the court has reached the conclusion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court holding s.s. 7 of s. 95 of the Canada Grain Act to be ultra vires must be affirmed. That the impugned subsection is not necessary to the project of the statute and that, taken alone, it encroaches on the provincial domain of local works and undertakings and property and civil rights (B.N.A. Act, s. 92 (10)-(13)), I conceive to be the basis of the judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court; and his view is shared by some members of this court. Another opinion condemns s.s. 7 as an incidental provision in a statute that does not come under any of the heads of Dominion legislative jurisdiction enumerated in s. 91 and contains many essential features which impinge on the provincial field and are so interwoven with other provisions, possibly in themselves unobjectionable, as not to be readily severable from them. Such legislation, they maintain, cannot be supported under the general power vested in Parliament to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nNo good purpose will be served by an elaborate exposition of the reasons which lead me respectfully to dissent from these views. I shall, therefore, merely outline them.\nAssuming that the Canada Grain Act as a whole is intra vires of Parliament, s.s. 7 of s. 95 seems to me to be defensible as an incidental enactment designed to promote the attainment of the purposes of the Act. It not only provides for the obtaining of revenue from persons and corporations instrumental and beneficially interested in the carrying out of the scheme which it sanctions, and to be applied towards the cost of working it, but it furnishes, perhaps, the best possible security that one of the main operations for which the Act provides, namely, the cleaning of the grain so that it will actually conform to the grade and quality called for by the Government certificate based on its prior inspection, will be honestly and efficiently carried out. It removes the greatest inducement to fraud or carelessness in the cleaning. Moreover any property right of the respondent in the surplus grain left in its elevator is very doubtful. The subsection would also seem to be defensible as regulatory of the licensed elevator company's remuneration. I cannot regard it as confiscatory. Toronto v. Can. Pac. Ry. Co.[10]. If Parliament has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the legislation as a whole, I am not prepared to condemn this ancillary provision as in excess of its powers.\nThe object of Parliament in enacting the Canada Grain Act was, in my opinion, to provide for the economical expeditious and profitable export and marketing abroad of what is to-day the most valuable product of Canada\u2014the most important subject of its trade and commerce\u2014its greatest source of wealth. The scheme of the Act is the constitution and regulation of machinery to effectuate that purpose. It provides, as only the Dominion Parliament can, for the control and handling of the grain from the moment it leaves the hands of the grower\u2014practically always in one of the Western Provinces\u2014until its shipment in Ontario or one of the eastern provinces for the foreign market accompanied by a government certificate of its grade and quality, upon the acceptance of which in that market the Canadian shipper can depend. Main features of this scheme are the inspection of the grain in transit at Winnipeg by Dominion Government officials and the cleaning, storing and handling of it, subsequent to inspection, under such control and supervision that it can properly and safely be accompanied on shipment by the Government certificate of grade and quality which forms the basis of our Canadian foreign grain trade. No single province could legislate to cover this field. Concurrent legislation by all the provinces interested, if practicable (which I doubt), would be ineffectual to accomplish the purpose. Dominion legislation is required. Apart from the fact that a provicial certificate would not carry the weight and authority attaching to a certificate issued under Dominion sanction, the necessary control over transit and handling in different provinces and ultimate shipment could not be exercised under provincial legislation.\nI regard the subject matter of the Canada Grain Act, therefore, as lying outside the scope of the powers entrusted to the legislatures by the sixteen heads of provincial legislative jurisdiction contained in s. 92. Insurance reference[11].\nIt is established that in legislation properly ascribable to the exercise of jurisdiction conferred by one of the enumerative heads of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, the Dominion Parliament is supreme. Such legislation, even in provisions properly ancillary, may deal with matters that would fall under provincial jurisdiction, if they were not appurtenant to a subject specifically assigned to the Dominion. Viscount Haldane, in the judgment cited, attributes the like right to Parliament\nwhen the subject matter (of its legislation) lies outside all the subject matters enumeratively entrusted to the province under s. 92. This view was reiterated by his Lordship in the Lemieux Act Case when, referring to Russell v. The Queen, he says, at p. 410:\nIt has been observed subsequently by this committee that it is now clear that it was on the ground that the subject matter lay outside provincial powers * * * that the Canada Temperance Act was sustained.\nThat Act undoubtedly deals with some matters prima facie within s. 92.\nIn alluding to the Lemieux Act judgment I feel that I should respectfully take exception to the suggestion there made, that the Board which decided Russell v. The Queen (2) must be considered to have had before their minds an emergency putting the national life of Canada in unanticipated peril (p. 416) as the occasion of the enactment by Parliament of the Canada Temperance Act, 1878. Referring to this supposed emergency his Lordship says, at p. 412:\nTheir Lordships think that the decision in Russell v. The Queen (2) can only be supported to-day, not on the footing of having laid down an interpretation, such as has sometimes been invoked of the general words at the beginning of a. 91, but on the assumption of the Board, apparently made at the time of deciding the case of Russell v. The Queen (2), that the evil of intemperance at that time amounted in Canada to one so great and so general that at least for the period it was a menace to the national life of Canada so serious and pressing that the National Parliament was called on to intervene to protect the nation from disaster. An epidemic of pestilence might conceivably have been regarded as analogous.\nI cannot find anything in the judgment delivered by Sir Montague E. Smith in the Russell Case[12] suggestive of such a view having been entertained by the Judicial Committee. On the contrary, the whole tenor of the judgment seems to me inconsistent with its having proceeded on that basis. I should indeed be surprised if a body so well informed as their Lordships had countenanced such an aspersion on the fair fame of Canada even though some hard driven advocate had ventured to insinuate it in argument.\nBy its concluding paragraph, s. 91 declares that\nany matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces. The restriction of provincial legislative power, which this paragraph clearly imports, to \"matters of a local or private nature\" has perhaps not always received the attention to which it is entitled when there has been question whether the subject matter of a particular statute falls within provincial or Dominion jurisdiction.\nAlthough counsel for the appellants invoked several of the enumerated heads of Dominion legislative power\u2014the regulation of trade and commerce, the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation, weights and measures (s. 91, s.s. 2, 3, and 17), inter and extra-provincial transportation (s. 92 (10)), and agriculture (s. 95)\u2014the only one of them within which, in my opinion, the Canada Grain Act as a whole might fall would be \"the regulation of trade and commerce,\" unless, perhaps, inter and extra-provincial transportation might also be invoked. Attempts to uphold Dominion legislation under head no. 2 of s. 91 have hitherto received little ecouragement from the Judicial Committee. In Citizens' Ins. Co. v. Parsons[13], power to regulate by legislation the contracts of a particular business such as the business of fire insurance, was held not to fall within it; but it was stated (p. 113) that it would include\npolitical arrangements in regard to trade with foreign governments requiring the sanction of Parliament, regulation of trade in matters of inter-provincial concern and, it may be, * * * general regulation of trade affecting the whole Dominion.\nIn Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[14], however, the power of Parliament when legislating under this head to make laws applicable throughout Canada in regard to matters which in each province are substantially matters of local or private interest was held to be subject to like restrictions as those which apply to its general power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada in regard to subjects not enumerated in s. 91. Such legislation, as Lord Watson pointed out in the Local Prohibition Case[15], at p. 360,\nought not to trench on provincial legislation in respect to any of the subjects enumerated in s. 92.\nIn John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[16], on the other hand, not only was the passage in Citizens' Ins. Co. v. Parsons15, above referred to, approved (p. 340), but Viscount Haldane, while intimating that the head, \"the regulation of trade and commerce,\" in s. 91 must receive a limited application, said that it\nat all events enables the Parliament of Canada to prescribe to what extent the powers of companies the objects of which extend to the entire Dominion should be exercisable, and what limitations should be placed on such powers. For if it be established that the Dominion Government can create such companies, then it becomes a question of general interest throughout the Dominion in what fashion they should be permitted to trade. Their Lordships are, therefore, of opinion that the Parliament had power to enact the sections relied on in this case.\nBut in the Board of Commerce Case[17], at p. 198, his Lordship stated that effect had been given the legislative power conferred by s.s. 2 of s. 91 in the Wharton Case[18] in aid of powers conferred by the general language of s. 91\nbecause the regulation of the trading of Dominion companies was sought to be invoked only in furtherance of a general power which the Dominion possessed independently of it.\nIn the still later Lemieux Act[19] decision, at p. 409, his Lordship alludes to the Wharton Case20 as illustrating \"a really definite effect\" given to the Dominion power over the regulation of trade and commerce\nwhen applied in aid of what the Dominion Government is specifically enabled to do independently of the general regulation of trade and commerce, for instance in the creation of Dominion companies with power to trade throughout the whole of Canada.\nHe adds, at p. 410, referring to Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta[20]:\nIt is, in their Lordships' opinion, now clear that, excepting so far as the power can be invoked in aid of capacity conferred independently under other words in s. 91, the power to regulate trade and commerce cannot be relied upon as enabling the Dominion Parliament to regulate civil rights in the provinces.\nThe incorporation of Dominion companies, which is held to be competent to Parliament, does not fall under any enumerative head of s. 91. It rests on the general power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in matters not entrusted to the provinces by s. 92. That power does not warrant an encroachment on the provincial domain[21]. While it is held that the power to regulate trade and commerce, operating independently and as an enumerated head of Federal legislative jurisdiction, does not justify such an encroachment, the Board of Commerce case and the Lemieux Act decision are authority for the statement that it may do so in furtherance or aid of powers conferred by the general language of s. 91. With the utmost respect, I fail to appreciate the reasoning on which this view is based. If neither the power conferred by the general language of s. 91, nor the power under the enumerative head No. 2, to regulate trade and commerce, taken independently, warrants Dominion legislation which trenches on the provincial field, if both powers are subject in this respect to the like restriction[22], I find rather elusive and difficult to understand the foundation for the view that legislation authorized only by the former may be so helped out by the latter that invasion by it of the provincial domain may thus be justified. But the decisive authority of the judgments which have so determined cannot now be questioned in this court. I defer to it.\nIf the view be sound that the subject matter of the Canada Grain Act, because it has mainly to do with the export trade in grain and the inter-provincial handling of it, and because of the magnitude of that trade and its vital importance to the entire trade and commerce of Canada\u2014to its very solvency as a nation\u2014is not\nwithin the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nbut lies outside that field and accordingly falls within \"the Dominion powers conferred by the general language of s. 91,\" may not \"the regulation of trade and commerce,\" on the authority of the passages to which I have referred in the decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Wharton Case[23], the Board of Commerce Case[24] and the Lemieux Act Case[25] (p. 409), be invoked as \"aiding Dominion powers conferred by the general language of s. 91\" and \"in furtherance of a general power which the Dominion Parliament possesses independently of it\" to support any necessary interference by the provisions of that Dominion statute with what might otherwise be regarded as subjects of provincial legislative jurisdiction?\nBut for their Lordships' emphatic and reiterated allocation of \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" to this subordinate and wholly auxiliary function, my inclination would have been to accord to it some independent operation, such as was indicated in Parsons' Case[26], and within that sphere, however limited, to treat it as appropriating exclusively to the Dominion Parliament an enumerated subject of legislative jurisdiction with consequences similar to those which attach to the other twenty-eight enumerative heads of s. 91. It is incontrovertible and readily apprehended that the subject matter of head No. 2 must be restricted as was indicated in Parsons' Case28 of which the authority has been frequently recognized in later decisions of the Judicial Committee. But that it should be denied all efficacy as an independent enumerative head of Dominion legislative jurisdiction\u2014that it must be excluded from the operation of the concluding paragraph of s. 91, except for the subsidiary and auxiliary purposes indicated in recent decisions,\u2014these are propositions to which I find it difficult to accede. They seem to me, with deference, to conflict with fundamental canons of construction and with the views expressed in Parsons' Case28. I am far from convinced that the regulation of Canada's export trade in grain, including all provisions properly ancillary to its efficient exercise, may not legitimately be held to come within Dominion legislative power conferred by clause no. 2 of sec. 91 operating independently as an enumerative head of federal jurisdiction. Gold Seal, Limited v. Attorney General for Alberta[27].\nBut apart from any assistance afforded by head No. 2 of s. 91, I would uphold the Canada Grain Act as a statute of which the\nsubject matter lies outside all of the subject matters enumeratively entrusted to the (provinces under s. 92,\nin which case, said Lord Haldane in the Insurance Reference[28], \"the Dominion Parliament can legislate effectively as regards a province.\" His Lordship cites Russell v. The Queen[29] as an instance of such a case.\nIn my view not only is the grain trade of Canada a matter of national concern and of such dimensions as to effect the body politic of the Dominion, but the provisions of the Canada Grain Act, with some possible exceptions, deal with matters which, as envisaged by that legislation, do not come within that class of matters of a local or private nature * * * assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nAs to most of them there is, therefore, no encroachment on the provincial domain. To enable the Dominion Government to exercise legislative control over links in the inter-provincial and extra-provincial operations of handling and transporting export grain so important as terminal elevators, I cannot think it necessary that each of them should be declared by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, or for the advantage of two or more provinces, although such declarations might, no doubt, with propriety be made. Any sections of the Canada Grain Act which may involve undue invasion of the provincial field could probably be readily identified and severed. None such has been shewn to be vital to the scheme of the Act as a whole.\nSo regarded the Canada Grain Act may, I think, be supported without having recourse to the existence of abnormal conditions involving some extraordinary peril to the national life of Canada, recently indicated as a justification for the invasion by Parliament of the provincial field when legislating under the general power conferred by s. 91. But if there should be in the statute provisions essential to its effective operation for the purpose aimed at which must be regarded as trenching on the provincial domain, and if it should therefore be deemed necessary to meet this test of their validity, I know of nothing more likely to create a national emergency in Canada than a judicial determination that the Dominion Parliament lacks the power to legislate for the regulation of the export grain trade of the country. It cannot be that Parliament must defer legislative action until a national emergency with attendant disaster has developed. To protect the national interest it assuredly may anticipate and ward off such an evil. There is an emergency connected with the movement of the grain crop at the end of each season incontrovertibly greater than any which can be supposed to have existed in 1878 with regard to the liquor traffic, and it is noteworthy that this emergency is specially recognized by Parliament in the provisions of the Bank Act for relaxing the restrictions upon the issue of paper money. Regarded as legislation essential to prevent such a financial crisis as would be not unlikely to ensue upon the relinquishment, voluntary or forced, of Dominion control over the grain trade, the Canada Grain Act might well withstand the test of validity suggested in the Board of Commerce[30], the Fort Frances[31] and the Lemieux Act[32] cases.\nBut, as already stated, that Act can, in my opinion, be successfully defended as a whole on the broader ground that, in the aspect in which they were viewed by Parliament, its vital provisions deal not with matters of a local or private nature properly the subject of provincial legislative jurisdiction, but rather with matters of Dominion importance and concern and, therefore, do not involve such interference with provincial jurisdiction as would prevent Parliament enacting them under its general power\nto make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects * * * assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nI accept the conclusion of the learned President of the Exchequer Court as to the basis on which the defendant's liability should be computed.\nI would for these reasons allow this appeal and maintain the plaintiff's action for the amount to be settled as indicated in the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of the learned President of the court below who tried this action, that the amendment to the Grain Act, upon which the action is rested, is ultra vires, and hence I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The Grain Act was passed in 1912. The authors of the legislation proceeded upon the view upon which the Dominion Parliament had acted in 1910 in enacting the Insurance Act, that, in exercise of the powers given by sec. 91 (2), for the regulation of trade and commerce, the Dominion Parliament could, by a system of licences and otherwise, regulate individual trades, both locally and in respect of interprovincial and external trade. The Act provides for a Board, to be known as the Board of Grain Commissioners, to be appointed by the Governor in Council, and this Board is invested with very wide powers. By sec. 20, the Board is empowered, with the consent of the Governor in Council, to make rules and regulations for the government, control and licensing of terminal and other elevators. By sec. 119, the Board shall\u2014\n(a) require all track-buyers arid owners and; operators of elevators, warehouses and mills, and all grain commission merchants and primary grain dealers to take out annual licences;\n(b) fix the amount of bonds to be given by the different operators of elevators, mills and flat warehouses and by grain commission merchants, track-buyers and primary grain dealers;\n(c) require the (person so licensed to keep books in form approved by the Board;\n(d) supervise the handling and storage of grain in and out of elevators, warehouses and cars;\n(e) enforce rules and regulations made under this Act.\nAnd by subsection (4), any person who engages in any business for which a licence is required, without obtaining such a licence, is declared guilty of an offence. Section 128 (2) specifically provides for the licensing of the owners of terminal elevators as public warehousemen. By sec. 123\nno person owning, managing, operating or otherwise interested in any terminal elevator shall buy or sell grain at any point in the Eastern or Western Inspection Division,\nsubject to certain exceptions not material. By sec. 153 it is specifically provided that the owner or lessee of a country elevator must be licensed to receive, ship, store or handle grain. By sec. 156 the Board is specifically authorized to promulgate regulations respecting country elevators.\nIn addition to the power of regulation conferred upon the Board, the Act contains elaborate substantive provisions defining the duties of persons engaged in the business of operating elevators, in respect of the cleaning of grain, the grading of, it, the storage of it; defines the effect of warehouse receipts, the rights of holders of them.\nBy secs. 210 et seq., provision is made for licensing persons in the Western Division to carry on the business of selling grain on commission; and persons not so licensed are prohibited from engaging in that occupation. By secs. 218 et seq. there is provision for licensing track-buyers, and prohibition against engaging in the occupation of a track-buyer without such a licence. By secs. 219 (a) et seq. there is a prohibition against carrying on the business of a primary grain dealer without first having obtained a licence to do so from the Board.\nThe Act is an attempt to regulate, directly and through the instrumentality of Grain Commissioners, the occupations mentioned. It is also an attempt to regulate generally elevators as warehouses for grain, and the business of operating them; and it seems, ex facie, to come within the decision of the Judicial Committee, Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta[33], condemning the Insurance Act of 1910 as ultra vires.\nMr. Symington, in a very able argument, attempted to support the Act on the ground that the trade in grain is largely an external trade (between seventy and eighty per cent, apparently, of the grain produced in the country is exported); and that the provisions of the Act are, on the whole, an attempt to regulate a branch of external trade, the provisions dealing with local matters being, as a rule, subsidiary and reasonably ancillary to the main purpose of the Act.\nIt is undeniable that one principal object of this Act is to protect the external trade in grain, and especially in wheat, by ensuring the integrity of certificates issued by the Grain Commission in respect of the quality of grain, and especially of wheat; and the beneficent effect and the value of the system provided by the legislation as a whole is not at all disputed by anybody. I do not think it is fairly disputable, either, that the Dominion possesses legislative powers, in respect of transport (by its authority over Dominion railways, over lines of ships connecting this country with foreign countries, over navigation and shipping); in respect of weight and measures; in respect of trade and commerce, interpreted as that phrase has been interpreted; which would enable it effectively, by properly framed legislation, to regulate this branch of external trade for the purpose of protecting it, by ensuring correctness in grading and freedom from adulteration, as well as providing for effective and reliable public guarantees as to quality. It does not follow that it is within the power of Parliament to accomplish this object by assuming, as this legislation does, the regulation in the provinces of particular occupations, as such, by a licensing system and otherwise, and of local works and undertakings, as such, however important and beneficial the ultimate purpose of the legislation may be. There are, no doubt, many provisions of this statute which, as they stand, can be sustained; with them we are not concerned at this moment. The particular provision which is sought to be enforced is one of a series of provisions which are designed to regulate elevators and the occupations of those who make it their business to operate elevators. The particular provision, if it stood alone, might, perhaps, be sustained as a tax, but it cannot be separated from its context; it is only one part of a scheme for the regulation of elevators. There is one way in which the Dominion may acquire authority to regulate a local work such as an elevator; and that is, by a declaration properly framed under section 92 (10) of the B.N.A. Act. See Union Colliery Co. of B. C. v. Bryden[34]. This, of course, is not to say that there may not be elevators subject to Dominion control, as being, for example, adjuncts of the undertaking of a Dominion railway or of a company operating a line of steamships under Dominion jurisdiction; but the general regulation of all elevators is a different matter.\nThere are two lurking fallacies in the argument advanced on behalf of the Crown; first, that, because in large part the grain trade is an export trade, you can regulate it locally in order to give effect to your policy in relation to the regulation of that part of it which is export. Obviously that is not a principle the application of which can be ruled by percentages. If it is operative when the export trade is seventy per cent of the whole, it must be equally operative when that percentage is only thirty; and such a principle in truth must postulate authority in the Dominion to assume the regulation of almost any trade in the country, provided it does so by setting up a scheme embracing the local, as well as the external and interprovincial trade; and regulation of trade, according to the conception of it which governs this legislation, includes the regulation in the provinces of the occupations of those engaged in the trade, and of the local establishments in which it is carried on. Precisely the same thing was attempted in the Insurance Act of 1910, unsuccessfully. The other fallacy is (the two are, perhaps, different forms of the same error) that the Dominion has such power because no single province, nor, indeed, all the provinces acting together, could put into effect such a sweeping scheme. The authority arises, it is said, under the residuary clause because of the necessary limits of the provincial authority. This is precisely the view which was advanced in the Board of Commerce Case[35] and, indeed, is the view which was unsuccessfully put forward in the Montreal Street Railway Case[36], where it was pointed out that in a system involving a division of powers such as that set up by the British North America Act, it may often be that subsidiary legislation by the provinces or by the Dominion is required to give full effect to some beneficial and necessary scheme of legislation not entirely within the powers of either.\nIn one respect there is a close analogy between this case and the Montreal Street Railway Case38. The expedient which their Lordships there pointed out as the appropriate one in order to enable the Dominion to acquire the authority it was seeking to exercise, is precisely that by which the Dominion could invest itself with the authority over such elevators as it might be considered necessary to regulate; that is to say, by resorting, as already suggested, to the power conferred by section 92 (10) to assume, through the procedure there laid down, jurisdiction in respect of \"local works.\"\nFortunately, however, to repeat what has been said above, the control possessed by the Dominion over the subject matters mentioned, and especially over transport (both land transport and water transport) and over external trade, would really appear to be amply sufficient to enable the Dominion, by appropriately framed legislation, effectively to secure the essential objects of this statute.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014In this case, His Majesty the King, in right of the Dominion of Canada, the appellant, claims from the respondent, the Eastern Terminal Elevator Company, Limited, operating, under a license issued by the Board of Grain Commissioners, a public terminal elevator at Port Arthur, Ontario, the surplus of grain in excess of one-quarter of one per cent, alleged to be 1,107,330 pounds, found in its elevator at the close of the crop year ending 31st August, 1920, or the sum of $43,431.20, value of this surplus of grain. The action is based on subsection 7 of section 95 of The Canada Grain Act (2 Geo. V, (Can.) ch. 27 (1912)), which was added to the Act by 9-10 Geo. V, ch. 40, sec. 3 (1919), and further amended by 10 Geo. V, ch. 6, sec. 1 (1919, 2nd session). Subsection 7 in its present form, reads as follows:\u2014\n7. In the month of August in each year, stock shall be taken of the quantity of each grade of grain in the terminal elevators; if in any year after the crop year ending the thirty-first day of August, 1919, the total surplus of grain is found in excess of one-quarter of one per cent of the gross amount of the grain received in the elevator during the crop year, such excess surplus shall be sold annually by the Board of Grain Commissioners and the proceeds thereof (paid to the said Board. Such proceeds shall be applied towards the cost of the administration of The Canada Grain Act in such manner as the Governor in Council may direct.\nThe respondent denies that there was any such surplus of grain in its elevator on August 31, 1920, and, in the alternative, alleges that the said subsection, as well as The Canada Grain Act itself, always were and are now ultra vires of the Parliament of the Dominion.\nThe first point involves the mode of calculation of the surplus of grain in excess of one-quarter of one per cent. It will however not be necessary to deal with this question if, on the second point, the conclusion be that subsection 7, or The Canada Grain Act of which it is a part, was not competently enacted by Parliament. The latter question therefore must be first considered.\nBefore doing so, however, it will be convenient to state how the grain trade of Canada is carried on under the authority of The Canada Grain Act, which was first enacted in 1912.\nThis statute divides Canada into two divisions for inspectional purposes, the Western division (by for the most important) comprising that part of the Dominion to the west of the cities of Port Arthur and Fort William, these two cities included, and the Eastern Division which lies to the east of Port Arthur.\nThe practice followed in the Western Division, from the time the grain leaves the farm until it reaches a terminal elevator and is shipped to its ultimate market, may be conveniently stated in the language of the learned trial judge.\nThe producing farmer usually sells, or stores, his grain to or in what is termed a country elevator, the business of which is to store grain for a charge, or to purchase the same outright. He may store on the basis of receiving the identical grain, or grain of the same grade, at a terminal elevator. He may also load his grain on a car consigned to a commission agent to sell for his account. In due course, the grain is forwarded to a terminal elevator at say Port Arthur, and in transit thereto, passes through Winnipeg, where the first inspection under the Grain Act takes place. An inspection certificate issues from the office of the chief inspector of grain of the Western Division, setting forth for whose account the grain was inspected, the number of the car, the railway station shipped from, the kind of grain, the grade, and the percentage of dockage, if any, \"dockage\" meaning the inspectors' estimate of unmarketable grain and foreign matter in the carload, which must be removed by the terminal elevator When cleaning the same. This noncommercial grain and foreign matter when separated from the grain at the terminal elevator are called \"screenings.\" If the grain is considered sufficiently clean by the inspector, or is estimated not to contain more than three-fourths of one per cent of foreign or unclean matter, the carload is marked as \"clean,\" and is stored with grain of the same kind and grade when it reaches a terminal elevator.\nThe inspected car then proceeds to Fort William or Port Arthur, the inspectors' certificate reaching there at the same time or earlier, and then being in the possession of an officer of the Board. The grain is subsequently weighed into an elevator, and pursuant to the Grain Act a certificate of weight is issued. This certificate shews the number of the car, the place where weighed, the date, the kind of grain and the weight of the carload of grain. Thereupon, and in conformity with the Grain Act, the receiving elevator company issues to the owner, of the grain a terminal warehouse receipt to the effect that it has received and holds, subject to the order of the owner, a specified quantity of a definite kind of grain expressed in bushels of an inspected and designated grade, to be stored with grain of the same grade. The quantity is the weight of the carload, less the deduction for dockage. This grain, or grain of the same grade, is deliverable upon the return of the warehouse receipt, properly indorsed by the holder thereof, and upon payment of storage and other charges. The certificate further states that the grain will be kept stored and insured for the benefit of the person to whose order the receipt is issued, or his assignee, and in conformity with the provisions and conditions of the laws of Canada relating to the warehousing of grain. The evidence shews that Canadian grain is usually sold in international markets, on the certified grades established by the inspection under the Grain Act, and the certificate shewing the grades accompanies the shipment to the ultimate market. Grain exported from Australia, India or Argentina is usually purchased on the basis of fair average quality on arbitration.\nA concrete case introduced in evidence illustrates the practice with respect to \"dockage.\" Car No. 303,015 G.T.P. was inspected at Winnipeg and the certificate of inspection shews the grade to be Manitoba 3 Northern and the dockage is placed at 4\u00bd per cent. When the car reached Port Arthur, the grain was weighed in the elevator and a certificate was issued giving the contents of the car as wheat and the weight of the grain as 72,100 lbs., this weight including the dockage. A warehouse receipt was then given by the respondent to the owner of the grain acknowledging receipt from car 303,015 of\nexactly 1,147 bushels 40 pounds exactly of 3 Nor. inspected grade to be stored with grain of the same grade by inspection.\nThe 1,147 bushels, 40 pounds, represented the 72,100 pounds of wheat, less the dockage which was also received by the terminal elevator company, but for which no warehouse receipt was given. The dockage was removed from the grain by the process of screening and left a residue termed \"screenings.\"\nThe course of dealing with regard to the screenings, the admission of the parties shews, was that a return had to be made by the elevator company for the balance of the screenings after deducting one half of one per cent of the gross weight of the car for waste. The screenings were rescreened and commercial grain was recovered therefrom. This commercial grain was placed in the storage bins containing grain corresponding in grade, and the residue of the screenings was put in separate bins used exclusively for screenings. During the crop year ending the 31st of August, 1920, the respondent made a return to the owners of the grain for a balance of screenings of $33,384.17 representing 3,186,894 pounds of screenings.\nIt should be remarked that at terminal points like Port Arthur and Fort William there are also private elevators, said to be considerably more numerous than the public ones. The terminal elevators are operated under a licence granted by the Board of Grain Commissioners, the private elevators are not mentioned in the Grain Act except for a passing reference in subsection 5 of section 57.\nThe admission of the parties, after referring to the method of ascertaining the surplus of grain contended for by the appellant, states that if that method be correct, there was in the respondent's elevator, on the 31st of August, 1920, a surplus of grain (termed in the evidence \"overage\") in excess of one-quarter of one per cent of the gross amount of the grain received in the elevator during the preceding crop year, and that the value of such surplus was $49,027.07. The appellant and the Board of Grain Commissioners, the admission states, assert no claim as to this surplus, except in so far as the claim may be justified under subsection 7 of section 95 of the Grain Act, and unless this subsection was within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe learned trial judge, the President of the Exchequer Court, was of opinion that subsection 7 is ultra vires. He however, in view of a possible appeal, passed upon the different modes of calculating the surplus of grain, and gave the preference to one of the modes suggested by the respondent. The appellant's action was dismissed with costs. In view of the conclusion to which I have come on the constitutional question, it will be unnecessary to deal with these modes of calculating the surplus of grain.\nComing now to the constitutional point, the scope of the Canada Grain Act must be stated as briefly as possible. A complete analysis of the statute with its 248 sections would necessarily be very lengthy; and it has therefore seemed preferable to emphasize its main features, rather than to follow their application in minute detail to such a complex problem as the Canadian grain trade.\nThis problem, being largely a geographical one, the Act divides the Dominion into the two inspection divisions to which I have already referred (section 21). And as the economical transportation of the grain to its market is one of the chief objects which Parliament has in view, the statute deals with terminal elevators for the storage of the grain (sections 122 et seq.), the most important of which are at the head of the great lakes, at Port Arthur and Fort William in Ontario, and with country elevators along the railways and near the farms (sections 151 et seq.) for the receipt and storage of the grain prior to its shipment en route for the seaboard. We are told that these country elevators in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta number some 4,000. We are also informed that ninety per cent of the shipments out of the terminal elevators are made by water.\nThe general administration of the Grain Act is entrusted to a Board called the Board of Grain Commissioners for Canada, consisting of three commissioners (one termed the Chief Commissioner), appointed by the Governor-in-Council, who hold office during good behaviour for a period of ten years, subject to removal by the same authority for cause (sections 3 et seq.). The duties of this Board are multifarious and are explained in a large number of sections to which it is impossible to refer in detail.\nTwo great objects are dealt with throughout the Act, the inspection of the grain and its proper grading.\nFor the inspection of the grain the Act provides for chief inspectors, inspectors and deputy inspectors (section 24). The two latter are granted a certificate qualifying them to act as inspectors after an examination before a board of examiners (sections 40 et seq.), and the chief inspector is selected among those who hold an inspector's certificate (section 44), so the qualifications of the inspecting officers are thus carefully safeguarded. The duty of the inspecting officer is to inspect the grain \"when called upon to do so by the owner or possessor thereof or his authorized agent\" (section 27). While this language seems to make the inspection optional in so far as the owner is concerned, and while nothing in the Act prevents any person from selling or buying grain by sample regardless of its grades (section 57), the inspection system, in practice, seems to be a necessary requirement of the great bulk of transactions in grain. All grain placed in public or terminal elevators is subject to inspection (section 90), and the certificate of inspection in all cases accompanies the grain to its destination (section 97).\nThe inspection determines the grade of the grain which is specified in the certificate granted by the inspecting officer. The Act contains elaborate provisions as to the grading of the different qualities of grain (sections 105 et seq.). All grain produced in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and in the Northwest Territories (and much the larger part of Canadian grain is produced in these provinces and territories), passing through the Winnipeg district, is inspected at Winnipeg or a point within the district, and on grain so inspected the inspection is final (section 91). All grain of the same grade is kept together and stored in the terminal elevators only with grain of a similar grade (section 94). It is binned under the direction, supervision and control of the inspecting officer, who has full control of all grain in terminal elevators, and no grain is shipped out of, transferred or removed from any terminal elevator without his supervision (section 95). The Act provides for the appointment of a grain survey board to which an appeal against the grading of grain may be brought by the owner or possessor of the grain (sections 101 et seq.). It also makes provision for the granting of warehouse receipts for the grain stored in terminal elevators (sections 127 et seq.).\nI have mentioned several times the country and terminal elevators. The latter are often called public elevators as distinguished from private elevators. These public elevators include every elevator or warehouse which receives grain for storage from the western inspection division after it has been inspected under the Act (section 2, subsection (w)). There are, the evidence shows, a large number of private elevators at terminal points. I have found nothing in the Grain Act specifically dealing with them. But the Act mentions hospital and mill elevators, the names of which are sufficiently descriptive. There are also what are known as flat warehouses (sections 180 et seq.). The owner of a terminal elevator cannot buy or sell grain (section 123), but this prohibition is not extended to the country elevators.\nThe licensing system under the Act is most elaborate, and here we find compulsory features which shew that the statute really regulates the Canadian grain trade. Section 119 states that the Board of Grain Commissioners shall\nrequire all track buyers (these are persons who buy grain by the car load, see sections 218 et seq.), and owners and operators of elevators (this term is possibly wide enough to include private elevators), warehouses and mills, and all grain commission merchants and primary grain dealers to take out annual licences.\nThe requirement of a license is again specifically mentioned in section. 122 for terminal elevators, in section 124 for hospital elevators, in sections 153 and 238 for country elevators, in section 218 for track buyers, and in section 219a for primary grain dealers. Licences granted can be revoked by the Board for cause.\nThe Act contains several other prohibitions and imposes penalties for various offences with which it is impossible to deal in detail without unduly lengthening this statement of the main features of the statute. Enough, however, has been said to shew that the Grain Act is an elaborate scheme of regulation of the Canadian grain trade.\nThe learned trial judge restricted his decision on the constitutional question to subsection 7 of section 95 of the Canada Grain Act which he held ultra vires on the ground that it dealt with a subject matter, the right of ownership of the surplus of grain, falling within the provincial domain. He stated that this subsection is\nin essence legislation dealing with property and civil rights, and is not a regulation of trade and commerce within the meaning of section 91, No. 2 of the British North America Act.\nHe also found that it was an attempt to regulate profits or dealings which give rise to profits. The legal title to the grain surplus in question in this case was, he said, in the defendant which had extinguished every other right or title in the surplus, and no other claim or title therein was put forward, or could be put forward, except by the Board under this legislation. This was not a case, it seemed to him, where the Grain Act purported to do something coming within the powers assigned to Parliament by section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, but which incidentally and necessarily in its operation came in conflict with property and civil rights. It was not the case, he added, of an ancillary provision, encroaching upon matters assigned to the provincial legislatures, but required to prevent the scheme of such a law being defeated, nor was it the case where, in order to operate a validly enacted scheme, procedure must be adopted to make effective that law even though invading the legislative field of the legislatures in respect of property and civil rights.\nElsewhere the learned judge said:\u2014\nIt was contended before me that the export of Canadian grain was a matter of national concern, by reason of its value and volume, by itself, and in relation to the total export trade of Canada; that such grain was sold in international markets as inspected and graded under the Grain Act, much to the advantage of Canadian grain growers and exporters, and that the whole enactment should be regarded in its entirety as a legislative scheme evolved in the interest of a primary industry of great magnitude, and for high national interests, and it was urged that under head 2 sec. 91, \"regulation of trade and commerce,\" there was legislative authority for the Grain Act, and the particular section under consideration. This view is not without force and must be seriously considered. The validity of the Grain Act as a whole is not challenged and I am not called upon to decide whether the more prominent features of the Act, such as the inspection, grading, and weighing of grain are within the legislative competence of Parliament by virtue of section 91 (2) or otherwise.\nIt appears to me that such provisions of the Grain Act as might be said to constitute its main purposes and objects might stand, while others might fall for want of jurisdiction, and without destroying the vital parts of the legislative scheme. The general scheme of the Act may be of paramount national concern and of national dimensions, and assuming its principal provisions to be within the legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament, such as inspecting, grading, weighing, cleaning, railway car facilities, etc., it does not, I think, follow that subsec. 7 of sec. 95 is a necessary factor in that scheme. That is to say the Grain Act might operate in the way of a regulation of trade and commerce, as well without this section as with it, as in fact it did for many years. If the general scheme of the Act comes within the head of \"regulation of trade and commerce\" or any other part of sec. 91, that might stand and function by itself, without subsec. 7 of sec. 95. That legislation, it seems to me, assumes to do something unrelated to the general scheme and purposes of the Grain Act.\nIf it be conceded that Parliament can deal with the regulation of the Canadian grain trade, with the licensing of those who take part in it, with the prohibition to operate terminal or country elevators without a licence, and with the operation generally of these elevators, I confess that I would have great difficulty in following the contention that Parliament cannot also deal, as was done by subsection 7, with the disposal of the surplus of grain, if any, which remains in a public terminal elevator after the latter has delivered all the grain for which it has issued warehouse receipts. It is rather because subsection 7 is a part of such a statute as I have described that I think its validity cannot be supported.\nI am constrained to this conclusion by successive pronouncements of the Judicial Committee; Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta[37]; In re Board of Commerce Act[38]; Fort Frances Pulp and Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co.[39]; Attorney General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers[40]; culminating in its very recent decision in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[41], where all the pertinent judgments of the Board were fully discussed and applied. These judgments have settled the law. In this case all the familiar contentions were addressed to us by the appellant's counsel in support of this legislation, but they are all finally answered by these decisions. It follows that the statute under consideration cannot be sustained on the ground that it is a regulation of trade and commerce or that it is for the general advantage of Canada. Nor can it be contended that it was designed to cope with a national emergency. In my opinion, this legislation cannot be brought under any of the heads of section 91 of the British North America Act, as they have been construed, and it would certainly, within any of the provinces, have been competent provincial legislation under section 92. This is decisive of the question at issue.\nI have not overlooked the appellant's contention that the statute can be supported under section 95 of the British North America Act as being legislation concerning agriculture. It suffices to answer that the subject matter of the Act is not agriculture but a product of agriculture considered as an article of trade. The regulation of a particular trade, and that is what this statute is in substance, cannot be attempted by the Dominion on the ground that it is a trade in natural products. What we have here is trade legislation and not a law for the encouragement or support of agriculture, however wide a meaning may be given to the latter term.\nI express no opinion on the question whether the grain surplus dealt with by subsection 7 is the property of the respondent. I merely agree, for the reasons above stated, with the holding of the learned trial judge that this subsection is ultra vires and that the action fails.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRinfret J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

Biggar K.C. and Varcoe for the appellant.\nMarquis K.C. and Louis Cot\u00e9 for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court dismissing a demurrer which the Crown pleaded to the petition of right of the suppliants. In substance, the suppliants alleged that, on or about the 15th day of January, 1924, owing to the negligence of a servant of the Crown, to wit the driver of a motor truck, the property of the Crown and which was used at the time of the accident in transporting workmen in the employment of the Department of Railways and Canals to the public work carried on at Thorold, Ontario, the suppliant Dominica Schrobounst was struck and seriously injured by the said motor truck.\nThe demurrer of the Crown set forth that the petition of right did not allege or disclose any facts giving rise to any obligation or liability on the part of His Majesty to pay to the suppliants the damages claimed.\nThe question turns on the proper construction of subsection (c) of section 20 of the Exchequer Court Act, as amended in 1917. This subsection reads as follows:\nThe Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters, * * *\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work.\nWe are of the opinion that the words \"upon any public work\" in subsection (c) qualify not necessarily the presence but the employment, of the negligent servant or officer of the Crown. The driver of the motor truck was employed upon the public work in question; and this is sufficient to give the suppliants the right of action they assert.\nIf it had been intended to restrict the application of the subsection to the case in which the person causing the injury was at the time physically present \"upon any public work\" these latter words would more properly have been inserted immediately after the word \"while,\" where their significance would have been unmistakable. The construction placed on the words \"on any public work\" in Piggott's Case[4] and other cases decided on the subsection as it stood prior to 1917, proceeded upon and was necessitated by their collocation with the words \"person or property.\"\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Act, 1867, s. 92, s.s. 10, par. c.\nThe appellant is a colliery company and had been authorized by a statute (c. 78 of 1921) of the province of Alberta to construct a railway known as the Luscar Branch to connect with the railway of the Mountain Park Coal Company, Limited, at or near Leyland station. In April, 1923, the appellant entered into an agreement with the Mountain Park Coal Company, the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company and the Grand Trunk Pacific Company, the two latter companies now represented by the Canadian National Railways, for the construction and operation of this railway. It also submitted its railway to the operation of certain agreements between the three other companies concerning the construction and operation of the railway of the Mountain Park Coal Company. The effect of all these agreements is that these railways were built by the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company at the expense of the two colliery companies, the cost of construction to be reimbursed to the latter by certain rebates allowed them on the shipment of all coal over these railways, it being agreed that when the companies are fully reimbursed the railways will become the property of the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company. The Grand Trunk Pacific Company undertook to operate the railways and to furnish such Tolling stock as would be necessary. In the agreement made by it with the three other companies, the appellant consented to any necessary application of the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company (or the Canadian National Railways) to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for approval of the location of the Lusgar branch and the maintenance and operation thereof by the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company. The respondent McDonald was the owner of Tarns coal lease, Mountain Park Branch, Canadian National Railways, in the vicinity of the Luscar branch, and desired to obtain from the Board of Railway Commissioners permission to use a \"Y\" on the Luscar branch and also to construct from this \"Y\" a spur track to serve his coal lease approximately 1,000 feet in length. This application was opposed by the appellant which denied the jurisdiction of the Board to grant it. At the time of the application, the legal title to the ownership of the Luscar Branch was still in the appellant company's name. Held, Idington J. dissenting, that the Board of Railway Commissioners had jurisdiction to entertain and grant the application made by the respondent N. S. McDonald.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Duff and Rinfret JJ.\u2014The Luscar Branch is a railway within the meaning of s. 185 of the Railway Act and therefore comes within the operation of the Railway Act by force of s. 5 of this Act.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014The Canadian National Railways, by the effect of the above agreements, acquired and exercised, subject to the terms specified, operating rights upon the Luscar Branch and it thus comes within the description of par. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act, as being a railway operated by a company which is wholly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and therefore a work declared to be for the general advantage of Canada.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Duff and Rinfret JJ.\u2014S.s. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act, which provides in general terms to what railways the Act shall extend and apply and enacts that these railways shall be deemed and are thereby declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada, is not within the legislative powers of the Dominion and does not constitute an effective declaration under par. (c) of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act. Mignault and Newcombe JJ. contra.\nAPPEAL by leave of a judge of this court from a decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada holding that it had jurisdiction to entertain an application by the respondent McDonald for an order of the Board granting him running rights over a spur track in use by the appellant and for an order of the Board requiring the respondent, the Canadian National Railways, to grant him permission for the construction of a spur track to serve his coal lease.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note. The Board having decided that it could entertain the respondent McDonald's application, the appellant applied to a judge of this court for leave to appeal from the decision of the Board. This leave was granted and the order specified as follows the points of jurisdiction which were in question:\u2014\n(1) Whether subsection (c) of section 6 of the Railway Act of Canada is within the legislative powers of the Dominion of Canada.\n(2) Whether assuming that Parliament has power to legislate as to the subject matter, a general declaration not specifying any particular railway or railways, as under subsection (c) of section 6 of the Railway Act of Canada, is a declaration complying with subsection (c) of subsection 10 of section 92 of the British North America Act. (3) Whether having regard to the provisions of chapter 78 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1921, subsection (c) of section 6 of the Railway Act of Canada has any application to the Luscar Collieries Limited.\n(4) Whether the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada under section 6, subsection (c) of the Railway Act of Canada has jurisdiction to make any order establishing connection with or giving any running rights over the railway constructed by Luscar Collieries Ltd., and if not, has the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada otherwise any jurisdiction to make such order.\nThe Attorney General of Canada intervened to support the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners. The Attorney General of Alberta, although notified of the order granting leave to appeal, did not instruct counsel to appear on his behalf at the argument, although subsequently, in answer to certain questions put by the court, a factum was filed on his behalf. The Canadian National Railways, respondents, were represented by counsel who stated that he neither asserted nor disputed the jurisdiction of the Board to make the order applied for.\nS. R. Woods K. C. for appellant.\nH. Aylen K.C. and J. A. Aylen for the respondent\nGeo. F. Macdonnell for the respondent\nS. R. Woods K. C. for appellant.\u2014Ss. 185 and 186 of the Railway Act do not apply to the Luscar Branch which has not been originally constructed pursuant to s. 185 but which has been originally constructed by the appellant company with their own money on their own right of way pursuant to powers granted by the legislature of Alberta.\nThe power conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by par. c. of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act has not been effectively exercised in the way it is sought to be exercised in s.s. c. of s. 6 of the Railway Act, so as to bring a purely provincial enterprise under the exclusive legislative control of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe legislative declaration in s.s. c of s. 6 of the Railway Act is ineffective because upon the true interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the B.N.A. Act, the declaration can competently be made only with reference to a work existing at the time or particularly specified.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and C. P. Plaxton for the Attorney General of Canada. Under the provisions of par. c. of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, the Dominion Parliament has jurisdiction to declare, in general terms, whole classes of works to be for the general advantage of Canada and is not bound to specify individually the works to which the declaration is directed. Therefore s.s. c. of s. 6 of the Railway Act is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nH. Aylen K.C. and J. A. Aylen for the respondent N. S. McDonald.\nGeo. F. Macdonnell for the respondent C.N.R.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance of Alberta, and was so incorporated with power inter alia to mine coal and other minerals under the provisions of certain leases upon lands situated in the Mountain Forest Reserve in said province.\nIt petitioned the legislature of Alberta setting forth that for the proper development of said coal fields and the marketing of its products it would be necessary that said company be given power to construct and operate a railway, and the said legislature, by c. 78 of its 1921 statutes, passed the desired Act, assented to on the 19th of April, 1921.\nS. 1 thereof enabled the said company to construct the desired railway from a point in or near township 47, range 24, west of the fifth meridian, by the most feasible route, to connect it with the Mountain Park Coal Company's railways in said province, at or near Leyland station, or any other feasible point of juncture with said line.\nS. 2 provided for the company entering into an agreement with certain named railways for operating appellant's road when built, and providing thereby for repayment of the cost of building out of rebates to be given by the operating company over any extended term of years of operation to be agreed upon and thus, if so agreed for the acquisition of appellant's railway.\nS. 3 thereof provides that the several claims of the Railway Act (which I take it means the Alberta Railway Act) shall be incorporated with and shall be deemed part of this Act, and shall apply to the company and to the said railway except so far as the same may be inconsistent with the express enactments thereof, and the expression \"this Act\" when used herein shall be understood to include the said clauses of said Railway Act and for greater certainty declared that the several clauses of the said Railway Act referring to the construction of the branch lines and spur lines or tracks are incorporated herein; but ss. 9 to 61, and ss. 143 to 228 of the said Railway Act shall not apply to the said company; and where others so inconsistent, provision is made in the articles of the company in the matters dealt with in the Railway Act, the provisions of the said memorandum and articles shall prevail, and in the event of an operating agreement or agreements being entered into, as aforesaid, by the said company notwithstanding anything in said Railway Act, the said railway may, if so provided in the operating agreement, be operated under and pursuant to the provisions of any statute of Canada, applicable to any company incorporated by or under the authority of the Parliament of Canada and the purview of said Railway Act, so far as necessary, be superseded, but nothing herein contained shall be taken to prevent said railway being operated either by the company or other company under the provisions of said Railway Act.\nProvided that notwithstanding anything herein contained, upon the acquisition of said railway by the Canadian National or other railway company, the provision of s. 143 of the Railway Act shall apply to the company so acquiring said railway.\nS. 4 provided for the appellant company, or the Canadian National Railway Company, or other railway company entering into such operating agreement applying to the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada (or other proper authority, provincial or federal) for all necessary and proper orders and authorities to provide for the operation of said railway.\nS. 5 provided for the construction of said railway being commenced within one year and its completion within three years from date of the coming into force of said Act.\nS. 6 provided power for the purposes of said undertaking to construct and operate an electric telephone and telegraph lines, etc.\nS. 7 provided as follows:\u2014\n7. Any railway line duly constructed under legislative authority may be joined on to the said line of railway upon application to the Minister of Railways and upon such terms as the Minister may determine. I have tried to outline the foregoing Act of incorporation in order to present the many angles therein presented looking, I submit, to becoming the very humble creation of a local legislature in preference to being considered and held to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, unless and until it had been acquired by the Canadian National Railway, or other railway, agreeing to operate it.\nThe appellant's railway in question is only five and a half, or five and three-quarter miles long, and evidently but a spur line enabling the appellant to have the coal recovered from its mine, transported to the Canadian National Railway, or other railway, and thereby carried to where a market may be found for its coal products.\nIn short it seems of no more importance than (if so much as) many switches provided by large manufacturers for transporting such goods on to the tracks over which they are destined to be carried by means of freight cars belonging to the said road.\nThe respondent, McDonald, having discovered, or got possession of, a coal mine near to the appellant's spur, conceived the idea of saving himself the expense of building a spur of his own connecting with another line of railway, or the line the appellant's spur is connected with, and applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for permission to connect his proposed spur line with that of appellant.\nThe (appellant's counsel resisted the application and pointed out that putting such a project into operation would necessitate running respondent's cars through appellant's yard and render it a rather dangerous expedient for which no provision had been made or anticipated as likely to be necessary. He said the appellant's spur had cost it from $200,000 to $220,000 and offered, if McDonald, the respondent, would pay half of that amount, that the appellant might try to overcome all these difficulties, but respondent would not listen to such a proposal.\nThe Board seemed doubtful of its powers but finally decided to make the order applied for and give the appellant an opportunity for testing the matter by an appeal to this court. And hence this appeal by leave of Mr. Justice Mignault under the provision of the Railway Act of Canada relevant to the powers and duties of said Commissioners. The question thus raised turns upon the interpretation and construction of, first, the item no. 10, of s. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, which reads as follows:\u2014\n10. Local works and undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:\u2014\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, or other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province;\n(b) Lines of steamships between the province and any British or foreign country;\n(c) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces;\nand secondly, the interpretation and construction of s. 6, s.s. (c) of the Railway Act, 1919, enacted by the Dominion Parliament, and which read's as follows:\u2014\n(c) every railway or portion thereof, whether constructed under the authority of the Parliament of Canada or not, now or hereafter owned, controlled, leased, or operated by a company wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, or by a company operating a railway wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, whether such ownership, control, or first-mentioned operation is acquired or exercised by purchase, lease, agreement or other means whatsoever, and whether acquired or exercised under authority of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislature of any province, or otherwise howsoever; and every railway or portion thereof, now or hereafter so owned, controlled, leased or operated shall be deemed and is hereby declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nThe said item 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, in its s.s. (c), it was stoutly contended by counsel for appellant, contemplated a specific designation of the particular railway, or other work, that was to be declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the advantage of Canada and that it was not competent for said Parliament to classify in an abstract and imaginary manner \"such works\" as it pleased, and declare any entire class of the kind to be \"for the advantage of Canada.\"\nI certainly was surprised to find such a classification and declaration as in the s. 6 (c) above quoted, for I have never had occasion to consider same until this case was presented to us, unless the early legislation providing for the cases of local railways crossing Canadian through lines.\nThe said assumption of authority if upheld, I respectfully submit, would leave it open to Parliament to assume control of all our highways, all our elevators, all our local hydro electric systems, now existent or hereafter to come into existence; all our local public utilities, which have become so manifold, especially in some of our western provinces, and which would include telephone systems and, if I mistake not, telegraph systems: and all the sidings and switches I have adverted to above, built by manufacturers for their own personal service and benefit, but operated by the railway to which they gave their transportation business, and perhaps preference in cases of competition, and in such cases possibly to a Dominion railway and alternating to a local railway, by simply passing a declaratory Act as to their being for the general advantage of Canada.\nI cannot follow all the possible consequences of such a holding, or of its manifold implications.\nI cannot assume that any such consequences, or anything like thereto, were ever expected to ensue upon or flow from any single enactment by the Parliament of Canada pretended to have been made within the meaning of the reservation of s.s. (c) of item 10, of s. 92 of said British North America Act, and thereby to fulfil its requirements for a declaration as to any works for the general advantage of Canada.\nIndeed I submit that it was in order to avoid any possibility of such like results that the said item 10 (c) was framed as it was, and so remains.\nSubsections (a) and (b) of said item 10 deal with works which can safely be classified and are dealt with accordingly, but beyond that the framers of the British North America Act apparently felt they could not proceed by the classification process, and hence proceeded to deal with the residue of what could not be so properly dealt with by the classification process; by entrusting said residue by s.s. (c) to the Parliament of Canada, on which it cast the onus of deciding whether or not anything further could properly be declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nIn other words it seems to me quite clear that Parliament was entrusted with the quasi judicial duty of determining after hearing all those concerned, whether or not a specific work, either before or after its execution, could properly be declared to be for the general advantage of Canada, or of two or more of its provinces. Any one conversant with how matters are dealt with by parliament must recognize the vast difference in possible results (to say nothing derrogatory of that body) when considering the abstract general proposition and a specific case.\nAnd no men ever knew that better than the framers of the British North America Act, and, to repeat what I have had so frequently to advert to in considering their work, I think we must consider and apply the point of view they took in any question arising upon the interpretation and construction of the British North America Act which was, though enacted by the British Parliament, essentially a product of the best thought of our Canadian statesmen engaged in trying to frame something for the future delimitations of the powers of Parliament and local legislatures.\nThe early legislation that ensued thereon in regard to anything like unto that with which we are now confronted was such as already adverted to in the case of local railways crossing Canadian through lines; and that came before this court in the case of a submission by the Railway Committee of the Canadian Privy Council to this court in Re Portage Extension of the Red River Valley Ry. Co., in which this court, in a judgment prepared by the late Mr. Justice Patterson, seems to have decided that the contentions set up by the through lines were unfounded.\nSo far as it went that decision was in principle against the contention of the respondent herein, largely, I submit, because of want of specific basis for the declaration relied upon and merely a class of railway. See Coutl\u00e9e's Digest of 1875-1903.\nThere does not seem to have been any other important question raised upon said earlier Dominion legislation.\nThese earlier Acts were all repealed in 1907, and thereafter there arose no case in principle exactly like the question now before us so far as it could arise under said earlier Acts which, by no means, ever attempted such an extension of authority as above quoted s. 6, s.s. (c) of the Dominion Act, 1919.\nThe decision of this court in the Through Traffic Case, so called, being Montreal Street Railway Company v. The City of Montreal[1], upheld by the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[2], which was delivered by Lord Atkinson, and his remarks on page 338, as follows, are relied upon by counsel for appellant herein:\u2014\nThere is not a suggestion in the case that the \"through\" traffic between this federal and this local line, or between any other federal or local line, had attained such, dimensions before this Railway Act was passed as to affect the body politic of the Dominion. If it had been so, the ready way of protecting the body politic was by making such a statutory declaration in any particular case or cases as was made in reference to the Park Line.\nThat case presented some curious features and in light of said judgment is well worthy of consideration herein, though not exactly in point.\nThe case of Re Ross and Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Ry. Co.[3], was an appeal from a decision of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board dealing with said railway, which, it was argued by virtue of a crossing section in the Dominion legislation, brought it under Dominion authorities, and the Appellate Division held not and dismissed the appeal. On appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, under the name of Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Ry. Co. v. The Attorney General of Ontario[4], that court of last resort held that the Act relied upon had been repealed and hence that it was not necessary to decide the other points raised and accordingly dismissed the appeal.\nSuch being the brief record of decided cases I must turn again to the consideration of said s. 6, s.s. (c) and its bearing upon the actual facts herein.\nThe appellant entered into an agreement between the Mountain Park Coal Company, Limited, the appellant, and the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, on the 2nd of April, 1923, pursuant to the powers given it, by the Act I have outlined above and that provides for the repayment to appellant of the cost of the construction and maintenance meantime, and interest thereon, of allowance or allowances by way of a rebate on the usual tolls of freight on shipments by appellant over said spur line in question. This agreement is so connected thereby with other agreements made by one or more of the parties thereto, that it would be imposing too much upon my readers to enter into a demonstration of the interpretation and construction I have readied as to the same, as stated, that I must content myself with saying such is the conclusion I have reached.\nIn short the whole scheme of said agreement and those with which it connects up, is that if the appellant is repaid by said means, then this spur in question herein will in effect ultimately become the property of the Canadian National Railway Company, or one of its subsidiaries, and completely subject to the statutory powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\nMeantime it is a local provincial work under the authority of the legislature of the province of Alberta, and the enactments of that legislature.\nIf these, at any time, conflict with what Parliament desires, the only way out for the latter is to declare it under item 10 (c) of s. 92 of the British North America Act, in specific terms as, I submit, the subsection requires \"a work for the general advantage of Canada.\"\nOf course it is rather like reducing the phrase \"a work for the general advantage of Canada\" to a point of ridicule, to bring thereunder the five miles and a half, or three-quarters of a spur line in Northeastern Alberta, serving, or originally intended only to serve, the appellant's Luscar Colliery, where collieries seem to be numerous.\nBut I am not to blame therefor. It is giving assent to such a proposition, as that such a pigmy thing can be declared by Parliament for the general advantage of Canada, when such phrase is used as the determining limit of the powers that are to be invoked and acted upon by Parliament alone, and not by any of its delegates.\nI respectfully submit that when provincial rights which were prima facie sure, are to be invaded and transferred to the rule of the Dominion Parliament, something more important was contemplated by the framers of said item 10 (c) of the 92nd section of the British North America Act, than such a comparatively trifling item as this little spur railway to afford appellant transportation for its mine.\nIt may turn out that the mine is not worth the expenditure of running an engine and cars for five miles of it; then the agreement, of necessity, will drop out of sight.\nOn the other hand it may be such as to find it necessary for appellant to keep entirely to itself the said spur for its own uses, until the cost of construction and interest thereon is paid by the rebates provided for by said agreement.\nIn such latter event the spur in question drops into and becomes part of the Canadian National Railway property.\nWhy anticipate and peremptorily deal with such a situation in the way the order appealed from does? It is none of our business to interfere with the administration of the powers of the Board for which I entertain great respect. I am only illustrating alternatively the varying aspects of law in which the case presents itself to my mind in this rather novel case.\nI am sorry that none of the factums herein present what the powers of the Canadian National Railways are relative to agreeing to run over a spur or switch or siding to get freight to be carried perhaps thousands of miles and thereby win very substantial earnings relative to, or compared with, which the five mile spur haul would be a mere nothing.\nMoreover, I infer there must have been some application to the Board, but possibly that was by some of appellant's predecessors named in the agreement.\nAnd I am also sorry to find that Lord Atkinson's view, expressed as above quoted, or the like attitude, surely desirable in transferring a provincial railway to Dominion jurisdiction, seems to have been overlooked by all concerned in promoting the order appealed from herein.\nI am surprised to find respondent, McDonald's, counsel, by their factum herein, frankly concede that Parliament has delegated any part of its functions, conferred on it by said item 10 (c) of the British North America Act, to said Board.\nIt submits the following on behalf of their said client:\u2014\nThe Parliament of Canada deemed it proper to enact s.s. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act in general terms and make same applicable to railways wherever situate, coming within the classes therein stated to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the general advantage of two or more of the provinces. Such general enactment relieves Parliament of innumerable applications by way of private bills which otherwise would come before it. Parliament, in enacting this legislation, has, in the language of May, \"exercised its legislative powers\" and delegated to the Railway Commission the judicial powers of determining if the facts and circumstances bring any particular railway within the scope of the legislation in question.\nI most respectfully submit that this proposition is not well founded in law for said item 10 (c) clearly casts the onus of any such decision upon Parliament itself and so clearly so as to destroy any pretence of foundation for delegation of its said powers by enacting in the Railway Act, s. 6 (c), such enactments as contained therein, especially that relative to future operations.\nIt is precisely that, which I have been attempting to demonstrate in several ways, which had been done by using a classification system to be determined by future results, and acts of others instead of specifically designating; either before or after the execution of the work, what it was that Parliament intended to be declared to be for the general advantage of Canada.\nThe constitutional rights of the people in any single province, and of its legislature to protect them and their property, are, I respectfully submit, of too much importance to be maintained, clear of all endangering thereof by their being invaded, or set aside, by any such like legislation as, said s. 6 (c) of the Railway Act.\nAttempts such as made by the order herein appealed against founded upon features of said s. 6 (c), clearly ultra vires, cannot be too carefully watched and guarded against.\nI, therefore, am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and the said order set aside.\nDuff J.\u2014The controversy as to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners, with which this appeal is concerned, turns upon the question whether or not a certain line of railway, which may be referred to as the Luscar Branch, is a railway within the meaning of s. 185 of the Railway Act, and one to which that enactment applies. This railway line runs from the Luscar Collieries Mine to the Leyland Siding, and there connects with a line referred to herein as the Mountain Park Branch, running from the Mountain Park Coal Mine, at its western terminus, to a point on the Alberta Coal Branch of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, known as Coal Spur, the Alberta Coal Branch having been constructed by the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company, apparently under the authority of its charter as amended in 1911 ([1911] Dominion Statutes, c. 83, s. 1 (37)). The Alberta Coal Branch, about fifty-eight miles in length, connects by a switch at Bickerdike with the main line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, constructed under the authority of c. 161, Dominion Statutes, 1903. The Mountain Park Branch was constructed by the Mountain Park Coal Company, pursuant to an agreement dated the 23rd of January, 1912, under which the coal company was to construct the line, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway company was to operate it, and the cost of construction was to be reimbursed to the coal company by allowances in respect of freight shipped from the coal company's mine and specifically dealt with in paragraph four of the agreement. Thereupon, the title to the railway line, the right-of-way, stations, station grounds and other buildings and erections connected therewith, water stations, telegraph and telephone lines, and all other property of the Coal Company, was to pass to the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company. By an agreement of the 10th of May, 1921, this agreement of 1912 was varied, by providing conditionally for the construction of the Luscar Branch and repayment of the cost of construction on similar terms to those affecting the obligation to repay the cost of the Mountain Park Branch; and further, that the obligation to operate the branch should cease upon the failure of the coal company to ship in any year 150,000 tons of coal on the Mountain Park Branch, or 75,000 tons per annum on the Luscar Branch.\nOn the 2nd of April, 1923, a further agreement was entered into by which the Luscar Collieries became party to the two preceding agreements already mentioned. The two coal companies were authorized to enter these agreements by provincial statutes, c. 42, Statutes of Alberta, 1912; and c. 78, Statutes of Alberta, 1921, respectively.\nBy the interpretation section of the Railway Act, c. 122 of 1903, it is declared (s. 12) that the main line of railway and branches authorized,\ntogether with such other branch lines and any extension of the said main line of railway as are hereafter constructed or acquired by the company shall constitute the line of railway to be called The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway.\nBy c. 99 of the Dominion Statutes of 1906, the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company was incorporated with authority to construct certain named lines of railway, with authority (s. 28) to enter into arrangements with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company for the sale and purchase of any of these lines, or for the operation of them. In 1911, by the statute already referred to, the Branch Lines Company acquired power to construct the branch known as the Coal Branch, and, with the authority of the Governor in Council, to construct from the Coal Branch branches connecting with the coal mining areas in the vicinity. Apparently it was under the authority of this provision that the agreements were entered into with the Luscar Company and the Mountain Park Company.\nIf the Mountain Park Branch and the Luscar Branch are generally within the operation of the Railway Act, then there appears to be no good reason for holding that s. 185 does not apply to these branches, or that the Board would not have authority under that section to make an order as against the Grand Trunk Pacific Company, the operating company.\nBy the definition section, \"railway\" includes any railway which the company has authority to construct or to operate; and by s. 5, the Act applies to all persons, railway companies and railways within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, with certain exceptions which are immaterial. S. 5 apparently contemplates railways which, apart from any declaration under s. 92 (10) of the British North America Act, are under Dominion jurisdiction. S. 7 deals with the effect of the Act as regards railways in respect of which such a declaration has been made; and s. 6 (c) contains such a declaration, affecting, if it be legally operative, all railways owned or operated by a railway company under the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion. S. 6 (c) obviously and admittedly applies, and if it be within the competence of the Dominion, unquestionably has the effect of bringing these branches within the scope of the Railway Act. The authority of the Dominion Parliament to enact s. 6 (c) will be discussed later. For reasons to be stated, it appears to be inoperative as a declaration under s. 92 (10c) of the British North America Act.\nBut this is not necessarily conclusive on the question of the application of the Railway Act. If the Luscar Branch is part of a railway in respect of which the Dominion has jurisdiction in the absence of a declaration under s. 92 (10c) of the British North America Act, then by force of s. 5 the Railway Act applies to it. Whether or not a line of railway operated as a branch of a Dominion railway\u2014that is to say, a railway within s. 92 (10a), extending beyond the limits of a province or connecting two or more of the provinces\u2014is an integral part of the Dominion railway in such a way as to give the Dominion jurisdiction over the branch, must be largely a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances of the case.\nThe Mountain Park Branch and the Luscar Branch are, with the Coal Branch, operated under the joint authority of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company's charter and the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company's charter. The contracts are virtually contracts entered into by the coal companies with the authority of the provincial legislature for the construction of these branches for the Branch Lines Company, the cost of construction to be paid in the first instance by the coal companies, and reimbursed by a rebate on charges for the carriage of coal. The intention of the contracts is that the Branch Lines Company shall ultimately become the owner of both branches, and that they shall be operated as parts of the Grand Trunk Pacific system. We have not before us any information as to the arrangements between the Grand Trunk Pacific Company and the Branch Lines Company, or as to the relations between the companies, but no dispute has been raised as to the authority of the Dominion to enact the Branch Lines Company's Act of 1906 or the amending Act of 1911. S. 36 of the Act of 1906, by which it is declared that the company's undertaking is a work for the general advantage of Canada, seems to be of very doubtful validity, as applied, at all events, to works subsequently authorized. But it may be assumed that, if the facts were disclosed, it would appear that in fact the Coal Branch is a part of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway undertaking, and therefore within the authority of the Dominion.\nIn fact, the Mountain Park Branch and the Luscar Branch are worked as part of the undertaking of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company as a railway in operation; they are part of the railway which, under the name of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, connects the province of Alberta with the other provinces of the Dominion. The fact alone that the legal title has not yet passed to the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company does not seem in itself to be a circumstance sufficiently important to segregate them from the principal line for the purposes of legislative jurisdiction. The proper conclusion seems to be that they come within the operation of the Railway Act by force of s, 5.\nThe grounds on which it can be argued that s. 6 (c) of the Railway Act does not constitute a valid declaration within s. 92 (10c) of the British North America Act, can be very concisely stated. The object of this provision, it is said, was not to enable the Dominion to take away jurisdiction from the provinces in respect of a given class of potential works; works, that is to say, which are not in existence, which may never come into existence, and the execution of which is not in contemplation; the purpose of the provision is rather to enable the Dominion to assume control over specific existing works, or works the execution of which is in contemplation. The control intended to be vested in the Dominion is the control over the execution of the work, and over the executed work. If a declaration in respect of all works comprised within a generic description be competent, the necessary consequence would appear to be that, with regard to the class of works designated by the description, provincial jurisdiction would be excluded, although Dominion jurisdiction might never be exercised, and although no work answering the description should ever come into existence.\nIn support of this view it may be said that the purport of the declaration authorized appears to be that the work which is the subject of it either is an existing work, beneficial to the country as a whole, or is such a work as ought to be executed, or, at all events, is to be executed, in the interests of the country as a whole. An affirmation in general terms, for example, an affirmation that all railways owned or operated hereafter by a Dominion company are works which ought to be or will be executed, as beneficial to the country as a whole, would be almost, if not quite, meaningless, and could hardly have been contemplated as the basis of jurisdiction. Of course, this provision of s. 92 must be construed reasonably, and reasonably applied. Parliament having assumed control of a work, such, for example, as a trunk line of railway within the limits of a province, may well, as included within the jurisdiction intended to be conferred by s. 92 (10c), have ample authority with regard to subsidiary works existing and non-existing, even though such subsidiary works should not have been specifically in contemplation at the date of the declaration. It is in light of this consideration, it would appear, that the observation of Lord Macnaghten, in The City of Toronto v. The Bell Telephone Company[5], ought to be construed and applied.\nThere seems to be a preponderance of argument in support of the view that s. 6 (c) is not an effective declaration under s. 92 (10c) of the British North America Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal by leave of a judge of this court from a decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada holding that it had jurisdiction to entertain an application by the respondent McDonald for an order of the Board granting him running rights over a spur track in use by the appellant and for an order of the Board requiring the respondent, the Canadian National Railways, to grant him permission for the construction of a spur track to serve his coal lease.\nThe appellant is a colliery company and had been authorized by a statute (c. 78 of 1921) of the province of Alberta to construct a railway to connect with the railway of the Mountain Park Coal Company, Limited, at or near Leyland station. In April, 1923, the appellant entered into an agreement with the Mountain Park Coal Company, the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company and the Grand Trunk Pacific Company, the two latter companies now represented by the Canadian National Railways, for the construction and operation of this railway. It also submitted its railway to the operation of certain agreements between the three other companies concerning the construction and operation of the railway of the Mountain Park Coal Company. The effect of all these agreements is that these railways were built by the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company at the expense of the two colliery companies, the cost of construction to be reimbursed to the latter by certain rebates allowed them on the shipment of all coal over these railways, it being agreed that when the companies are fully reimbursed the railways will become the property of the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company. The Grand Trunk Pacific Company undertook to operate the railways and to furnish such rolling stock as would be necessary. In the agreement made by it with the three other companies, the appellant consented to any necessary application of the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company (or the Canadian National Railways) to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for approval of the location of the Luscar branch and the maintenance and operation thereof by the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company.\nThe respondent McDonald was the owner of Tarns coal lease, Mountain Park Branch, Canadian National Railways, in the vicinity of the Luscar branch, and desired to obtain from the Board of Railway Commissioners permission to use a \"Y\" of the Luscar branch and also to construct from this \"Y\" a spur track to serve his coal lease approximately 1,000 feet in length. This application was opposed by the appellant which denied the jurisdiction of the Board to grant it. The Board having decided that it could entertain the application, the appellant applied to a judge of this court for leave to appeal from the decision of the Board. This leave was granted and the order specified as follows the points of jurisdiction which were in question:\u2014\n(1) Whether s.s. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act of Canada is within the legislative powers of the Dominion of Canada.\n(2) Whether assuming that Parliament has power to legislate as to the subject matter, a general declaration not specifying any particular railway or railways, as under s.s. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act of Canada, is a declaration complying with par. (c) of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act.\n(3) Whether having regard to the provisions of c. 78 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1921, s.s. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act of Canada has any application to the Luscar Collieries Limited.\n(4) Whether the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada under s. 6, s.s. (c) of the Railway Act of Canada has jurisdiction to make any order establishing connection with or giving any running rights over the railway constructed by Luscar Collieries Ltd., and if not, has the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada otherwise any jurisdiction to make such order. The Attorney General of Canada intervened to support the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners. The Attorney General of Alberta, although notified of the order granting leave to appeal, did not instruct counsel to appear on his behalf at the argument, although subsequently, in answer to certain questions put by the court, a factum was filed on his behalf. The Canadian National Railways, respondents, were represented by counsel who stated that he neither asserted nor disputed the jurisdiction of the Board to make the order applied for.\nThe third point of jurisdiction mentioned in the order granting leave to appeal does not require any special consideration if the appellant is wrong as to the other points. For if s.s. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act (of Canada) is within the legislative powers of the Dominion, and if the declaration therein contained complies with par. (c) of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, the Board of Railway Commissioners has jurisdiction to allow the application of the respondent McDonald, and nothing in the Alberta statute can stand in the way of the exercise of this jurisdiction. If on the other hand the appellant is right in its attack on s.s. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act, the Board is without jurisdiction to grant the order applied for and no opinion need be expressed as to the effect of the Alberta statute. The outstanding question for determination on this appeal is whether s.s. (c) of s. 6 of the Railway Act is within the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion, and it can be so considered only if it complies with the requirements of par. (c) of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act.\nSubsection 10 of s. 92 of the latter Act deals with the jurisdiction of the province as to local works. It reads as follows:\n10. Local works and undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:\u2014\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings, connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province;\n(b) Lines of steamships between the province and any British or foreign country;\n(c) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces. The power conferred on Parliament to declare that works wholly situate within the province are for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces, is obviously a far-reaching power. Parliament is the sole judge of the advisability of making this declaration as a matter of policy which it alone can decide. And when the power is exercised in conformity with the grant, it vests in Parliament exclusive legislative authority over the local work which it removes from the provincial to the federal field of jurisdiction.\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that this power is frequently exercised by the Canadian Parliament. It has often done so in wide and comprehensive terms, as can be seen by the different enactments of the Railway Act. Thus in 1883, in an Act further to amend the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, 46 Vict., c. 24, s. 6, Parliament declared ten named lines of railway to be works for the general advantage of Canada, and after this declaration it stated that\neach and every branch line or railway now or hereafter connecting with or crossing the said lines of railway, or any of them., is a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nThis enactment was repeated in the Railway Act, c. 109 of the Revised Statutes of 1886, s. 121, and in the Railway Act of 1888, 51 Vict., c. 29, s. 306. In 1893, by 56 Vict., c. 27 Parliament declared that the railway of any company should not be crossed, intersected, joined or united by or with any other railway, nor should any railway be intersected or crossed by any street railway, electric railway or tramway, whether constructed under Dominion or provincial or municipal authority or otherwise, unless the place and mode of the proposed crossing, intersection, or junction or union, are first approved by the Railway Committee. This, it was stated in a subsequent statute, 63-64 Vict., c. 23, 1900, did not imply that street railways and tramways, by reason only of crossing or connecting with one or other of the lines of railway mentioned in s. 306, should be taken or considered to be works for the general advantage of Canada. And in 1903, by 3 Edw. VII, c. 58, an Act to amend and consolidate the law respecting railways, which repealed in toto previous railway Acts, including of course s. 306 of 51 Vict., c. 29, it was declared by s. 7, that railways, steam or electric street railways or tram- ways, the construction or operation of which is authorized by a special Act passed by the legislature of any province, connecting with or crossing a railway which, at the time of such connection or crossing, is subject to the legislative authority of Parliament, is a work for the general advantage of Canada in respect only to such connection and crossing or to through traffic thereon.\nIn 1919, by the Railway Act now in force, 9-10 Geo. V, c. 68, it was enacted by s. 6 as follows:\nThe provisions of this Act shall, without limiting the effect of the Last preceding section, extend and apply to,\u2014\n(a) every railway company incorporated elsewhere than in Canada and owning, controlling, operating or running trains or rolling stock upon or over any line or lines of railway in Canada either owned, controlled, leased or operated by such company or companies, whether in either case such ownership, control, or operation is acquired by purchase, lease, agreement or by any other means whatsoever;\n(b) every railway company operating or running trains from any point in the United States to any point in Canada.\n(c) every railway or portion thereof, whether constructed under the authority of the Parliament of Canada or not, now or hereafter owned, controlled, leased, or operated by a company wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, or by a company operating a railway wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, whether such ownership, control, or first-mentioned operation is acquired or exercised by purchase, lease, agreement or other means whatsoever, and whether acquired or exercised under authority of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislature of any province, or otherwise, howsoever; and every railway or portion thereof, now or hereafter so Owned, controlled, leased or operated shall be deemed and is hereby declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nThis latter provision the appellant attacks as transcending the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament. Under the agreements above referred to, its railway is operated by the organization now known as the Canadian National Railways, which is subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and it will become the property of this organization when the appellant is fully reimbursed the cost of construction. It thus comes within the scope of the declaration made by Parliament that any railway so operated shall be deemed and is declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nThe argument on behalf of the appellant is that the power which the British North America Act confers on Parliament to declare for the general advantage of Canada local works and undertakings is a power which can be exercised only in respect of a specified work, a work not necessarily named, but so identified by its description that it can be located on the plans or upon the ground. This, the appellant contends, cannot be said of the declaration made in s. 6, which comprises railways now or hereafter owned, controlled, leased or operated by a company wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. It argues that the judgment of Parliament must be exercised as to the particular work which it declares to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, that the line must be drawn somewhere, and that a general declaration or a declaration applicable to a class of works, as distinguished from a specific work, is inoperative to remove the class of works from the provincial to the federal field of jurisdiction.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant could cite no decided case on the point at issue, for beyond a statement in the headnote, but not in the reasons for judgment, of a decision of the late Mr. Justice Street in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Hamilton Radial Electric Ry. Co.[6], there is nothing in the reports bearing on this constitutional problem. The precise point now to be determined was indeed mentioned, but not decided, by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Hamilton, Grimsby & Beamsville Ry. Co. v. Attorney General for Ontario[7]. This decision, may however be usefully referred to as it holds that Parliament can at any time repeal a declaration which it has made under s.s. (c) of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act.\nIn 1888, the Railway Committee referred to this court a question as to the validity of a Manitoba statute authorizing the construction of a railway which crossed a branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The formal answer of the court is alone reported (In re Portage extension of the Red River Valley Ry.) [8], and was that the statute was valid and effectual to confer authority on the Railway Commissioner of Manitoba to construct the railway. The reasons on which the answer was based were not reported, but in the archives of the court an extended memorandum, (so termed) or draft judgment of the late Mr. Justice Patterson was found. The learned judge was inclined to favour the provincial contention as to the exercise of the declaratory power, but affirmed the validity of the Manitoba statute on the ground that a federal statute, not cited at the argument, impliedly recognized that the provincial Act governed the construction of the railway. He was of opinion that a declaration made by Parliament under s.s. (c) of s.s. 10 cannot be recalled, but this can no longer be said in view of the decision of the Judicial Committee in the case above mentioned.\nThe argument addressed to the court upon this reference by four very eminent counsel, Messrs. Edward Blake, Q.C. and Christopher Robinson, Q.C. for the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., and Messrs. Oliver Mowat Q.C. (afterwards Sir Oliver Mowat) and Dalton McCarthy, Q.C. for the Manitoba Government, has fortunately been preserved and of this argument we have been furnished copious extracts. It does not seem possible to add anything to the discussion of the important constitutional problem which the court however did not solve. So the question submitted is in every way an open one.\nExpressing now the opinion which I have formed after full consideration, it seems obvious that if Parliament can declare for the general advantage of Canada a specified work, it can also, in one declaration, comprise several works having the same distinguishing characteristics, or a class of works sufficiently described so as to leave no doubt as to the identity of each member of the class, as coming within the description of the enactment. Certainly if the works declared to be for the general advantage of Canada are adequately described, it is no objection that the enactment has grouped them together or described them as a class of works, each member of which can be identified as having been contemplated by Parliament when it made the declaration. And such a declaration cannot be termed a general declaration, if that really is an objection, because it comprises all the works so described. However, wide may be its application, it is specific in its description, and the judgment of Parliament is necessarily directed to each particular work which may now or hereafter come within this description.\nIt must not be forgotten that the power conferred on Parliament applies to such works as are, before or after their execution, declared by Parliament to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more provinces. The work may not be in existence when in advance of its execution it is declared for the general advantage of Canada. It must therefore be described so that when it does come into existence it can be identified as being the work which Parliament had in mind when it made its declaration. If this condition be fulfilled, there can be, in my judgment, no possible complaint against a declaration that a class of works, and each member of the class, is for the general advantage of Canada. It matters not that new members of the described class may come into existence after the declaration is made, for the declaration can be made before or after the execution of the work. Parliament has considered in advance each new member coming within the described class, and has exercised its judgment as to each. And it would seem as inconvenient as it would be contrary to the wide terms of the grant of power to require that each member of the class should be the object of a new declaration by Parliament when it comes into existence or when plans have been prepared for its construction.\nIf this interpretation of par. (c) of s.s. 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act be sound, there is no room for the objection that the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces as to local works and undertakings is swept away by the declaration here in question. The argument before the court took a very wide range. It was urged that Parliament might conceivably declare all railways wholly situate within a province to be works for the general advantage of Canada, that a line must be drawn somewhere, and that the whole provincial jurisdiction as to local railways might be thus taken away.\nWith these objections or these fears we need have no concern. It is unnecessary to discuss where the line should be drawn, for the present case is certainly well within the line of a reasonable construction of par. (c) of s.s. 10. That is the only point on which we have to pass judgment. And it would seem as unreasonable as it would be impracticable to require that each time a provincial line is operated by a Dominion company a special declaration should be made by Parliament. The policy or the reason for the declaration is a matter for the consideration of Parliament alone. All that it is necessary to say here, and that is the conclusion at which I have arrived, is that in enacting s. 6, s.s. (c) of the Railway Act, Parliament has not overstepped its legislative jurisdiction.\nThe appeal against the decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners should be dismissed. The appellant should pay the costs of both respondents and of the Attorney General of Canada.\nNewcombe J.\u2014In the distribution of legislative powers by the British North America Act 1867 it is in effect enacted by the joint operation of s. 91 (29) and s. 92 (10) that the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the class of subjects described as local works, which,\nalthough wholly situate within, the province, are, before or after their execution, declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada, or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\nThere is no longer any question that works within the purview of this provision include railways.\nThe Railway Act, 1919, c. 68 of the Dominion, by s. 6 (c), which is one of the clauses defining the application of the Act, enacts that the provisions of the Act shall extend and apply to\nevery railway or portion thereof, whether constructed under the authority of the Parliament of Canada or not, now or hereafter owned, controlled, leased or operated by a company wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada or by a company operating a railway wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, whether such ownership, control, or first mentioned operation is acquired or exercised by purchase, lease, agreement or other means whatsoever, and whether acquired or exercised under authority of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislature of any province, or otherwise howsoever; and every railway or portion thereof, now or hereafter so owned, controlled, leased or operated shall be deemed and is hereby declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nBy Act of Alberta, c. 78 of 1921, power was granted to the appellant company to construct and operate a railway in the province of Alberta, known in the case as the Luscar Branch, for the transport of its coal to the railway line of the Mountain Park Coal Company, and in the execution of the power so conferred the appellant company constructed the Luscar Branch; assuming as I shall, because it was not questioned at the bar, that the agreements submitted are within the powers of the respective companies, the Canadian National Railways, by the effect of these agreements, acquired and exercise, subject to the terms specified, the operating rights upon the Luscar Branch, and it thus comes with the description of par. (c) of s. 6 above quoted, as being a railway operated by a company which is wholly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and therefore a work declared to be for the general advantage of Canada.\nBut it is said that the legislative declaration is ineffective because upon the true interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, the declaration can competently be made only with reference to a work existing at the time or particularly specified. The question is like that which was decided favourably to Dominion authority by Street J. in Grand Trunk v. Hamilton Electric Railway Co.[9]. A similar question was left undecided by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Co. v. Attorney General for Ontario and others[10]. The latter case however removes some of the doubts which formerly existed with regard to the meaning and effect of the 10th enumeration of s. 92. The Lord Chancellor (Buckmaster) in pronouncing the judgment said:\nTheir Lordships are clearly of opinion that s. 92, s.s. 10, never intended that a declaration once made by the Parliament of Canada should be incapable of modification or repeal. To come to such a conclusion would result in the impossibility of the Dominion ever being able to repair the oversights by which, even with the greatest care, mistakes frequently creep into the clauses of Acts of Parliament. The declaration under s. 92, s.3. 10 (c), is a declaration which can be varied by the same authority as that by which it was made. In the present case their Lordships see no reason to doubt that if the statute of 1888 effected such a declaration as to place the whole railway under Dominion control, that declaration has been properly and effectually varied, and the appellant company have ceased to be, even if they ever once were, under the control of the Dominion Board.\nFrom this it would seem logically to follow that the exclusive power of Parliament to declare works wholly situated within a province, either before or after their execution, to be for the general advantage of Canada is a legislative power to be exercised in the manner and subject to the incidents which are appropriate or belong to the general subjects of legislation which fall to the Parliament in the distribution effected by ss. 91 and 92; and since the declaration once made is susceptible of modification or repeal, it would not be an unreasonable consequence that it may be enacted for a temporary purpose, or to be effective conditionally.\nNow it is common knowledge that the Parliament of Canada when acting within those limits by which its powers are circumscribed is not in any sense an agent or delegate of the Imperial Parliament, but has, and was intended to have, plenary powers of legislation as large and of the same nature as those of the latter Parliament. The Queen v. Burah[11]. The authority conferred upon the Parliament of Canada is as plenary and as ample within the limits prescribed as the Imperial Parliament in the plentitude of its power possessed and could bestow. Within these limits the Parliament of Canada is supreme and has the same authority as the Imperial Parliament. Hodge v. The Queen[12]. It was in the exercise of powers such as these, conferred by ss. 91 and 92 (10) of the British North America Act, 1867, that the Parliament, of Canada enacted the Railway Act. In par. (a) of s. 92 (10) it was not necessary for the Imperial Parliament to mention specifically or to describe individually every work and undertaking which was to come within the Dominion powers; every work of the general description passed under the words\nlines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the province.\nRailways are works within the meaning of par. (a), because they are mentioned as exceptions from the general class of local works; so likewise are they works within the meaning of par. (c), and the word \"works\" as used in the latter paragraph is no less comprehensive, as to the character of the works embraced, than it is in paragraph (a), except that, in locality, area or extent, the works included within paragraph (c) are limited to the province; these are strictly local or provincial works, whereas in paragraph (a) the works although described as local are in reality Dominion or interprovincial; that I take it is the only distinction. The effect of paragraph (c) is that railways and other works wholly situate within a province may, before or after their execution, in the exercise of the uncontrolled judgment and legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, be brought within its exclusive jurisdiction; and, by the force of the Imperial Act, the Parliament of Canada has the same power in this particular as is possessed by the Imperial Parliament, although of course the power must be executed in the prescribed manner, by way of declaration for the general advantage. It is thus a sovereign legislative power which the Parliament of Canada exercises; and, when it comes to execute that power, it is no more excluded from the use of general language to describe the works to which the declaration is to apply than the Imperial Parliament was in describing the works which were without any further legislative declaration assigned to the Parliament of Canada. In either case the general rules of legislative expression and interpretation must govern, and, applying these rules, it follows that the definition of the subject matter of the declaration may be in general terms or specific, so long as the language be apt to ascertain with certainty the works to which the declaration is to extend.\nThe practical difficulties and the inconvenience and inadequacy of the interpretation for which the appellant contends will be manifest upon reflection. It might for example not unnaturally be found expedient for the Parliament to assume permanent authority over factories for the manufacture of arms and ammunition, and no one of these factories might be too insignificant or of a character too local to be neglected in the general taking over. Then how could the project reasonably be effected save by a comprehensive declaration in general terms? It would be impracticable to specify every factory or every locality in Canada; and, if the declaration as affecting a particular work could be made only after the work was actually constructed or projected, and so could be identified as a separate individual of the class, it would during an interval escape the regulations for the enforcement of which it was the object of the declaration to provide.\nIt may be that the general advantage of Canada with relation to a work or class of works is in the judgment of Parliament determined by a characteristic or quality or effect which is common to all works of a certain class, and therefore that the public interest or general advantage requires that Parliament should assume authority over every work of the particular kind or class. For example it might be considered that every local railway which terminates on the seaboard should, by reason of having that terminus and its connection with navigation and shipping, be regulated by Parliament. Must there be as many separate declarations as there are such railways, or may not Parliament invoke the expedient of general description to include all which possess the common and determining-factor? I see no reason to the contrary so long as the declaration operates by way of description to recognize the works before or after their execution as being for the general advantage, and not as comprehending the whole subject matter from which Parliament is empowered to make its selections. Perhaps another apt illustration would be local wireless broadcasting stations as to which reasons for a comprehensive declaration suggest themselves, or are not difficult to imagine.\nIt will be perceived that by the express words of clause (c) declaration may take place before or after the execution of the work. It is mere conjecture that the imperial Parliament contemplated that the power should not be exercised with regard to a future work until it had become a fixed and definite design, or until it could be identified as a work actually in contemplation. The declaration may be made at any time, although it operates only when the work shall have come into existence, because the subject matter is defined as works of a class declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada; therefore it would seem that until there is actually a work of the kind described in the declaration there would be nothing in the declaration except its potential authority, and therefore in the interval no disturbance of the preexisting distribution of legislative power. Both in the introductory lines of s. 92 (10) and in s. 91 (29) works and undertakings belonging to classes are the subjects to which the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament attaches. Under s. 92 (10 c.) it is Parliament which creates the class by its declaration. Why may not Parliament, as it has done in practice, call into existence a class uno flatu? Why is it necessary that it should create the class by the less convenient method of specifying each constituent unit? I am utterly at a loss to discover in s. 92 (10 c.) any word or accent of Parliamentary intention that it is essential to the execution of the power to name a work to which the declaration is to apply, if the description be otherwise adequate to identify and include the work, or to define a class of works by describing the individual specimens rather than by apt words descriptive of the whole.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in City of Toronto v. The Bell Telephone Company[13], an authority which was not mentioned in the Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Case[14], indicates that in the opinion of their Lordships, who constituted a strong board not unused to the interpretation of the British North America Act, the declaration in the former case, which was expressed in general terms, would have been effective if the works had been wholly situate within the province. The Bell Telephone Company of Canada was incorporated by Dominion statute, c. 67 of 1880, and it was subsequently amended by c. 85 of 1882. By s. 2 of the Amending Act it is provided that the company shall have power\nto build, establish, construct, purchase, acquire or lease, and maintain and operate, or sell or let any line or lines for the transmission of messages by telephone, in Canada or elsewhere, and to make connection, for the purpose of telephone business, with the line or lines of any telegraph or telephone company in Canada or elsewhere.\nBy s. 4 of the original Act it is enacted that:\n4. The said company shall have power and authority to purchase or lease for any term of years any telephone line established or to be established, either in Canada or elsewhere, connecting or hereafter to be connected with the lines which the company is authorized to construct, or to purchase or lease for any term of years the right of any company to construct any such telephone line.\nS. 4 of the Amending Act is as follows:\n4. The said Act of incorporation as hereby amended, and the works thereunder authorized, are hereby declared to be for the general advantage of Canada.\nTwo minor points were mentioned as worthy of notice in the judgment of their Lordships, and the second was concerned with the effect of the section last quoted. Lord McNaghten said, referring to the company's Act of incorporation as amended.\nIt is not very easy to see what the part of the section declaring the Act of incorporation to be for the general advantage of Canada means. As regards the works therein referred to, if they had been \"wholly situate within the province,\" the effect would have been to give exclusive jurisdiction over them to the Parliament of Canada; but, inasmuch as the works and undertakings of the company authorized by the Act of incorporation were not confined within the limits of the province, this part of the declaration seems to be unmeaning.\nThe works referred to are described in the most general terms and they are ascertained and identified only by their description as telephone lines to be built, established, constructed, purchased, acquired or leased by the company; or as telephone lines established or to be established, connecting or to be connected with the lines of the company, and purchased or leased by the company. S. 4 of the Act of 1880 even goes so far as to provide that the telephone lines which the company shall have power to purchase or lease may be those which connect or may be connected with lines which the company is authorized to construct, and some of the lines which were the subject of the legislative declaration were therefore lines which were not only to be established in the future, but further to be identified by their connection with lines to be constructed by the company in the future. Nevertheless it is said that the effect of this general declaration, as to the works therein referred to, if they had been wholly situate within the province, would have been to give exclusive jurisdiction over them to the Parliament of Canada.\nIt was suggested on behalf of the appellant that the legislative declaration that every railway now or hereafter operated by a Dominion company shall be deemed to be a work for the general advantage of Canada should be interpreted to mean that such a railway should be deemed to be for the general advantage of Canada only while it is in fact being operated by the Dominion company; this is not the necessary effect or interpretation of the clause; but if it were the meaning, the objection would perhaps be fatal to the validity of the enactment if it were held that the power resulting from s. 92 (10 c.) could, as to any work or class of works, only be exercised permanently and in its entirety, that the power is exhausted by the exercise of it, and is in its effect irrevocable; but, seeing that the declaration is not incapable of modification or repeal, it may be enacted originally in a modified manner or to endure for a limited period; and, while of course care must be taken to see that the declaration is not uncertain, the general maxim certum est quod certum reddi potest would apply. Although conceivably there might be some difficulty in ascertaining the facts upon which such a declaration is to operate, or the existence of the conditions which are to accompany its operation, that is no more than a trouble which is incident to any statute, the operation of which is by its terms declared to depend upon facts or a condition of things which it may be necessary to establish by proof. It is in the abstract no valid objection to an Act of Parliament that it operates only for a limited time, or occasionally, or at intervals depending upon conditions, and the statutes abound with examples of such legislation. The declaration for general advantage of Canada is in effect a mere constitutional formula by the use of which Parliament, in the general public interest, assumes exclusive legislative authority, whether temporarily or without limitation of time, according to the intention, over works of the character specified in s. 92 (10 c.) which would in the absence of the declaration be regarded as local works within a province. I apprehend that if Parliament be endowed with the authority to declare a work to be for the general advantage of Canada and thus to acquire over it the exclusive legislative authority, and after a time to repeal that Act, thereby remitting the subject to its original provincial jurisdiction, it has equally the power to limit its declaration at the time of the enactment and to prescribe the time or the conditions at or upon which the declaration shall cease to apply and when the jurisdiction shall in consequence revert to the province; it is only necessary to express the casus legis. In this view it is unnecessary to determine whether the declaration in the present case would continue in force if the railway cease to be operated by the Dominion company. No doubt is suggested that in fact, at the time of the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, the railway was operated, and is still operated, by the National Railways, and indeed will always be so operated if the existing dispositions be fulfilled, and it will be possible to determine any question as to the status of the railway at a time in the future if it should arise. At present the railway is clearly of the kind described by the clause of the Railway Act which embodies the declaration. It may be observed that the declaration of the appellant company's railway to be for the general advantage of Canada is not out of line with the general policy of the British North America Act, and not in that sense an interference with provincial rights, because this railway connects with the National Railway system and is therefore a connecting railway as well as a railway operated by the National authorities; but I do not find it necessary, in the view which I take of the case, to determine whether or not the Parliament could have exercised its authority, with respect to the Luscar Branch, situated and connected as it is, in the absence of a declaration for the general advantage.\nRinfret J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Woods, Field, Macalister & Craig.\nSolicitors for the respondent N.

The Canadian National Railways, [1925] S.C.R. 494\nDate: 1925-06-18\nThe City of Ottawa (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Canadian National Railway (Defendant) Respondent.\n1925: May 29; 1925: June 18.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nAssessment and taxes\u2014Agreement for fixed valuation\u2014Term of years\u2014Computation\u2014Mode of assessment.\nIn 1907 an agreement was entered into by the city of Ottawa with the Can. Atl. Ry. Co. which was undertaking to build a hotel in the city to cost not less than $1,000,000. The agreement provided \u201cthat for and during the period of fifteen years next ensuing from and including the year 1909 the total assessed value of the said hotel and the land used in connection therewith and all buildings * * * and appurtenances * * * is hereby fixed and agreed upon at the sum of five hundred thousand dollars and no more.\u201d During this period the rates on such valuation were to be the same as those imposed on property owners generally. In 1907 and since the system of the city was\u2014and is\u2014to prepare, not later than September 30 of each year, an assessment roll to form the basis of taxation for the following year if the council of that year so decides.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (56 Ont. L.R. 153) that the agreement for the fixed assessment value must be construed in connection with the system according to which the first assessment on the hotel property would be levied in 1910; the fifteen year period, therefore, included the year 1924.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board in favour of the appellant.\nThe only question for decision on this appeal is whether or not the fifteen-year period for a fixed assessment of the Chateau Laurier, under the agreement the material portions of which are set out in the above head-note, expired in 1923 or extended to 1924. The Court of Revision, County Judge and Municipal and Railway Board held that it ended in 1923 but were overruled by the Appellate Division.\nProctor for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014By a statute of the Ontario Legislature of 1907, ch. 79 of the statutes of that year, the Corporation of the City of Ottawa was authorized to conclude an agreement with the Canada Atlantic Railway Company, the respond- ents\u2019 predecessors in title, to fix, for a period of years, on specified conditions, the municipal assessment for taxation purposes of a central passenger station to be constructed by the railway company, and also to fix at the sum of $500,000, for a period of fifteen years, the municipal assessment for such purposes of an hotel, also to be constructed by the railway company.\nPursuant to this authority, the municipality and the railway company executed an agreement on the 16th day of November, 1907, by which the railway company undertook (inter alia) to construct an hotel, to cost not less than one million dollars, and a fixed assessment was agreed to, for a period defined by the agreement.\nThe question in controversy between the parties to this appeal arises from the construction of clause 3 of the agreement of 1907, which reads as follows:\u2014\n3. And for the considerations aforesaid the city, in pursuance also of the powers and authority conferred on it by the said statute of the province of Ontario, chapter 79 of 7 Edward VII, agrees with the Canada Atlantic that for and during the period of fifteen years next ensuing from and including the year 1909, the total assessed value of the said hotel and the land used in connection therewith and all buildings, superstructures, substructures, fixtures and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging shall be and the said assessment and valuation is hereby fixed and agreed upon at the sum of five hundred thousand dollars and no more, and it is hereby distinctly agreed and declared that the said above described property shall only be liable to be rated for all purposes of taxation by the city in each of the said fifteen years, on such fixed assessment valuation of five hundred thousand dollars and no more and that such rates to be imposed on said fixed assessment of five hundred thousand dollars shall be the usual and the same as the rates imposed on all ratepayers and property owners of the said city of Ottawa generally, in each of said fifteen years as provided by the provisions of the Assessment Act and amendments thereto.\nFor some years before 1907 it had been the practice of the municipality, in preparing the annual assessment roll, to follow the procedure authorized by section 57 of the Assessment Act (c. 95, R.S.O., 1914), and this procedure has been followed ever since. According to this plan, the assessment roll is prepared and completed in each year not later than the thirtieth of September, submitted to the Court of Revision before the end of the year, and forms, if the council of the ensuing year so decides, the basis of taxation for the latter year.\nThe municipality contends that the fifteen-year period defined by clause 3 came to an end with the year 1923, and that there is nothing in the clause to disable the municipal- ity from assessing the property in the assessment roll prepared in that year, which was to form the basis of taxation for the year 1924, at its full value in the normal way, without reference to the terms of the agreement. On behalf of the railway company, on the other hand, it is argued that the agreement is expressed in contemplation of the procedure already mentioned in relation to assessment, which was in force in the municipality, and that the declaration in clause 3, fixing the amount of the assessment during the specified period, governs the municipality in respect of any assessment made in any one of the years during that period, in conformity with that procedure, which was known to all parties, and which all parties assumed, and rightly assumed, would not be discontinued.\nIt would appear that the agreement must be interpreted in light of this procedure. It is impossible to deny that the roll prepared under sec. 57 of the Assessment Act in one year as the basis of taxation for the next year (at the discretion, it is true, of the next year\u2019s council), is properly described as an \u201cAssessment Roll,\u201d or that the entries in it respecting assessable properties and their values are properly described as \u201cassessments.\u201d The statute so describes the roll, and the statute provides for appeals in the ordinary way to the Court of Revision and the County Judge, in respect of the \u201cassessments\u201d comprised in it. When, therefore, the statute speaks of a \u201cfixed assessment\u201d of $500,000 \u201cupon a hotel,\u201d and the agreement speaks of \u201cthe total assessed value of the said hotel and the land,\u201d and of the \u201csaid assessment and valuation,\u201d and of \u201cthe fixed assessment valuation,\u201d and of the \u201csaid fixed assessment,\u201d all these phrases are properly capable of application to the valuation or the assessment appearing in any annual roll made in conformity with the settled practice. There appears to be little force in the suggestion that either the statute or the agreement contemplates an assessment by operation of law in disregard of the ordinary procedure. Everybody must have assumed that the sum of $500,000 would be entered in the usual way in the annual roll as the assessed value of the company\u2019s property, for the reason alone, if for no other, that this would be the convenient and normal way of ensuring that this sum would be taken into account as one of the elements making up the total value of taxable property in respect of which the rate would be struck. The language being fairly susceptible of this construction, it seems reasonable to read it in light of the existing course of procedure, and, in ascertaining its true construction, it is quite impossible to ignore the subsequent practice under the agreement. Under that practice, in the year 1909, the assessed value of the hotel property was entered as $500,000 in the roll prepared as the basis of taxation for the year 1910. Notice of this assessment, it must be assumed, was in due course sent to the company, and it was on this footing that the parties carried out the agreement thereafter. The majority of the Appellate Division seems to have rightly concluded that, in view of these considerations, the first part of paragraph 3 must be read as containing a declaration that, for the purpose of any assessment made during the specified fifteen years, including any assessment made in accordance with the existing procedure in any one of those years as the basis of taxation for the ensuing year, the value of the property was ascertained and fixed at the sum of $500,000, and that the effect of that part of the clause, if not qualified by the subsequent words, would be to preclude the municipality from entering as that value in the assessment roll prepared in 1923 any higher or other sum than $500,000.\nThis view is attacked upon two grounds: first, it is said that assessments of this character are not really assessments within the meaning of the clause, because they go into effect only at the discretion of the council of the following year. That objection has been sufficiently answered already. The next objection is that in effect, by this construction, the company receives the benefit of an exemption for sixteen, instead of fifteen, years. To this there are two answers: first, the parties must have realized that there was no certainty that for the earlier years, particularly for the year 1910, the fixed assessment would operate for the advantage of the company. In point of fact, it seems probable that it operated to their disadvantage in both the years 1910 and 1911. Secondly, if the parties had acted on the construction now advanced on behalf of the municipality, and taxed the company on the basis of an assessed value of $500,000 for the year 1909, the result would have been in fact an obviously ludicrous one. The hotel was not completed till 1912. The order in council authorizing the transfer of the land was passed only in October, 1909.\nWe cannot assume that the actual course of events was quite outside the expectation of the parties, and if it was at all in accordance with those expectations, it is impossible to suppose that the parties would have provided for taxes on the basis of a valuation of $500,000 in the year 1909. In this view it will be apparent that the construction advanced by the municipality, if adopted, postulates an intention to grant only an exemption for fourteen years, instead of fifteen years. The view above indicated as to the reading of the first part of paragraph three not only gives effect to the words employed by the parties, but gives effect also to their intentions as deduced from all the facts which may legitimately be taken into account for the purpose of construing those words.\nBut the first part of clause 3 cannot, of course, be read alone; and it is argued that, read with the remainder of the clause, the effect is materially qualified. The words to be considered are these:\u2014\nand it is hereby distinctly agreed and declared that the said above described property shall only be liable to be rated for all purposes of taxation by the city in each of the said fifteen years, on such fixed assessment valuation of five hundred thousand dollars and no more and that such rates to be imposed on said fixed assessment of five hundred thousand dollars shall be the usual and the same as the rates imposed on all ratepayers and property owners of the said city of Ottawa generally, in each of said fifteen years as provided by the provisions of the Assessment Act and amendments thereto.\nThe effect of this language may, I think, be fairly stated thus: The municipality is disabled from rating the property mentioned for any purpose of taxation in any one of the specified fifteen years upon a valuation of more than $500,000. It does not limit the effect of the earlier part of the paragraph: it is introduced not for the protection of the municipality, but for the protection of the ratepayer. If, by some carelessness or misapprehension, it is more limited in its scope than it should have been, that is not a ground for declining to give effect to the plain meaning of the words which precede it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Frank B. Proctor.\nSolicitor for the respondent: George F. Macdonnell.\n[1] 56 Ont. L.R. 153.\n"

[1914] c. 195, ss. 5 (9) and 47 (3)).\nBy sec. 5, subsec. 9 of The Ontario Assessment Act every industrial farm, house of industry, etc., \u201cor other charitable institution conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purpose of profit or gain\u201d is exempt from taxation. By sec. 47, subsec. 3 \u201cthe structures * * * on railway lands and used exclusively for railway purposes or incidental thereto * * * shall not be assessed.\u201d A railway company erected, on its own land, a building with all facilities for lodging, entertainment and recreation and handed it over to the Y.M.C.A. which agreed to provide suitable lodgings for its own members and employees of the railway. The railway company did not, and the Y.M.C.A. could not, make any financial gain therefrom.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the appellate Division (56 Ont. L.R. 62) that the building was not exempt from taxation under sec. 5 (9); the words \u201cor other charitable institution\u201d in that subsection mean an institution ejusdem generis, as those previously mentioned; moreover the lodging house in this case was not a charitable institution conducted on philanthropic principles inasmuch as the Y.M.C.A. received an adequate return for the services supplied.\nNor was it exempt under sec. 47 (3); by other provisions of that section the structure must be \u201cin actual use and occupation by the company\u201d and by subsec. 3 it must be \u201cused exclusively for railway purposes or incidental thereto\u201d while other persons than railway employees took advantage of it.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario refusing the appellant\u2019s claim to exemption of its property from taxation.\nThe nature of the questions in dispute and the necessary facts are set out in the above head\u2011note. The building erected by the railway company and the land on which it stood were assessed by the town and the assessment was confirmed by the Court of Revision and County Judge. The Railway and Municipal Board held that the building was exempt under sec. 47 (3) but the Appellate Division held differently and sent the case back to the Board for consideration of the effect of sec. 9 (5). The Board held against exemption under that provision and the case came again before the Appellate Division which decided that there was no right to exemption under either section. Lafleur K.C. and R.E. Laidlaw for the appellant. The railway company erected this building for the sole object of improving the living conditions of its employees and realized no profit from it. This would make it a charitable institution in the ordinary sense. See Commissioners of Income Tax v. Pemsel[1]; In re City of Ottawa and Gray Nuns[2].\nAnd it is a charitable institution under sec. 5 (9) of the Assessment Act, the fact that the Y.M.C.A. received payment for its services being immaterial. Shaw v. Halifax Corporation[3]; In re Noailles[4]; In re City of Ottawa and Gray Nuns2; In re Estlin[5].\nThe Municipal and Railway Board found that the fact is that the property was \u201cused exclusively for railway purposes or incidental thereto\u201d and is, therefore, exempt from taxation under sec. 473.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and G.E. Buchanan K.C. for the respondent. A charitable institution to be exempt under sec. 5 (9) must be of the same character as those named in said subsection. In re Stockport Ragged Industrial and Reformatory Schools[6].\nThe institution in question is not conducted on philanthropic principles. Reg. v. Sterry[7]; Rex v. St. Giles[8] at page 579.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The appellant claims exemption from liability for assessment either under s.s. 9 of s. 5 or under s.s. 3 of s. 47 of The Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O., c. 195) for a property in the town of Capreol.\nOn land owned by it in the town, Canadian Northern Realities, Ltd., a subsidiary corporation of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, erected at a cost of about $80,000 a building containing numerous bed-rooms, a reading-room and other rooms and facilities for lodgings, entertainment and recreation. This building, partly equipped, was handed over to the National Council of the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association of Canada to be operated under the terms of an agreement made between that body and the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway Company. The association agreed to pay a nominal rental ($1 per year), to use the building as a branch of the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association and, inter alia,\nto provide suitable lodgings at all times, subject to the capacity of the branch, to its own members and to employees of the railway at charges that shall be satisfactory to the Railway Superintendent.\nThe evidence shows that, although much the greater number of those who availed themselves of these privileges were railway employees, other citizens of Capreol also took advantage of them. The railway company contributed $150 per month towards the upkeep of the branch and provided, free of charge, fuel, water and light, and maintained insurance on the building, fixtures and equipment. The entire revenue is handled by the association which, by its charter, is prevented from making gain or profit for its members.\nThere is no doubt that the purpose of the railway company in erecting the building and placing it in the hands of the Y.M.C.A. was to improve the social and living conditions of its employees and that the only advantage it derives from the undertaking is in the improved morale and efficiency of its employees who make use of the institution.\nIn 1922 the town of Capreol assessed the land used in connection with the institution at $3,500 and the building at $50,000. The rate of assessment in the town was stated to be 45 mills on the dollar.\nOn appeal to the Court of Revision this assessment was confirmed and the District Court judge dismissed a further appeal taken to him. An appeal to the Railway and Municipal Board was allowed, however, and exemption granted under s.s. 3 of s. 47. On a further appeal to the Appellate Divisional Court, that court took a different view and referred the case back to the board to consider the claim for exemption under s.s. 9 of s. 5, in support of which further evidence was to be admitted. But, after hearing such evidence, the board did not consider the appellant entitled to exemption under this subsection and, upon the matter again coming before the Appellate Divisional Court, the claim for exemption on either ground was finally negatived by a majority of the court. Hence the present appeal.\nSubsection 9 of section 5 of the Assessment Act exempts from assessment: 9. Every industrial farm, house of industry, house of refuge, orphan asylum, and every boys\u2019 or girls\u2019 or infants\u2019 home or other charitable institution conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purpose of profit or gain, and every house belonging to a company for the reformation of offenders, and the land belonging to or connected with the same; but not when occupied by a tenant or lessee. 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 5, par. 9; 1 Geo. V, c. 59, s. 1.\nThe claim of the appellant was that the Railway Y.M.C.A. at Capreol is\na charitable institution conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purpose of profit or gain,\nand that it is, therefore, entitled to the exemption claimed.\nBut it seems obvious that every charitable institution so conducted does not fall within s.s. 9 of s. 5. Special exemptions of undertakings of a charitable nature conducted on philanthropic principles and not for purposes of profit and gain are to be found in s.s. 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 and 13. It seems reasonably certain, therefore, that the words\ncharitable institutions conducted on philanthropic principles and not for the purpose of profit or gain,\nare not used in s.s. 9 in their most comprehensive sense.\nWe agree with Mr. Justice Ferguson that\nthese word\u2019s take their colour from and are limited by the other words of the section\nin which they are used and must be restricted in their application to institutions ejusdem generis as those enumerated. In re Stockport Ragged, Industrial and Reformatory Schools[9]. The category appears to comprise institutions which provide board and lodging at the public expense, or otherwise gratis, to their inmates\u2014Tillmanns & Co. v. Knutsford[10].\nWe cannot think that the legislature meant to exempt as a charitable institution an undertaking of which, as Mr. Justice Ferguson says,\nthe evidence establishes that the moneys collected by the Y.M.C.A. from their members, boarders and lodgers and received from the railway, were an adequate return to the appellants and the Y.M.C.A. for the lodging accommodation and services rendered by the Y.M.C.A., and that the accommodation, lodging and services were not offered, given or rendered as charities, and were not received or accepted as such.\nThe learned judge adds that in his opinion that is the meaning of the evidence and of the Board\u2019s finding. It would seem strange indeed if this institution, which clearly competes with the hotels, lodging houses and clubs of the town, were exempt from the taxation to which they are subject.\nThe claim to exemption under s.s. 3 of s. 47 must now be considered. The provisions of s.s. 3 can best be appreciated by reading it in the context in which it is found.\nSec. 47. (1). Every steam railway company shall annually transmit on or before the first of February to the clerk of every municipality in which any part of the roadway or other real property of the company is situate, a statement shewing:\n(a) The quantity of land occupied by the roadway, and the actual value thereof (according to the average value of land in the locality) as rated on the assessment roll of the previous year;\n(b) The vacant land not in actual use by the company and the value thereof;\n(c) The quantity of land occupied by the railway and being part of the highway, street, road or other public land (but not being a highway, street or road which is merely crossed by the line of railway) and the assessable value as hereinafter mentioned of all property belonging to or used by the company upon, in, over, under, or affixed to the same;\n(d) The real property, other than aforesaid, in actual use and occupation by the company, and its assessable value as hereinafter mentioned;\nand the clerk of the municipality shall communicate such statement to the assessor. 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 44 (1).\n(2) The assessor shall assess the land and property aforesaid as follows:\n(a) The roadway or right of way at the actual value thereof according to the average value of land in the locality; but not including the structures, substructures and superstructures, rails, ties, poles and other property thereon;\n(b) The said vacant land, at its value as other lands are assessed under this Act;\n(c) The structures, substructures, superstructures, rails, ties, poles and other property belonging to or used by the company (not including rolling stock and not including tunnels or bridges in, over, under or forming part of any highway) upon, in, over, under or affixed to any highway, street or road (not being a highway, street or road merely crossed by the line of railway), at their actual cash value as the same would be appraised upon a sale to another company possessing similar powers, rights and franchises, regard being had to all circumstances adversely affecting the value including the non-user of such property; and\n(d) The real property not designated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection in actual use and occupation by the company, at its actual cash value as the same would be appraised upon a sale to another company possessing similar powers, rights and franchises. 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, g. 44 (2).\n(3) Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the structures, substructures, superstructures, ties, rails, poles, wires and other property on railway lands and used exclusively for railway purposes or incidental thereto (except stations, freight sheds, offices, warehouses, elevators, hotels, roundhouses and machine, repair and other shops) shall not be assessed. 6 Edw. VII, c. 36, s. 13. (4) The assessor shall deliver at, or transmit by post to, any station or office of the company a notice, addressed to the company, of the total amount at which he has assessed the said land and property of the company in his municipality or ward shewing the amount for each description of property mentioned in the above statement of the company; and such statement and notice respectively shall be held to be the assessment return and notice of assessment required by sections 18 and 49.\n(5) A railway company assessed under this section shall be exempt from assessment in any other manner for municipal purposes except for local improvements. 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 44 (3-4).\nSubsection 3 is obviously intended to exempt from taxation property of which the railway company is required to make a return under s.s. 1 and which would otherwise be assessable under s.s. 2. If, therefore, the property under consideration be not within s.s. 1 and s.s. 2, exemption cannot be claimed for it under s.s. 3. The only clauses of s.ss. 1 and 2 within which it might be suggested that this property would fall are the clauses lettered (d) in each sub\u2011section. But actual use and occupation of the property by the railway company is the condition of the application to it of each of those provisions. That condition excludes this property. Moreover, property exempted under s.s. 3 must be \u201cused exclusively for railway purposes or incidental thereto.\u201d\nAssuming, but without so deciding, that the use of this property solely as a club and lodging house for railway employees would fulfil the requirement of s.s. 3, that use is not exclusive, since other citizens of Capreol admittedly share in the benefits and advantages offered by the branch Y.M.C.A.\nWe are, for these reasons, of the opinion that on neither of the grounds set up is the property in question entitled to exemption.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.J.

It was referred to a select standing committee of the League with the result that an article in the Treaty of Versailles provided that \"each of the members (of the Labour Conference) undertakes that it will * * * bring the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action.\" The Dominion of Canada is a member.\nHeld, that the only obligation of the Dominion of Canada is to bring the draft convention before the competent authority for action.\nHeld also, that the matter of labour in industrial undertakings in Canada, is primarily within the competence of provincial legislatures, but Parliament can legislate as to labour in territories not yet organized into, or forming part of, a province and as to labour of servants of the Dominion if these are within the scope of the draft convention.\nREFERENCE by the Governor General in Council of questions respecting legislative jurisdiction over hours of labour for hearing and consideration.\nNo. 1\nP.C. 2218.\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 23rd December, 1924, from the Minister of Justice, stating that he has had under consideration, upon reference from the Honourable the Minister of Labour, the report of the Select Standing Committee on Industrial and International Relations, which was adopted by resolution passed by the House of Commons of Canada on the 18th July, 1924, and is in the terms following:\u2014\n\"A Resolution was adopted by the House of Commons on May 23, declaring it expedient that a certain Draft Convention which was adopted at the 1st Session of the International Labour Conference of the League of Nations in 1919 limiting the Hours of work in Industrial Undertakings to eight in the day and forty-eight in the week should be referred to the Select Standing Committee on Industrial and International Relations for examination and report, having regard to the Labour Provisions of the Treaties of Peace and to the Order in Council of November 6, 1920, dealing with the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and the Provincial Legislatures.\n\"Your Committee has held several sittings and made a careful examination of the Draft Convention, the Labour Part of the Treaties of Peace, and the Order in Council of November 6, 1920, dealing with the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and of the provincial legislatures. Evidence was taken with respect to the present position of the eight-hour day in industrial employment in Canada and other countries. Information was presented to your Committee with reference to a conference which was held in Ottawa in September last between representatives of the Dominion and Provincial Governments which indicate that notwithstanding the view expressed in the Order in Council of November 6, 1920, doubt existed in certain quarters as to the jurisdiction of the federal and provincial authorities, respectively.\n\"It is accordingly recommended that measures be taken to refer the 'Draft Convention Limiting the Hours of Work in Industrial Undertakings to eight in the day and forty-eight in the week' to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration under Section 60 of the Supreme Court Act together with such questions as will serve to secure an advisory judgment from the Court on the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and of the provincial legislatures, respectively.\"\nThe Order in Council of November 6, 1920 (P.C. 2722) referred to in the foregoing report, was passed on the report of the then Minister of Justice (the Rt. Hon. C. J. Doherty) and deals, in part, with the nature of the obligation of the Dominion of Canada as a member of the International Labour Conference, constituted under the Labour Part (Part XIII) of the Treaty of Versailles and the corresponding provisions of the other treaties of peace with relation to the draft conventions or recommendations which may from time to time be adopted by the International Labour Conference and in order to appropriate legislative or other action being taken to give effect to them, and the opinion expressed by the Minister upon this point was set forth in the following paragraph of the said Order in Council:\u2014\n\"The Minister further states that he is of opinion that the provisions of the Labour Part of the Treaty of Versailles do not impose any obligation on the Dominion of Canada to enact into law the different draft conventions or recommendations which may from time to time be adopted by the Conference. The obligation as set forth is simply in the nature of an undertaking on the part of each member within the period of one year at most from the closing of the session of the Conference, or if it is impossible owing to exceptional circumstances to do so within a period of one year, then at the earliest practicable moment, and in any case not later than eighteen months from the closing of the Conference 'to bring the recommendations or draft conventions before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies for the enactment of legislation or other action.' The treaty engagement being of this character, it is not such as to justify legislation on the part of Parliament under the authority of section 132 of the British North America Act, 1867, to give effect to any of the proposals of the said draft conventions and recommendations, which must be held, as between the Dominion and the provinces, to be within the legislative competence of the latter. The Government's obligation will, in the opinion of the Minister, be fully carried out if the different conventions and recommendations are brought before the competent authority, Dominion or Provincial, accordingly as it may appeal, having regard to the scope and objects, the true nature and character of the legislation required to give effect to the proposals of the conventions and recommendations respectively, that they fall within the legislative competence of the one or the other.\"\nThe said Order in Council of the 6th November, 1920, also embodied the Minister's opinion upon the question whether the provisions of the \"Draft Convention Limiting the Hours of Work in Industrial Undertakings to Eight in the Day and Forty-Eight in the Week,\" adopted at the first session of the International Labour Conference at its first annual meeting, 29th October-29th November, 1919, came within the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada or of the provincial legislatures. The Minister reported that the proposals of this Convention \"involve legislation which is competent to Parliament in so far as Dominion works and undertakings are affected, but which the provincial legislatures have otherwise the power to enact and apply generally and comprehensively.\"\nThe Minister observes, however, that the Select Standing Committee on Industrial and International Relations of the House of Commons received information which indicated \"that, notwithstanding the view expressed in the Order in Council of November 6, 1920, doubt existed in certain quarters as to the jurisdiction of the federal and provincial authorities, respectively.\"\nThe Minister considers it expedient, in view of the said report of the Committee on Industrial and International Relations and of the importance of the subject-matter involved, that the question which has arisen as to the respective legislative powers of the Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures in relation to the enactment of the legislation required to give effect to the provisions of the said draft convention should be judicially determined, and he, accordingly, recommends that the following questions, together with copies of the Treaty of Peace with Germany and the \"Draft Convention Limiting the Hours of Work in Industrial Undertakings to Eight in the Day and Forty-Eight in the Week,\"* be referred by Your Excellency in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the authority of Section 60 of the Supreme Court Act.\n(1) What is the nature of the obligation of the Dominion of Canada as a member of the International Labour Conference, under the provisions of the Labour Part (Part XIII) of the Treaty of Versailles and of the corresponding provisions of the other Treaties of Peace, with relation to such draft conventions and recommendations as may be from time to time adopted by the said Conference under the authority of and pursuant to the aforesaid provisions? (2) Are the legislatures of the provinces the authorities within whose competence the subject-matter of the said draft convention (copy of which is herewith submitted) in whole or in part lies and before whom such draft convention should be brought, under the provisions of Article 405 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, for the enactment of legislation or other action?\n(3) If the subject-matter of the said draft convention be, in part only, within the competence of the legislatures of the provinces, then in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, is the subject-matter of the draft convention within the competence of the legislatures?\n(4) If the subject-matter of the said draft convention be, in part only, within the competence of the legislatures of the provinces, then in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, is the subject-matter of the draft convention within the competence of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe Committee submit the same for approval.\nE. J. LEMAIRE,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nLafleur K.C. and Donohue K.C. for the Dominion of Canada.\nGeoffrion K.C. for the province of Quebec.\nBayly K.C. for Ontario.\nMathers K.C. for Nova Scotia.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The first of the questions submitted concerns the general effect of one of the clauses in Article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles and the corresponding provision in the other treaties of peace. This article is one of those comprised in the Labour Part (Part 13) of the treaties and it defines the undertaking entered into by each of the members respecting recommendations and draft conventions adopted by the general conference of representatives of the members of the League of Nations established as part of a permanent organization for the promotion of the objects set forth in the preamble to that part. The pertinent clause is in these words:\u2014.\nEach of the members undertakes that it will, within the period of one year at most from the closing of the session of the Conference, or if it is impossible owing to exceptional circumstances to do so within the period of one year, then at the earliest practicable moment and in no case later than eighteen months from the closing of the session of the Conference bring the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action.\nIt seems very clear that the duty arising under this clause is not a duty to enact legislation or to promote legislation; it is an undertaking simply to bring the recommendation or draft convention before the competent authority.\nNo question is submitted as to the duty of the member arising under the succeeding clauses of the same article in the event of the competent authority or authorities giving its or their consent to the recommendation or draft convention; and upon this no opinion is expressed.\nThe second, third and fourth questions submitted relate to a particular draft convention, that, namely, adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations on the 29th of October, 1919, which has for its object the limiting of the hours of work in industrial undertakings as therein defined to eight hours in the day and forty-eight hours in the week.\nUnder the scheme of distribution of legislative authority in the British North America Act, legislative jurisdiction touching the subject matter of this convention is, subject to a qualification to be mentioned, primarily vested in the provinces. Under the head of jurisdiction numbered 13 in section 92, Property and Civil Rights, or under the sixteenth head, Local and Private Matters Within the Provinces, or under both heads, each of the provinces possesses authority to give the force of law in the province to provisions such as those contained in the draft convention. This general proposition is subject to this qualification, namely, that as a rule a province has no authority to regulate the hours of employment of the servants of the Dominion Government.\nIt seems questionable whether government employees, in industrial undertakings carried on by the Government, such, for example, as shipbuilding, are within the scope of the convention. The point was not the subject of argument before us, and concerning it no opinion is intended to be expressed.\nIt is necessary to observe, also, that as regards these parts of Canada which are not included within the limits of any province, the legislative authority in relation to civil rights generally, and to the subject matter of the convention in particular, is the Dominion Parliament.\nIt is now settled that the Dominion, in virtue of its authority in respect of works and undertakings falling within its jurisdiction, by force of section 91, no. 29, and sec. 92, no. 10, has certain powers of regulation touching the employment of persons engaged on such works or undertakings. The effect of such legislation by the Dominion to execution of this power is that provincial authority in relation to the subject matter of such legislation is superseded, and remains inoperative so long as the Dominion legislation continues in force. There would appear to be no doubt that, as regards such undertakings\u2014a Dominion railway, for example\u2014the Dominion possesses authority to enact legislation in relation to the subjects dealt with in the draft convention. The only Dominion legislation on this subject to which our attention has been called is to be found in sec. 287 of the Railway Act of 1919, which confers authority on the Board of Railway Commissioners to make orders and regulations concerning the hours of duty of persons employed on railways subject to the jurisdiction of the Board, with a view to the safety of the public and of such employees. It is understood that no orders or regulations have been made in execution of this power; and in view of the fact that this enactment, creating this unexecuted power, appears to be the only Dominion legislation in existence on the subject matter of the draft convention, the primary authority of the province in relation to that subject matter remains, subject to the qualification mentioned, unimpaired and unrestricted.\nIt follows from what has been said that the draft convention ought to be brought before the Parliament of Canada as being the competent legislative authority for those parts of Canada not within the boundaries of any province; and if servants of the Dominion Government engaged in industrial undertakings as defined by the convention are within the scope of its provisions, then the Dominion Parliament is the competent authority also to give force of law to those provisions as applicable to such persons.\nThe convention should also be brought before the Lieutenant-Governor of each of the provinces for the purpose of enabling him to bring it to the attention of the Provincial Legislature as possessing, subject to the qualification mentioned, legislative jurisdiction within the province in relation to the subject matter of the convention.\nThe answers to the questions submitted are, therefore:\u2014\nTo the first question: the obligation is simply in the nature of an undertaking to bring the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action.\nTo the second question: yes, in part.\nTo the third question: the subject matter is generally within the competence of the legislatures of the provinces, but the authority vested in these legislatures does not enable them to give the force of law to provisions such as those contained in the draft convention in relation to servants of the Dominion Government, or to legislate for these parts of Canada which are not within the boundaries of a province.\nTo the fourth question: the Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority in those parts of Canada not within the boundaries of any province, and also upon the subjects dealt with in the draft convention in relation to the servants of the Dominion Government.\n"

On the 8th of February, 1923, K. agreed to sell to P. the same property for $123,000 payable as follows: $7,000 on the execution of the agreement, $79,000 by assuming the payment of the above balance of purchase money due by K. to J., $28,000 on the 15th of March, 1923, and $1,000 on the 15th of each month, April to December, 1923, with interest at 7 per cent. This last agreement also provided that \"all adjustments, including rents (were) to be made as of the 15th day of March, 1923, ***.\" Of the first deferred payment of $6,000 payable 20th July, 1923, a sum of $3,605.70 was attributable to interest up to the 15th of March, 1923, upon the purchase money, according to the first agreement of sale. P. withheld the interest earned up to 15th March, 1923, amounting to the aforesaid sum of $3,605.70, claiming that he was entitled to that allowance upon the instalment of $6,000 due 20th July, 1923. K. refused to credit the interest, claiming that P. was not entitled to any deduction.

The judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014By agreement of 20th July, 1922, the defendant (respondent) agreed to purchase from Arthur William Jones and Arthur Philip Luxton, trustees under the will of the late Arthur Wellesley Vowell, deceased, certain real estate in the city of Vancouver for the sum of $85,000 payable, $6,000 on the execution of the agreement, and the balance of $79,000, with interest thereon, or on so much thereof as shall for the time being remain unpaid, at the rate of 7 per cent per annum, computed from 20th July, 1922, in the amounts and at the times following, viz: $6,000 on 20th July, 1923, and the like sum on the same day in 1924, 1925 and 1926; $25,000 on 20th July, 1927, and the balance on 20th July, 1928; and it was moreover provided that\nthe amount of the aforesaid deferred payments respectively be applied first in payment of the interest on the said purchase money to the date of the respective payments, then towards the said purchase money.\nThe respondent paid the first instalment of $6,000 and thus became entitled to and had possession of the premises. Afterwards he agreed to sell the property to the appellant (plaintiff), and by the agreement, dated 8th February, 1923, it was recited that the respondent had agreed to sell the property to the appellant, and the appellant had agreed to purchase it for $123,000,\npayable in manner and on the days and times hereinafter mentioned, that is to say: the sum of seven thousand ($7,000) dollars on the execution of this agreement (the receipt whereof the said vendor doth hereby admit and acknowledge), and the balance payable as follows: $79,000, being the balance due and owing under a certain agreement for the sale and purchase of the said lands dated the 20th day of July, 1922, between Arthur William Jones and Arthur Philip Luxton, trustees under the will of Arthur Wellesley Vowell, deceased, which said agreement and the payments due thereunder the purchaser doth hereby assume, $28,000 on the 15th day of March, 1923, and $1,000 on the 15th day of each of the months of April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December, 1923, together with interest at seven (7%) per cent per annum, payable with the last instalment of principal.\nFollowing these recitals the purchaser covenanted with the vendor that he would\nwell and truly pay, of cause to be paid, to the vendor the said sums of money above mentioned, together with interest thereon at the rate of 7 per cent per annum both before and after maturity, and on the days and times in manner above mentioned.\nIt was also agreed in effect that the purchaser should have possession from the making of his first payment. The agreement contained also the following clause:\nAll adjustments, including rents, are to be made as of the 15th day of March, 1923, provided however that the vendor shall not be required to account to the purchaser for any advance rents which he may have collected prior to the date hereof.\nIt will have been perceived that according to the intent of the agreement of 20th July, 1922, which evidences the respondent's title, and which is described in the case as the Vowell agreement, the deferred payments were to be applied first in payment of the interest upon the purchase money to the respective dates of payment, and then towards the principal; in consequence, according to the figures which were accepted for the purposes of the argument, the first of these deferred payments, amounting to $6,000, which became payable on 20th July, 1923, was, to the extent of $3,605.70, attributable to interest on 15th March upon the purchase money, and it was only the balance which went in reduction of the latter. The appellant had possession from the date of his agreement, 8th February, 1923, and, in view of the adjustment clause, it was not questioned that, if it were intended that the interest should be apportioned, the apportionment should take effect as from the last mentioned date. The defendant maintains however that, according to his understanding of the agreement, interest was not among the adjustments provided for, and that the plaintiff should assume and pay at his own charge the entire instalment of $6,000, which, by the Vowell agreement, became payable on 20th July next following the date of the agreement between the parties to the action. He claimed that this was true upon the interpretation of the latter agreement, or, if otherwise, that the agreement did not in this particular express the intention of the parties, and that it should therefore be reformed; upon the latter issue evidence was introduced.\nThe learned judge, who pronounced his judgment orally at the trial, found for the respondent upon the interpretation of the agreement, and that upon the appellant's interpretation, the instrument did not carry out the respondent's understanding; but he held moreover that, if it were necessary to reform the instrument in order to give effect to the intention found, he did not consider the evidence strong enough because rectification must be of a mutual mistake and it must be proved by satisfactory evidence.\nThe Court of Appeal was composed of four judges and they were divided in the result. The Chief Justice and M. A. McDonald J.A. would have allowed the appeal for reasons which they state, and which appear to me satisfactory, while Martin J.A. and McPhillips J.A. were for the respondent; they agreed with the trial judge upon the interpretation of the contract, and Martin J.A. moreover expressed the view that a clear case for rectification had been established by the proof to which he referred.\nConsiderable evidence was taken touching the negotiations which preceded the execution of the agreement, but, in the view which I take of the case, the question will be resolved upon the interpretation of the instrument, and I do not find it necessary to discuss the oral testimony.\nIt is obviously not the meaning of the recital that the purchaser shall pay to the vendor $79,000 as part of the stipulated purchase price, and also to the Vowell estate the amount said to be due and owing under the agreement of sale from it to the respondent. The parenthesis in the recital,\nwhich said agreement and the payments due thereunder the purchaser doth hereby assume,\nis ancillary; it is evidently introduced as descriptive of the manner and the days and times of payment of the price or sum of $123,000, and it operates to define or to explain these by reference to the Vowell agreement, and to show that what is thus paid under that agreement is paid on the respondent's account and goes in diminution of the purchase price of $123,000. It must be realized that the $79,000, corresponding to the amount of the principal payments undertaken by the respondent in the latter agreement, is treated in the agreement between the parties to the action as a portion of the balance of the consideration money of $123,000, after deducting $7,000, the amount paid on the execution of the agreement, and there is nothing to define the manner or time of payment of the $79,000 except by way of assumption of the Vowell agreement.\nThe appellant's covenant which is found in the first paragraph of the operative part of his agreement provides that he shall pay to the respondent the sums of money mentioned in the recital, which aggregate exactly $123,000, with interest at 7 per cent, but upon no principle of construction can this covenant be interpreted to include an obligation for the payment of interest accrued before the making of the agreement or while the vendor had the possession, and which is not included in the sums mentioned in the recital. That interest continues to be the obligation of the latter, to be discharged by him, or to be compensated if paid by the purchaser. The ordinary rule is that the purchaser does not pay interest accrued before the completion of the purchase, Monro v. Taylor[1], and I do not find anything in the language of the agreement to evince an intention that the appellant shall pay more than the stipulated consideration money of $123,000.\nWhen the accounts came to be adjusted between the parties pursuant to the agreement, on or about 15th March, 1923, the appellant, who was in California, sent Mr. E. A. Parker, the man who looked after the construction of his offices, to pay the $28,000, which fell due at that time, and to see to the adjustments. He and Mr. Boultbee, a real estate agent who was acting for the plaintiff, met the respondent and they had some conversation, resulting in the payment of the $28,000, less $856.08 found payable by the respondent to the appellant, and E. A. Parker then gave the respondent a receipt for the latter amount, which he signed in the appellant's name, and which is expressed to be\nin full of all adjustments re sale Kogos to Parker, lots 25 and 26, block 9, D.L. 196. Balance of deferred payments due from Parker to Kogos, as per agreement of sale, $9,000.\nThis transaction, which, as has been said, took place on or about 15th March, was of course prior to the payment of the first instalment of $6,000 under the Vowell agreement, which fell due on 20th July following; the appellant was not present at the interview; no adjustment of interest was made or mentioned, and it is contended for the respondent that the fact that an adjustment was made, expressed to be in full, without any reference to the subject of interest, confirms his understanding of the contract that the interest accrued under the Vowell agreement was to be paid by the appellant. On the other side it is said that the agent was not fully instructed, and that, as the interest became pay- able only at a later date, it would naturally stand over. It would have been prudent no doubt, and might have been expected, that, if the parties had realized that there was an outstanding question about interest, they would have at least stipulated a reservation in the receipt; but, however that may be, if, as I find, the contract is not ambiguous, the court may not look to this circumstance to aid in its interpretation. A receipt does not operate as a discharge.\nAs to the question of reformation, I see no reason to disturb the finding of the learned judges, including the trial judge, who considered that the evidence was insufficient. The contract of course binds according to its purport and tenor, and it is upon the respondent, seeking reformation, to show that it ought not to do so. I have considered the evidence very carefully, and not only does it fail to convince me that the instrument does not accurately express the understanding and intention with which the parties executed it, but I think it is reasonably apparent that the appellant did not intend or contemplate at the time that he should become bound for payment of purchase price in excess of $123,000.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, the counter-claim should be dismissed with costs, and there should be judgment for the appellant for specific performance of the agreement.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. W. Walsh.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. Meredith.\n[1] 8 Hare 70.\n"

On 18th May, 1923, the appellant passed a resolution granting to T. over his salary a commission of 1\u00bd per cent on the cost of all new constructions. T. died on the 6th November, 1923, without having received any part of such commission. The respondents are the executors of the estate of T. and claimed from the appellant the amount of salary due to T., the commission of 1\u00bd per cent for all works already done on the new buildings and a further commission of \u00be per cent on the total cost of the buildings when completed as remuneration for the drawing of the plans and specifications according to the official tariff of architects' fees.\nHeld that the appellant was not bound to pay any amount over the salary earned and the commission of 1\u00bd per cent of the value of the work actually done on the new buildings at the time of the death of T., such salary comprising any remuneration due him for the preparation of the plans and specifications for these works.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondents' action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nL.

M. Georges-Emile Tanguay \u00e9tait architecte pratiquant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\nLes commissaires d'\u00e9coles, par leur r\u00e9solution du 1er d\u00e9cembre 1918, lui avaient demand\u00e9 de mettre ses services \u00e0 leur disposition, moyennant un salaire de $2,000 jusqu'au 1er mai 1919; de l\u00e0, $2,400 au 1er mai 1920; de cette derni\u00e8re date au 1er mai 1921, $2,700; et depuis le 1er mai 1921, $3,000. Monsieur Tanguay avait accept\u00e9 ces conditions. Par contrat re\u00e7u devant ma\u00eetre Delagrave, notaire, le 29 d\u00e9cembre 1919, les termes de cette convention furent arr\u00eat\u00e9s entre les parties; et rengagement fut conclu moyennant la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pr\u00e9vue par la r\u00e9solution.\nCe contrat d\u00e9clare que le salaire\ncomprend tous d\u00e9bours\u00e9s, commission ou (honoraires que le dit bureau serait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 un architecte pour remplir les devoirs ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9s.\nCes devoirs, que M. Tanguay \"s'engage\" \u00e0 remplir, sont:\nA.\u2014pr\u00e9parer les plans g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, les plans de d\u00e9tails, devis et quantit\u00e9s pour toutes constructions ou r\u00e9parations d'\u00e9coles ou pour toutes b\u00e2tisses appartenant au dit Bureau soit comme propri\u00e9taire, soit comme locataire ou occupant.\nB.\u2014fournir au dit Bureau copie des plans, devis, sp\u00e9cifications et estim\u00e9s pour toutes et chacunes des dites constructions ou r\u00e9parations d'\u00e9coles ou b\u00e2tisses occup\u00e9es par le dit Bureau comme ci-dessus, et fournir et donner au dit Bureau les quantit\u00e9s et \u00e9valuations de toutes constructions ou am\u00e9liorations d'\u00e9coles ou b\u00e2tisses occup\u00e9es ou \u00e0 \u00eatre occup\u00e9es par le dit Bureau et tous renseignements qu'il, le dit Bureau, jugerait utiles ou n\u00e9cessaires.\nD.\u2014surveiller tous travaux de construction de nouvelles \u00e9coles, trottoirs, ou de toutes r\u00e9parations et am\u00e9liorations faites aux dites \u00e9coles, constructions ou b\u00e2tisses appartenant ou occup\u00e9es par le dit Bureau, faire un estim\u00e9 pr\u00e9alable des dites constructions, r\u00e9parations ou am\u00e9liorations, en donner rapport d\u00e9taill\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande du dit Bureau et faire un estim\u00e9 des terrains ou constructions que le Bureau aurait l'intention d'acheter.\nD.\u2014contr\u00f4ler et v\u00e9rifier tout compte produit touchant les dites r\u00e9parations, constructions ou am\u00e9liorations et pour l'ameublement de toutes constructions,\u2014\u00e9coles ou b\u00e2tisses.\nE.\u2014se tenir \u00e0 la disposition du dit Bureau et assister aux s\u00e9ances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et sp\u00e9ciales du dit Bureau lorsque sa pr\u00e9sence sera requise.\nF.\u2014se conformer en tous points aux voeux et aux d\u00e9sirs du dit Bureau quant aux plans des b\u00e2tisses, des r\u00e9parations ou am\u00e9liorations projet\u00e9es, et quant \u00e0 toute autre chose, acquisition d'immeuble ou autre, du domaine du dit Bureau, et o\u00f9 les services d'un architecte ou \u00e9valuateur seraient requis.\nLe 18 mai 1923, les commissaires d'\u00e9coles adopt\u00e8rent la r\u00e9solution suivante:\nR\u00e9solu: Qu'une commission de un et demi pour cent soit accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'architecte de cette commission, G.-Emile Tanguay, \u00e0 part de son salaire r\u00e9gulier de trois mille piastres par ann\u00e9e, sur les nouvelles constructions de l'ann\u00e9e et sur celles de l'avenir.\nMonsieur Tanguay est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 6 novembre 1923, avant l'expiration de l'ann\u00e9e qui a suivi l'adoption de cette r\u00e9solution et sans avoir touch\u00e9 aucune partie de la commission qui lui \u00e9tait ainsi accord\u00e9e. Les intim\u00e9s sont ses ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et r\u00e9clament des commissaires d'\u00e9coles, qui sont les appelants, le paiement de la somme qui, dans leur opinion, repr\u00e9sente cette commission.\nL'on s'entend sur \"les nouvelles constructions de l'ann\u00e9e.\" Ce sont: L'\u00e9cole Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec; l'\u00e9cole Notre-Dame-du-Chemin; l'Acad\u00e9mie Saint-Jean-Baptiste; le couvent des Dames de la Congr\u00e9gation de Saint-Malo; et l'\u00e9cole des Fr\u00e8res Maristes, Saint-Malo, Qu\u00e9bec. Mais les parties donnent \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du 18 mai 1923 un sens diff\u00e9rent qui, suivant le cas, attribuerait \u00e0 la succession Tanguay la somme de $8,731.94 ou celle de $6,590.68. Les commissaires d'\u00e9coles admettent cette derni\u00e8re somme, qu'ils se sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s pr\u00eats \u00e0 payer avant l'institution de l'action. Ils ont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 leurs offres par leur plaidoyer et ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la somme en concluant au renvoi de l'action pour le surplus.\nLe litige est exactement pos\u00e9 dans les paragraphes 8 et 11 de la d\u00e9claration:\n8.\u2014Pour constituer le dit montant, les demandeurs r\u00e9clament pour la succession du dit feu Georges-Emile Tanguay, sur la commission de 1\u00bd pour cent \u00e0 lui octroy\u00e9e par la r\u00e9solution du 18 mai 1923, \u00be pour cent sur le prix total des diff\u00e9rents contrats attribu\u00e9s, et ce pour services rendus par le dit feu Georges-Emile Tanguay, en rapport avec la confection des plans et devis complets, \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires comprises, qui tous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits et pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par lui avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et qui ont servi \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux, puis \u00be pour cent de la commission susdite pour frais de surveillance sur le co\u00fbt des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du dit architecte ;\n11.\u2014Toute la diff\u00e9rence entre les parties provient de ce que le d\u00e9fendeur pr\u00e9tend s'acquitter de ses obligations envers les demandeurs, en payant \u00e0 ces derniers la commission de 1\u00bd pour cent seulement sur le co\u00fbt des travaux parachev\u00e9s, sans tenir compte du fait que les plans et devis complets, \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires comprises, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par feu Georges-Emile Tanguay, et qu'il ne restait plus au d\u00e9fendeur qu'\u00e0 faire continuer la surveillance pour la balance des travaux \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter depuis le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'architecte.\nDeux \u00e9tats de compte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s suivant les pr\u00e9tentions respectives des parties, qui admettent que les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires auront droit \u00e0 Tune ou l'autre somme, suivant l'interpr\u00e9tation qui doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du 18 mai 1923. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure s'est rang\u00e9e du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des commissaires d'\u00e9coles. Elle a maintenu leurs offres.\nEn Cour du Banc du Roi, les opinions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es. Deux des juges ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'avis de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure; les trois autres, par cons\u00e9quent la majorit\u00e9, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion contraire et ont adopt\u00e9 l'interpr\u00e9tation des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires.\nLa solution que nous cherchons d\u00e9pend uniquement du sens et de l'intention de la derni\u00e8re r\u00e9solution des commissaires d'\u00e9coles.\nJusqu'\u00e0 l'adoption de cette r\u00e9solution, M. Tanguay \u00e9tait indiscutablement un salari\u00e9. Son salaire avait vari\u00e9; mais il comprenait tout ce qu'on peut \u00eatre\nappel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 un architecte pour remplir ses devoirs\nsans aucune exception, et l'obligeait \u00e0\nse conformer en tous points aux voeux et aux d\u00e9sirs du dit Bureau (des Commissaires) quant aux plans des b\u00e2tisses, des r\u00e9parations ou am\u00e9liorations projet\u00e9es, et quant \u00e0 toute autre chose, acquisition d'immeuble ou autre, du domaine du dit Bureau, et o\u00f9 les services d'un architecte ou \u00e9valuateur seraient requis.\nIl devait m\u00eame\nse tenir \u00e0 la disposition du dit Bureau et assister aux s\u00e9ances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et sp\u00e9ciales du dit Bureau lorsque sa pr\u00e9sence serait requise.\nIl n'y avait donc, en tant qu'architecte, pas un seul devoir auquel M. Tanguay ne f\u00fbt tenu, ni un seul service qu'il ne f\u00fbt oblig\u00e9 de remplir moyennant la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration stipul\u00e9e au contrat.\nEn vertu de la loi des architectes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le conseil de l'association fixe, pour les services de ses membres (dont faisait partie M. Tanguay), un tarif qui, une fois approuv\u00e9 par le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil, est publi\u00e9 dans la Gazette Officielle de Qu\u00e9bec. Suivant le texte de la loi (R.S.Q. art. 5245), il a pour but d'\u00e9viter devant toutes les cours de justice la preuve de la valeur des services, lorsqu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e par une convention. Les architectes ne sont pas li\u00e9s par ce tarif. Ils peuvent y d\u00e9roger.\nC'est ce que fit M. Tanguay lorsqu'il convint de rendre aux commissaires d'\u00e9coles de Qu\u00e9bec tous les services d'un architecte moyennant une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle. Son contrat avait pour but et pour effet d'exclure les honoraires fix\u00e9s par le tarif et d'y substituer des honoraires diff\u00e9rents.\nLa r\u00e9solution du 18 mai 1923 ne modifie pas cette situation. Elle ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une convention nouvelle ou ind\u00e9pendante du contrat. Elle n'est pas une convention compl\u00e8te par elle-m\u00eame. Elle ne mentionne pas les services que M. Tanguay sera appel\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre. De toute \u00e9vidence, elle n'est qu'un amendement du contrat originaire pourvoyant \u00e0 une augmentation de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Jusque l\u00e0, le salaire de M. Tanguay \u00e9tait un montant fixe. A partir de la date de cette r\u00e9solution, il aura droit \u00e0 ce montant fixe et, en outre, \u00e0 un montant suppl\u00e9mentaire qui variera suivant\nles nouvelles constructions de l'ann\u00e9e et celles de l'avenir.\nNous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous occuper des constructions de l'avenir, puisque M. Tanguay est mort dans l'ann\u00e9e et que, des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s, l'on admet que ses droits ont cess\u00e9 le jour de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nComme le contrat originaire avait pour but d'exclure le tarif et comme la r\u00e9solution ne fait qu'augmenter le montant stipul\u00e9 dans ce m\u00eame contrat, il s'ensuit que le tarif continue d'\u00eatre exclu et qu'on ne saurait y r\u00e9f\u00e9rer dans le but d'interpr\u00e9ter la r\u00e9solution.\nL'id\u00e9e contenue dans la r\u00e9solution est que, en plus de son salaire, M. Tanguay recevra une commission d'un pourcentage invariable calcul\u00e9 sur le co\u00fbt des constructions parachev\u00e9es. Il ne faut pas entendre par l\u00e0 les constructions lorsqu'elles auront \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9es, mais simplement tout le travail qui est accompli au moment du calcul du pourcentage. Non seulement les m\u00e9thodes de calcul \u00e9tablies par le tarif des architectes sont \u00e9limin\u00e9es par l'existence m\u00eame d'une convention diff\u00e9rente; mais le principe de cette convention s'oppose \u00e0 l'application du tarif.\nEn effet, les honoraires indiqu\u00e9s au tarif sont bas\u00e9s \"sur le prix qu'aura co\u00fbt\u00e9 la b\u00e2tisse\" (Tarif, Article 1). La commission qui y est pourvue est calcul\u00e9e \"sur le co\u00fbt total des travaux\" (Tarif, Article 8). Au contraire, la commission de M. Tanguay a pour base le co\u00fbt des seuls travaux termin\u00e9s.\nLes honoraires attribu\u00e9s par le tarif sont fix\u00e9s \u00e0 raison du travail fait par l'architecte; la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Tanguay, en vertu de son contrat tel qu'amend\u00e9 par la r\u00e9solution, est \u00e9tablie uniquement \u00e0 raison de son emploi au service de la commission scolaire, ind\u00e9pendamment du travail qu'il fera. En vertu de ce tarif, l'architecte recevra une commission de 5 pour cent s'il a fait tous les travaux,\ncomprenant les \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires, les plans complets, les devis, les d\u00e9tails et la surveillance.\nIl ne recevra qu'une partie de ces honoraires s'il n'a fait qu'une partie de ces travaux, soit: les \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires seules; ou les plans et devis complets (les \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires comprises); ou les d\u00e9tails; ou la surveillance. Pour chacun de ces cas, des honoraires partiels sont pr\u00e9vus.\nIl en est autrement de M. Tanguay qui a droit \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de son salaire et \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de sa commission, quels que soient les travaux qu'il sera appel\u00e9 \u00e0 faire; et m\u00eame s'il n'est pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 en faire du tout. Avant la r\u00e9solution si M. Tanguay e\u00fbt fait tous les travaux pour lesquels les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires r\u00e9clament maintenant une commission de \u00be pour cent, il n'e\u00fbt re\u00e7u rien autre chose que son salaire. Depuis la r\u00e9solution, pour les m\u00eames travaux, il doit recevoir son salaire et la totalit\u00e9 de la commission qui y est stipul\u00e9e. Il n'y est nullement question de subdivision. Et la m\u00e9thode sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s nous para\u00eet arbitraire.\nLe paiement des plans et devis qu'il a faits est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par ce salaire et cette commission. Il eut eu droit \u00e0 cette commission int\u00e9grale de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on si les commissaires d'\u00e9coles avaient jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de faire pr\u00e9parer les plans et devis par un autre architecte. Sa commission e\u00fbt toujours, quand m\u00eame, \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9e sur tout ce qui se serait d\u00e9pens\u00e9 pour les \"nouvelles constructions\" pendant que M. Tanguay \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi du bureau des commissaires.\nIl s'ensuit que le montant auquel il a droit est ind\u00e9pendant du travail qu'il a fait. Contrairement au tarif des architectes qui subdivise la commission totale suivant le travail qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli par l'architecte lui-m\u00eame, ici la base de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est le montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9 sur les b\u00e2tisses nouvelles \u00e0 la date du calcul de la commission. Les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s du tarif n'ont rien \u00e0 faire avec cela. Sa commission est pour l'ensemble de ses services, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur nature particuli\u00e8re.\nNous croyons donc que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait exactement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la convention entre M. Tanguay et les commissaires d'\u00e9coles de Qu\u00e9bec; et que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, en infirmant la decision de la Cour du Banc du Roi et en r\u00e9tablissant le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon, Parent & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Galipeault, Lapointe, Rochette & Boisvert.\n"

C., neither is the question one of fact alone or of mixed law and fact within clause (b), but it falls within clause (c) of that section; and therefore leave of the Court of Appeal was a condition precedent to the respondent's right of appeal to that court.\nAlthough on the case being referred back to the Court of Appeal the respondent may obtain leave, his appeal on the ground of the disqualification of the petit juror would ultimately fail, because in the circumstances of this case, even though that disqualification should be established, it did not cause a miscarriage of justice (s. 1014 (1) (e) Cr. C.) or should be dismissed because \" no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred \" (s. 1014 (2).\nAn order made by the judge designated to preside at the assizes directing the sheriff to summon other persons to serve on the grand and petit juries in the places of those whom the sheriff had been unable to serve was drawn up, by inadvertence, to cover only the summoning of petit jurymen.\nHeld that the order as pronounced by the judge may be regarded as the order made by him rather than the order in the mistaken form in which it was drawn up, and there had been no illegality in the constitution of the grand jury. The judge designated to hold the assizes may in advance of the actual opening of the court, for the purposes of section 31 of the Jury Act (B.C. 1913, c. 34) be regarded as the \"presiding judge.\"\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1925] 2 W.W.R. 40) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside the conviction of the respondent for manslaughter and directing a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. and M. B. Jackson K.C. for the appellant.\nNo counsel appeared for the respondent at the argument.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The Attorney-General appeals by leave of a judge of this court, under s. 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code, against an order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia setting aside the conviction of the defendant and directing a new trial. Although he appeared by counsel on the application for leave to appeal and was duly served with notice of the appeal, the defendant was not represented on the argument and the appeal was heard ex parte.\nConvicted of manslaughter on his trial before Mr. Justice Murphy and a jury, the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. Three grounds of appeal were urged:\u2014\n(a) misdirection\n(b) illegality in the constitution of the grand jury; and\n(c) disqualification of a petit juror through deafness.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal, pronounced by the Chief Justice, was that the conviction be set aside and a new trial ordered on the ground that one of the petit jurors was disqualified by deafness; that the question involved in this ground of appeal was a question of law alone in respect of which leave to appeal was unnecessary; that such leave was accordingly refused; and that the members of the court might pronounce separate judgments. (S. 1013 of the Criminal Code, as enacted by 13-14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9.) Judgments were accordingly delivered by each of the judges who composed the court.\n(a) There was no expression of opinion by any of them on the alleged misdirection.\nOn ground (b) two of the learned judges (Martin and M. A. Macdonald, JJ.A.) were of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the indictment quashed. McPhillips J.A. expressed no opinion on this point. Galliher J.A. was of the view that this ground of appeal was met by s. 1011 of the Criminal Code; and the learned Chief Justice thought that it should, if known, have been raised at the trial by motion to quash the indictment and that in any case it involved a question of fact and law as to which an appeal would not lie without leave, which, presumably, he would have refused.\n(c) Martin, Galliher and McPhillips, JJ.A., were of opinion that the objection to the disqualification of the petit juror raised a question of law alone within clause (a) of s. 1013 in respect of which there was a right of appeal without leave; that evidence taken by direction of the Court of Appeal under s. 1021 established deafness amounting to disqualification of the juror Keown; that, as a result, there had been a miscarriage of justice; and that the conviction should be set aside. The Chief Justice, dissenting, held that the question raised by this ground of appeal was one of mixed law and fact falling within clause (b) of s. 1013; that, in the absence of a certificate of the trial court that it was a fit case for appeal, no appeal lay without leave of the Court of Appeal; and that, under the circumstances, which he detailed, leave should be refused, Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald expressed no opinion on this ground of appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal is a statutory court (Criminal Code, s. 2, s.s. 7; s. 1012 (b). The right of appeal to it is conferred and defined by s. 1013 of the Criminal Code (13-14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9). Subsections 1 and 3 of that section read as follows:\u2014\n1013. (1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal to the court of appeal against his conviction;\n(a) on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone ; and\n(b) with leave of the court of appeal, or upon the certificate of the trial court that it is a fit case for appeal, on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact; and\n(c) with leave of the court of appeal, on any other ground which appears to the court of appeal to be a sufficient ground of appeal.\n(3) No proceeding in error shall be taken in any criminal case, and the powers and practice now existing in the court of criminal appeal for any province, in respect of motions for or the granting of new trials of persons convicted on indictment, are hereby abolished.\nThe Criminal Code does not contain a provision corresponding to s.s. 4 of s. 20 of the English Criminal Appeal Act. (7 Edw. VII, c. 23.)\nThe defendant asserted a right of appeal under clause (a) of s.s. 1 of s. 1013 and, alternatively, asked leave to appeal if his case should be deemed to fall not within that clause but within clause (b) or clause (c) of that subsection. There was no suggestion that any other remedy was open to him.\nBy s. 921 (1) of the Criminal Code\nEvery person qualified and summoned as a grand or petit juror, according to the laws in force for the time being in any province of Canada, shall be duly qualified to serve as such juror in criminal cases in that province.\nBy s. 5 (1) of the Jury Act (B.C. 1913, c. 34) a person afflicted with deafness incompatible with the discharge of the duties of a juror is absolutely disqualified for service as a juror. Such disqualification is not a ground of challenge for cause. (S. 935 of the Criminal Code.)\nWe are of the opinion that the ground of appeal resting on the alleged disqualification of the petit juror does not fall within clause (a) of s. 1013. That clause was meant to cover questions of law arising out of the proceedings at the trial based upon facts admitted or conclusively found and not involving the appreciation or weighing of evidence by the appellate court. This is implied in the terms \" law alone.\" The facts on which such questions were submitted under the former practice were found and stated by the trial judge: no matter of fact was open for decision by the appellate court. Here the deafness of a juror incompatible with the discharge of his duties was in issue; its existence was contested by the Crown; such determination of it as there was at the trial, if any, was adverse to the defendant; and in any case this ground of appeal involved the determination of a question of fact by the Court of Appeal upon evidence not before the trial court but taken by direction of the Court of Appeal under the powers conferred upon it by s. 1021. This ground of appeal clearly did not \" involve a question of law alone.\"\nNeither, in our opinion, is the question one of fact alone, or of mixed law and fact within clause (b) of s. 1013. We incline to the view that the questions contemplated by that clause relate to matters which are in issue on the trial and the determination of which by the trial court is challenged.\nIn our view the ground of appeal now under consideration falls rather within clause (c) of s. 1013\u2014\nany other ground of appeal which appears to the Court of Appeal to be a sufficient ground of appeal.\n(Archbold, Cr. Pl., Ev., Pr., 26th Ed., 338). The question is as to the constitution of the petit jury. Where such a defect in the constitution of the petit jury is charged as might involve a miscarriage of justice (s. 1014 (1) (c) ) the Court of Appeal may regard it as something which, if established, would be a sufficient ground of appeal. But an appeal lies under clause (c) of s. 1013 only \" with leave of the Court of Appeal.\"\nWe are, therefore, of the view that leave of the Court of Appeal was a condition precedent to the defendant's right of appeal. Inasmuch as the Court of Appeal proceeded on the view that such leave was unnecessary it did not exercise the discretion conferred on it by the statute in respect to the giving or refusing of leave. It follows that its order setting aside the defendant's conviction and directing a new trial cannot be maintained on the ground on which it was based.\nUnder such circumstances the usual course would be to remit the case to the Court of Appeal in order that it should pass upon the defendant's application for leave to appeal. But we should not send the case back for that purpose if satisfied that, although the defendant should obtain leave, his appeal on the ground of the disqualification of the petit juror must fail, because, even though that disqualification should be established, it did not cause a miscarriage of justice (s. 1014 (1) (c) ), or should be dismissed because \"no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred\" (s. 1014 (2) ). The pertinent facts are stated by Macdonald C.J.A. as follows:\u2014\nDuring the trial a rumour was started which came to the ears of the trial judge to the effect that one of the jurors was afflicted with deaf- ness. Counsel for the appellant urged that the trial should be proceeded with. He even went the length of offering an undertaking that no question would be raised concerning the juror in question in case of an appeal. This was practically a confession that there was no ground for the rumour; but be that as it may, the accused, through his counsel, had the opportunity of having the rumour confirmed or denied, and if confirmed of asking that the jury should be dismissed and a new jury called, but far from taking that course he gave as one of his reasons for urging that the trial be proceeded with, that some of his witnesses were from a distance and might not be available again. The undertaking was not accepted by the learned judge, but that does not affect the fact that the objection which counsel might then have taken against the proceeding at the trial was not taken. The appellant took his chance of success with the jury as it was then constituted, and with knowledge that there was a question respecting the hearing of one of the jurors, and it was only when he failed to secure an acquittal that this rumour was revived. *** We were satisfied, on consultation with the learned trial judge, that the test made by him of having the sheriff call over, once in an ordinary tone of voice, and once in a lower tone, was not known to either the appellant or his counsel but there is no suggestion that the appellant was not made aware of the alleged deafness of the juror.\nIt is thus apparent that the question of the deafness of the juror Keown was canvassed during the trial and that, with the knowledge that the learned trial judge was aware that that question had been raised and must have satisfied himself that Keown's deafness was not so great as to be incompatible with his discharge of the duties of a juror before allowing the trial to proceed with him as a member of the petit jury, counsel representing the defendant, to suit his own purposes, acquiesced in that course being taken.\nUnder these circumstances we are not disposed to admit the right of the defendant to contend on appeal that the presence of Keown on the petit jury resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and, if he should be allowed to do so, we are fully convinced that\nno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\n(Cr. C. s. 1014 (2) ).\nWe, therefore, think that so far as the defendant's appeal to the Court of Appeal rests on this ground it should now be dismissed.\nThe objection to the constitution of the grand jury rests on the facts that an order of Mr. Justice Murphy, purporting to be made by him as presiding judge at the assizes, and directing the sheriff to summon other persons to serve on the grand and petit juries in the places of those whom the sheriff had been unable to serve (Jury Act, B.C. 1913, c. 34, s. 31) was in fact made by him six days before the assizes opened and by inadvertence was drawn up to cover only the summoning of additional petit jurymen, although the record shews that it was sought in respect of the grand jury as well as of the petit jury. There is no doubt that the learned judge meant his order to cover both grand and petit jurors and there is equally no doubt that the omission of the words \" the grand jury and \" in the operative clause was a mere clerical error entirely due to a slip, or inadvertence, on the part of the solicitor who drew the order up.\nUnder these circumstances we incline to think the order as pronounced by the learned judge may be regarded as the order made by him rather than the order in the mistaken form in which it was drawn up. Hatton v. Harris[2] ; Milson v. Carter[3]. In any case, however, if the consequences of the mistake made in drawing up the order should afford a ground on which \" the appeal, might be decided in favour of the appellant,\" we are convinced that \" no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred \" as a result of such mistake.\nAlthough the statute authorizes \" the presiding judge \" to make the order and, on a strict construction, this might be held to confer jurisdiction only after the sittings of the Assize Court had begun, convenience obviously requires that the jury panels shall be filled in advance of the actual sitting of the court. Giving to s. 31 (of the Jury Act) a construction designed to advance the remedy it was meant to afford, we are of opinion that the judge designated to hold the assizes may in advance of the actual opening of the court for the purposes of the section be regarded as \" the presiding judge\" to whom the sheriff is to report and who may, on request made on behalf of the Crown, make the order.\nMoreover, we incline to agree with Mr. Justice Galliher that s. 1011 of the Criminal Code, notwithstanding the absence from it of the word \" summoning,\" was meant to preclude the impeaching of a verdict on the grounds such as these. The defendant's appeal to the Court of Appeal on this ground should, therefore, likewise stand dismissed. There remains the ground of misdirection. This was not discussed at bar and so far as appears from the material before us was not passed upon in the Court of Appeal. Moreover the charge of the learned judge is not in the record. Having regard to the further fact that the defendant was not represented on the argument of the appeal, we think the only course open to us is to remit the case to the Court of Appeal in order that that court may pass upon the grounds of appeal based on misdirection.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] [1925] 2 W.W.R. 40.\n[2] [1892] A.C. 547.\n[3] [1893] A.C. 638, 640.\n"

G\u00e9rin-Lajoie for the respondent.\nGeo. A. Campbell K.C. and A. S. Bruneau for the appellant. As between mother and tutor, the mother's right is not absolute, where, as in this case, the mother has renounced to the charge of tutorship and has voluntarily transferred to the tutor the care of the child's person.\nThe right is not absolute, but depends on the circumstances, the determining factor being the interest of the child.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, the respondent is not entitled to proceed by way of habeas corpus, but should have proceeded by way of ordinary writ of summons.\nH. G. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie for the respondent. The right of the mother to regain possession of her child is a right resulting from the principles of paternal authority.\nThe rights of tutorship cannot extinguish that right.\nThe writ of habeas corpus is the proper remedy in the circumstances of the case, according to the doctrine of the authors and the jurisprudence.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Cette cause pr\u00e9sente deux questions resultant\n1. d'un conflit apparent entre les droits d'une mere et ceux d'un tuteur sur la personne d'une fille mineure;\n2. de la recevabilit\u00e9 d'un bref d'habeas corpus comme rem\u00e8de appropri\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer ces droits.\nGertrude Stevenson, la fille de l'intim\u00e9e, est une enfant posthume. La m\u00e8re, rest\u00e9e veuve et sans moyens, ne pouvait subvenir aux besoins de son enfant, et crut de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de cette derni\u00e8re de consentir \u00e0 ce qu'elle rest\u00e2t chez les grands-parents paternels. Quoique 1'enfant n'e\u00fbt aucuns biens, on lui fit nommer un tuteur, et la m\u00e8re renon\u00e7a a la charge en faveur du grand-p\u00e8re.\nLes grands-parents demeuraient \u00e0 Ste-Sophie, qui est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ trente-trois milles de Montr\u00e9al, o\u00f9 la m\u00e8re s'\u00e9tablit pour gagner sa vie. Malgr\u00e9 la modicit\u00e9 de ses ressources p\u00e9cuniaires, l'intim\u00e9e fit \u00e0 son enfant des visites r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et avait l'habitude de lui apporter des v\u00eatements, des jouets et des friandises.\nGraduellement la condition de l'intim\u00e9e s'am\u00e9liora et elle parvint \u00e0 gagner un salaire suffisant pour lui permettre de reprendre \u00e0 sa charge l'obligation naturelle et l\u00e9gale de \"nourrir, entretenir et \u00e9lever son enfant\" (Art. 165 C.C.).\nGertrude avait atteint l'\u00e2ge de neuf ans. C'\u00e9tait le moment de lui faire suivre les classes. Les grands-parents demeurant \u00e0 la campagne, ils jug\u00e8rent \u00e0 propos de l'envoyer \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, chez une tante, aupr\u00e8s de qui elle e\u00fbt une chambre (\"rooming\".) pour lui permettre de suivre les cours du \"high school.\" Sa m\u00e8re apprit cela et n'y fit d'abord aucune objection. Mais l'instinct maternel prit le dessus; et, un jour que la fillette se promenait sous les soins d'une institutrice attach\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement tenu par la tante, l'intim\u00e9e chercha \u00e0 s'emparer de son enfant. L'institutrice r\u00e9sista et la tentative n'eut pas de r\u00e9sultat imm\u00e9diat. Cependant l'esprit de la m\u00e8re s'\u00e9tait \u00e9veill\u00e9 \u00e0 la v\u00e9ritable nature de ses droits; et, au moyen de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pour \u00e9mission d'un bref d'habeas corpus, elle r\u00e9clame la possession et la garde de son enfant. Le grand-p\u00e8re, qui est l'appelant, oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate une r\u00e9sistance \u00e9nergique en invoquant ses droits de tuteur et la longue p\u00e9riode d'ann\u00e9es pendant laquelle il a eu soin de l'enfant, en ajoutant qu'il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 une affection r\u00e9ciproque tr\u00e8s vive qu'il serait cruel de briser aussi brusquement.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a trouv\u00e9 que\nla preuve faite en cette cause \u00e9tablit que la requ\u00e9rante a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 digne de la garde de son enfant, et qu'elle l'est encore; (que) la pauvret\u00e9 seule l'a fait consentir \u00e0 s'en s\u00e9parer, elle s'est toujours montr\u00e9e bonne m\u00e8re, visitant souvent (son enfant) et lui apportant des choses n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la vie aussi bien que des jouets et friandises. (Aujourd'hui qu'elle se trouve) dans une position financi\u00e8re qui lui permet d'assurer \u00e0 son enfant les soins et instruction et l'\u00e9ducation convenables et appropri\u00e9s il est temps, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant. que sa m\u00e8re, la requ\u00e9rante, lui donne ou lui fasse donner, comme c'est son droit maternel, sacr\u00e9 et inali\u00e9nable, la formation intellectuelle, morale et religieuse de son choix.\nLa cour a donc maintenu le bref d'habeas corpus ad subjiciendum et a confi\u00e9 l'enfant \u00e0 la m\u00e8re.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9.\nLa concordance de vues en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour du Banc du Roi, appuy\u00e9e comme elle l'est sur une exacte appreciation des circonstances, n'a entra\u00een\u00e9 devant cette cour aucune discussion sur les faits.\nLe grand-p\u00e8re a quatre-vingts ans et la grand'm\u00e8re au del\u00e0 de soixante-quinze. Malgr\u00e9 toute leur tendresse et leur sollicitude, il para\u00eet clair que leur \u00e2ge ne leur permettra pas d'accorder encore longtemps leur attention et leurs soins \u00e0 la fillette. Il est donc prudent, m\u00eame en se pla\u00e7ant uniquement \u00e0 ce point de vue, de la pourvoir d\u00e8s maintenant d'un autre protecteur. La sant\u00e9 de l'enfant n'entre pas en balance, puisque, pour les fins de son instruction, les grands-parents \u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s de la placer en chambre \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et que son accommodation, sous ce rapport, n'offre pas de diff\u00e9rence sensible avec ce que la m\u00e8re est en \u00e9tat de lui procurer.\nNous ne faisons que constater en passant que le r\u00e9sultat du litige ne diminuera pas le bien-\u00eatre de Gertrude Stevenson, sans toutefois attacher \u00e0 cette question une importance d\u00e9cisive.\nAbordons premi\u00e8rement le c\u00f4t\u00e9 des droits du tuteur. L'appelant a sembl\u00e9 vouloir faire \u00e9tat de la renonciation de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la charge de tutrice. Il a voulu qu'on y v\u00eet une sorte de convention qui aurait pour effet de lier l'intim\u00e9e et contre laquelle elle ne pourrait plus r\u00e9clamer.\nIl est inutile de dire que les droits qui d\u00e9rivent de la puissance paternelle ne peuvent jamais faire l'objet d'un pacte de ce genre. Ces droits sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au p\u00e8re et \u00e0 la m\u00e8re par la nature et par la loi. Il n'est pas en leur pouvoir de s'en d\u00e9partir eux-m\u00eames. Un contrat qui aurait cet objet serait intrins\u00e8quement immoral et ill\u00e9gal. La loi elle-m\u00eame n'intervient pour att\u00e9nuer ou \u00e9carter l'autorit\u00e9 paternelle que dans les cas o\u00f9 les parents sont incapables ou indignes de l'exercer.\nLa renonciation contenue dans l'acte de tutelle n'a donc pas affect\u00e9 les droits de l'intim\u00e9e en tant que m\u00e8re; mais e\u00fbt-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans ce but (et en dehors des cas d'adoption que la loi de Qu\u00e9bec permet maintenant), elle devrait \u00eatre \u00e0 cette fin consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme absolument nulle et incapable de mettre la moindre entrave aux conclusions de l'intim\u00e9e.\nLa cour du Banc du Roi a depuis longtemps tranch\u00e9 cette question. Barlow v. Kennedy[2]. Fuzier-Herman Code Civil\u2014Art. 373, n\u00b0 32. Mais, tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieusement, l'appelant invoque les pouvoirs et les devoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le code civil en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur:\nLe mineur non \u00e9mancip\u00e9 a son domicile chez ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re ou tuteur (art. 83 C.C.).\nSi le p\u00e8re est disparu, la m\u00e8re a la surveillance des enfants mineurs et elle exerce tous les droits du mari quant \u00e0 leur personne et \u00e0 l'administration de leurs biens, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il y ait un tuteur (art. 113 C.C.).\nLe tuteur prend soin de la personne du mineur et le repr\u00e9sente dans tous les actes civils (art. 290 C.C.).\nOn ne saurait en tirer l'argument que l'appelant sugg\u00e8re. Il fallait que la loi attribu\u00e2t ces pouvoirs au tuteur, parce qu'il pouvait \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 les exercer. Les codificateurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de pr\u00e9voir le cas o\u00f9 le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re seraient indignes ou incapables de les remplir. C'est pouquoi ils ont inclu ces devoirs parmi ceux du tuteur. Il fallait pourvoir aux cas o\u00f9 les circonstances l'exigeraient.\nCes droits r\u00e9sultant de la puissance paternelle appartiennent aux parents d\u00e8s la naissance de l'enfant. La tutelle est dative et les pouvoirs qu'elle comporte n'existent que depuis la date o\u00f9 elle est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e. L'article 243 du code civil attribue au p\u00e8re l'autorit\u00e9 sur l'enfant jusqu'\u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 ou l'\u00e9mancipation de ce dernier. Jusque l\u00e0 le mineur non \u00e9mancip\u00e9 ne peut quitter la maison paternelle sans la permission de son p\u00e8re (art. 244 C.C.).\nIl ne fait absolument aucun doute qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut du p\u00e8re cette autorit\u00e9 appartient \u00e0 la m\u00e8re (arts. 113, 120, 245 C.C.). Les seules causes qui en font perdre l'exercice, en dehors de la majorit\u00e9 ou de l'\u00e9mancipation de l'enfant, sont l'incapacit\u00e9 (comme, par exemple, l'interdiction), ou l'indignit\u00e9 (comme les mauvais traitements qui pourraient compromettre son intelligence ou sa vie, ou l'immoralit\u00e9).\nL'octroi de la tutelle \u00e0 une autre personne que la m\u00e8re n'a pas pour r\u00e9sultat de faire dispara\u00eetre la puissance paternelle.\nIl faut done consid\u00e9rer les articles de la loi qui conf\u00e8rent au tuteur des droits sur la personne du mineur comme ins\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le code civil pour pr\u00e9voir le cas o\u00f9 le mineur serait priv\u00e9 de son protecteur naturel et l\u00e9gal, qui est la m\u00e8re, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut du p\u00e8re. Les pouvoirs du tuteur se bornent autrement \u00e0 l'administration du patrimoine du pupille. Et m\u00eame si le domicile l\u00e9gal de ce dernier est chez son tuteur, sa r\u00e9sidence obligatoire continue d'\u00eatre la maison paternelle. (Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3i\u00e8me \u00e9d. vol. 5, p. 149).\nL'un des deux \u00e9poux \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, la puissance paternelle est exerc\u00e9e par le survivant, tuteur ou non tuteur, remari\u00e9 ou non remari\u00e9. (Demolombe, vol. 6, n\u00b0 374).\nDemolombe ajoute:\nLa puissance paternelle et la tutelle sont deux pouvoirs distincts, qui peuvent co-exister ensemble, r\u00e9unis sur la m\u00eame t\u00eate ou s\u00e9par\u00e9s.\nMais comment, direz-vous, cela est-il possible?\nLa puissance paternelle a pour mission de gouverner la personne et d'administrer les biens de l'enfant. Or la tutelle a aussi absolument la m\u00eame mission. Donc ces deux pouvoirs ne sauraient exister en m\u00eame temps. Leur existence simultan\u00e9e est n\u00e9anmoins incontestable; seulement ce syllogisme est vrai en ce sens, que Fun des pouvoirs en effet l'emporte quelquefois sur l'autre dans l'exercice de certains attributs, ainsi que nous allons l'expliquer.\nIl examine ensuite les diff\u00e9rentes hypoth\u00e8ses possibles (nos. 375, 376, 377, 378, 379 et 380); puis il conclut que, entre le survivant des p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re et le tuteur, parent ou \u00e9tranger,\nc'est au survivant qu'appartient, en vertu du droit de puissance paternelle, la garde de l'enfant et la direction de son \u00e9ducation.\nTelle \u00e9tait l'ancienne jurisprudence (Nouveau Denizart, tome 7, verbo Education, no. 4; et tome 9, par. 12, no. 4; Sirey, 1830-11-337).\nLa m\u00eame doctrine est enseign\u00e9e par Baudry-Lacantinerie (3\u00e8me \u00e9d., vol. 5, p. 142) et Aubry & Rau (5\u00e8me \u00e9d. tome 1er, par. 111). La note 7, \u00e0 la page 674, au bas de ce paragraphe 111, se lit comme suit:\nL'autorit\u00e9 tut\u00e9laire, qui peut exister concurremment avec la puissance paternelle, ne saurait restreindre les droits de cette derni\u00e8re. En pareil cas, les pouvoirs du tuteur se bornent \u00e0 l'administration du patrimoine; et le gouvernement de la personne reste, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, confi\u00e9 au p\u00e8re ou \u00e0 la m\u00e8re. C'est au survivant des \u00e9poux, investi de la puissance paternelle et capable de l'exercer, qu'appartiennent les droits d'\u00e9ducation, de correction et d'\u00e9mancipation.\nFuzier-Herman (verbo Tutelle), apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 les principes de l'administration de la personne du mineur par le tuteur, r\u00e9sume la situation comme suit:\n684. Les principes qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, relatifs \u00e0 l'administration de la personne du mineur, ne re\u00e7oivent leur compl\u00e8te application qu'au cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s des p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re ou que lorsque le survivant d'eux a perdu ou ne peut exercer la puissance paternelle. Au cas contraire, l'administration du patrimoine appartient seule au tuteur, la personne du mineur devant rester sous la puissance paternelle du p\u00e8re ou de la m\u00e8re survivant. D\u00e9j\u00e0, dans le m\u00eame r\u00e9pertoire de Fuzier-Herman (verbo Puissance Paternelle), on trouvait:\n94. Ces droits continuent \u00e0 appartenir au survivant des \u00e9poux, qu'il soit ou non tuteur de ses enfants. Tutelle et puissance paternelle sont en effet choses tr\u00e8s distinctes et peuvent co-exister sans se porter pr\u00e9judice l'une \u00e0 l'autre. D'o\u00f9 il suit que, d'abord, l'autorit\u00e9 paternelle subsiste enti\u00e8re, apr\u00e8s la mort du p\u00e8re ou de la m\u00e8re, dans la personne de celui des deux qui survit: elle n'est en rien modifi\u00e9e ou alt\u00e9r\u00e9e par la qualit\u00e9 de tuteur des enfants dont se trouve investi l'\u00e9poux survivant, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 subordonner son autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 celle du conseil de famille.

Il faut m\u00eame g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser, comme nous l'avons dit plus haut et poser en principe que l'exclusion ou la destitution de la tutelle n'enl\u00e8ve pas au parent survivant l'exercice de la puissance paternelle.\u2014Cass., 3 mars 1856, Wey, (S. 56.1. 408, p. 52, 2. 266, D. 56. 1. 290);\u201415 mars 1864, X\u2026, (S. 64, 1, 155, p. 64, 972, D. 64, 1. 301) Paris, 9 mars 1854, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9,\u2026Poitiers, 21 Juill. 1890, Guilberteau-Billaud, (S. 91, 2.17, p. 91, 1, 103, D. 91, 2. 73).\u2014Sic Marcad\u00e9, t.2, n. 135, 244; Demolombe, t. 6, n. 379 et s.; Laurent, t. 4, n. 263 et s.; Magnin, t. 1, n. 439, 442; Chardon, t. 2, a. 66 et s.; Bernard, p. 207; Leloir, t. 1, n. 310; Taudi\u00e8re, p. 104.\u2014Contra, de Fr\u00e9minville, t. 1, n. 806; Demante, t. 2, n. 117 bis-11; Rivi\u00e8re, Rev.

C'est donc \u00e0 la m\u00e8re, et non au tuteur, qu'appartient le droit de garde et d'\u00e9ducation de Gertrude Stevenson.\nMais ce droit, pr\u00e9tend l'appelant, ne peut pas, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, \u00eatre affirm\u00e9 au moyen du bref d'Habeas Corpus. Cette proc\u00e9dure n'est admise que dans le cas\no\u00f9 une personne est emprisonn\u00e9e ou priv\u00e9e de sa libert\u00e9.\nOr, dit-il, en l'esp\u00e8ce, Gertrude Stevenson est librement chez moi. Si toutefois la m\u00e8re veut faire reconna\u00eetre son droit de garde et d'\u00e9ducation elle devra adopter une autre proc\u00e9dure.\nSans doute, la tendance moderne et la pratique constante de cette cour sont de se d\u00e9gager, autant que possible, des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure pour ne prononcer les arr\u00eats que sur le m\u00e9rite des questions et le fond m\u00eame du litige. Il est difficile, de prime abord, de voir pourquoi, si le bref \u00e9mis en cette cause ne cadre pas exactement avec les prescriptions de l'article 1114 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, l'intim\u00e9e ne pourrait pas se r\u00e9clamer de l'article 3 du m\u00eame code; surtout quand la cour, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, a permis la production de plaidoiries \u00e9crites et l'audition de t\u00e9moins comme dans une enqu\u00eate ordinaire. Si le grief de l'appelant consiste uniquement dans le fait qu'on aurait d\u00fb le poursuivre au moyen du bref de sommation habituel, il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que, dans le cas actuel, la m\u00e9thode diff\u00e9rente qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e lui avait caus\u00e9 le moindre pr\u00e9judice.\nMais le bref d'Habeas Corpus, qui s'appuie sur le fondement m\u00eame des droits constitutionnels du citoyen britannique, est d'un caract\u00e8re trop sp\u00e9cial, pour que ce d\u00e9bat puisse \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9 sur le principe qu'il ne soul\u00e8ve qu'une simple chicane de proc\u00e9dure.\nEn principe, c'est la personne qui est emprisonn\u00e9e ou priv\u00e9e de libert\u00e9 qui, elle-m\u00eame, s'adresse au juge pour faire constater si la cause de sa d\u00e9tention est justifiable. Le code permet cependant qu'un autre le fasse pour elle. Ici, la requ\u00eate ne pouvait venir de l'enfant; et si quelqu'un \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 agir pour elle, c'\u00e9tait \u00e9videmment l'intim\u00e9e.\nMais s'agit-il d'un cas o\u00f9 la personne est priv\u00e9e de sa libert\u00e9?\nIl serait oiseux de rappeler ici les \u00e9tapes historiques du bref d'Habeas Corpus ad subjiciendum en mati\u00e8res civiles. En ce qui concerne la province de Qu\u00e9bec, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retrac\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te par Mr le juge Mathieu dans la cause de Daoust v. Schiller[3], et par Mr Ludovic Brunet, dans l'opuscule qu'il a consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude de cette question. A travers les lois successives (art. 1114 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile de 1897; art. 1040 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile de 1867; art. 20 du c. 95 des Statuts Refondus du Bas-Canada (1861); art. 1er du c. 8 des Statuts du Bas-Canada (52 Geo. III, (1812), on retrouve invariablement les m\u00eames expressions:\nlorsque quelque personne sera emprisonn\u00e9e ou priv\u00e9e de sa libert\u00e9.\nIl est bien compris que nous nous bornons ici \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation qui \u00e9tendit aux mati\u00e8res civiles le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et le privil\u00e8ge d'un bref dont le recours, en mati\u00e8re criminelle ou suppos\u00e9e criminelle, remonte \u00e0 une origine bien ant\u00e9rieure m\u00eame \u00e0 l'acte 31 Charles II (1679) et au moins jusqu'\u00e0 la Grande Charte (1215).\nLe parlement anglais, en 1816, adopta une loi (56 Geo. III, c. 100) au m\u00eame effet que celle dont jouissait le Bas-Canada depuis 1812. Il convient donc de rechercher comment, in pari materia, cette condition de la privation de la libert\u00e9 (\"restraint of liberty\") a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en Angleterre, le pays d'origine du bref d'Habeas Corpus.\nOr, il est ind\u00e9niable que, par extension, l'on y a assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une privation de sa libert\u00e9 le fait pour un enfant en bas \u00e2ge d'\u00eatre sous la garde d'une personne autre que celle \u00e0 qui la loi conf\u00e8re cette autorit\u00e9 et ce contr\u00f4le.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0, en 1831, le juge Patteson pouvait-il affirmer, en rendant jugement re McClellan[4].\nI understand Mr. Jeremy's argument against the restoration of the child to its father to be\u2014first, on the ground that this court does not interfere, by habeas corpus, to take an infant out of the custody of any one, unless something like force or improper restraint of the person exists\u2014and, secondly, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the court will not be disposed to interfere. As to the first ground, I think the authorities do not warrant the objection. The law is perfectly clear as to the right of the father to the possession of his legitimate children, of whatever age they be. In the case of Rex v. De Manneville[5], the court held that the father of a child is entitled to the custody of it, though an infant at the breast of its mother, if the court sees no ground to impute any motive to the father injurious to the health or liberty of such a child, as by sending it out of the kingdom; the father being at the time an alien enemy, domiciled in this kingdom, and the mother being an English woman, and apprehensive only that he meant to send the child abroad, but assigning no sufficient reason for such an apprehension. With respect to the argument that some force or improper restraint must be used, in order to authorize the court in removing an infant from the custody of any one, the authorities referred to shew that it is not necessary that any force or restraint should exist on the part of the person having the custody of the infant towards it; but there must be some force or improper restraint on the part of the father, in order to enable the court to take it from him.\nEn 1836, dans la cause de The King v. Henrietta Lavinia Greenhill[6], le Lord Chief Justice Denman disait (p. 640):\nWhen an infant is brought before the court by habeas corpus, if he be of an age to exercise a choice, the court leaves him to select where he will go. If he be not of that age, and a want of direction would only expose him to dangers or seductions, the court must make an order for his being placed in the proper custody. The only question then is, what is to be considered the proper custody; and that undoubtedly is the custody of the father.\nEt Coleridge J. (p. 643) :\nBut where the person is too young to have a choice, we must refer to legal principles to see who is entitled to the custody, because the law presumes that, where the legal custody is, no restraint exists; and where the child is in the hands of a third person, that presumption is in favour of the father.\nEn 1857, dans la cause de The Queen v. Maria Clarke[7], Lord Campbell, Lord Chief Justice, s'exprime comme suit (p. 193):\nThe question then arises, whether a habeas corpus be the proper remedy for the guardian to recover the custody of the child, of which he has been improperly deprived. Certainly the great use of the writ, the boast of English jurisprudence, is to set at liberty any of the Queen's subjects unlawfully imprisoned; and, when an adult is brought up under a habeas corpus, and) found to be unlawfully imprisoned, he is to have his unfettered choice to go where he pleases. But, with respect to a child under guardianship for nurture, the child is supposed to be unlawfully imprisoned when unlawfully detained from the custody of the guardian; and when delivered to him the child is supposed to be set at liberty. The King v. De Manneville[8] clearly proves that such is the fit mode of proceeding if the child is under seven. Is there any reason for following a different course between seven and fourteen? The intellectual faculties of the child may be considerably developed in this interval; and the child may now have a very strong inclination to leave the home of the guardian, and, from religious as well as frivolous motives, to be educated at a different school from that which the guardian has selected. But the consequences which would follow from allowing such a choice are most alarming. We must lay down a rule which will be generally beneficial although it may operate harshly in particular instances. If the proposed choice were given to the child, the relation of guardian and ward would still subsist; the guardian might retake the child wherever he finds it; and he might maintain an action against the person who, contrary to his wishes, takes or detains the child. Then, how could nurture be carried on with such a doctrine, which, if established, would apply to every father of a family in the kingdom, in respect of all his children, male and female, above the age of seven years. If a father wishes to take his son when ten years old from a private school where flogging is not practised, and send him to Eton, and the boy refuses to come home, and is brought up by habeas corpus, is he to be permitted to say that, on consideration, he is of opinion that the private school is preferable to any public school where flogging is permitted, and therefore he makes his choice to return to the private school, the master being willing to receive him. Or suppose that a Protestant mother, guardian for nurture of a daughter seven years of age, sends her to a boarding school professing to be a Protestant seminary; in a short time she finds that attempts have been successfully made by teachers to convert the girl to the Roman Catholic faith; the girl refuses to come home, saying, in analogy to the language used by Alicia Race: \"I will not go home to my own mother; I will stay here where I may pray to the Mother of God;\" she is in consequence brought up by habeas corpus. Are we to examine her, and, finding her of quick parts and professing to be a sincere convert to the Roman Catholic faith, to tell her that, in spite of the wishes of her mother, she is at liberty to return to the school where she has been converted. Such a doctrine seems wholly inconsistent with parental authority, which both reason and revelation teach us to respect as essential for the welfare of the human race. La jurisprudence, en Angleterre, s'est de plus en plus affirm\u00e9e dans ce sens; et Halsbury, The Laws of England (1909), la resume ainsi (vol. X, p. 40, n\u00b0 91):\nWhere the restraint is imposed on civil grounds under claim of authority, the legal validity of such claim may be investigated land determined; and where, as frequently occurs in the case of infants, conflicting claims for the custody of the same individual are raised, such claims may be inquired into on the return to a writ of habeas corpus, and the custody awarded to the person having the legal right thereto.\nA la page 52, n\u00b0 109:\nA parent, guardian or other person, who is legally entitled to the custody of a child, can regain such custody, when wrongfully deprived of it, by means of the writ of habeas corpus. The unlawful detention of a child from the person who is legally entitled to its custody, is, for the purpose of the issue of the writ, regarded as equivalent to tan unlawful imprisonment of the child. It is therefore unnecessary to allege, in applying for the writ, that any restraint or force is being used towards the infant by the person in whose custody and control it is for the time being.\nA la page 57, n\u00b0 120:\nAny person who is legally entitled to the custody of another may sue out the writ in order to regain such custody.\nEnfin, dans Short and Mellor, \"The Practice of the Crown Office\" (1908), \u00e0 la page 313, on trouve l'exposition suivante de la pratique courante:\nWith reference to the custody of children the judges of the common law courts have exercised a larger jurisdiction in granting writs of habeas corpus than in other cases. They have exercised powers somewhat analogous to those which the Court of Chancery has always exercised in its character of parens patriae. For instance, the writ was issued irrespective of the wishes or desire of the child detained, and in making the rule absolute, the court has always exercised a certain discretion in order to protect the child, in addition to merely setting the infant free from restraint.\nLes auteurs citent le passage du jugement de Coleridge J. re Greenhill[9], reproduit plus haut, et ils continuent:\nAnd all the judges agreed that age, and not mental capacity, was to be taken to be the criterion of a capacity to choose. In The Queen v. Clarke[10], and The Queen v. Howes[11], it was laid down that the age at which children should be deemed to have discretion was fourteen in the case of a boy and sixteen in the case of a girl.\nVoil\u00e0 donc quelle est, en Angleterre, l'adaptation qu'on fait du bref d'habeas corpus au cas des enfants mineurs. Il n'y a pas de raison juridique pour que le m\u00eame texte ne re\u00e7oive pas ici la m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation, lorsqu'il s'agit de la competence d'un bref identique et que nous tenons de la constitution anglaise. Dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, certains jugements plus anciens\u2014et il faut reconna\u00eetre que la liste en est longue\u2014paraissent avoir inclin\u00e9 dans un sens diff\u00e9rent Stoppellben v. Hull[12], confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision[13]; Riley v. Grenier[14]; Vautrin v. Dupuis[15]; Robert v. V\u00e9ronneau[16]; Pickering v. Caloran[17]; Rousseau v. Lapointe[18]; Morency v. Fortier[19]; Garcin v. Croteau[20].\nPeu de ces arr\u00eats cependant ont refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre l'applicabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 un pareil cas du rem\u00e8de par voie d'habeas corpus. La plupart ont admis que ce bref \u00e9tait un recours comp\u00e9tent, mais ont refus\u00e9 de l'accorder dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la cause. Le juge W. Dorion, qui a prononc\u00e9 en 1876, le jugement de Stoppelben v. Hull[21], sur lequel les d\u00e9cisions, depuis rendues dans le m\u00eame sens, paraissent s'\u00eatre largement appuy\u00e9es, dit lui-m\u00eame:\nBut, says the father, until my child has attained the age of majority she can have no will, no opinion, no judgment except mine, and she being detained against my will, she must be considered as detained against her will. This might perhaps be urged in cases where a child of tender age or other, such as an insane person, incapable of making a choice, was concerned, but in a case of this kind (meaning Stoppelben), where the contrary appears, I cannot admit this doctrine, nor do I find it propounded authoritatively in any of the authorities cited.\nEt le juge Mathieu, en conclusion de la longue revue qu'il a faite de la question re Daoust v. Schiller[22], n'est pas loin de s'exprimer de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la page 553:\nOn peut suivant les circonstances consid\u00e9rer comme contrainte, l'enl\u00e8vement et la d\u00e9tention d'un enfant qui n'a pas l'\u00e2ge de raison, et la soustraction de cet enfant \u00e0 la garde l\u00e9gale de ses parents. Si l'enfant n'a pas l'\u00e2ge de raison, nous croyons, avec Hurd, que l'enl\u00e8vement de l'enfant de la garde de ses parents, peut \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 la contrainte donnant lieu au bref d'habeas corpus, et que le droit des parents d'avoir la garde de leur enfant, ou le devoir de l'enfant de retourner sous leur garde peut \u00e9quivaloir au d\u00e9sir d'\u00eatre mis en libert\u00e9 et soustrait \u00e0 cette contrainte. Si un \u00e9tranger va sans motif enlever un enfant qui n'a pas l'\u00e2ge de raison \u00e0 la garde de son p\u00e8re, nous croyons que le tribunal pourra sur habeas corpus ordonner que l'enfant soit remis au p\u00e8re, vu que cet enl\u00e8vement peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une contrainte; mais nous croyons qu'il n'y a que le cas o\u00f9 l'enfant est contraint ou doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant contraint et priv\u00e9 de sa libert\u00e9 o\u00f9 sa remise au p\u00e8re doit \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e sur bref d'habeas corpus. Tout ce que le tribunal peut faire sur un bref d'habeas corpus, c'est de constater s'il y a contrainte, et, si cette contrainte est constat\u00e9e de la faire cesser, en remettant les choses dans l'ordre.\nMais cela m\u00eame est admettre que, dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la garde des enfants mineurs est en jeu, le bref d'habeas corpus est le rem\u00e8de appropri\u00e9. C'est essentiellement un bref d'enqu\u00eate (\"writ of inquiry\").\nIl a pour but d'examiner les causes de d\u00e9tention et de constater s'il y a contrainte. La loi ne suppose nulle part que l'enfant mineur pourra opposer son d\u00e9sir de libert\u00e9 \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 de ses parents. C'est la jurisprudence qui a introduit ce correctif \u00e0 la puissance paternelle. Elle n'a pas cependant pos\u00e9 de principe absolu. Elle s'est inspir\u00e9e d'une discr\u00e9tion restreinte bas\u00e9e sur certaines conditions d'\u00e2ge et d'intelligence de l'enfant, en tenant compte des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales \u00e0 chaque cas particulier. Conc\u00e9der, comme le juge Dorion et le juge Mathieu, qu'il est certains de ces cas o\u00f9 le bref pourrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9, c'est admettre qu'il faut dans chaque cas rechercher si les conditions requises existent pour le maintien du bref, qu'il y a lieu \u00e0 l'\"inquiry\" \u00e0 laquelle pourvoit le bref; c'est donc conclure \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence de l'habeas corpus.\nIl est inutile, en effet, de signaler qu'il faut \u00e9viter de confondre entre la recevabilit\u00e9 du bref et la question de savoir s'il devra \u00eatre maintenu, apr\u00e8s que l'\"inquiry\" aura d\u00e9montr\u00e9 s'il y a, au sens o\u00f9 l'on entend ces mots pour les enfants mineurs, privation de leur libert\u00e9. Pour les fins de cette enqu\u00eate et pour \"remettre les choses dans l'ordre,\" l'habeas corpus est l'instrument voulu, \u00e9minemment appropri\u00e9 et efficace.\nC'est ce qu'un grand nombre d'arr\u00eats ont reconnu.\nDans Barlow v. Kennedy[23], les faits offraient beaucoup de ressemblance avec ceux de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce. Voici comment les r\u00e9sume le juge Badgley:\nThe respondent petitioned the provincial judge for the district of St. Francis, for the issue of a writ of Habeas Corpus ad subjiciendum, and which was issued forthwith, to obtain the custody and possession of his minor child. The, facts are that four years previous to the application, the mother of the child having died, the petitioner, the child's father, being very needy, and personally unable to care for and have charge of the infant, agreed that she should be given over to Barlow, and brought up by him and his wife, who were very respectable and in good circumstances. Kennedy was to have executed a contract to that effect, but had failed or neglected to do so, but allowed the child to remain as agreed upon with the appellant's family, where it has been kindly eared for as their own child. Kennedy had lately remarried, and being in circumstances to take care of his child, made this application to recover her, although it is manifest that neither his means nor position as a common labourer will allow or enable him to bring up the child with the comfort and welfare afforded by Barlow and his wife; and in consequence, guided by these very charitable motives for the child's comfort and advantage, the petition was dismissed by the judge, to whom the application was originally made.\nDans les circonstances qui viennent d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9es, la Cour de R\u00e9vision avait infirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et avait maintenu le bref d'habeas corpus. La Cour du Banc de la Reine confirma cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9. Le seul juge qui enregistra son dissentiment le fit parce qu'il \u00e9tait d'avis que le refus de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait sans appel; mais ce m\u00eame juge fut le plus expressif, dans ses notes, sur la comp\u00e9tence du bref d'habeas corpus en l'occurrence.\nCet arr\u00eat remonte \u00e0 1871. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi de ceux de Ex parte Grace Ham[24]; la Mission de la Grande Ligne v. Morrissette[25]; Truax v. Ingalls[26], o\u00f9 le juge Lynch fait une revue des autorit\u00e9s anglaises, am\u00e9ricaines et canadiennes et conclut en faveur\nof the principle that the illegal keeping of a child, even with its own consent, constituted such a constraint as is covered by the Habeas Corpus Act.\nA son tour, le juge Davidson re Lorenz v. Lorenz[27], d\u00e9cide:\n1. The unauthorized removal of a minor of tender years from legal custody is equivalent to confinement and restraint of liberty, and habeas corpus will lie to restore it to its proper guardians.\n2. A girl of nine years of age is too young to exercise a controlling right of choice between her father and mother who live apart, and it lies within the discretion of the judge to hand her over to whichever of the parents he thinks it best in her interest.\nLe juge Demers re Moquin v. Turgeon[28], juge:\nUne veuve, m\u00e8re d'enfante \u00e2g\u00e9s de six \u00e0 huit ans, a le droit d'en avoir la garde, et le recours de l'habeas corpus est ouvert en sa faveur pour se les faire remettre par leur grand'm\u00e8re et oncle, qui les ont \u00e9lev\u00e9s et chez qui ils demeurent.\nLe juge Beaudin, re Tr\u00e9panier v. Lefebvre[29], a maintenu le bref et ordonn\u00e9 la remise d'une enfant en la possession du p\u00e8re, sur le principe qu'il avait le droit \u00e0 la garde de son enfant d'une mani\u00e8re absolue, s'il ne s'en est pas rendu indigne par sa mauvaise conduite,\ndans une instance que le juge lui-m\u00eame relate de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nLe requ\u00e9rant est le p\u00e8re de Yvette Tr\u00e9panier, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 10 mois, issue du mariage du requ\u00e9rant avec Ald\u00e9a Neveu, maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, fille de l'intim\u00e9e par le premier mariage de cette derni\u00e8re.\nL'intim\u00e9e fait rapport sur le bref d'Habeas Corpus qu'elle est la grand'm\u00e8re maternelle de l'enfant; que sa fille Ald\u00e9a Neveu est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e vers le 1er juin; que le 28 juin 1913 par \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9, le requ\u00e9rant confia \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e son enfant, s'engageant \u00e0 ne lui jamais enlever la dite enfant du vivant de la dite dame intim\u00e9e, quand m\u00eame il viendrait \u00e0 se remarier. Elle demande \u00e0 ce que suivant l'\u00e9crit par lequel la dite enfant lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e, le bref d'Habeas Corpus soit cass\u00e9 et annul\u00e9.\nCe dernier arr\u00eat est de 1913. Viennent ensuite, en 1917, Kostel v. Hampton[30], et, en 1920, Brin v. Mayer[31], o\u00f9 le juge Surveyer d\u00e9cide:\n2. Les parents ont un droit absolu \u00e0 la garde de leur enfant, m\u00eame s'ils se sont volontairement, dans le pass\u00e9, d\u00e9partis de cette garde en faveur d'un \u00e9tranger, qui l'a accept\u00e9e.\nIl reste \u00e0 mentionner le jugement de Sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux re Fournier[32], et la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc du Roi re Osmun v. Morin[33]. Nous croyons que le v\u00e9ritable sens de ce dernier arr\u00eat est contenu tout entier dans ces mots du juge Lavergne:\nLes circonstances actuelles, du reste, ne donnaient pas lieu au bref d'habeas corpus.\nC'est une cause d'esp\u00e8ce.\nQuant \u00e0 l'affaire Fournier, le savant juge-en-chef de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec s'appuie primordialement sur les principes du droit public et du droit constitutionnel pour refuser de soustraire \u00e0 l'enr\u00f4lement militaire un mineur de moins de 18 ans qui s'est volontairement engag\u00e9 sans le consentement de son p\u00e8re. Il n'y a pas l\u00e0 d'analogie avec la question qui fait l'objet de notre discussion.\nOn voit donc que, si la jurisprudence est loin d'\u00eatre d'accord, son \u00e9volution plus r\u00e9cente l'a rapproch\u00e9e de la pratique moderne en Angleterre, telle qu'on la trouve expos\u00e9e dans les passages tir\u00e9s de Halsbury et de Short and Mellor que nous avons cit\u00e9s plus haut.\nNous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 que c'est de cette pratique que nous devons nous inspirer et il est satisfaisant de constater que c'est \u00e9galement vers cette conclusion que s'est d\u00e9finitivement dirig\u00e9e l'opinion judiciaire de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLes jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi, en cette cause-ci, sont conformes aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents anglais et \u00e0 la jurisprudence qu'ils ont \u00e9tablie en mati\u00e8re d'habeas corpus. Ils sont, \u00e0 travers plus d'une h\u00e9sitation, l'aboutissement logique des \u00e9tudes patientes et \u00e9labor\u00e9es auxquelles cette importante question a donn\u00e9 lieu. En affirmant la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des droits de la m\u00e8re sur ceux du tuteur quant \u00e0 la garde et au contr\u00f4le de la personne de l'enfant mineur; en d\u00e9cidant que, dans les circonstances, il y avait ouverture en faveur de la m\u00e8re au recours de l'habeas corpus pour se faire remettre son enfant, nous sommes d'avis que ces jugements sont bien fond\u00e9s et qu'ils doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9s.\nNous ne voudrions pas cependant laisser \u00e9chapper cette occasion d'appuyer sp\u00e9cialement, pour dire qu'il a toute notre approbation, sur le passage suivant des notes de Mr. le juge Greenshields[34]:\nI am not unmindful that the interests of the child should, to some extent, and perhaps to a considerable extent, be considered. But let it be well understood that the interest of the child is not to be confounded with the wish or will of the child. It can be readily understood that a young child, living with its old grandparents, might, for some reason or other, prefer to remain there. It is possible that these aged people would exercise less restraint and control over the child. It is possible that the child even might prefer the home or house in which her grandparents lived rather than that occupied by her mother. In the present case the child was asked if she wished to leave her grandparents, and she said \"No.\" Pressed for a reason, she said she was frightened of her mother, and she gave a reason which has no foundation in fact. Asked if her mother had always been good to her she answers, \"Yes,\" and asserts that she was always kind to her and never said any hard words.\nRien ne nous para\u00eet, en effet, moins satisfaisant que d'essayer de d\u00e9terminer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant en se basant sur ses inclinations du moment ; surtout de les d\u00e9duire des d\u00e9clarations plus ou moins incertaines qu'il peut prof\u00e9rer en cour \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le t\u00e9moignage des enfants doit \u00eatre accueilli avec beaucoup de circonspection. A plus forte raison, dans des cas comme ceux-ci, serait-il fallacieux de s'en rapporter aux pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences indiqu\u00e9es par leurs r\u00e9ponses. L'atmosph\u00e8re n'est pas favorable. Il y a toutes les chances du monde qu'ils se d\u00e9clarent pour ceux avec qui ils ont accoutum\u00e9 de vivre. Dans plusieurs des arr\u00eats que nous avons cit\u00e9s, les juges expriment l'avis qu'il faut donner effet \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 des parents \u00e0 rencontre du d\u00e9sir exprim\u00e9 par les enfants. Lord Campbell, dans la cause de Clarks[35], soul\u00e8ve m\u00eame un doute sur l'opportunit\u00e9 d'interroger l'enfant. Comment peut-on faire de ce dernier le juge d'une question aussi grave et aussi difficile? (Voir sur ce point les remarques tr\u00e8s justes de Mignault, vol. 11, pp. 148 et 149).\nComme le dit fort sagement Mr. le juge Philippe Demers: Moquin v. Turgeon[36]:\nLe p\u00e8re, et la m\u00e8re, \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut, ont d'apr\u00e8s le droit naturel droit \u00e0 la garde de leur enfant.\u2014Pour qu'ils soient priv\u00e9s de ce droit, il ne suffit pas d'un caprice de l'enfant; il faut une raison, soit que le p\u00e8re ait abus\u00e9 de son droit, soit qu'il soit indigne ou incapable de l'exercer. Dans ces cas, \u00e9tant incapable de remplir son devoir, il ne peut r\u00e9clamer de son droit. C'est ainsi que les auteurs peuvent (logiquement dire que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des enfants doit seul guider le juge.\nSe baser sur d'autres principes c'est tomber dans l'arbitraire. Qui d'ailleurs peut dire ce qui sera en d\u00e9finitive le plus avantageux pour les enfante, la garde de leur grand'm\u00e8re ou celle de leur m\u00e8re? Dieu seul le sait. Il me para\u00eet plus sage, dans le doute, de suivre la loi naturelle.\nL'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant, qu'il faut prendre en consid\u00e9ration, son bien-\u00eatre, ne r\u00e9sident pas surtout dans le confort mat\u00e9riel, mais dans les soins et l'affection paternels, dans les avantages de l'\u00e9ducation familiale et religieuse. Le chagrin passager que l'enfant va, sans doute, ressentir en laissant ceux avec qui il a v\u00e9cu et qui furent bons pour lui, et en changeant d'entourage, ne saurait se comparer \u00e0 la satisfaction permanente et au bonheur solide qu'il ne tardera pas \u00e0 \u00e9prouver en r\u00e9alisant qu'il est d\u00e9sormais chez lui, dans sa demeure, par droit de naissance et non plus en vertu de la bienfaisance d'un \u00e9tranger qui n'a pas envers lui d'obligation l\u00e9gale; (Brown v. Partridge[37], confirm\u00e9 par cette cour le 13 mai 1925) ; en grandissant dans l'honneur et le respect pour ses parents (art. 242 C.C.), \u00e0 l'ombre de leur autorit\u00e9 (arts. 243 et seq.). C'est l\u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat bien compris de l'enfant d'accord avec celui de la famille et de l'\u00e9tat.\nSuivant le mot du chancelier Boyd, in re D'Andrea[38]:\nThe normal well ordered home is unquestionably preferable to the foster home, however well ordered.\nCe que Laurent exprime en d'autres termes (vol. IV, p. 368):\nMais il ne s'agit pas ici * * * de la libert\u00e9 individuelle; il s'agit de sanctionner un droit qui est \u00e9tabli dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00eame de l'enfant. Son droit \u00e0 lui consiste \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e9lev\u00e9; or, pour qu'il puisse l'\u00eatre, il faut qu'il soit sous la garde de son p\u00e8re.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kerry & Bruneau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Kavanagh, Lajoie & Lacoste.\n[1] [1923] Q.R. 38 K.B. 314.\n[2] [1871] 17 L.C.J. 253.\n[3] [1900] 2 R. de Pr. 529.\n[4] 1 Dowling's Rep. 81, at p. 84.\n[5] 5 East, 221.\n[6] 4 Ad. & E. 624.\n[7] 7 El. & Bl. 180.\n[8] [1804] 5 East, 221.\n[9] 4 Ad. & E. 624.\n[10] 7 El. & Bl. 186.\n[11] [1860] 3 El. & El. 332.\n[12] [1876] 2 Q.L.R. 255.\n[13] 3 Q.L.R. 136.\n[14] [1888] 33 L.C.J. 1.\n[15] [1900] 3 R. de P. 232.\n[16] [1903] R. de P. 426.\n[17] [1905] 7 R. de P. 350.\n[18] [1906] 8 R. de P. 43.\n[19] [1897] Q.R. 12 B.C. 68.\n[20] [1905] Q.R. 27 S.C. 198.\n[21] 2 Q.L.R. 255, at p. 257.\n[22] 2 R. de Pr. 529.\n[23] 17 L.C.J. 253.\n[24] [1883] 27 L.C.J. 127.\n[25] [1889] M.L.R. 6 Q.B. 130.\n[26] [1898] 4 R. de J. 442.\n[27] [1905] Q.R. 28 S.C. 330.\n[28] [1912] Q.R. 42 S.C. 232.\n[29] [1913] 15 R. de Pr. 225.\n[30] 23 R.L. n.s. 307.\n[31] 23 Rapp. de Prat. 270.\n[32] [1916] 32 D.L.R. 720.\n[33] [1918] Q.R. 27 K.B. 282.\n[34] Q.R. 38 K.B. 314, at pp. 317, 318.\n[35] 7 El. & Bl. 186.\n[36] Q.R. 42 S.C. 232.\n[37] [1925] 1 W.W.R. 378.\n[38] [1916] 37 O.L.R. 30, at p. 33.\n"

(1922), c. 183, ss. 54, 55, 179. Where a transfer of mortgaged land was given by the mortgagor as security only, but was absolute in form and contained no declaration negativing or modifying the covenant by the transferee with the transferor and mortgagee for payment of the mortgage, declared by section 54 of The Land Titles Act to be implied in the transfer, and where in a memorandum of agreement it was stipulated that upon payment of the amount in which the mortgagor was indebted to him, the transferee should re-transfer to the mortgagor a title to the land in fee simple subject to existing encumbrances or \"other encumbrances of equal amount.\"\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division, (20 Alta. L.R. 449), that section 54 did not render the transferee liable to the mortgagee for the amount of the mortgage. By the interpretation of sections 54 and 55 of The Land Titles Act in light of section 179 of the same Act, their ex facie meaning appears to be subject, at least, to this gratification, that they must not be construed or applied in such a way as to disable the courts from giving effect to the terms of any agreement constituting a \"disposition\" of the land within the meaning of section 179, entered into either contemporaneously with or subsequently to, the execution of the transfer.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (1), affirming the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the appellant's action to recover from the respondent certain mortgage moneys.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported. A. G. Virtue for the appellant. The covenant implied by section 54 cannot be negatived in any manner other than that set out in the Act, i.e., by express declaration in the instrument.\nAny agreement between the transferee and the mortgagor cannot annul a covenant existing by virtue of section 54 between the transferee and the mortgagee.\nMacleod Sinclair K.C. for, respondent.\nWhile prima facie a transferee of mortgaged property is directly liable to the mortgagee on the implied covenant, nevertheless by section 55 of the Act the implication or presumption is capable of being negatived, rebutted or modified by evidence as to the exact relationship between the transferor, mortgagor and the transferee expressly agreed to between them or to be implied from the actual facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The only question requiring discussion is that arising out of the claim of the appellant based upon s. 54 (1) of The Land Titles Act, c. 133, R.S.A. 1922. The facts can be stated in a sentence or two. The appellant held a mortgage (executed in May, 1918) to secure a loan of $1,600 on certain Alberta lands, the property of one Henderson. In October, 1919, the respondent took from Henderson a transfer under The Land Titles Act of the same lands. This transfer was duly registered, and the respondent became the registered owner of the land, subject to the appellant's mortgage.\nThe transfer was in fact taken as security for moneys owing by Henderson to the respondent, the terms of the arrangement, with the exception of the amount of the indebtedness, being stated in a memorandum of agreement of November, 1919, which is in evidence.\nThe ground on which the appellant, who was plaintiff in the action, bases his claim is, that by force of s. 54 [1] of The Land Titles Act, the respondent, being a transferee of the mortgaged lands, subject to the mortgage, is under an obligation, both to the mortgagee and to Henderson, to pay off the mortgage; and the point to be decided is whether, in the circumstances of this case, such is the effect of s. 54 (1).\nBy the agreement of November, 1919, it is stipulated that on payment by Henderson to the respondent of the amount in which Henderson was thus indebted to him together with interest at a specified rate, the respondent should retransfer to Henderson a title to the land in fee simple, subject to existing encumbrances or \"other encumbrances of equal amount.\" In the meantime the respondent was to have the right to sell the land, accounting to Henderson for the surplus, after repayment of debt, interest and costs. The land has proved to be valueless, and, in the circumstances of this case, if the proposition upon which the appellant bases his appeal be accepted, it must follow that the respondent is obliged to pay the appellant's mortgage debt, and that he is entitled to no indemnity from Henderson, because, by the terms of s. 54 (1), if that enactment is operative, the respondent is under an obligation to indemnify Henderson in respect of this very mortgage. This result follows, according to the appellant's contention, notwithstanding the fact that by the terms of the written agreement of November, as already mentioned, the sole obligation of the respondent, which arises only on payment of Henderson's debt to him, is to transfer the land to Henderson, subject to existing encumbrances.\nBy s. 139, c. 24, of the Statutes of Alberta, 1906 (now s. 179, R.S.A. 1922), it is provided:\u2014\nNothing contained in this Act shall take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court on the ground of actual fraud or over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land for which a certificate of title has been granted.\nBy virtue of this section (apart altogether from other sources of jurisdiction) the Supreme Court of Alberta has jurisdiction to give effect to the understanding between Henderson and the respondent evidenced by the agreement of November, 1919, and to the equitable rights arising from that understanding. Subject to any modification of those rights effected by s. 54 (1), the respondent, as between himself and Henderson, must be treated as a mortgagee of the land which was the subject of the arrangement, and their rights, inter se, must be determined on that footing. The existence of a right of indemnity, inhering in the mortgagor, as against the mortgagee in respect of the prior mortgage would, of course, be incompatible with a proper recognition of these rights, besides being inconsistent with the express stipulation of the agreement of November.\nComing now to s. 54 (1), if that section stood alone, there could be no difficulty in giving effect to the agreement of November as modifying any implied covenant arising from the statute. But by s. 55,\nevery covenant and power declared to be implied in any instrument by virtue of this Act may be negatived or modified by express declaration in the instrument;\nand it is argued that this provision, if operative at all, must operate as declaring exclusively the procedure by which the implication arising under the earlier section can be displaced.\nSection 55 is, however, a section which applies not only to the covenant implied by force of s. 54 (1), but to every covenant and every power implied in any instrument by virtue of any provision of the Act; and it is by no means clear that, by rejecting the contention advanced by the appellant, one would be depriving it of all effect. Moreover, these sections, 54 and 55, must be read with s. 179\u2014 formerly s. 139, quoted above\u2014and, so far as possible, effect be given to all of them. Interpreting ss. 54 and 55 in light of s. 179, their ex facie meaning on any reading of the words appears to be subject, at least, to this qualification, that they must not be construed or applied in such a way as to disable the court from giving effect to the terms of any agreement, constituting a \"disposition\" of the land within the meaning of s. 179, entered into either contemporaneously with, or subsequently to, the execution of the transfer. Where there is, as in this case, an express agreement in writing creating equitable rights equivalent, as between the parties, to an equity of redemption, the application of s. 179 presents no difficulty whatever; nor would there appear to be any difficulty in applying that section in any case in which, by proper and sufficient evidence, it was shown that the transferee had accepted the transfer and the title conveyed by it under any arrangement vesting in the transferor equitable rights in the land and incompatible in its nature or in its terms with the implication declared by s. 54. In the circumstances of this case, therefore, a 54 (1) did not create any covenant for indemnity in favour of the transferor; and since the terms of that section leave no doubt that the transferee's obligation to the mortgagee is only to arise in circumstances in which the transferee is, by virtue of the statute, under an obligation to indemnify the transferor, it follows that the appellant must fail. This view is in harmony with the course of decision in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Short v. Graham[2]; Evans et al v. Ashcroft and The British Canadian Trust Company[3]; Great West Lumber Company v. Murrin & Gray[4]; Montreal Trust Company v. Boggs and Beresford[5]; Dominion of Canada Investment and Debenture Co. v. Carstens[6]; in re Macdonald Estate[7].\nTwo of the learned judges in the court below have taken the view that the transfer ought to be rectified by inserting in it an express declaration negativing any implication under s. 54.\nIf a covenant of indemnity in the terms of that section had appeared in the transfer, there could have been no difficulty in rectifying the instrument to bring it into accord with the common intention of the parties as established by the agreement of November; and a decree for rectification would, if necessary, appear to be a proper decree in this case.\nIn the view already expressed, however, that, in the circumstances, s. 54 (1) is inoperative, rectification is unnecessary.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] Reported as Walsh v.

V, c. 53; 14 Geo. V, c. 74 (N.B.).\nIn 1920 by 10 Geo. V, c. 53, the Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities, under another name, was created in New Brunswick and authorized to make a contract with any municipality for supplying electrical energy therein. In 1924 by an amending Act it was given power, when a corporation had constructed, or desired to construct, works for distributing electricity on a highway on which were similar works of another corporation, to make an order approving of the location and of construction of the works of the new works which shall then be deemed lawful and may be operated by such corporation incurring liability to any other; nothing done by the Board in this respect is open to judicial review and no court shall by injunction or otherwise restrain the construction or operation of works so approved. By sec. 61, subsection 2, the Act of 1924 does not apply to pending litigation \"unless otherwise ordered by the court before which such litigation may be pending.\" In 1923 litigation started between the N.B. Power Co. and the city of St. John. The city, under statutory authority and a contract with the Board, was constructing works for supplying electricity within its limits and the Power Co., which had carried on the same business for some years applied for an injunction and damages alleging a wrongful interference with its property and operation of its system. The action came on for trial in 1924 when the Act of that year above referred to was in force and the trial judge, under the provisions of sec. 61 (2) ordered that it should apply to such litigation on condition that the city should promptly apply to the Board for approval of its works. The Appeal Division set aside this order holding that the judge had no power to make it and granted the injunction and damages.\nHeld, that the legislature had delegated to the court the legislative authority to declare the Act applicable and that the trial judge had properly exercised the power so delegated.\nHeld also, that the Power Co. was entitled to damages for injury incurred prior to the Board's approval of the enterprise of the city.\nQu. Was the order of the trial judge open to review?\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick reversing the order at the trial directing that a statute of the province should be retroactive.\nThe facts are fully set out in the above head-note. Baxter K.C. for the appellant.\nFred. R. Taylor K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal arises out of a dispute between the city of Saint John and the New Brunswick Power Company\u2014a company which, with its predecessors in title, has for a number of years been carrying on the business of distributing electric current through the city of Saint John and the surrounding district. In 1920, the legislature of New Brunswick passed an Act (c. 53 of the statutes of that year) authorizing the appointment by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of a commission, to be known as the \"New Brunswick Electric Power Commission,\" and providing, inter alia, for contracts between the Commission and the municipalities for the supply by the Commission of electrical energy for the production of light, heat and mechanical power.\nBy amendments in 1922 and 1923, municipalities entering into such contracts may\nacquire land and real and personal property and erect, construct and operate works for the transmission and distribution of electrical power or energy in the municipality.\nBy chapter 74 of the statutes of 1922, sec. 1, it was provided that it should be lawful for the city of Saint John to engage in the business of supplying electric light, heat and power and \"any and all other forms of use of electrical energy\" to persons and corporations within the limits of the municipality.\nThe appellant municipality, having entered into a contract with the provincial Power Commission within the meaning of this clause, proceeded to construct a distribution system in the city of Saint John. This action was brought in March, 1923, claiming an injunction and damages on the ground that in the construction of its distribution system the appellant municipality was, in violation of the respondent company's rights, wrongfully interfering with the respondent company's property and with the operation of its system.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice White in August and September, 1923, and judgment was delivered on the 28th of October, 1924. The learned trial judge held that the respondent company had established the existence of the wrongful interference alleged and stated that, in his opinion, the company would have been entitled to an injunction in respect of the wrongful acts of the appellant municipality had it not been for a certain statute which in the meantime had been enacted by the New Brunswick legislature; and some account of this legislation (c. 26 of the statutes of 1924) is necessary to make intelligible the character and effect of the judgment of the learned trial judge, as well as that of the Court of Appeal.\nIt is best to permit the legislation to speak for itself. The pertinent provisions are in these words:\u2014\n59. (1) Where a corporation has constructed or desires to construct works for conducting, furnishing or distributing electricity for light, heat or power purposes, in, under or upon any highway, or part of highway in, under or upon which any other corporation has already constructed and has works for the like purposes, or any of them, upon the application of the first mentioned corporation and after notice to the other and hearing any objection which it may make, the Commission may, if it is of opinion that the location and mode of construction of such works are proper, approve of the same, and all works which such first mentioned corporation has constructed or may thereafter construct, the location and mode of construction of which have been so approved, shall be deemed to have been constructed under statutory authority and to be lawfully constructed and may be maintained and operated by such corporation without its incurring any liability to any other corporation in respect of the construction, maintenance or operation of such works, any statute or law to the contrary notwithstanding, provided that the location and mode of construction, maintenance and operation are maintained up to the standard approved by the Commission.\n(5) The powers conferred by this section may be exercised from time to time as occasion may require.\n(6) The provisions of this section shall apply to works of a corporation constructed at any time before, as well as after the passing of this Act.\n60. The Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction as to all matters in respect of which authority is, by the next preceding section, conferred upon it, and nothing done by the Commission within its jurisdiction shall be open to question or review in any action or proceeding or by any court.\n61. (1) No court shall have authority to grant or shall grant an injunction or other order restraining, either temporarily or otherwise, the construction, maintenance or operation of any works the location and mode of construction of which have been approved by the Commission, if the same are being, or have been, constructed in the place and according to the mode which have been so approved.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any litigation now pending in any court, unless otherwise ordered by the court before which such litigation may be pending.\nBy the same statute it was provided that the designation of the Commission created by the Act of 1920 should be altered, and should thereafter be the \"Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities.\"\nThe learned trial judge by his judgment exercising the powers vested in him by sec. 61 (2), ordered that the provisions of the statute should apply to all cases of alleged interference in respect of which relief was asked in the action, provided that an application were made by the appellant municipality within thirty days to the Board for \"approval and allowance of the location and construction\" complained of by the respondent company.\nThe appellant municipality made application to the Board, and accordingly, on the 28th of January, 1925, an order was made by the Board to the effect that the location and mode of construction of the works of the appellant municipality be altered in conformity with the report of Professor Baird, which the Commission had before it, subject to the approval of an inspector, to be appointed by the Board; and, for the purpose of effecting this, the appellant municipality was authorized to affix insulators and other appliances to the poles of the New Brunswick Power Company, and to attach the wires of the municipality to the said insulators or other appliances.\nThe respondent company having appealed to the Court of Appeal, it was held by that court that the learned trial judge had improperly exercised the authority conferred by subsection (2) of section 61. The court accordingly reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge, granted the injunction prayed, and directed a reference as to damages. The reasons for judgment were delivered by Mr. Justice Crockett, and the view taken appears to have been that the legislature had expressed its intention that the statute should not apply to any litigation then pending in any court, and that the authority under which the learned trial judge acted was an authority \"to reverse at its will\" this \"clearly expressed intention.\"\nThe legislature appears to have left it to the court before which the litigation might be pending to determine whether or not the statute should apply to matters in dispute in that litigation\u2014that is to say, whether, in such matters, the Board should have jurisdiction. The legislature did not express its intention that the statute should not apply to such matters, and left the whole matter to the court, but did not, in express language at all events, indicate any rule or principle by which the court was to be guided.\nThe first subsection of section 59 leaves no room for doubt that the situation which has given rise to the present litigation is precisely the kind of situation in which the Act was intended to operate. Had there been no litigation pending between the parties, there could have been no manner of doubt as to the authority of the Board to approve, under such conditions as it might see fit to prescribe, of the \"location and mode of construction\" of the appellant municipality's works; or that, the directions of the Board being observed in respect of the construction, maintenance and operation of those works, no liability would be incurred by the appellant municipality thereunder in respect of anything done thereafter, in compliance with the orders of the Board. It is equally clear, also, that the jurisdiction of the Board is an exclusive jurisdiction, and that neither the Board nor the parties to any proceedings authorized by the statute are subject in respect of such proceedings to any control by any court.\nThe proper view of the statute would appear to be that, in the absence of some such provision as subsection (2) of section 61, the existence of pending litigation would not affect the authority of the Board as to future acts. Due effect can be given to the enactment without allowing it to create immunity from damages sustained before the approval of the works, and it ought not to be construed retrospectively beyond the limit to which the language of it necessarily extends. See per Bowen L.J., in Reid v. Reid[1]. As to future acts, the subsection mentioned appears rightly to have been considered necessary in order to qualify the rigour of the other provisions of the statute, and the order of the learned trial judge appears to have been consonant with the general policy of the Act.\nThe Court of Appeal seems rightly to have held that this authority with which the Supreme Court was invested, to determine the applicability or non-applicability of the statute, was, in its nature, a delegated legislative authority; and there is much to be said for the view that the character of the authority itself gives rise to a presumption that the exercise of it was not to be open to review. It is not necessary to decide that question. The order of the learned trial judge seems in the whole to have been the proper order. The Board is much better equipped than any court of law to do complete justice to all parties concerned; and the learned trial judge rightly assumed that the rights of the respondent company would be protected and its legitimate interests not overlooked by the Board.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal, in so far as it directs a reference as to damages, and as to costs, should not be disturbed, but in other respects the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, but modified as to costs in the manner now to be mentioned.\nIn the very special circumstances of this case the appellant municipality should have no costs of this appeal, and should pay all the costs of the action down to and including the trial.\nOur intention has been called to a statute of the New Brunswick Legislature passed since the date of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. This is a declaratory Act, and it is unnecessary to consider whether or not its provisions ought to be noticed by this court in deciding upon the questions in controversy on the appeal, and no opinion is expressed upon that point. This is unnecessary, because the purport of the statute is, by legislative declaration, to affirm the decision of the learned trial judge in so far as concerns the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Board.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. B. M. Baxter.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Fred. R. Taylor.\n[1] 31 Ch. D. 402 at pages 408-9.\n"

The last ten monthly payments were to be guaranteed to the bank's satisfaction. This proposal was accepted by the bank and a formal deed of composition was entered into. With the view of fulfilling his obligation, H. obtained the respondent's endorsements to five notes of $500 drawn in favour of the bank and payable on certain dates coinciding with five of the last ten monthly payments, but he was unable to obtain security for the balance of the $10,000. When H. had made only three of the monthly payments, T., acting for the bank apparently not considering H. to be in default, demanded and obtained from H. the transfer of the respondent's notes with a letter hypothecating the notes \"as a general and continuing collateral security for the due payment of all advances made or to be made to\" H by the bank. T., at the time of the transfer, knew that the purpose of the respondent's endorsements was to secure in part the last ten payments under the deed of composition and also knew that H. had failed to obtain security for the balance of the last ten monthly payments.\nHeld that, as T. knew that H. had no right to hypothecate generally the respondent's notes and to convert what was a specific security into a general security, which was a breach of faith towards the respondent, the bank had no right of recovery as not having taken the notes in good faith and therefore not being a holder in due course.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant's action for $2,010.16, amount of four promissory notes endorsed by respondent.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nHague K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and J. C. Lamothe K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench reversing, Greenshields and Guerin JJ. dissentientibus, the judgment of the Superior Court, Archer J., which had maintained the appellant's action.\nThe facts which gave rise to the litigation may be briefly stated.\nIn February, 1921, the commercial firm Hoerner, Williamson & Co., furriers of Montreal, were heavily indebted to The Merchants Bank of Canada, so much so that the bank had decided to force them into liquidation unless they furnished additional security. For that purpose Mr. Thompson, who was in charge of the discount accounts of the bank, and who throughout acted for the bank, sent Mr. Hart, an authorized trustee under the Bankruptcy Act, to see them, and Mr. Hart, finding that they were hopelessly insolvent, and that a forced liquidation would not realize more than a few cents on the dollar, advised the bank not to put them into bankruptcy, but rather to make a composition with them. He then submitted to the bank, through Mr. Thompson, a proposition on behalf of the firm in the form of a letter signed by the latter. This letter made an offer of composition on the basis of fifty cents on the dollar. The firm's indebtedness to the bank was then $74,327.49, and the proposal was that the firm would pay one-half of this sum by instalments of $1,000 monthly, with interest at five per cent, the last ten payments to be guaranteed to the bank's satisfaction. Instead of paying the balance, Hoerner and Williamson were to furnish the bank with life insurance policies for $25,000 each, running for twenty years, the premiums of which they obliged themselves to pay. They were also to hypothecate properties belonging to them in Montreal and Winnipeg, and they agreed that failure on their part to make these payments and to pay the insurance premiums would give the bank the right to demand immediate payment of their full indebtedness. The bank was to continue to discount the approved trade paper of the firm. After some negotiations, the bank accepted this proposition, which was put in the shape of a notarial agreement, dated the 23rd of February, 1921.\nWith the view of fulfilling their obligation to guarantee to the bank's satisfaction the last ten monthly payments of $1,000 each, Hoerner, Williamson & Company obtained the respondent's endorsement to five notes of $500 each, drawn in favour of the bank, and payable respectively on June 12, August 12, September 12, November 12, 1923, and January 12, 1924, the due date of which coincided with five of these last ten monthly payments. Notwithstanding their efforts, however, Hoerner, Williamson & Company were unable to obtain further endorsements, so that to the extent of $7,500 these last ten payments were never guaranteed. Of the fact that the respondent had endorsed these five notes to carry out the undertaking of Hoerner, Williamson & Company to guarantee to the bank's satisfaction the last ten monthly payments, as well as of the inability of the firm to obtain security for the balance of these payments, the bank was fully advised.\nWhen the respondent endorsed these five notes, he stipulated with Hoerner, Williamson & Company that they would not use his endorsement or hand over the notes to the bank unless and until they had obtained security or endorsement from other parties for the balance of the last ten monthly payments. The learned trial judge found that the bank had no knowledge of this condition.\nHoerner, Williamson & Company made only three of the monthly payments, and apparently they were not considered by the bank to be in default when, on June 15, 1921, after several demands, the bank obtained from the firm the transfer of the notes which the respondent had endorsed. These notes were transferred to the bank by a letter of hypothecation signed by the firm, which hypothecated the notes,\nas a general and continuing collateral security for the due payment of all advances made or to be made to us (the firm) by the said bank (and all legal expenses incurred by the said bank in relation to our account or advance), and to be realized by them in such manner as may seem to them advisable in the event of any default in the payment of said advance.\nIn May, 1922, Hoerner, Williamson & Company went into bankruptcy, being still heavily indebted to the bank. The appellant having acquired all the assets, subject to liabilities, of the Merchants Bank, brought action against the respondent claiming payment of four of these notes, which had then matured. At the hearing in this court, the appellant's counsel admitted that the appellant was not in a better position to demand payment of the notes than the Merchants Bank would have been, so that the right of action, if any, of the latter is the sole subject of the controversy.\nThe question to be determined, briefly stated, is therefore whether the Merchants Bank under these circumstances could claim payment from the respondent of the notes endorsed by him.\nThe evidence does not show that the bank was aware of the condition stipulated by the respondent that the notes endorsed by him would not be handed over to the bank until Hoerner, Williamson & Company had succeeded in having the balance of the last ten monthly payments fully guaranteed by other endorsers. On the other hand, it appears clear that in handing these notes to the bank on its demand, and more particularly in transferring them as a general and continuing collateral security for all advances made or to be made by the bank, Hoerner, Williamson & Company were guilty of a breach of faith towards the respondent. There is no doubt that Thompson knew that the respondent had endorsed these notes in order to guarantee, pro tanto, the last ten payments. He so admits.\nAs above stated, the learned trial judge, finding that the bank had no notice of the condition stipulated by the respondent when he endorsed the notes, gave judgment in favour of the appellant. This judgment was set aside by the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench on the ground that Hoerner, Williamson & Company, in handing over the notes to the bank, had violated the promise they had made to the respondent, and had committed a breach of faith. They also held that the negotiation of the notes as a collateral security was a defective negotiation, entach\u00e9e d'un vice, with the consequence that it was incumbent on the bank to show that it was a holder in due course, to wit, that it had taken these notes for value, in good faith, and in ignorance of the defect in Hoerner, Williamson & Company's title. The learned judges relied on sections 56, 58 and 74 of the Bills of Exchange Act.\nThe learned trial judge and, I think, the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench, were concerned chiefly with the question whether the bank had sufficient notice of the condition stipulated by the respondent that the notes endorsed by him would not be handed over to the bank unless and until Hoerner, Williamson & Company had completed the securing of the last ten payments.\nIt was for the respondent to prove this, and, as I read the evidence, there is nothing to show that Thompson was aware of this condition. He did know that Normandin had endorsed these notes as part of the security for the last ten payments, but, while both Hoerner and Williamson state that they informed Thompson (and he admits that he knew) that the endorsement was in partial fulfilment of their undertaking to secure the last ten payments, they do not pretend that they mentioned the special condition alleged by the respondent, and which they state they agreed to. So far, therefore, as this condition is concerned, and although the negotiation of the notes was a breach of this condition, the position of the bank has not been successfully assailed. On the other hand, Thompson knew that the purpose of the respondent's endorsement was to secure, in part, the last ten payments to be made under the deed of composition, but he took the notes under a letter of hypothecation, hypothecating them as a general and continuing collateral security for the due payment of all advances made or to be made to Hoerner, Williamson & Company. This would entitle the bank, in case the latter made these last ten payments, to retain the notes for any other advances made by it. Thompson knew that Hoerner, Williamson and Company had no right to thus hypothecate these notes, and he knew that converting what was a specific security into a general security was a breach of faith towards the respondent. It is true that the deed of composition was made for the whole indebtedness of the bank and that the last ten payments were a part of this indebtedness. But, as I have said, the letter of hypothecation goes much further than this. As effected, the transfer of these notes to the bank was to Thompson's knowledge made without right by the debtors of the bank.\nUnder these circumstances and for this reason I think the judgment appealed from can be sustained. It is quite an elementary proposition that a person who takes notes must, to be a holder in due course, take them in good faith. As stated by Lord Herschell in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[1],\nregard to the facts of which the taker of such instruments had notice is most material in considering whether he took in good faith. If there be anything which excites the suspicion that there is something wrong in the transaction, the taker of the instrument is not acting in good faith if he shuts his eyes to the facts presented to him and puts the suspicions aside without further enquiry.\nHere it was not merely a question of suspicion but of knowledge that Hoerner, Williamson & Company had no right to convert this specific security into a general security. Under all these circumstances the bank was not a holder in good faith and in due course, and has no right of recovery.\nNo argument was addressed to us on the point whether the bank, being the payee of these notes, could be considered as a holder in due course, and it is not intended to express any opinion on the abstract question. It suffices to hold that the bank did not take the notes in good faith and this of course is conclusive against it whether it be regarded as a holder of the notes or as a creditor under a contract of suretyship.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lamothe, Gadbois & Charbonneau.\n[1] [1892] A.C. 201 at p. 221.\n"

Racine, [1925] S.C.R. 593\nDate: 1925-10-06\nColumbia Gramophone Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nA. Racine (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1925: June 8; 1925: October 6.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault and Newcombe JJ. and Tessier J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSheriff's sale\u2014Lease\u2014Effect\u2014Transfer of the lease to the buyer\u2014Right of the lessee to abandon premises. Art. 781 C.C.P. Arts. 1663, 2128 C.C.\nWhere, subsequently to the sheriff's sale of an immovable, the person on whom the property was sold transfers his rights in a lease to the buyer (adjudicataire) and the latter notifies the lessee that he can remain in possession of the immovable, the lessee has no right to abandon the premises and is not discharged from the obligations resulting from the lease.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 38 K.B. 17) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe respondent was the adjudicataire of certain property sold by sheriff's sale. The sale took place on the twelfth day of October, 1923. The appellant was then one of the tenants in occupation of the property sold, under a lease from one dame Jennie Prokassoff. On the 15th October, 1923, dame Jennie Prokassoff before John Mulcair, notary public, assigned and transferred to respondent with subrogation, all her rights in the lease. The deed of transfer was served upon the appellant on the 27th October, 1923. On the 29th October, two days later, the appellant abandoned the leased premises and removed its effects therefrom. The present action was taken by the respondent on the 3rd November, 1923, accompanied by saisie-gagerie par droit de suite to enforce the covenants of the lease. The respondent claimed $20,333.13 from the appellant for rents due and to be due until the full expiration of the lease.\nAngers for the appellant. The sheriff's sale has the effect not only of discharging the property from the lease, but of terminating the lease itself.\nThe transfer of the lease by the lessor to the buyer cannot thus revive it.\nPerron K.C. and Chipman K.C. for the respondent. There is nothing in the law to the effect that a sheriff's sale cancels a lease.\nIn no judgments of our courts has any expression to that effect been necessary to decide the issue; these judgments were substantially based upon the view that there was no lien de droit between the adjudicataire and the occupier in the particular instances, none having arisen from the sheriff's sale, and none having been created by law.\nThe lease and the contractual rights and obligations persist, as well after the sheriff's sale as before, and where, as in the present case, the lessor and the adjudicataire, the person bound to give enjoyment and the person able to give enjoyment, have become one, a complete right of action exists against the tenant, who, not having suffered either a physical or a judicial disturbance, is not entitled to a release from his obligations.\nAngers for the appellant.\nPerron K.C. and Chipman K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014Une question int\u00e9ressante se pr\u00e9sente en cette cause. Le d\u00e9cret met-il fin au bail de telle sorte que malgr\u00e9 que l'adjudicataire ait, depuis la vente judiciaire, obtenu du bailleur une cession de ses droits au bail, et qu'il offre au locataire de le maintenir en la jouissance de l'immeuble lou\u00e9, le locataire puisse abandonner l'immeuble et se lib\u00e9rer des obligations r\u00e9sultant du bail? Je dis que la question se pose ainsi, et il est important de le constater, car en cela cette cause diff\u00e8re essentiellement des arr\u00eats que l'appelant invoque. Ainsi il ne s'agit nullement de d\u00e9terminer si le bail est opposable \u00e0 l'adjudicataire de l'immeuble lou\u00e9. Il pourrait bien ne pas lui \u00eatre opposable sans qu'il s'ensuive qu'il ne peut profiter du bail s'il en a obtenu la cession du locateur et s'il offre au locataire de le maintenir en possession de l'immeuble.\nC'est bien ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans l'esp\u00e8ce. Le 26 mars, 1921, par un bail sous seing priv\u00e9 qui para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9, une dame Jennie Prokassoff louait \u00e0 l'appelante un immeuble rue St-Denis, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, pour cinq ans \u00e0 compter du 1er mai, 1921, \u00e0 raison d'un loyer annuel de $8,000, par versements mensuels de $666.66 chacun, payables d'avance. L'appelante se mit en possession des lieux en vertu de ce bail et en avait la jouissance lorsque l'immeuble fut vendu par le sh\u00e9rif le 12 octobre, 1923, et l'intim\u00e9 s'en porta adjudicataire. Le 15 octobre, 1923, l'intim\u00e9 obtint de dame Prokassoff une cession de ses droits au bail qu'il fit signifier \u00e0 l'appelante le 27 octobre. A la fin d'octobre, l'appelante abandonna l'immeuble, pr\u00e9tendant que le d\u00e9cret avait mis fin au bail. L'intim\u00e9 prit alors une saisie-gagerie par droit de suite contre l'appelant, r\u00e9clamant le loyer \u00e9chu et \u00e0 \u00e9cheoir jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration du bail, tant comme loyer qu'\u00e0 titre de dommages, soit $20,-333.13. La cour sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par l'honorable juge-en-chef suppl\u00e9ant Martin, renvoya l'action, mais sur appel \u00e0 la cour du Banc du Roi l'intim\u00e9 obtint jugement pour $12,333.33. L'appelante nous demande maintenant d'infirmer ce jugement et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nLa seule question discut\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audition est la question de droit que j'ai formul\u00e9e ci-dessus. Je me propose de lui donner la solution qui s'impose, sans avoir la pr\u00e9tention d'ailleurs de trancher d'autres points qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9s en cour d'appel et qui ne sont pas n\u00e9cessaires pour la d\u00e9cision de la cause.\nL'argumentation de l'appelante peut se r\u00e9sumer bri\u00e8vement. Il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 de principe dans l'ancien droit, dit-elle, que le bail prenait fin par le d\u00e9cret de l'immeuble lou\u00e9. Le code civil a innov\u00e9 en adoptant les articles 1663 et 2128 qui ne se r\u00e9f\u00e8rent qu'\u00e0 la vente volontaire. Donc la doctrine de l'ancien droit est toujours rest\u00e9e en vigueur et le bail dont il s'agit n'existe plus.\nIl convient de constater que dans la section VI du Titre du Louage, portant la rubrique Comment se termine le contrat de louage des choses, il n'est nullement question du d\u00e9cret. Cette omission est d\u00e9j\u00e0 significative, si comme l'appelante le pr\u00e9tend, les articles 1663 et 2128 C.C. ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 la vente forc\u00e9e. Mais je ne veux pas fonder mon avis sur une simple omission.\nLaissant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les autres causes de dissolution du bail, comme la perte de la chose, l'expropriation pour cause d'utilit\u00e9 publique, etc., la vente elle-m\u00eame n'est envisag\u00e9e que quant \u00e0 ses effets \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'acheteur. Il s'agit de savoir si apr\u00e8s cette vente le bail est opposable \u00e0 l'acheteur, en d'autres termes, si le locataire peut \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 par lui.\nOn ne peut dire que l'objet des articles 1663 et 2128 C.C.\u2014il faut envisager ce dernier article, qui se trouve au Titre de l'Enregistrement des droits r\u00e9els, avec l'article 1663 C.C., car les deux dispositions se compl\u00e8tent\u2014soit de trancher la question de savoir si la vente met fin au bail. Au contraire, pour prot\u00e9ger le locataire, ces articles maintiennent le bail quand les conditions prescrites se rencontrent, et le rendent opposable au nouveau propri\u00e9taire. Et si ces dispositions ne peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tendues \u00e0 la vente forc\u00e9e, point sur lequel il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de se prononcer, il n'y a aucune disposition au code civil qui mette fin au bail lorsque l'immeuble lou\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par autorit\u00e9 de justice.\nOn invoque l'article 781 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile qui d\u00e9clare que, sauf certaines exceptions qui ne nous int\u00e9ressent pas ici, le d\u00e9cret purge tous les droits r\u00e9els non compris dans les conditions de la vente. Et on dit que si le bail conf\u00e9rait au locataire un droit r\u00e9el, jus in re, dans l'immeuble qui en est l'objet, ce droit serait purg\u00e9 par le d\u00e9cret, s'il n'\u00e9tait pas compris dans les conditions de la vente, et \u00e0 plus forte raison en serait-il de m\u00eame d'un droit purement personnel.\nMais il est clair qu'encore ici il s'agit du droit du locataire d'opposer son bail \u00e0 l'adjudicataire. Et il est bon d'observer que le droit r\u00e9el est purg\u00e9 sans que le contrat qui l'a cr\u00e9\u00e9 prenne n\u00e9cessairement fin. Ainsi, dans le cas de l'hypoth\u00e8que, le contrat subsiste toujours, mais le droit pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel qu'il donne s'exerce non plus sur l'immeuble, mais sur le produit de la vente.\nDonc, en tant qu'il s'agit des textes, on ne peut leur donner une port\u00e9e plus absolue que de rendre le bail inopposable \u00e0 l'adjudicataire. Ces textes ne mettent pas fin au bail en ce qui concerne le lien personnel qu'il cr\u00e9e entre le locateur et le locataire, cela soit dit tout en reconnaissant que si ce dernier ne peut, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9cret, jouir de l'immeuble lou\u00e9, il ne devra plus payer loyer au locateur. Qu'on appelle cela une dissolution du bail, il importe peu, car il ne s'ensuit pas que l'adjudicataire ne peut obtenir du locateur une cession du bail et contraindre le locataire qu'il laisse en jouissance \u00e0 lui en payer le loyer.\nLa jurisprudence que la cour sup\u00e9rieure invoque, sauf peut-\u00eatre un seul arr\u00eat, n'est pas plus concluante en faveur de la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante que les textes. Je la passerai rapidement en revue.\nMcLaren v. Kirkwood[2], d\u00e9cision de juge Papineau. Il s'agissait d'une requ\u00eate par un adjudicataire demandant un bref de possession pour l'expulsion d'un locataire du saisi qui lui disputait la possession de l'immeuble vendu sur d\u00e9cret. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'article 1663 C.C. ne s'applique pas \u00e0 la vente d'un immeuble par le sh\u00e9rif et que le locataire de cet immeuble peut \u00eatre expuls\u00e9, \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'adjudicataire, avant l'expiration de son bail. Donc l'arr\u00eat d\u00e9cide seulement que le bail ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'adjudicataire.\nMowry v. Bowen, cour de revision[3]. Il s'agissait de la demande d'un bref de possession par l'adjudicataire d'un immeuble vendu par le sh\u00e9rif contre le locataire qui lui opposait son bail. Quand les juges disent que le bail prend fin avec le d\u00e9cret, il faut entendre par l\u00e0 qu'il ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'adjudicataire, en d'autres termes qu'il est non avenu \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, car c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce qu'ils avaient \u00e0 juger. Si les expressions dont on s'est servi d\u00e9passent la ratio decidendi, elles ne sont que des obiter dicta.\nStandard Life Insurance Co. v. Lamy[4], Loranger J. Cet arr\u00eat, tel que rapport\u00e9, para\u00eet d\u00e9cider que le bail prend fin par le d\u00e9cret de l'immeuble lou\u00e9, et que partant, \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9cret, la caution du locataire est lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'obligation qu'elle avait assum\u00e9e au bail. Il y avait dans l'esp\u00e8ce all\u00e9gation que le locataire \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 en possession apr\u00e8s la vente du sh\u00e9rif, mais le jugement ne dit pas si cette all\u00e9gation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e. Il est possible qu'on ait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le locataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de la jouissance de l'immeuble. Si cependant cette d\u00e9cision a une port\u00e9e plus absolue, et si elle veut dire que le bail est an\u00e9anti par le d\u00e9cret, m\u00eame lorsque l'adjudicataire adopte ce bail et laisse le locataire en possession, je suis respectueusement d'avis qu'elle est mal fond\u00e9e.\nMcGee v. Larochelle, cour de revision[5]. L'honorable juge-en-chef suppl\u00e9ant ne fait que mentionner cette cause qui ne se prononce pas sur la question en litige, sauf que le juge Casault dit, \u00e0 la page 216, qu'en cas de vente le bail, dans les rapports de l'acqu\u00e9reur avec le locataire, est r\u00e9put\u00e9 n'avoir pas d'existence, ce qui est la v\u00e9ritable doctrine quand les conditions prescrites par les articles 1663 et 2128 C.C. ne se rencontrent pas, et que l'acqu\u00e9reur n'a pas adopt\u00e9 le bail.\nEnfin le juge-en-chef suppl\u00e9ant cite l'opinion de mon regrett\u00e9 coll\u00e8gue, le juge Brodeur, dans St. Charles v. Friedman[6], o\u00f9 le savant juge dit que dans l'ancien droit le contrat de louage \u00e9tait termin\u00e9 par la vente que le propri\u00e9taire faisait de la chose lou\u00e9e. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, il s'agissait de savoir si, apr\u00e8s la vente, l'acqu\u00e9reur pouvait expulser le locataire, ce qui, je l'ai dit plusieurs fois, est une tout autre question.\nJe ne crois donc pas que la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e par le juge-en-chef suppl\u00e9ant nous autoriserait \u00e0 mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le jugement de la cour d'appel.\nL'appelante invoque aussi la doctrine de l'ancien droit qui, suivant elle, est encore applicable lorsqu'il y a eu d\u00e9cret de l'immeuble lou\u00e9. Cependant les auteurs qu'elle cite dans son m\u00e9moire envisagent la question quant au droit du nouveau propri\u00e9taire d'expulser le locataire lorsqu'il n'a pas assum\u00e9 l'obligation de continuer le bail.\nAinsi Domat, \u00e9d. R\u00e9my, tome 1er, p. 208, dit:\nSi le bailleur vend une maison ou un autre h\u00e9ritage qu'il avait lou\u00e9 ou baill\u00e9 \u00e0 ferme, le bail est rompu par ce changement de propri\u00e9taire, et l'acheteur peut user et disposer de la chose comme bon lui semble, si ce n'est que le vendeur l'e\u00fbt oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 entretenir le bail. Mais si l'acheteur expulse le preneur, soit un fermier ou un locataire, le bailleur est tenu des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats que cette interruption du bail aura pu causer.\nC'est toujours la m\u00eame question. Le nouveau propri\u00e9taire peut expulser le locataire s'il ne s'est pas oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 entretenir le bail. Donc dans ce dernier cas le bail continue, et quand le droit d'expulsion existe le locataire a un recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats contre son bailleur, ce qui fait bien voir que le lien du contrat entre le bailleur et le locataire n'est pas rompu.\nDe m\u00eame Pothier, Louage, n\u00b0 101, dit:\nLe conducteur d'un h\u00e9ritage ne peut opposer l'exception de garantie au nouveau propri\u00e9taire qui l'a acquis \u00e0 titre singulier du locateur, si le locateur ne l'a pas charg\u00e9 de l'entretien du bail.\nEt au num\u00e9ro 288 du m\u00eame trait\u00e9, \u00e9galement cit\u00e9 par l'appelante, Pothier dit:\nLe locataire ou fermier n'ayant aucun droit dans l'h\u00e9ritage qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9, si le locateur a vendu ou l\u00e9gu\u00e9 cet h\u00e9ritage \u00e0 quelqu'un, sans le charger de l'entretien du bail qu'il en a fait, cet acheteur, ce l\u00e9gataire, ne seront point oblig\u00e9s de l'entretenir, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne l'aient approuv\u00e9 au moins tacitement.\nOn le voit, au cas o\u00f9 le nouvel acqu\u00e9reur a approuv\u00e9 le bail, Pothier enseigne que les effets de ce bail subsistent entre lui et le locataire. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que la cour d'appel a jug\u00e9 en cette cause.\nEnfin Laurent, tome 25, n\u00b0 19, que l'appelante cite \u00e9galement, parlant de la doctrine de l'ancien droit, dit:\nLe bailleur et le preneur ayant int\u00e9r\u00eat au maintien du bail, quoi de plus naturel que de stipuler dans le contrat de vente que l'acqu\u00e9reur sera tenu de respecter le droit du preneur? La loi Emptorem indiquait elle-m\u00eame cette voie aux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es: Imposez cette obligation \u00e0 l'acheteur, dit-elle, et le bail sera maintenu.\nOn le voit, l'ancien droit, dans un cas comme celui-ci, reconnaissait que le bail subsistait malgr\u00e9 la vente. En tout cela, il n'est question que du droit d'expulsion qui appartient \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur quand il ne s'est pas engag\u00e9 \u00e0 entretenir le bail. Ce serait d\u00e9naturer la pens\u00e9e de ces auteurs que de dire que le lien personnel entre le locateur et le locataire est rompu par la vente, soit volontaire, soit judiciaire.\nL'honorable juge-en-chef suppl\u00e9ant dit:\u2014\nI cannot imagine that the law can be construed as being so arbitrary and one-sided as to hold that the lease is at an end by reason of the sheriff's sale only at the option and pleasure of the adjudicataire and that, if he so elects, he can hold the lessee to the terms of the original lease, or, if he otherwise elects, he can expel him from the leased premises. Qu'il me soit permis d'opposer un respectueux non sequitur \u00e0 cette objection. Le nouveau propri\u00e9taire n'est pas partie au contrat intervenu entre le bailleur et le locataire. Il peut donc \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 m\u00e9conna\u00eetre ce contrat. Mais il peut \u00e9galement, s'il le veut, approuver le bail, et alors, dit Pothier, il est oblig\u00e9 de l'entretenir. Tout cela est ce qu'il y a de plus naturel et de plus juridique.\nJ'ajoute qu'il n'est pas rare, m\u00eame lorsqu'il s'agit des droits respectifs des parties \u00e0 un m\u00eame contrat, que l'une d'elles ait une action en rescision qui n'appartient pas \u00e0 l'autre. Voy. l'art. 987 C.C. Toute la th\u00e9orie des nullit\u00e9s relatives est bas\u00e9e sur cette distinction.\nJe conclus donc que dans l'esp\u00e8ce l'intim\u00e9 ayant obtenu la cession des droits du bailleur, et ayant assum\u00e9 l'obligation d'entretenir le bail, l'appelante ne pouvait, par son abandon des lieux, \u00e9chapper \u00e0 l'obligation de payer le loyer pendant la dur\u00e9e du bail.\nL'appel est mal fond\u00e9 et doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Monty, Duranleau, Ross & Angers.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] [1924] Q.R. 38 K.B. 17.\n[2] [1881] 25 L.C.J. 107.\n[3] [1884] M.L.R. 3 S.C. 417.\n[4] [1901] 7 R. de J. 320.\n[5] [1891] 17 Q.L.R. 212.\n[6] [1914] 62 Can.

Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., [1925] S.C.R. 600\nDate: 1925-10-06\nDame Mabel Kiernan (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company (Defendant) Respondent.\n1925: June 1, 2; 1925: Oct. 6.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nInsurance, Life\u2014Application\u2014Statements by insured\u2014Non-disclosure\u2014Materiality\u2014Application attached to the policy\u2014Arts. 7027 and 7028, ss. 1, 2 R.S.Q.\u2014Arts. 992, 2485, 2487, 2489 C.C.\nThe late Dr. Bourgeois, the appellant's husband, was insured with the respondent company for $20,460 upon two policies applied for on the 29th November, 1918. He was operated on for cancer of the throat in March, 1919, and died of it on the 22nd December, 1919. His widow sued to enforce the policies. The respondent contested her claim on grounds of concealment and misrepresentation by the assured. Dr. Bourgeois suffered from early in 1918 from persistent laryngitis accompanied by hoarseness and, at times, extinction of voice. He visited three doctors who were his friends. He was given treatments with nitrate of silver by one of these doctors upon the advice of another of them. In question 2 of part B of the application for insurance, the insured was required to answer whether he had ever suffered from any of some 47 specified complaints, one of them being \"debilitation de la voix,\" although no mention was made of laryngitis. To this question, he answered \"No.\" By question 8, the applicant was asked : Have you had any other complaint than that already mentioned? and he also answered \"No.\" By question 4, he was asked to give the name and address of his regular (habituel) doctor and he answered \"none.\" By question 9, he was asked;\/?\/ Have you consulted or have you been attended by any other doctor than the one above mentioned? If yes, when and what for? To this question, he replied with a dash.\nHeld that, in the circumstances of this case, the laryngitis, the extinction of voice and the hoarseness from which the insured was suffering, his visits to different doctors and his treatments with nitrate of silver were material facts which the insured was bound to disclose. Mignault and Rinfret JJ. dissenting.\nHeld, also, that, not only would disclosure of the facts so concealed have prevented the undertaking of the risk, but their suppression, however innocent, having regard to the questions propounded to the applicant, constituted misrepresentation which actually induced the insurer to enter into the contract. Mignault and Rinfret JJ. dissenting.\nA photographic copy of the application, which contained the answers made by the insured and which was declared to form part of the contract had been attached by glue or paste to one of the inside pages of each of the policies sued upon.\nHeld that such attachment is a substantial compliance with the statutory requirement contained in s.s. 1 of art. 7028 R.S.Q. which enacts that all the terms or conditions of a contract of insurance shall be set forth in full on the face or back of the policy. Mignault and Rinfret JJ. expressing no opinion.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, at Three Rivers and dismissing the appellant's action to recover amounts of two policies of insurance issued by the respondent company on the life of appellant's husband.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLaflamme K.C. for the appellant.\nClaxton K.C. and St. Laurent K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff and Newcombe JJ.) was delivered by Anglin C.J.C.\u2014The late Dr. Bourgeois was insured with the defendant-respondent company for $20,460 upon two policies applied for on the 29th of November, 1918, and issued on the 11th of December, 1918. He died of cancer of the throat on the 22nd of December, 1919. His widow sues to enforce these policies. Her claim is contested on grounds of misrepresentation and concealment by the assured:\u2014(a) as to a prior application for insurance with the Canada Life Assurance Co., upon which a policy did not issue; (b) as to his health and medical history; and (c) as to previous medical attendance.\nThat these misrepresentations were of a fraudulent nature was averred. The charge of fraud, however, unanimously rejected in the provincial courts, was not pressed at bar. We find it unnecessary further to consider it.\nIf there was a prior application or proposal for insurance to the Canada Life Assurance Co., within the meaning of the questions put to the insured, the learned Chief Justice of Quebec was of the opinion that any misrepresentation or concealment in this connection was of such minor importance that it may be disregarded. In the view we take as to the other misrepresentations or concealments charged and their effect, we find it unnecessary to deal with this aspect of the case.\nThe question for decision may, therefore, be stated in these terms: Was there any misrepresentation, or concealment, by the insured in regard to his health, medical history or previous medical attendance, which, though made merely in error, was of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk and operated to induce the insurer to enter into the contract?\nThe misrepresentations or concealments relied upon are answers to questions contained in the declaration made by the appellant's husband on his medical examination, which is designated as Part B of the application for insurance. A photographic copy of the application, including this declaration, is attached by glue or paste to one of the inside pages of each of the policies sued upon. At the foot of Part B and immediately above the signature of the insured, is the following clause:\nEn outre, il est convenu et consenti que les d\u00e9clarations et les r\u00e9ponses qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent ainsi que les r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es an m\u00e9decin examinateur sont rigoureusement correctes et enti\u00e8rement vraies et qu'elles serviront de base du contrat d'assurance si une police est \u00e9mise.\nThe policy itself contains on its second page the following provision :\nCette police et l'application en constituent le contrat complet entre les parties * * * Toutes d\u00e9clarations faites par l'assur\u00e9, en l'absence de fraude, seront consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des repr\u00e9sentations et non pas comme garanties et telle d\u00e9claration n'annulera cette police ni ne servira de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation en vertu de cette police, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne se trouve dans l'application \u00e9crite dont copie est ci jointe parfaitement coll\u00e9e pour en faire partie, lors de l'\u00e9mission.\nArt. 7027 R.S.Q. directs that contracts of insurance\nshall be construed according to the law of the province.\nSubsection 2 of Art. 7028 R.S.Q. enacts that\nnothing contained in this article shall exclude the proposal or application of the assured from being considered with the contract.\nIn our opinion, if the application of the assured be not excluded from its operation by this provision, the attachment of a photographic copy of it to the policy is a sufficient compliance with s.s. 1 of Art. 7028 R.S.Q., which makes it a condition of their validity and admissibility in evidence against the insured that all the terms or conditions of any contract of insurance evidenced by a written instrument shall be set forth on the face or back of such instrument. There was substantial compliance with this statutory requirement. But, if not, s.s. 2 would seem to preclude its application to statements made in the proposal or application of the insured. While such statements cannot in this case be regarded as warranties, they must be \"considered with the contract\" as representations of the insured contained in a document which the parties have agreed shall form an integral part of that contract.\nSubsection 2 of Art. 7028 R.S.Q. further provides:\nand the court shall determine Low far the insurer was induced to enter into the contract by any misrepresentations contained in the said application or proposal.\nWith the foregoing statutory provisions must be read Arts. 992, 2485, 2487, and 2489 of the Civil Code, which are as follows:\n992. Error is a cause of nullity only when it occurs in the nature of the contract itself, or in the substance of the thing which is the object of the contract, or in some thing which is a principal consideration for making it.\n2485. The insured is obliged to represent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact which shows the nature and extent of the risk, and which may prevent the undertaking of it, or affect the rate of premium.\n2487. Misrepresentation or concealment, either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a cause of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed.\n2489. The obligation of the insured with respect to representation is satisfied when the fact is substantially as represented and there is no material concealment.\nSuch appear to be the relevant provisions of the Quebec law upon the interpretation and application of which the disposition of this action depends. (Art. 7027 R.S.Q.)\nThe insurance was applied for on the 29th of November, 1918. In the spring of that year Dr. Bourgeois had developed a condition of laryngitis which produced marked hoarseness and, at times, extinction of voice. His wife testifies that owing to hoarseness he was unable to deliver a lecture early in 1918. In May he told his friend Dr. Dupont that he had suffered from extinction of voice while on a fishing trip to Lake Masketsy. His wife says that his hoarseness continued at intervals throughout that summer and autumn.\nIn June, Dr. MacTaggart, medical examiner for the Canada Life Assurance Co., met Dr. Bourgeois in the University Club, in Montreal, of which both were members, and then found him \"remarkably hoarse.\" Being told by Dr. Bourgeois that he would shortly call upon him for medical examination in connection with an application for insurance in the Canada Life, Dr. MacTaggart advised him not to present himself for such examination until his laryngitis had disappeared.\nDr. Dupont met Dr. Bourgeois about this time en route to New York and says \"il avait alors cette extinction de voix.\" Dr. Dupont again saw him in July in Montreal when, he says, \"il avait une extinction de voix,\" and he then advised him \"de ne plus fumer.\"\nDr. Lasalle, a throat specialist in Montreal, and a friend of Dr. Bourgeois, examined his throat early in June. He ordered him not to smoke and to refrain from talking. Dr. Bourgeois then complained of laryngitis. Dr. Lasalle appears to have seen him again later in June, or early in July, and found his condition much the same. He again saw the insured in September. On this occasion he once more examined his throat, renewed his advice against smoking and talking and recommended treatments with a solution of nitrate of silver to be administered with a stylet by a throat specialist, Dr. Panneton of Three Rivers. Dr. Lasalle says that on each occasion when he saw Dr. Bourgeois \"il avait la voix enrou\u00e9e.\" Dr. Panneton, also a friend of the deceased, tells of having treated his throat with a solution of nitrate of silver several times during the summer and autumn of 1918 at irregular intervals. During this period Dr. Panneton made no examination of the insured's throat, understanding that he was merely carrying out treatment prescribed for Dr. Bourgeois by Dr. Lasalle. Late in the autumn, or about the beginning of the winter, however, Dr. Panneton did examine Dr. Bourgeois' throat. He found it in bad condition with a considerable growth on one of the vocal chords. It presented a very serious aspect. He advised that the treatments with a solution of nitrate of silver be discontinued as useless and that there should be a serious examination of Dr. Bourgeois' throat by another doctor. Dr. Panneton says that the condition of the insured's throat had not at all improved under the treatment he had administered. Unfortunately Dr. Panneton is very indefinite as to the date when he made the examination which disclosed the serious condition which he describes. The further examination which he then recommended was deferred by Dr. Bourgeois for \"plusieurs semaines.\" It took place late in February, or early in March, and disclosed a cancer of the larynx so well developed that an immediate operation was ordered. Of the seriousness of the condition which Dr. Panneton's examination had revealed he leaves no doubt. He adds that it could not have arisen in one night, or one week\u2014it might have taken either weeks or months of development to reach the stage at which he found it.\nDr. Hamilton, a throat specialist of 28 years' experience and a lecturer at McGill University, tells us that treatment with nitrate of silver is not usual in cases of acute or simple laryngitis, that it is one of the strong solutions used\nin cases of long duration that resist everything else.\nHe says a tumorous condition of the larynx is frequently mistakenly diagnosed as a mere laryngitis; that hoarseness may be the only symptom for months. He inclines to the view that the cancerous condition of Dr. Bourgeois' throat had been incipient before May, 1918. Dr. Cross, a partner of Dr. Bourgeois, says that no medical examiner allows a detail such as the possibility of cancer in a case of hoarseness to escape his notice, and that obstinate hoarseness is the most terrible symptom of a cancer of the throat. He concedes the wisdom of the Home Office, or a Medical Board, in suspending an applicant for insurance who has laryngitis.\nThe evidence leaves no doubt that from early in 1918 Dr. Bourgeois constantly suffered from a serious laryngitis accompanied by a marked hoarseness and, at times, by an extinction of voice; a laryngitis so persistent that it did not yield to treatment, but, on the contrary, led Dr. Panneton, who had considered it his duty merely to carry out the treatment recommended by Dr. Lasalle, eventually to make an independent examination which disclosed the existence of a condition of some standing which, on further examination, proved to be cancerous.\nIt is perhaps not sufficiently proven that this cancerous condition actually existed on the 29th of November, 1918, although, personally, I think the proper inference from the evidence would be that it did. But, in the view we take, it is not necessary to proceed on this footing (Art. 2487 C.C.) and we treat that fact as not established.\nIn question 2 of Part B of the application, the insured was required to answer whether he had ever suffered from any of some 47 specified complaints, one of them being \"d\u00e9bilitation de la voix.\" To this question he answered: \"Non.\" The evidence establishes beyond question that he suffered for some time previous to his examination from continued hoarseness accompanied at intervals with extinction of the voice. While laryngitis was not one of the complaints specified in question no. 2, by question no. 8 the applicant was asked: \"Avez-vous eu d'autre maladie que celle ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e?\" To this question he also answered: \"Non.\" By question no. 4 he was asked to give the name and address of his regular (habituel) doctor, to which he answered, no doubt truthfully: \"Aucun.\" But, by the 9th question, he was asked:\nAvez-vous consult\u00e9 ou avez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9 soign\u00e9 par un autre m\u00e9decin que celui mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus? Si oui, quand et pourquoi?\nTo this question he replied with a dash (\u2014\u2014). While it is true that Drs. Dupont, Lasalle and Panneton seem to have regarded Dr. Bourgeois' visits rather as those of a friend than as those of a patient, while they made no entry of any charge against him and kept no record of consultations or treatments, since Dr. Bourgeois was a friend and fellow-practitioner of these physicians we find nothing in these circumstances to justify his failure to disclose the facts above detailed in answer to the questions propounded in part B of his application for insurance.\nIn our opinion the persistent laryngitis, the recurrent extinction of voice, the constant hoarseness from which Dr. Bourgeois suffered, his visits to Drs. Dupont and Lasalle and his treatments by Dr. Panneton with nitrate of silver on the advice of Dr. Lasalle, were matters which the insured was bound to disclose. They were facts which bore upon the nature and extent of the risk to be undertaken by the insurer; their concealment tended to diminish the appreciation of that risk. The facts were not substantially as represented; the suppression amounted to material concealment. (Arts. 2485, 2487, 2489 C.C.) The result was error on the part of the insurer in regard to something which was a principal consideration for making the contract. (Art. 992 C.C.) The importance from the insurer's point of view of the disclosure of any laryngitis from which the applicant for insurance is suffering, or has recently suffered, admits of no doubt, so often is it the forerunner, a premonitory symptom or danger signal, of serious, if not fatal, throat affection. The testimony of Drs. MacTaggart, Thompson, Coolidge, Ricard, Hamilton, Cross and Lasalle, puts this beyond question; and their evidence is uncontroverted.\nThat there was material concealment\u2014that it was of facts of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk\u2014that not only would disclosure of the facts so concealed have prevented the undertaking of the risk, but that their suppression, however innocent, having regard to the questions propounded to the applicant on his medical examination, constituted misrepresentation which actually induced the insurer to enter into the contract, are conclusions which, we think, do not admit of serious controversy. Had the facts been disclosed, they must have led the company's officers as reasonable men to reject the risk, or at least to withhold the issue of the policies until the doubts as to the seriousness of the throat condition of Dr. Bourgeois, which knowledge of his persistent and continued laryngitis must have created, should have been entirely dispelled.\nFor these reasons we are of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of King's Bench dismissing this action was right and should be maintained.\nThe judgment of the dissenting judges (Mignault and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, reversing, with two dissenting judges, the decision of the trial judge in an action taken by the appellant, the widow and universal legatee of the late Dr. Georges Bourgeois, in his lifetime physician and surgeon of Three Rivers, Que., against the respondent, a life insurance company, to recover $20,460, the amount of two insurance policies on the life of her husband. In its plea, the respondent disputed its liability on the ground of false representations and false answers to questions put to Dr. Bourgeois at his medical examination, which took place on the 29th of November, 1918. It also alleged fraud and intent to deceive on the part of the deceased, but at the hearing its counsel frankly admitted that he could not contend under the evidence that Dr. Bourgeois had been guilty of any such fraud or intent to deceive. This is moreover entirely in accord with the finding of the learned trial judge and with the opinion expressed by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec in concurring in the judgment appealed from. The liability of the respondent must therefore depend on the reply to be made to the question whether these contracts of insurance were induced by misrepresentations in the answers given by the deceased at his medical examination, assuming these answers to have been made in good faith.\nAt the outset, the provisions of article 7028 of the Quebec Revised Statutes should be considered. This article, which apparently was overlooked in the courts below, is in paragraph 18 of chapter III of title XI of the Revised Statutes, which paragraph contains general provisions applicable to all companies or associations. It reads as follows:\u2014\n7028. 1. Where an insurance contract made by any company or association, is evidenced by a written instrument, the company or association shall set out all the terms or conditions of the contract in full on the face or back of the instrument forming or evidencing the contract, and, unless so set out, no term or condition, stipulation or proviso modifying or impairing the effect of any such con-tract made or renewed after the tenth day of February, 1909, shall be good and valid or admissible in evidence to the prejudice of the assured or beneficiary.\n2. Nothing contained in this article shall exclude the proposal or application of the assured from being considered with the contract, and the court shall determine how far the insurer was induced to enter into the contract by any misrepresentation contained in the said application or proposal.\n3. A mutual benefit or charitable association may, however, instead of setting out the complete contract in the certificate or other instrument of contract, indicate therein, by particular references, those articles or provisions of the constitution, by-laws or rules which contain all the material terms of the contract not inserted in the instrument of contract itself, and the association shall, at or before the delivery over of such instrument of contract, deliver also to the assured a copy of the constitution, by-laws and rules therein referred to.\nUnder the first paragraph of article 7028, no term or condition modifying the contract or impairing its effect can be invoked against the insured or beneficiary unless it be set out on the face or back of the instrument evidencing the contract. This rather sweeping enactment must however be read with the second paragraph of Art. 7028, which requires the court to consider the proposal or application of the insured with the contract in order to determine\nhow far the insurer was induced to enter into the contract by any misrepresentation contained in the said application or proposal.\nIn this case, fraud being eliminated, there remains only the fact that it is alleged that Dr. Bourgeois gave false answers to certain questions put to him at his medical examination, due regard being had of course to the test of materiality just quoted from the statute.\nI will state the pertinent facts with all possible brevity.\nDr. Bourgeois was a physician and surgeon in very active practice in Three Rivers where he had established a private hospital to which he was, at the time of the insurance, adding a new wing. In the month of May, 1918, he contracted a cold at a fishing excursion, and in June was suffering from what has been described as acute laryngitis, or catarrhal laryngitis. In June, he came to Montreal and met one of his friends, Dr. MacTaggart, at the University Club. Dr. MacTaggart was an examiner for the Canada Life Assurance, and it appears that Dr. Bourgeois spoke to him about an insurance on his life for $10,000 which he contemplated taking in that company. Dr. MacTaggart relates the incident as follows:\u2014 I was sitting in the club. Dr. Bourgeois came in, came over and sat down, and began to chat with me. Afterwards he said: \"I want to come up for examination before you for life insurance.\" I remarked at the time that he was very hoarse, suffering evidently from laryngitis, and I told him. I asked him first of all: \"What is the matter with your throat?\" And he replied he had an attack of laryngitis. I told him to postpone that examination until the laryngitis disappeared.\nQ. Did he ever call upon you again? Answer: No.\nElsewhere he says that he gathered from the statement made by Dr. Bourgeois that he had just an ordinary attack of laryngitis.\nIt was probably during this visit to Montreal\u2014he was then leaving for New York with his wife on an automobile trip\u2014that Dr. Bourgeois went to see Dr. Albert Lasalle, one of his intimate friends. Dr. Lasalle says that Dr. Bourgeois complained of hoarseness and of acute laryngitis, and he thinks he examined his throat with a small mirror. He advised him not to smoke (he was a cigarette smoker) and not to talk. His diagnostic was \"une laryngite catarrhale aigu\u00eb,\" and not chronic laryngitis. He says he discovered no symptom which could indicate the presence or approach of any serious disease (affection grave). He saw Dr. Bourgeois again on his return from New York, found his condition about the same, and advised him, when at home, to have his throat treated with a solution of nitrate of silver by one of his friends, Dr. Panneton, of Three Rivers. He states that Dr. Bourgeois' general condition of health was good.\nIn July, 1918, Dr. Bourgeois visited in Montreal another of his intimate friends, Dr. Georges Dupont, who found that he had \"une extinction de voix.\" He advised him not to smoke, but made no examination of his throat. Dr. Bourgeois appears to have called on both Dr. Lasalle and Dr. Dupont as friends, rather than as medical advisers, and probably considered that he had not been treated medically by them. I may add that in January, 1919, Dr. Dupont examined Dr. Bourgeois' blood, and he states that the result was negative.\nDr. Lasalle, as I have just said, advised Dr. Bourgeois, on his return to Three Rivers, to have another of his medical friends, Dr. Panneton, a specialist in throat diseases, treat his throat with nitrate of silver. Dr. Bourgeois followed this advice and Dr. Panneton says that, during the summer, he administered this remedy merely as a friend and not as a medical adviser. His testimony as to the condition in which Dr. Bourgeois then was is extremely vague. He says he did not examine his throat at that time; he merely acted upon what Dr. Bourgeois told him as to Dr. Lasalle's diagnosis, that it was \"une l\u00e9g\u00e8re laryngite.\" Elsewhere he states:\nJe me suis d\u00e9fendu d'y penser, d'autant plus qu'un confrere de plus d'exp\u00e9rience que moi avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 examine le docteur.\nThere is evidently but little assistance to be derived from this testimony with respect to Dr. Bourgeois' condition during the summer months.\nAnother statement of Dr. Panneton's must however be noted. He examined Dr. Bourgeois' throat at a later period, and he says: \"J'ai constat\u00e9 que sa gorge n'\u00e9tait pas en bon \u00e9tat.\" He adds elsewhere:\nce qui m'a fait peur, c'est qu'il y avait une masse sur une des cordes vocales qui pr\u00e9sentait un aspect tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux.\nIf the date of this examination could be fixed, it would have a very important bearing on the qusetion we have to decide, but Dr. Panneton cannot state when it occurred. He says\n\u00e0 l'automne, peut-\u00eatre au commencement de l'hiver, tr\u00e8s tard dans la neige,\nand then adds: \"je ne me rappelle pas la date du tout.\" In cross-examination, he hazards the statement: \"\u00e7a devait \u00eatre dans les environs du Jour de l'An\": \"je me rappelle de cela que c'\u00e9tait en hiver.\"\nHe advised Dr. Bourgeois to have his throat examined by another physician,\nun m\u00e9decin qui le verrait non pas comme un ami, comme je l'ai vu toujours, mais qui le verrait s\u00e9rieusement.\nDr. Bourgeois followed this advice and, in February or March 1919, went to Montreal and had his throat examined by Dr. Lasalle and by Dr. Roy at the H\u00f4tel-Dieu. It was then that a malignant tumour of an apparently cancerous character was first discovered. This was two or three months after the medical examination in connection with this insurance.\nThe rest of the story can be briefly told. Dr. Lasalle accompanied Dr. Bourgeois to New York in March, 1919, when an operation was performed by a specialist and the tumour removed. Nothing much is said of the following months. Evidently the cancerous growth returned, for Dr. Bourgeois died of cancer in the larynx on the 22nd of December, 1919. The medical evidence seems to show that this tumour was of very rapid growth, but it is not established that it existed at the time of the application for insurance.\nThe respondent bases its defence on certain answers made by Dr. Bourgeois in the application for insurance and the medical examination. It is to be observed that the application is divided into three parts:\u20141. The application proper called \"partie A\"; the medical examination proper, termed \"partie B\"; and the report of the medical examiner, or \"partie C\". The answers in the first two parts are in Dr. Bourgeois' handwriting. The blanks in part C are filled in by the medical examiner, Dr. Godin.\nThe respondent complains of the following answers to questions 15 and 16 of part A:\u2014\nQuestion 15. Avez-vous jamais postul\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune compagnie, ordre ou association sans recevoir le montant, ou le plan de l'assurance demand\u00e9e, ou \u00e0 voire \u00e2ge veritable ou aux primes correspondantes?\nThe answer is \"non.\"\nThen follow certain headings:\u2014\nCompagnie, ordre ou association, De quelle mani\u00e8re diff\u00e8re-t-elle de la police demand\u00e9e. Refus\u00e9 ou ajourn\u00e9. Si vous n'avez pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9, dites-le.\nUnder the first heading, Dr. Bourgeois wrote \"Aucune.\" There is nothing under the other headings.\nQuestion 16. Avez-vous jamais fait application ou n\u00e9goci\u00e9, sign\u00e9 une application ou subi un examen medical pour l'assurance \u00e0 quelque compagnie, ordre ou association, autres que celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9es dans les r\u00e9ponses? Si oui, donnez des details.\nThe answer is \"non.\"\nThe respondent also complains of the following answers in part B:\nQuestion 2. Avez-vous jamais souffert de: (R\u00e9pondez oui ou non pour chaque maladie, n'employez pas la marque \"ditto\" (sic).\nThen follows a list of forty-seven diseases, opposite each of which Dr. Bourgeois wrote \"non.\" It is significant that among them there is no mention of laryngitis, either acute or chronic. The last of all is \"debilitation de la voix, de l'ouie ou de la vue,\" whatever that may signify. \"D\u00e9bilitation de la voix\" may mean hoarseness or \"une extinction de voix,\" as respondent contends, but if laryngitis was intended, it should certainly have been mentioned by its well known name.\nQuestion 4. Nom et adresse de votre m\u00e9decin habituel? The answer is \"aucun,\" and it is not shewn that Dr. Bourgeois ever had a \"m\u00e9decin habituel\" before his last illness.\nQuestion 5. A quelle \u00e9poque et pour quelle maladie vous a-t-il donn\u00e9 des soins?\nThere is no answer to this, only a dash.\nQuestion 6. Quand avez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de rester \u00e0 la maison pour cause de maladie?\nThe answer is \"mal de dents en 1916.\" There is no evidence that Dr. Bourgeois was ever confined to his house by sickness, outside the instance mentioned, up to the date of his medical examination. His laryngitis did not prevent him from being very actively engaged in the discharge of his professional duties, especially during the epidemic of Spanish flu in the fall of 1918.\nQuestion 7. Donnez tous les d\u00e9tails de chaque maladie que vous avez eue depuis votre enfance, et le nom de chaque m\u00e9decin qui vous a soign\u00e9 ou donn\u00e9 des prescriptions?\nThen there are the following headings with a space for the answer:\nAffection. Nombre d'attaques. Date. Dur\u00e9e. S\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Complications. M\u00e9decin consultant.\nThere is no answer to this question.\nQuestion 8. Avez-vous eu d'autre maladie que celle ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e?\nAnswer : \"Non.\"\nQuestion 9. Avez-vous consult\u00e9 ou avez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9 soign\u00e9 par un autre m\u00e9decin que celui mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus? Si oui, quand et pourquoi?\nThere is no answer, only a dash.\nThese are all the answers in part B of which the respondent complains.\nBefore dealing with them, some preliminary observations may be made.\nIn part A there is the general statement :\nIl est convenu et consenti que les d\u00e9clarations et les r\u00e9ponses qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, ainsi que les d\u00e9clarations et r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es au m\u00e9decin examinateur, sont rigoureusement correctes et enti\u00e8rement vraies, et qu'elles serviront de base du contrat d'assurance si une police est \u00e9mise.\nWe also find in the policy the following condition:\nToutes d\u00e9clarations faites par l'assur\u00e9, en l'absence de fraude, seront consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des repr\u00e9sentations et non pas comme garanties et telle d\u00e9claration n'annulera cette police ni ne servira de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation en vertu de cette police, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne se trouve dans l'application \u00e9crite dont copie est ci-jointe parfaitement coll\u00e9e pour en faire partie, lors de l'\u00e9mission.\nReading these two clauses together, it does not seem possible in this case to give to the answers made by Dr. Bourgeois the effect of warranties; they are mere representations and under the statute a mis-statement or a misrepresentation does not affect the validity of the policy unless it induced the insurer to enter into the contract, in other words unless it was as to a material fact.\nThere may be the further question whether a condition inserted in the application, even where as here a photographic copy of the application is attached or glued to the policy, is a sufficient compliance with the requirement of the statute that all the terms or conditions of the contract be set out on the face or back of the instrument forming or evidencing the contract. A decision on this point might have a far-reaching effect, and inasmuch as article 7028 was called to the attention of appellant's counsel by the court and not mentioned by him, I do not feel that the question has been sufficiently argued to warrant us in deciding it, unless it be absolutely necessary to do so in order to dispose of this case. As I read the two clauses, they do not make the strict accuracy of the answers of the insured a condition of validity of the policy unless these answers induced the contract. That is the real question we have to decide and it is unnecessary therefore to express any opinion on the point to which I have referred.\nComing now to the merits of the appeal on the facts disclosed by the testimony, the misrepresentations relied on in connection with the answers given to questions 15 and 16 of part A, are in respect of an application for insurance which Dr. Bourgeois is said to have made in June, 1918, to the Canada Life Assurance Company. The application itself was not produced, but what is called an application data slip is in the record. Assuming that the respondent was entitled to adduce secondary evidence of this application\u2014and it is strenuously contended that the loss of the original has not been satisfactorily proved, and that moreover no witness can state of his own knowledge that the application data slip was compared with the original application,\u2014it does not appear, on a reasonable construction of questions 15 and 3.6, that any real misrepresentation by Dr. Bourgeois has been established. The evidence, if at all admissible, is that Dr. Bourgeois gave to an agent of the Canada Life Assurance Co. an application for $10,000 of life insurance. A medical examination of the applicant by Dr. MacTaggart was to have followed, but it never took place, Dr. MacTaggart explaining that he advised Dr. Bourgeois to wait until his laryngitis had disappeared. Questions 15 and 16, in my opinion, refer to an application which was at least considered, if not acted upon, by the insurance company. The alleged application was never considered, or acted upon by the Canada Life Assurance Co. ; it was clearly incomplete, for it was accompanied by no medical examination, and it contained no statement by Dr. Bourgeois as to his condition of health. It may be conceded that the respondent had an interest to know whether Dr. Bourgeois had been refused insurance by another insurance company, but no such refusal has been established, and Dr. Bourgeois was entitled to assume that the application which he gave to the agent, if it be sufficiently proved that he gave such an application, did not come within the scope of the questions put to him. I would further think that no materiality within the intendment of article 7028 has been made out in respect of the answers to question 15 and 16 of part A.\nComing now to the answers given, or to the failure to answer certain questions, in part B of the application, the onus clearly was on the respondent to shew that Dr. Bourgeois misrepresented material facts. The misrepresentations relied on are that Dr. Bourgeois failed to disclose that he had suffered from laryngitis, and that he had consulted physicians and had been treated by them in connection therewith.\nThe learned trial judge found on the evidence that\nle docteur Bourgeois avait alors une laryngite et qu'il ne l'a pas mentionn\u00e9e, mais que cette laryngite n'\u00e9tait qu'une laryngite simple, catarrhale ou banale, comme le d\u00e9clarent les t\u00e9moins entendus, n'ayant aucune gravit\u00e9 et n'affectant en aucune mani\u00e8re la sant\u00e9 du Docteur Bourgeois.\nThe learned trial judge also expressed the opinion that\nle docteur Bourgeois n'\u00e9tait tenu de d\u00e9clarer que les maladies graves pouvant affecter son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 ; que la laryngite qu'il avait alors n'exer\u00e7ait aucune influence sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, non plus que sur le risque en mati\u00e8re d'assurance, et que dans ces circonstances le docteur Bourgeois ne s'est pas rendu coupable de r\u00e9ticence ou de fausse d\u00e9claration en ne mentionnant pas ce fait banal.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge may be construed as meaning that Dr. Bourgeois had not misrepresented or concealed\na fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or to change the object of it\n(art. 2487 C.C.), or a fact which induced the insurer to enter into the contract. The consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench shew that the plaintiff's action was dismissed because the answers given by Dr. Bourgeois to questions 15 and 16 of part A and to question 8 of part B were untrue \"annulant les dites polices d'assurance.\" This is not satisfactory, for unless the answers were as to a material fact, their mere untruth would not be a reason to set aside the contract.\nWe are therefore forced to carefully examine all the evidence in order to determine whether there was, in the answers given in part B, a misrepresentation of a material fact. In other words, was the laryngitis from which Dr. Bourgeois undoubtedly suffered a material fact which he should have disclosed, the onus being on the respondent to establish that it was?\nIt is very extraordinary that the respondent, having called as its witness Dr. Godin, its medical examiner, who examined Dr. Bourgeois for this insurance, was content merely with having him state that Dr. Bourgeois made the answers and signed the application in question. A part of this application is part C which contains the declaration by Dr. Godin that in his opinion the chances of life of the applicant were excellent and that he recommended the risk. And not a single question was put by the respondent to Dr. Godin, who was still, at the date of the trial, one of its medical examiners, to challenge this statement.\nIf the laryngitis in question was a \"fait banal,\" if it had no effect on the state of health of Dr. Bourgeois, as found by the trial judge, the test of materiality would not appear to be satisfied. Such a \"fait banal,\" without effect on the state of health of the insured, would not have influenced a reasonable insurer so as to induce him to refuse the risk or alter the premium: Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Ontario Metal Products Co.[1]. The question now is whether this finding is justified by the evidence.\nIn my recital of the pertinent facts, I have sufficiently stated the effect of the evidence given by the medical witnesses, doctors Lasalle, Dupont and Panneton, called by the respondent to prove the laryngitis from which Dr. Bourgeois is alleged to have suffered. This is the only evidence on which we can rely to determine what appears to be the issue on the testimony, whether or not, as found by the learned trial judge, this laryngitis was\nun fait banal, n'ayant aucune gravit\u00e9 et n'affectant en aucune mani\u00e8re la sant\u00e9 du Dr. Bourgeois.\nIn my opinion, this evidence supports the finding at the trial, and there is no testimony to contradict it. Dr. Lasalle, who examined Dr. Bourgeois' throat in June, 1918, and subsequently in February or March, 1919, when a cancerous growth was discovered, is emphatic in declaring, as the result of his examination, that the condition he observed in June, 1918, had not brought about the condition he found in March, 1919. I quote from the closing part of his cross-examination:\nQ. Alors, docteur, en resum\u00e9, vous n'avez \u00e9tabli aucun lien de parent\u00e9 ou causalit\u00e9 entre ce que vous avez constat\u00e9 au mois de juin, 1918, et ce que vous avez constat\u00e9 au mois de mars, 1919?\nR. Non.\nThat the hoarseness or \"extinction de voix\" of Dr. Bourgeois, in 1918, had no apparent effect on his general condition of health is also affirmed by the physicians who saw him, and is further stated by the witnesses called by the plaintiff in rebuttal: Dr. C. Ernest Cross, the associate of Dr. Bourgeois, in his hospital; Mr. C. R. Whitehead, manufacturer, of Three Rivers, who advised him to take this insurance; Miss Fernande Genest, his stenographer, who says that, in December, 1918, she spoke to Dr. Bourgeois over the telephone from Montreal, and understood him very well; and the plaintiff herself, who states that the hoarseness of her husband was occasional and intermittent. To this we must add the positive declaration of Dr. Godin, the respondent's medical examiner, in part C of the medical examination, that in his opinion Dr. Bourgeois' chances of life were excellent and that he recommended the risk. As I have said, not a question was put to Dr. Godin by the respondent, on whom the onus lay, to contradict or challenge this statement.\nUnder these circumstances, it would seem to me a rash proceeding to substitute our own opinions for those of all these witnesses, and for the finding of the learned trial judge, and to infer that the laryngitis in question was more serious than they imagined, and that it was a fact, material in its effect on the health of the insured, the non-disclosure of which induced the respondent to enter into the contract. If the laryngitis was more than \"un fait banal,\" no one would have been more aware of it than Dr. Bourgeois, who specialized in these diseases, and he would have been guilty of fraud in concealing it. But the respondent's counsel frankly admitted at the hearing that no fraud on the part of Dr. Bourgeois had been established. One perhaps cannot help feeling some doubt in reading the medical evidence, and I have said that the testimony of Dr. Panneton is unsatisfactory and is possibly open to the suggestion that he closed his eyes to something which, had he observed it, might have assisted us in deciding this case. It is however the evidence adduced by the respondent, on whom the onus lay to prove material misrepresentation, and there is nothing in the circumstances of this case to shift the burden. To enable us to conclude that the laryngitis described by the witnesses was not \"un fait banal,\" a trivial matter, there should at least be some evidence on which we could base such a conclusion, and there is none. I certainly would not assume that because a cancerous growth was discovered in March, 1919, cancer existed in November, 1918, at the date of the medical examination. There is so much unsolved mystery about the origin and cause of cancer, and its growth is often so rapid, that the existence of cancer at a stated period cannot be relied on to show that it was present three months before. The question of materiality is a question of fact to be established by the respondent, and after carefully reading the testimony of all the medical witnesses, I am not in a position to firmly conclude that the laryngitis of 1918 had any effect whatever on the health of the insured.\nI cannot help thinking that the learned judges who formed the majority of the Court of King's Bench applied to this case a severer test, that of the absolute truth of the answers of the insured, than the statute calls for. Their decision possibly might have been different if the provisions of this statute had been called to their attention.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial court, with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Martel & Martel.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Claxton & Claxton.\n[1] [1925] A.C. 344.\n"

The respondent did not deliver any plea (Arts. 211, 212 C.C.P.), but filed a cross-demand claiming $38,788.52 for breach of the terms of the contract and asking that the amount of the judgment be compensated pro tanto. The appellants inscribed the case ex parte for judgment on the principal demand and the trial judge gave judgment accordingly.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 38 K.B. 325), that, as the claim under the terms of the cross-demand arises \"out of the same causes as the principal demand,\" article 217 C.C.P. prescribes the procedure to be followed and that adjudication must be made at the same time upon the original demand and the cross-demand.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, at Montreal, which had maintained the appellants' action and sending the parties back to the Superior Court in order that adjudication should be made at the same time upon the principal action and the cross-demand.\nLafleur K.C. and Maclaire for the appellants. This case must be decided according to arts. 211 and 212 C.C.P. and the appellants have the right to rely on the principle of intenational comity and public policy which those articles express.\nThese articles are absolute and should not be gratified by and read together with art. 217 C.C.P.\nA cross-demand based on a contract between the parties do not arise \"out of the same cause\" as an action based on an exemplification of a final judgment obtained in another province.\nChipman K.C. for the respondent. The cross-demand set up a claim arising out of the same causes as the principal demand which the respondent could not plead by defence; and accordingly, art. 217 C.C.P. applies.\nThe cross-demand should have been adjudicated upon by the trial judge concurrently with the appellants' claim.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLafleur K.C. and Maclaire for the appellants.\nChipman K.C. for the respondent.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal turns upon the effect of art. 217 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec, which is in these words:\u2014\nArt. 217. The defendant may set up by cross-demand any claim arising out of the same causes as the principal demand, and which he cannot plead by defence.\nWhen the principal demand is for the payment of a sum of money, the defendant may also make a cross-demand for any claim for money arising out of other causes; but such cross-demand is distinct from and cannot retard the principal action.\nThe court, whenever it renders judgment upon both demands at the same time, may declare that there is compensation.\nThe question arises in this way: The appellants, as plaintiffs, declared upon a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia of the 26th of November, 1923, awarding to the plaintiffs judgment against the defendant for the sum of twelve thousand odd dollars. The defendant, by cross-demand upon the allegation that the judgment was based upon a contract for the sale of lumber between the plaintiffs and the defendant, under which certain quantities of lumber were delivered, claimed certain sums by way of damages for breach of the terms of the contract. One of these claims is embodied in pars. 6 and 7 of the cross-demand, which read as follows:\u2014\n6. That of the entire quantity of lumber purchased under the said contract, the cross defendants were short in their deliveries to the extent of 1,985,901 feet, which lumber they actually disposed of according to their own admission in their statement of claim in the British Columbia action filed in this case by the cross defendants.\n7. That the cross plaintiffs suffered a loss on this head of at least $15 per thousand, being the difference between the contract price and the market price, amounting in all to the sum of twenty-nine thousand, seven hundred and eighty-eight dollars and fifty-two cents ($29,788.52), for which sum cross plaintiffs also counter-claim in this action.\nThe claim, thus stated, could not have been set up as a defence in the original action: it could only have been put forward in a separate action or by way of counterclaim. It would appear, therefore, that to it, art. 212 of the Code of Civil Procedure has no application; and the question arises whether it falls within the scope of the rule laid down by art. 217. The Court of King's Bench has taken the view that the claim under these paragraphs arises out of the same \"causes\" as the principal demand, and that art. 217 therefore prescribes the procedure to be followed. The language of that article might be more precise, but it seems clearly to be open to the interpretation adopted by the Court of King's Bench; and on the whole there appears to be no very solid ground for differing from this view.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. A question may arise whether the claim under par. 5 of the cross-demand is not one which, in substance (as a claim in respect of diminution in value resulting from breach of the contract of sale), might, on the principle of Mondel v. Steele[2], have been set up, in whole or in part, as a defence to the British Columbia action; see Bow McLachlan & Co. v. The Ship \"Camosun,\"[3]. From this point of view, the relevancy of art. 212, as respects this claim, may have to be considered; but it seems more convenient that any such question should be reserved for the trial.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Lafleur, MacDougall, Macfarlane & Barclay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.

[1914] c. 75, ss. 20 and 24.\nLands in Ontario were twice mortgaged and the first mortgagee entered into possession occupying the lands and receiving the rents and profits for sufficient time to acquire title under the Statute of Limitations. During this period leases were executed by the mortgagee in possession and by the second mortgagee as third party. The leases contained no express acknowledgment by the lessors of title in the second mortgagee but contained this clause: \"The parties of the third part hereby consent and agree to the within lease.\"\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (53 Out. L.R. 99) that this clause acknowledged the authority of the lessors to execute the lease but did not imply an acknowledgment by them of any title in the second mortgagee.\nHeld also that the second mortgagee had no status to maintain the action; all her rights under her mortgage and her interest in the lands having become extinguished at the expiration of the statutory period.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[4] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondents.\nThe facts are stated in the above head-note.\nJ. A. Ritchie, K.C. for the appellant.\nH. J. Scott, K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington, J.\u2014Accepting, as this court is accustomed to do, the finding of fact by two concurrent courts below, unless some strong reason put forward for doubting the accuracy thereof, I have considered the relevant law applicable thereto, and see no reason for doubting the accurate apprehension thereof as presented by the learned trial judge and the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, with whom I fully agree, I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThey seem to me to have covered the entire ground and I see no useful purpose to be served by repeating same here.\nDuff, J.\u2014The appellants as the second mortgagees and purchaser under an alleged mortgage sale respectively brought the action out of which the appeal arises, asserting a right of redemption against the respondents, who are respectively first mortgagees and purchaser from them.\nIn 1894, one H. W. Wherry was the owner of the lands the subject of the action, and in that year executed a mortgage in favour of Victoria Taylor, of Montreal, under the Short Forms Act, to secure the sum of $5,500, payable in five years. The land was, on 26th April, 1897, conveyed, subject to the mortgage, to Annie Odette, and on the same day she and her husband executed the mortgage which is the second mortgage above mentioned, to the appellant Mary Nutson, for $1,700, payable 26th April, 1902. Victoria Taylor having died, her estate is represented by the respondents Hanrahan, Hardie and Elliott.\nIn March, 1898, by conveyance from Annie Odette, one Frederick John Holton became the owner of the equity of redemption, subject to the above mentioned mortgages. Default having occurred under both mortgages, Victoria Taylor, by her agent Dougall, took possession of the mortgaged property and remained in possession or in receipt of the rente and profits until the death of Dougall, in 1910. From that time Messrs. Bartlett & Bartlett were in possession or in receipt of the rents and profits for the Taylor trustees until the sale to the Raymonds, in 1920.\nThe property was leased from time to time by Dougall, and afterwards by Messrs. Bartlett & Bartlett, as agents of the Taylor estate, and as such they received the rents and accounted for them to the estate.\nIn 1920, the Taylor estate having agreed to sell to the Raymonds, a question of title arose as to the interest purchased by Holton, and that was bought in by the Raymonds in that year.\nThe appellants contend that when Dougall took possession (as above mentioned), he did so under the terms of a proposed agreement set out in a document produced in evidence, which, it is argued, constituted him trustee for all parties interested in the property\u2014mortgagees tinder both mortgages, as well as the owner of the equity of redemption. Dougall actually received all the rents from 1897 until his death, and since then they have been received by Messrs. Bartlett and Bartlett.\nThe appellant Mary Nutson received nothing on account of the moneys due under her mortgage after the years 1901.\nIn 1908 a lease of the premises was executed by the trustees of the Taylor estate in favour of the Peabody Company, which Mary Nutson also executed as a party of the third part; and in 1912 the premises were leased by the trustees to McNee & Sons, and as in the preceding lease, Mary Nutson joined as party of the third part. The rents under both these leases were collected by the agent of the trustees, and no part of them was paid to Mary Nutson.\nThe Appellate Division held that, first, the respondents had been in possession for sufficient time to give them a title under s. 20 of the Limitations Act; and that by s. 24, any right of Mary Nutson in the property has become extinguished, and with it all right and status to maintain an action of redemption.\nAs to the first point, the judgment is attacked on two grounds: The leases of 1908 and 1912 are said to constitute an acknowledgment of the respondents' title within the meaning of the statute; and further that by the agreement above mentioned, under which Dougall first took possession, a trust was constituted which affects the Taylor estate and precludes the estate from setting up the statute as against the appellants.\nThe leases relied upon as constituting an acknowledgment contain no express acknowledgment; the demise and the covenants are by the trustees of the Taylor estate, and a clause is added in these terms:\n\"The parties of the third part hereby consent and agree to the within lease.\"\nThere seems to be an acknowledgment of the authority of the trustees to execute a lease, but I see no implication of an acknowledgment by them of any title in the second mortgages.\nAs to the alleged agreement with Dougall, the trial judge has found against it, and his finding has been affirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeal. I think these findings are supported by the evidence.\nI agree also that the respondents are entitled to succeed upon the ground that the appellants have no status to maintain this action. By s. 24, R.S.O. c. 75, the right of Mary Nutson to enforce her mortgage and with it her interest in the land became extinguished after the expiration of ten years after the last payment on account of the mortgage having been received by her, which was in the year 1901. In re Hazeltine's Trusts[5]; In re Fox[6].\nI agree also that the claim based upon the alleged sale of the equity of redemption in 1902 under the second mortgage fails. I concur in the findings of the courts below that this alleged sale was never legally operative.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault, J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Duff.\nMaclean, J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nI am of the opinion, that the finding of the trial judge affirmed by the Appeal Division, in respect of the pleaded agreement with Dougall was warranted by the evidence and should not be disturbed. I also agree that the respondents' contention, that any claim the plaintiffs, Mary Nutson and Annie M. Murphy, ever had in the lands mortgaged to Mary Nutson, has been barred by the Limitations Act, c. 75, s. 24 R.S.O. must prevail.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Sheppard & Sheppard.\nSolicitors for respondents: Hanrahan, Hardie and Elliott, Bartlet, Bartlet & Barnes.\nSolicitors for other respondents: Kenning & Cleary.\n[1] [1924] Q.R. 38 K.B. 325.\n[2] [1841] 8 M. & W. 858.\n[3] [1909] A.C. 597, at pp. 610-611.\n[4] 53 Ont.

Under that section, four cases are penalized: (a) the copying of the entire map, and (b) the copying of a part thereof, in either case in its integrity (sans aucune alt\u00e9ration), or, at least without change in the main design; (c) the copying of the entire map, and (d) the copying of a part of the map, again in either case, with an alteration in the main design.\nHeld that a plaintiff seeking to enforce this section in any of these four cases cannot succeed if the court is satisfied that in committing the act or the acts charged as an infringement of copyright the defendant did not act \"with intent to evade the law.\"\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, maintaining the respondent's action and condemning the appellant to pay $19,893.60, half to the Crown and half to the respondent, with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nL. A. Cannon K.C. and Buchanan for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Larue K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff sues to recover penalties under s. 39 of the Copyright Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 70) for alleged infringements by the defendant of his copyright in a highway map of the province of Quebec. The action was dismissed in the Superior Court (Gibsone J.)[1], but was maintained in the Court of King's Bench and judgment was entered for $19,893, to be paid one-half to His Majesty and one-half to the plaintiff; Lafontaine C.J.Q. and Greenshields J. dissenting.\nThe copyright was obtained in 1922 and the alleged infringements occurred prior to the 19th of January, 1923. Accordingly the Revised Statute of 1906 applies, the Copyright Act, 1921 (c. 24), having come into force by proclamation only on the first of January, 1924.\nThe copyrighted map is published in booklet form and consists of 26 distinct charts or sheets, each of them drawn on a scale of 4 miles to an inch and shewing in detail the highways and connecting roads in one of the 26 districts (covering approximately 1,500 square miles apiece), into which the plaintiff divided the settled portion of the province which his maps cover. With these 26 sheets is a Tableau d'Assemblage, or index map, drawn on a scale of 40 miles to an inch. This index map shews the outline of the counties, without naming them, and the main highways in the province. It is said to be a map prepared by one of the public departments. Superimposed are black lines indicating the 26 districts in rectangular blocks, 1 inch by 15\/16 of an inch each, and numbered 1 to 26 in heavy black type, corresponding to the numbers borne by the 26 district maps. There are also shewn on the map, in heavy and light black lines respectively, the improved and unimproved principal highways.\nThis index map seems to serve a double purpose. It indicates the general outlines and main directions of the principal highways and also enables the tourist or traveller readily to find the district or sectional map which he may require for immediate use. It is only of this index map that infringement is alleged, consisting in its use, with some variations, additions and omissions, as the background for an advertising calendar for the year 1923 issued by the defendant company.\nThe plaintiff's map was published, under an arrangement with him, by the provincial department of roads. Five thousand impressions were printed of which he received 3,500 for his own use and the department 1,500 for free distribution. The Minister of Roads appears to have sent one of these latter copies to Mr. Dawes, the president of the defendant company, From the judgment of Mr. Justice Gibsone, who tried the action, I take the following passages, which are fully warranted by the evidence.\nAs it happened the defendants were at this very time considering their advertising plans for 1923, they had tentatively decided to bring out a calendar with a map of the province, with a picture of one of their beer bottles printed on the map and a legend to the effect that this beer had the hacking of the province.\nWhen Dawes saw the index map in the booklet which Perron had given him, it struck him that, as it covered the settled and industrial parts of the province, and nothing more, it would be suitable for the calendar they had in mind, and he handed it to the lithographers as the type of map which defendants desired as the back ground for their advertising matter.\nThe lithographers thereupon took the index map, made the additions and omissions which I will detail in a moment, added the picture of the beer bottle and the advertising matter, and reproduced the result to become the heading of a monthly page of a calendar. Some 16,578 calendars were distributed, each with 12 such monthly sheets, so that 198,936 reproductions of the map were printed and distributed.\nI use the word \"reproduced\" to describe the operation executed by the lithographers. The lithographers were not called to testify how exactly the reproduction was effected; witnesses for the plaintiff incline to the opinion that it was by photographic process and I am satisfied that that is the right view.\nNow the noticeable additions and omissions made to it before reproducing were these: The county names and a few others were printed in; the index squares and the index numbers were left out, as also was the title \"Index map to sections, 40 miles to one inch\"; the legend indicating how improved and unimproved roads were shewn was retained but in slightly different form.\nThere is also this difference between the original and the reproduction; that the reproduction is larger, noticeably larger, but not, so far as can be seen, in any definite or intended proportion. A consequence of this circumstance is that the scale of the original 40 miles to one inch is not applicable to the reproduction and that in fact the reproduction is not a plan to scale.\nWhen plaintiff became aware of the publication and distribution of those calendars he took suit claiming $10,000 damages of which $3,000 for violation of his right of copyright and $7,000 for loss of profits; the action was tried by me and my judgment was in effect the following:\u2014\n(a) That reproduction of plaintiff's work constituted a violation of his right and entitled him, as for vindication of his right, to condemnation of the defendant to a certain sum in money; (b) that the violation entitled plaintiff also to a judgment for the loss and damages caused to him by such violation; (c) that the facts shewed the violation to have been technical rather than real, the publication to have been made in good faith and without intention to violate plaintiff's rights, in ignorance that plaintiff had any rights (though this ignorance was inexcusable in law under the circumstances shewn), also that the calendar did not in any way compete with the plaintiff's booklet, that it was not utilizable as a road guide, its distribution did not interfere in any way with the plaintiff's sales and did not in fact cause him any damage whatsoever. I felt obliged however to grant to plaintiff vindication of his violated right and on that ground I maintained the action for $100. The damage action ended there, the defendant paid the condemnation, and straightway plaintiff instituted the present penal action.\nAs the second action is submitted on the same evidence as served in the first, I need not say that my findings of fact wall be those I arrived at in the first action. My only duty then is to say whether on those findings of fact the penalty enacted by s. 39 has been incurred.\nMr. Dawes deposed that he was unaware that the plaintiff's map was copyrighted and had no idea that he was invading any of his rights. The learned judge found that any infringement there may have been was unintentional; that the road lines on the map\u2014the distinctive feature of it reproduced by the defendant\u2014were immaterial to the use to which it put the map; that the map without these road lines, in which the plaintiff had no property rights, would have served the defendant's purpose equally well; and that the publication of the defendant's calendar in no way competed with or affected the sale of the plaintiff's map. He concluded that on the defendant's part there had not been \"any attempt to evade the law.\"\nWe do not understand these findings to be impugned in the judgments of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench\u2014with the possible exception of that of Mr. Justice Rivard. They appear to be supported by the evidence, and, having due regard to the circumstance that the learned judge saw and heard Mr. Dawes give his evidence, we assume them to be correct. Is the plaintiff, in view of the facts so found, entitled to recover?\nSeveral objections were suggested to the constitution of this action: notably that the plaintiff sues to recover the entire penalty for himself and that he claims only the minimum penalty of ten cents for each copy of the map published by the defendant, thus probably precluding the court from awarding a greater penalty, up to one dollar per copy, to which it might consider the defendant liable, and in the recovery of which the Crown would have a one-half interest. Whatever view should be taken of these objections, were it necessary to consider them, we accede to the suggestion of counsel for the defendant, that the appeal should, if possible, be disposed of on the merits, or demerits, of the plaintiff's claim.\nSection 39 of the Copyright Act (R.S.C. 1906 c. 70) reads in part as follows: 39. Every person who, without the consent of the proprietor of the copyright first obtained,\u2014(a) after the registering of any * * * map according to the provisions of this Act, and within the term or terms limited by this Act, * * * copies, or causes to be * * * * copied, * * * any such * * * map * * * or any part thereof, either as a whole or by varying, adding to or diminishing the main design (dessin ou motif principal) with intent to evade the law.\n(b) * * *.\n(c) * * *.\nshall forfeit the plate or plates on which such map * * * has been copied, and also every sheet thereof, so copied or printed as aforesaid, to the proprietor of the copyright thereof; and shall also forfeit, for every sheet of such * * * map found in his possession, printed or published or exposed for sale, contrary to this Act, such sum not exceeding one dollar and not less than ten cents, as the court determines, which forfeiture shall be enforceable or recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n2. A moiety of such sum shall belong to His Majesty for the public uses of Canada, and the other moiety shall belong to the lawful owner of such copyright.\nIt will be observed that four cases are penalized:\n(a) the copying of the entire map, and\n(b) the copying of a part thereof; in either case in its integrity (sans aucune alt\u00e9ration), or, at least, without change in the main design; and\n(c) the copying of the entire map, and\n(d) the copying of a part of the map; again in either case, with an alteration in the main design.\nThere was considerable discussion at bar as to whether the applicability of the words \"with intent to evade the law\" should be extended to all four cases or should be restricted to the two last mentioned. While there is not a little to be said for the latter view as a matter of grammatical construction, it is difficult to conceive of Parliament having meant to penalize a reproduction as a whole for some innocent purpose and quite without any \"mens tea\" either of an entire map or of a part thereof. Having regard to the penal nature of the enactment, we incline to the view that the better construction is that which requires that a plaintiff seeking to enforce this section shall in every case be required to satisfy the court that in committing the act or acts charged as an infringement of copyright the defendant acted \"with intent to evade the law.\" Being satisfied that the finding of absence of that intent made by the learned trial judge should be upheld, it follows that the plaintiff has not made out a case which entitles him to judgment for the penalties claimed. For these reasons, with respect, we allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon, & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Francoeur, Vien & Larue.\n[1] [1924] 1 D.L.R. 1082.\n"

The appellant acquired an interest in land purchased by H. for purposes of speculation. H. agreed to transfer to the appellant, free from encumbrances, an undivided quarter interest, and he professed to make this transfer by an instrument subsequently executed, in which, moreover, H. agreed, upon demand, to execute such further transfers, assignments and other documents as should protect the interest of the appellant.\nHeld that the latter instrument left nothing outstanding between the parties except the undertaking for further assurance, which is an independent covenant, and that delay in the performance of it was not a cause for rescission of the executed conveyance and recovery of the purchase money.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Walsh J.[1], and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nC. J. Ford K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and McL. Sinclair K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The appellant (plaintiff) alleges an agreement of sale made orally, about 1st April, 1913, with the late Michael Healy, deceased, whereby the latter agreed to sell to the appellant, for $9,500, an undivided quarter interest in three parcels of land at Medicine Hat, each containing two lots, and particularly described as:\nLots twenty-nine (29) and thirty (30), block twenty-four (24), plan 1491, lots one (1) and two (2), block eighty-nine (89), plan 656-m, and lots five (5) and six (6), block \"D,\" plan 32,380, all an the city of Medicine Hat in the province of Alberta.\nThe appellant alleges that he paid the purchase money but failed, notwithstanding repeated demands, to obtain a conveyance of the title, wherefore he repudiated the agreement, and he claims repayment of the money with interest. By the defence the allegations upon which the action is founded are specifically denied.\nThe appellant testifies to the oral agreement and to the payment of the consideration money in the manner which he describes. He produces a document, dated 1st April, 1913, signed by Mr. Healy, which reads as follows:\nI, Michael Healy, contractor, of the city of Toronto, province of Ontario, hereby declare that Mr. P. D. Bowlen, of Elbow, Saskatchewan, owns one-quarter interest in the under-noted lots being: subject to deferred payments of $2;600\u2014twenty-six hundred dollars on lots 1 and 2, block 89, lots 5 and 6, block D, Herald * * *.\nand lots 1 and 2, block 89, plan 636m, all in the city of Medicine Hat, Alberta.\nThis declaration, owing to some confusion, mentions only four of the lots and two of them are named twice, but nothing turns upon this fact. The property remained in the possession of Mr. Healy, who continued to have the management of it. The appellant's cross-examination began as follows:\nQ. I think the arrangement you had with Mr. Healy was that using the language of the real estate market he was going to let you in on a quarter interest of the property he had bought in Medicine Hat, wasn't he?\nA. Well, he gave me the impression that I was getting a pretty good deal, a good bargain.\nQ. I do not want your impressions, but what the result was. I am not going in to what led you or induced you to go into it but what actually was the arrangement; he had bought or was about to buy this property in Medicine Hat. He had bought it?\nA. Yes, I understand he had.\nQ. And you were discussing it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And he said he would let you in on a quarter and you pay a proportion of what it cost him and he was not making any profit on the deal?\nA. Well a very small profit.\nQ. He was letting you in to the extent of a quarter interest in his deal?\nA. Yes.\nTwo agreements were introduced by the appellant. The first is dated 12th April, 1916, between the appellant as party of the first part, and Mr. Healy as party of the second part, and it contains the following recitals: Whereas the party of the first part is indebted to the party of the second part in the sum of four thousand five hundred and ninety-three ($4,593.69) dollars and sixty-nine cents and interest thereon from the 20th day of December, A.D. 1915, at the rate of eight (8) per cent per annum under and by virtue of a certain promissory note for four thousand five hundred and ninety-three ($4,593.69) dollars and sixty-nine cents now deposited in the Union Bank of Canada, Toronto, Ontario;\nAnd whereas the said indebtedness is now over due and entirely unpaid;\nAnd whereas the said party of the second part has demanded payment of the said indebtedness;\nAnd whereas the said party of the first part is unable to make payment of the said indebtedness;\nAnd whereas the said party of the first part is the owner of the northeast quarter of section thirty-one (31), in township twenty-two (22), in range nine (9), west of the third meridian, in the province of Saskatchewan, free from all encumbrances and will be the owner of a one-quarter undivided interest in a certain three parcels purchased by himself and Michael Healy in the city of Medicine Hat, in the province of Alberta, if the payments herein provided for are made in the manner herein provided for;\nAnd whereas the party of the first part has agreed to give as security a transfer of the said northeast quarter of the said section thirty-one (31) upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;\nThis agreement proceeds to witness that in consideration of the premises the appellant agrees to transfer to Mr. Healy the northeast quarter of section 31, mentioned in the recital, to be held in-trust by the latter as security for the recited indebtedness and interest, and that Mr. Healy is to retransfer upon payment to him by the appellant, on or before 1st February, 1917, of the sum of $4,593.69 and interest from 20th December, 1915, at 8 per cent, being the amount of the indebtedness due from the appellant to Mr. Healy; the agreement also provides that:\nThe party of the first part further agrees that upon default being made in the payment of the amount of the said indebtedness on the said first day of February, A.D. 1917, that he will release and hereby releases all his right, title and interest in certain properties in the city of Medicine Hat, in the province of Alberta, being three parcels in which the said party of the first part has a one-quarter undivided interest with the said party of the second part, and hereby for that purpose releases and quit claims all his right, title and interest in the said parcels, and agrees to execute upon request by the party of the second part, any further quit claim deed or other instrument required to vest the said parcels in the party of the second part for his sole use and benefit but such request by the party of the second part shall in no way be construed as an acknowledgment by the said party of the second part that the said party of the first part has any further interest in the said property after the said first day of February, A.D. 1917.\nIt is, however, agreed between the parties hereto that should the party of the first part pay to the party of the second part on or before the first day of February, A.D. 1917, a sum equal to the difference between the sum of $4,593.69 and interest thereon from the 20th day of December, A.D. 1915 at eight per cent per annum and the sum of $3,200 being the agreed value of the said quarter-section, then and in such case the party of the first part shall receive a one-quarter undivided interest in the said parcels situate in the city of Medicine Hat, in the province of Alberta, and such said payment of the said difference shall be payment in full for his one-quarter undivided interest in the said property.\nIt appears, according to the appellant's evidence, that the promissory note for $4,593.69 was paid by credit of $3,200 for the northeast quarter of section 31, and the balance by the appellant's cheque, which was paid through Mr. Trainor, his solicitor.\nSubsequently another agreement, dated 10th March, 1917, was made between Mr. Healy and the appellant, the material provisions of which are as follows:\nWhereas the party of the first part is the registered' owner of three parcels of land in the city of Medicine Hat in the province of Alberta free from all encumbrances.\nAnd whereas the party of the second part has at different times paid different sums of money to the party of the first part for an equitable interest, which the party of the second part holds in the said three parcels of property.\nAnd whereas the party of the second part was owing the party of the first part a further sum of money in respect of the said three parcels of property in the city of Medicine Hat, Alberta.\nAnd whereas the party of the first part and the party of the second part entered into an agreement dated the 12th day of April, 1916, whereby an agreement was reached with respect to the amount owing by the party of the second part to the party of the first part on the three parcels of land in Medicine Hat.\nAnd whereas in pursuance of the agreement entered into between the parties hereto on the 12th day of April, 1916, the party of the second part did transfer to the party of the first part the northeast quarter of section thirty-one (31), township twenty-two (22), range (9), west of the third meridian.\nAnd whereas according to the terms of the agreement dated the 12th day of April, 1916, entered into between the parties hereto, there was due as to the 1st day of February, 1917, to the party of the first part, the sum of fifteen hundred and ninety-six dollars and eighty cents ($1,596.80).\nAnd whereas the said amount of money has been paid by the party of the second part to the party of the first part.\nAnd whereas it was agreed that on the payment of the said sum of fifteen hundred and ninety-six dollars and eighty cents ($1,596.80) the party of the first part would transfer to the party of the second part an undivided one-quarter interest free from all encumbrances in the three parcels of land now held by the party of the first part in his own name in the city of Medicine Hat.\nNow therefore in consideration of the premises and the sum of fifteen hundred and ninety-six dollars and eighty cents ($1,596.80) now paid by the party of the second part to the party of the first part (the receipt Whereof is hereby acknowledged), the party of the first part transfers, assigns and sets over to the party of the second part free from all encumbrances an undivided one-quarter interest in the three parcels of pro- perty in the city of Medicine Hat in the province of Alberta now standing in the name of the party of the first part.\nAnd the party of the first part agrees upon demand to execute such further transfers, assignments and other documents as shall protect the interest of the party of the second part.\nAfter the execution of the latter agreement Mr. Healy, on 27th October, 1917, wrote to Mr. Trainor, stating that he would be in Calgary on 8th November and would like to meet the appellant at the solicitor's office\nin connection with a transfer he made of a quarter section of land;\nbut on 1st November Mr. Healy wrote the solicitor that his trip would be postponed for the present. A series of letters followed between the appellant's solicitor on the one hand and Mr. Healy's solicitors on the other, in which the appellant urged that the title of the Medicine Hat property should be transferred to him. No objection was stated on behalf of Mr. Healy. In a letter of 28th December, 1917, his solicitors said:\nMr. Healy has instructed us to prepare a transfer to Mr. Bowlen of his interest in this property.\nIt appeared however that Mr. Healy had lost or mislaid the duplicate certificate of title to two of the parcels and that this caused some delay; then Mr. Healy went to California.; the duplicate certificate was found with his solicitors at Toronto, but could not be handed over without an order from Mr. Healy; there was also a mortgage to be discharged, which covered one of the parcels. Mr. Healy's solicitors wrote on 15th June, 1920, that although they had written him several times in order to have the matter adjusted, they had received no instructions for nearly a year and a half, but that they were writing him again, and, on 19th June following, they wrote that they had received a letter from Mr. Healy to the effect that he expected to be at Calgary the following week and would see them in connection with the matter; but he did not see them, and here ends the correspondence which took place in Mr. Healy's lifetime. The appellant however tells of a conversation between him and Mr. Healy in the fall of 1921. He says:\nA. I went there to see him. I went to Swift Current where I thought I would find him, that is where he made his home.\nQ. What was your object in going to Swift Current?\nA. My object in going to Swift Current was to meet Mr. Healy and talk this matter over with him.\nQ. Talk it over for what purpose?\nA. For the purpose of getting my transfer or getting my money back. That was in 1921. Q. You did not see him in Swift Current?\nA. No, I did not see him at Swift Current but I came back then to Gull Lake and went out to his farm and saw him there.\nQ. What discussion did you have with Mr. Healy on that occasion?\u2014\nA. Well I talked this matter over with him and I told him I had gone to a lot of expense and trouble and I am sure I wrote a lot of letters or had a lot of letters written.\nQ. Your solicitor had been acting for you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. He will give that evidence.\nA. And I told him, well I do not remember just exactly what I told him, but I told him I was down there for the purpose of getting my transfer or getting my money back, that I had put a lot of confidence in him and I had waited on him a number of years to get the transfer, words to that effect, that is the impression that I gave him, that I was there and I had gone to a lot of expense and a lot of trouble and I was disappointed. I told him I wanted my transfer or my money back.\nQ. What did he say?\nA. He said he would come to Calgary in a short time and would arrange matters with me satisfactorily. We talked the matter over.\nQ. And that is the way you left it?\nA. Yes, I told him I was disappointed.\nQ. You left it as you have stated, that he would come to Calgary?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did he come to Calgary?\nA. No.\nQ. The court: You did not see him? He may have come?\nA. No, I did not see him.\nQ. Mr. Ford': Did he interview you later at Calgary?\nA. I never saw him afterwards.\nMr. Healy died on 31st January, 1923. The respondents are his executors. On 29th May, 1923, the appellant's solicitor wrote them, enclosing copy of the agreement of 10th March, 1917, and saying:\nthis agreement is repudiated by me and return of the moneys paid demanded, which, with interest, amount approximately to $11,743.\nOn 30th July, 1923, the solicitor wrote again to the respondent company, asking what they were prepared to do, and saying that unless the claim were admitted he would have to take action. On 16th August, 1923, he wrote again urging a settlement. The manager of the company said in reply that the estate could not recognize responsibility for the claim, and that the case was in the hands of their solicitors. Finally, on 11th October, 1923, the appellant wrote the respondents as follows:\nI hereby repudiate the agreement in writing entered into between myself and the late Michael Healy, which agreement was dated the 10th day of March, A.D. 1917.\nI repudiate the said agreement on the grounds that the late Michael Healy had undertaken therein to deliver to me a one-quarter undivided interest free from all encumbrances in the three parcels of property in the city of Medicine Hat, Alberta, but both the late Michael Healy and you, as executors, have failed to deliver such title free from all encumbrances.\nThe learned trial judge found, and it was not disputed, that the title to two of the lots had been in Mr. Healy's name since November, 1912; to two others, since May, 1914, and to the remaining two, since July, 1914, also that the two latter were, when Mr. Healy acquired them, subject to a mortgage which was discharged in 1917, although the discharge was not registered until 1923. The mines and minerals in two of the lots were by the grant from the Crown reserved, but no question arises as to this, and, subject to a claim for taxes, it was found that Mr. Healy had, since the dates of the respective certificates, the title in fee simple. The conclusion at the trial was that the plaintiff had effectively repudiated the contract, and was entitled to recover the various sums paid by him to Mr. Healy, with interest at the contract rate of 8 per cent from the dates of the respective payments. In this disposition of the case the judge was influenced by the decision of this court in Simson v. Young[2], which he thought could not be distinguished. In that case there was a purchase of land in a speculative market. A part of the purchase money was paid at the time of the execution of the contract and the balance, $1,600, was to be paid on a fixed date one year later. Time was declared to be of the essence of the contract. When the time for payment of the balance arrived, the vendor, who lived in Ireland, was not ready with her conveyance and there was a long period of delay in the preparation of it, by reason of which it was held that she could not have specific performance, and, moreover, that the purchasers were entitled to rescind, either because time continued to be of the essence of the contract, or because, in view of the special circumstances of the case, the purchasers were entitled to be placed in the same position as if they had given notice of intention to rescind conditional upon the vendor not delivering the conveyance within a named reasonable time. It is unnecessary further to review the facts, which are very fully explained in the report; a perusal of them serves to convince me that Simson's Case [3] differs from the present one in every particular which is contested, or might be thought to create a difficulty in the latter.\nUpon appeal it was considered that the testimony and exhibits did not evidence a sale and purchase, but were more consistent with the view that the transaction was in reality a joint purchase; that the property was bought for purposes of speculation with the intention that Mr. Healy should hold the title until a profit could be realized, a purpose which was defeated owing to the war and the depression which ensued. The judgment was pronounced by the Chief Justice, the other members of the court concurring, except Stuart J., who would have preferred to adopt the reasoning of the trial judge, but did not dissent.\nFrom the foregoing relation it is apparent that the appellant encounters formidable difficulties. The transaction was oral, the writings produced do not necessarily point to a sale; it is a remarkable fact that neither the declaration of 1st April, 1913, nor the agreements of 12th April, 1916, and of 10th March, 1917, contain any statement or recital of a sale by Mr. Healy to the appellant. By the declaration it is said that the appellant owns one quarter interest in the lots. By the agreement of 1916 it is recited that the appellant is indebted to Mr. Healy, and provision is made looking to the discharge of the indebtedness, and, in the event of default, that the appellant will release his interest in the Medicine Hat properties, which are described as three parcels in which the appellant has a one-quarter undivided interest with Mr. Healy, while on the other hand it is stipulated that, if the indebtedness be paid, the appellant shall receive a one-quarter undivided interest; Mr. Healy thus recognizing merely that the appellant has or shall receive that interest upon payment of the indebtedness as provided. Then, finally, by the agreement of 1917, whereby Mr. Healy is admitted to be the registered owner of the three parcels, subject to an equitable interest for which the respondent has paid, the former acknowledges the payment and his obligation to transfer an undivided one-quarter interest free from encumbrances. Upon these recitals, and in consideration of the payments, Mr. Healy in the words of the agreement,\ntransfers, assigns and sets over to the party of the second part (the appellant) free from all encumbrances, an undivided one-quarter interest in the three parcels now standing in the name of the party of the first part.\nThe covenant for further assurance follows. Consideration of these documents in the light of the oral testimony in my opinion justifies the conclusion that the latter agreement was intended to satisfy Mr. Healy's obligations to the appellant, except as to the covenant for further assurance. The appellant acquired the equitable title, and the covenant was meant to provide for any more particular description, if necessary, and as well for conveyance of the legal title, if required; the agreement thus operated as a settlement between the parties, leaving nothing outstanding in the transaction except the undertaking for further assurance, to be performed according to its terms upon demand. But this is an independent covenant, and delay in the performance of it, which is really the only ground upon which the action rests, is not a cause for rescission of the executed conveyance and recovery of the purchase money. Gibson v. Goldsmid[4]. This conclusion is decisive of the case, but I would add the following observations.\nThe property was speculative, consisting of building lots at Medicine Hat, some of which were built upon and occupied, others vacant. It was the admitted understanding that Mr. Healy was to manage the properties, collect the rents and pay the taxes. The appellant had a ranch at Cochrane and he lived there, except when he was at Calgary. His occupation was ranching. These facts suggest the improbability that he was acquiring an undivided interest in city lots at Medicine Hat otherwise than for purposes of speculation. The original oral arrangement was made in 1913. The war intervened; this would not unnaturally render hopeless or would interfere with any project of speedy sale, and when the appellant had succeeded in discharging his commitments to Mr. Healy, as evidenced by the agreement of 1917, it would seem that the provisions of that agreement were naturally responsive to the situation in which the parties found themselves, with speculative property in hand, which they had acquired jointly, and opportunity for realization postponed. Then there is the appellant's testimony at the trial, to which I have referred, which articulates with the circumstantial evidence. It must be remembered too that Mr. Healy in his lifetime was never faced with any demand on the part of the appellant which pointed to the sale of an undivided interest as distinguished from a joint enterprise in which, the parties were mutually concerned. This statement I think need not be qualified by reason of the conversation at Gull Lake in 1921, according to the evidence of which the appellant told Mr. Healy that he had come for the purpose of getting a transfer or a return of his money. Moreover, the case was carefully considered by the learned judges of the Appellate Division who came to a conclusion, which is not shown to be wrong; and of course, in view of Mr. Healy's death, and the fact that the action is against his executors, who have no knowledge of the transaction except as derived from the documents and the appellant's version, the proof ought to be very closely scrutinized. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1924] 2 W.W.R. 327.\n[2] [1918] 56 Can. S.C.R. 388.\n[3] [1918] 56 Can S.C.R. 388.\n[4] [1854] 5 DeG. M. & G. 757.\n"

V, c. 65, s. 611\nThe appellant took an action to recover damages to his mill property caused by flooding alleged to be due to an obstruction of the natural flow of the waters of the River B\u00e9cancourt by the piers of a bridge constructed by the respondent corporation. Section 5684 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (now 13 Geo. V, c. 65, s. 611) prescribes that a person who would recover damages from a municipal corporation for injury caused to his property shall within 30 days from the date of the occurrence of such injury give notice in writing to the clerk of the municipality \"containing the particulars of his claim.\" The day after the flooding of which he complains, the appellant caused a letter to be written by his attorney to the secretary-treasurer of the respondent corporation informing it of his claim for damages exceeding $2,000 suffered by him \"dans son moulin.\"\nHeld, that the notice given by the appellant was a sufficient Compliance with the statute as to damages caused by the flooding to the mill property itself and to its appurtenances.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, varying the judgment of the Superior Court by reducing the amount of damages awarded to the appellant from $979.45 to $689.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now rejected.\nF. Roy K.C. for the appellant.\nGalipault K.C. and A. Girouard for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014This is an action to recover damages to the plaintiff's mill property caused by flooding alleged to be due to an obstruction of the natural flow of the waters of the River B\u00e9cancourt by the piers of a bridge constructed by the defendant corporation. The plaintiff claimed $4,000. In the Superior Court he recovered judgment for $979.45. The defendants appealed denying their liability; the plaintiff also appealed claiming the award to be insufficient. By a majority judgment the Court of King's Bench reduced the plaintiff's recovery to $689. From this judgment both parties appealed independently to this court. On motion the defendant's appeal was quashed for want of jurisdiction. The plaintiff's appeal, in which he now demands that the judgment in his favour be increased to $2,816.42, was heard.\nThe finding of the Superior Court that the flooding was due to a narrowing of the river channel by the piers of the bridge constructed by the defendant, affirmed unanimously by the Court of King's Bench, appears to be supported by sufficient evidence to put interference with it by this court out of the question. The sufficiency of the amount allowed for damages is, therefore, the only matter to be considered.\nSection 5684 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (13 Geo. V, c. 65, s. 611) prescribes that a person who would recover damages from a municipal corporation for injury caused to his property shall within 30 days from the date of the occurrence of such injury give notice in writing to the clerk of the municipality \"containing the particulars of his claim.\" The day after the flooding of which he complains, the plaintiff caused a letter to be written by his attorney to the secretary-treasurer of the defendant corporation informing it of his claim for damages exceeding $2,000 suffered by him \"dans son moulin.\" With the view of the Court of King's Bench that the notice given by the plaintiff was a sufficient compliance with the statute as to the damages claimed for injury to the mill and such things as may reasonably be considered as incidental or appurtenant thereto, we are in accord. The legislature did not intend that there should be a detailed account of the items of the damage. The purpose of the notice was to give the municipal corporation such knowledge of the claim in respect of which it was given as would enable it to make the necessary inquiries to ascertain, within a reasonable time after the claim arose, the basis of it and the material facts and circumstances affecting the corporation's liability. The notice, therefore, was properly treated as sufficient to support a claim for liability for damages caused by the flooding to the mill property itself and to its appurtenances. The plaintiff's damages as now formulated are particularized as follows:\nA. Cost of restoring the mill, $225.\nB. Damages to flume, $300.\nC. Loss of time, $100.\nD. Damages to electric motor, $64.65.\nE. Cost of new motor, $400.\nF. Temporary repairs to mill, $176.97.\nG. Damages to rev\u00eatement wall and for levelling ground, $1,450.\nH. Damages to cellar and garden, $100.\nTotal, $2,816.42.\nItems A, B, C and D were allowed by the Court of King's Bench, with the exception of forty-five cents in item D, which may obviously be regarded as falling within the maxim \"de minimis.\" These four items, therefore, need not be further inquired into. It may be remarked, in respect of item B, that the Superior Court allowed only $200. The evidence, however, appears to warrant the increase made by the Court of King's Bench.\nItem E: The ground on which this claim was disallowed was that the repairs covered by item D, when made, put the motor in good running order, and that the fact that it had really been destroyed and made useless by the flooding only developed after the action was brought. With great respect, that does not seem to be a proper ground for disallowing the item. If, in fact, the flooding so completely destroyed the motor that it could not be repaired and made fit for permanent use without an expenditure of $400, which would be the cost of a new motor, the cause of action for that damage arose at the time of the flooding, although its existence only became apparent subsequently. The decision of this court in Finlay v. Howard[1], establishes that such damages are recoverable. The evidence of the witness Lefebvre makes it clear that this expense will be necessary. On the other hand, however, although the motor which the plaintiff had was comparatively new\u2014the evidence does not disclose how long it had been in actual use\u2014it was in fact worth something less than a new motor would be. Moreover, as the motor proved to be of no value, the expenditure of $64.45 for repairs was money thrown away. Deducting this amount, therefore, and an allowance for depreciation in the value of the motor owing to its use up to the time of the flooding\u2014which must at best be an approximation\u2014we think that if the plaintiff recovers, in addition to the $64 already allowed, $275 towards the cost of a new motor, he will be compensated as fully as is reasonable.\nItem F: The plaintiff has been allowed, in item A, the cost of restoring the mill; in this item he claims in addition $176.97 for temporary repairs to the mill. It is by no means clear on the evidence that the $225 estimated by the witnesses Couture and Breton as the cost of restoration did not include what was done by way of temporary repairs. Mr. Justice Bernier would allow on this account $161.47. On the whole, the proper conclusion seems to be that the plaintiff has not so clearly established that this expense was outside what is covered by the item of $225 already allowed that we would be justified in reversing the decisions of the Superior Court and of the Court of King's Bench, by both of whom it was rejected.\nItem G: This is the most substantial claim made\u2014$1,450 for damages to the rev\u00eatement wall and for levelling the ground. It is apparent from the plan that the rev\u00eatement wall is some distance from the mill. The evidence shews that it was built by the city for the protection of the highway. Moreover it is at least very doubtful whether it could in any case properly be regarded as so appurtenant to, or connected with the mill that the attention of the municipality would be drawn to a claim in respect of injury to it by a notice claiming damages for injury suffered by the plaintiff \"dans son moulin.\" In respect of this item the purpose of the requirement of the notice was probably not attained. The evidence in regard to the claim for levelling is most unsatisfactory. The trial judge allowed $300 in this connection \"pour dommages dans la cour du moulin et les accessoires.\" The judges of the Court of King's Bench unanimously disallowed this item in toto. The evidence does not enable us to say that in doing so they were clearly wrong.\nThe same observations apply to item H. The cellar and garden are appurtenant to the residence and in no way appurtenant to the mill. In the net result, therefore, we would increase the award made by the Court of King's Bench in favour of the plaintiff by the sum of $275, making his total recovery $964. He should have his costs of the appeal to this court; but the disposition of costs made by the Court of King's Bench will not be disturbed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon, Parent & Taschereau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

L.R. 405) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of trial judge; Mathers C.J.K.B.[2], and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThis is an action by the rural municipality of Portage la Prairie against the rural municipality of Cartier upon an award made by the Municipal Commissioner under sections 667 and 668 of The Municipal Act for half the cost of construction of a permanent bridge across the Assiniboine River which forms the boundary between these two municipalities. The respondent's defence is that the bridge was constructed by the appellant alone and on its own behalf without any agreement or concurrence on the part of the respondent. The appellant answered this defence by stating that the respondent by its course of conduct estopped itself from setting up as a defence the absence of a by-law authorizing the building of this bridge jointly with the appellant.\nF. G. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nWard Hollands K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014The point to be decided in this case is whether the rural municipality of Cartier is bound to pay one-half of the cost of building a bridge over the Assiniboine River between the two municipalities. The appellant decided to build this bridge and gave the contracts for the work without any agreement by the respondent to share in the cost. It appears that Cartier at one time expressed its willingness to contribute to the construction in respect of the acreage benefited by the bridge, but nothing came of this tentative offer, and finally, but after the bridge had been completed, the matter was brought before the municipal commissioner, who, purporting to act under the authority of s. 668 of The Municipal Act (R.S.M., 1913, c. 133), as amended, decided that the respondent should pay one half of the sum expended by the appellant. The present action claims payment of certain accrued instalments under the award, and the respondent disputes its liability, alleging that the municipal commissioner acted without jurisdiction.\nSection 667 of The Municipal Act, when a river or stream forms the boundary or part of the boundary between two or more municipalities, empowers the councils of these municipalities to construct a bridge or bridges across such river or stream. By s. 668, it is enacted that if the municipalities are unable mutually to agree as to their joint action in constructing, maintaining or keeping the bridge in repair, or as to the share of the expense of maintenance or repair to be borne by each, the Municipal Commissioner, on application to him by one or more of the municipalities, may determine all and singular the said matters and the amount which each municipality shall be required to expend. I think these two sections should be read together.\nIn order to give jurisdiction to the Municipal Commissioner to apportion the cost, the two municipalities must have agreed to construct the bridge. This essential condition is wanting here, for the council of the respondent never so agreed. Section 667 assumes that both the municipalities have exercised the power it confers to construct the bridge, but in this case the bridge was built by the appellant alone without the concurrence of the respondent. It is also objected by the respondent that any consent by it to the construction of the bridge, in other words, any exercise of the power conferred by s. 667, could only be by by-law. This is in conformity with s. 327 of The Municipal Act, and the objection therefore seems well founded. There is an abundance of authority on this point.\nIt is, however, contended, and this the learned Chief Justice of the King's Bench considered the crucial point in the case, that the respondent adopted a course which was consistent only with the existence of liability for its proper proportion of the cost of the bridge. When threatened with litigation, it is said, it sent representatives to the Municipal Commissioner to request him to fix the amount the respondent should pay. It appears, as well by the statement of claim as by the recitals of the award, that it was the appellant that applied to the Municipal Commissioner to determine the amount that each municipality should expend in connection with the construction of the bridge. Certainly sending its representatives before the Municipal Commissioner under these circumstances could not amount to an assumption of liability by the respondent for a work undertaken entirely by the appellant, the more so as any agreement of the respondent to share in the cost of the bridge could only be expressed by a by-law. I am unable, therefore, to find in the circumstances of the case any foundation for the contention that the respondent is now estopped from disputing a liability it never assumed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor & Colwill.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bonnar, Hollands & Philp.\n[1] [1924] 34 Man.

The action involved proof in solemn form of the said last will and testament bearing date the 16th day of January, 1923.\nAt the trial, the executor adduced as evidence three earlier wills of the deceased respectively dated 30th October, 1897, 16th July, 1901, and 25th February, 1911. Under this latter will, Thomas Harrison was named a residuary beneficiary and claimed approximately one-ninth of the estate of the deceased which is estimated to amount to about $350,000.\nAll of the appellants to this court are excluded and left without benefit from the terms of any known will of the deceased.\nThe trial judge found inter alia the purported will, dated 16th January, 1923, to be a forgery. He refused the petition for probate and dismissed the action.\nUpon appeal by the executor Shaver and also certain beneficiaries under the said will, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversed the trial judgment, allowed the petition for probate and declared the said document of the 16th January, 1923, to be the last will and testament of the deceased. The appellants to this court took the first step towards an appeal from the appellate court\u2019s judgment by obtaining, on 28th May, 1925, an order approving of a bond as security for the appeal to this court.\nHowever, on the 2nd June, 1925, the respondent Thomas Harrison paid two thousand dollars ($2,000) into court as security for an appeal from the said appellate court to His Majesty\u2019s Privy Council, and this security was, on the 5th June, approved and the appeal allowed\nupon the undertaking of counsel for the applicant that a motion would be made forthwith to the Supreme Court of Canada for an order staying the pending appeal to that court in this action.\nSuch is the motion which is now being made to this court.\nHarrison has always had his own solicitor and counsel, other than those employed or retained by the appellants here.\nIt is not disputed, in fact it was conceded at bar, that if the respondent Thomas Harrison be successful on his appeal to His Majesty\u2019s Privy Council, this result will be conclusive of the contentions of the appellants before this court; while the judgment of this court will not necessarily be final, as leave to appeal from it may still be granted by the Judicial Committee.\nThe precise question involved in this motion does not appear to have yet come before this court in exactly the same form.\nIn the case of McGreevy v. McDougall[1] (3rd March, 1888), at the hearing, it appeared that the respondent had taken an appeal from the same judgment to Her Majesty\u2019s Privy Council, which said appeal was then pending before the Judicial Committee. The court stopped the arguments of counsel and ordered that the hearing of the appeal to this court should stand over until after the adjudication of the said appeal to the Privy Council.\nIn the case of Eddy v. Eddy[2] (4th October, 1898), the situation was the same. The respondent before this court had taken an appeal from the same judgment to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Again the hearing of the appeal to this court was stayed until the appeal to the Privy Council had been decided,\nupon the respondent undertaking to proceed with diligence in the appeal so taken by him.\nIn neither of these decisions does the priority of the proceedings in appeal of one or the other party appear to have been the ratio decidendi.\nIn the case of The Bank of Montreal v. Demers[3], where the appellant had inscribed an appeal for hearing in the Supreme Court of Canada after he had received notice of an appeal in the same matter by the respondent to the Privy Council, upon motion on behalf of the respondent, the proceedings on the Supreme Court appeal were stayed pending the decision of the Privy Council. The motion was granted with costs against the appellant, on the ground, not that he had inscribed his appeal subsequent to that of the respondent to the Privy Council, but that it was posterior to the decision in Eddy v. Eddy, which, in the judgment of the court as reported, was stated to have\nsettled the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada in such cases.\nIn each of the preceding cases, the parties were opponents in the courts below. The difference between them and the present case therefore is that Ashbridge and his co-appellants here, as well as Thomas Harrison, the appellant to the Privy Council, were co\u2011defendants in the action before the Supreme Court of Ontario. This difference, however, does not appear to us to be sufficient for distinguishing this case from the others above mentioned.\nWe know of no rule, and none has been pointed to us, which could prevent one of the co\u2011defendants, under the circumstances appearing in this case, from severing and appealing to the Judicial Committee; and Thomas Harrison, having been properly allowed to appeal to the Privy Council, we think the principle laid down in the former decisions should also govern this appeal.\nThe motion to stay proceedings pending the decision of the appeal to the Privy Council shall therefore be granted; but upon the undertaking by the applicant Thomas Harrison to expedite his appeal so taken by him and to proceed with diligence. If he should not do so, leave should be reserved to the appellants herein to apply to this court for the removal of the stay under the present order.\nMotion granted.\n[1] Coutl\u00e9e\u2019s Dig. 74.\n[2] Coutl\u00e9e\u2019s Dig. 130.\n[3] [1899] 29 Can.

Article 16 of its by-laws enacted that an employee, obliged to discontinue his services to the bank by reason of abolition of his position (pour cause de suppression d'emploi) after 25 years of service to the bank and of participation in the society, should be entitled to claim the amount of the pension provided in the by-laws. But it was also provided by article 44 that, in the event of La Banque Nationale ceasing to exist, the society would be liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the members in accordance with the by-laws; and that those having no vested rights at that time would receive only their contributions with interest at four per cent. La Banque Nationale was merged with La Banque d'Hochelaga on the 30th April, 1924, in accordance with the provisions of the Bank Act.\nHeld that the merger of La Banque Nationale with the other bank, although it necessarily terminated the employment of the members of the society as employees of that bank, did not effect an abolition of positions (suppression d'emploi) within the meaning of article 16 of the by-laws of the pension fund society; but that the rights of the members were governed by the terms of article 44.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, at Quebec.\nThe present case arose out of the liquidation of a pension fund society known under the name of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Caisse de Retraite de la Banque Nationale, Quebec. That society had for its object the creation and the administration of a pension fund, the revenues of which were intended to insure a life annuity for the employees of La Banque Nationale obliged to discontinue their services to the bank because of old age or disability. Its liquidation became necessary as a result of the merging of La Banque Nationale with La Banque d'Hochelaga.\nMr. Eug. Trudel, the appellant herein, was appointed liquidator for the winding up of the assets of the society and their distribution amongst the associate members according to their respective rights under the by-laws of the society.\nAfter realization of the assets the liquidator prepared a distribution sheet, which was contested in the present proceedings at the instance of ten members-annuitants or pensioners of the pension fund society, the respondents St. Georges Lemoine and others.\nThe latter claimed that the distribution sheet disregarded their rights, that they had been wronged to the benefit and profit of the other members, and they therefore demanded its annulment.\nThe Superior Court found against the respondents, the distribution sheet was maintained as prepared, but the costs of the contestation were adjudged against the estate.\nOn appeal to the Court of King's Bench, the judgment of the trial court was reversed, the distribution sheet was annulled and a new distribution sheet was ordered to be prepared.\nThe liquidator appealed to this court claiming that the trial court judgment should be restored together with the first distribution sheet.\nOn the other hand the respondents, St. Georges Lemoine and others, lodged a cross-appeal against that part of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench which found a third class of pensioners or annuitants composed of members who, after 25 years of service to the bank and of contribution to the fund, became obliged to discontinue their services to the bank by reason of abolition of their positions (suppression d'emploi) resulting from the merger of the bank.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the appeal was dismissed, but the cross-appeal was allowed and the judgment of the Court of King's Bench was varied.\nThe judgment of the court, as delivered by Rinfret J., after dealing with other questions raised on the appeal, reads as follows as to the matter mentioned in the head-note. Rinfret J.\u2014Nous sommes donc d'accord avec la Cour du Banc du Roi dans l'interpr\u00e9tation qu'elle a donn\u00e9e aux mots \"droits acquis\" dans l'article 44 des r\u00e8glements. Mais nous diff\u00e9rons d'opinion dans l'application qu'elle a faite de cette interpr\u00e9tation: car nous croyons que la disparition de la banque ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la \"suppression d'emploi\" envisag\u00e9e par l'article 16 des r\u00e8glements.\nIl s'agit l\u00e0 d'une suppression individuelle et non d'une suppression g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. L'article 16 donne ce que l'on peut consid\u00e9rer comme une d\u00e9finition de l'expression. Cette d\u00e9finition implique la continuation des affaires de la banque et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, alors que le soci\u00e9taire cesse d'\u00eatre employ\u00e9. Les mots qui se trouvent dans la d\u00e9finition, \"toute autre cause du m\u00eame genre\" n'ont pas m\u00eame besoin de l'application de la r\u00e8gle ejusdem generis, puisque le texte le dit lui-m\u00eame; et la fermeture de toute la banque n'est certainement pas \"du m\u00eame genre\" que la fermeture d'un bureau.\nD'ailleurs, ce qui exclut d\u00e9finitivement l'interpr\u00e9tation que nous repoussons, c'est que les r\u00e8glements contiennent un article sp\u00e9cial qui pr\u00e9voit la suppression g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme cons\u00e9quence de la dissolution de la banque et de la liquidation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9: c'est l'article 44. Il en r\u00e9sulte que l'article 16, en parlant de suppression d'emploi, a voulu pourvoir \u00e0 un cas diff\u00e9rent. En plus, les r\u00e8glements supposent que cette suppression d'emploi existe au moment de la dissolution et non par suite de la dissolution.\nNous \u00e9liminerons donc de la classe des soci\u00e9taires ayant des \"droits acquis\" au sens de l'article 44 des r\u00e8glements, ceux qui, bien qu'ayant vingt-cinq ans de service et de participation \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, n'avaient pas encore atteint l'\u00e2ge de soixante ans; car nous ne pouvons interpr\u00e9ter la disparition de la banque comme constituant la \"suppression d'emploi\" sp\u00e9ciale et particuli\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 16. Il s'ensuit que nous sommes d'avis que les seuls soci\u00e9taires qui avaient alors (i.e. au moment de la dissolution) des droits acquis \u00e0 faire liquider leur pension sont les employ\u00e9s ayant atteint soixante ans d'\u00e2ge et ayant accompli vingt-cinq ann\u00e9es de service \u00e0 la banque et de participation dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ainsi que les employ\u00e9s ayant dix ans au moins de participation \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de discontinuer leur service pour cause d'infirmit\u00e9 mentale ou corporelle.\nSeuls ceux qui, au moment de la dissolution, \u00e9taient dans Tune ou l'autre de ces deux cat\u00e9gories doivent \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 recevoir, avec les pensionnaires qui jouissaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 de leur indemnit\u00e9 de retraite, un dividende repr\u00e9sentant une pension.\nTous les autres soci\u00e9taires ne peuvent retirer que leurs versements avec un int\u00e9r\u00eat de 4 pour cent.\n****\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et le contre-appel des intim\u00e9s doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9; de m\u00eame que, comme cons\u00e9quence, l'intervention doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e. Le bordereau de dividende devra \u00eatre fait suivant les conclusions du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, sauf les modifications mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus. L'ordre sera:\n1. Les frais de distribution et ceux faits dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun;\n2. Les cr\u00e9anciers de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, comprenant les ex-soci\u00e9taires chacun pour la part des ses contributions, sans int\u00e9r\u00eat, dans le cas o\u00f9 ils n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s;\n3. (a) Les pensionnaires ou leurs ayants droit, (b) les soci\u00e9taires ayant des droits acquis, c'est-\u00e0-dire ceux qui n'avaient pas encore exerc\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 leur pension mais qui, au moment de la dissolution de la banque, avaient atteint soixante ans d'\u00e2ge et accompli vingt-cinq ans de service \u00e0 la banque et de participation \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ou qui, lors de la dissolution de la banque, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de discontinuer leurs services pour cause d'infirmit\u00e9 mentale ou corporelle et qui avaient au moins dix ans de participation \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ces soci\u00e9taires ont droit \u00e0 la liquidation de leur pension dont le montant annuel devra d'abord \u00eatre calcul\u00e9 suivant l'article 17 des r\u00e8glements. Le montant annuel des pensionnaires a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 liquid\u00e9. Le capital des pensions sera estim\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux articles 1915 et 1917 du code civil, (c) Tous les autres soci\u00e9taires. Ils ont droit \u00e0 un montant correspondant aux versements qu'ils ont faits \u00e0 la caisse de retraite avec un int\u00e9r\u00eat de 4 p. 100.\nDu moment que le montant appartenant \u00e0 chacun de ces pensionnaires ou soci\u00e9taires aura \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, ils devront \u00eatre trait\u00e9s tous au m\u00eame rang et ils seront colloques au bordereau de dividende pour le total de leur d\u00fb, si les deniers \u00e0 distribuer sont suffisants; ou au marc la livre, s'ils sont insuffisants.\nNous ne parlons pas d'un surplus \u00e0 distribuer, puisque les parties nous ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait certain qu'il y aurait insuffisance de deniers.\nQuant aux frais, le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi les a attribu\u00e9s contre le liquidateur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9. Nous croyons que la contestation devant les tribunaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun.

Bitter and Imperial Trust Company of Canada Respondents.\nImperial Steel Corporation, Ltd. (Defendant), and J.A. Currie Appellants;\nand\nFrederick Arthur Watson (Plaintiff) and Imperial Trust Company of Canada (Defendant) Respondents.\n1925: October 6, 7; 1925: November 4.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nPractice\u2014Status\u2014Intervention\u2014Discontinuance\u2014Supreme Court Act, ss. 60, 69, 80.\nWhere a judgment had been given against a corporation in favour of a holder of a debenture, the interest upon which was in default, and the company and its president personally (the latter not theretofore a party) gave security for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada without objection by the respondents.\nHeld, that the president had no status to take part in the appeal as he had not intervened in the manner provided by The Supreme Court Act, s. 80.\nAn informal statement in a letter from the solicitors of the appellants, (Imperial Steel Corporation Ltd.) indicating an intention to abandon an appeal does not suffice to effect a discontinuance, the explicit provisions of the Supreme Court Rule 60 not having been complied with.\nAPPEALS from the decisions of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nBy originating summons under the Trustee Act the respondent Bitter sought the removal of the Imperial Trust Co. of Canada as trustee for bondholders under a bond mortgage made by appellant, The Imperial Steel Corporation, Ltd., and the substitution for it of the Trust & Guarantee Co. which he also asked should be appointed receiver of the appellant corporation. Mr. Justice Riddell made an order appointing the Trust & Guarantee Co. trustee and receiver as asked. From this order an appeal was taken to the Appellate Division, on the ground, inter alia, that the learned judge had exceeded his jurisdiction in appointing a receiver by way of equitable execution on a summary application under the Trustee Act.\nTo meet this difficulty, the respondent Watson then brought an action for realization of the mortgage security and for the appointment of a receiver of the assets of the Imperial Steel Corporation and made a motion returnable before Mr. Justice Riddell for the appointment of an interim receiver.\nWatson was the holder of certain bonds of the Imperial Steel Corporation of which J.A. Currie was president. Default had been made in the payment of three half-yearly instalments of interest on these bonds.\nUpon the return of Watson\u2019s motion it was turned by the court into a motion for judgment, and final judgment was pronounced for the realization of the mortgage security and appointing the Trust & Guarantee Co. receiver of the assets of the Imperial Steel Corporation, Ltd.\nFrom this judgment an appeal was also taken to the Appellate Division.\nBoth appeals came on to be heard together. The Appellate Division, on the 13th of May, 1925, modified the first order made by Mr. Justice Riddell so as to restrict it to the appointment of the Trust & Guarantee Company as trustee. The judgment in the action it affirmed without variation.\nFrom these judgments the appeals were taken to this court which the respondents move to quash.\nOn the motion to quash coming on for hearing on the 6th of October, judgment was reserved. The court subsequently quashed the appeal from the judgment affirming the order appointing the Trust & Guarantee Co. trustee in lieu of the Imperial Steel Corporation, for want of jurisdiction. It was, however, of the opinion that it had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the judgment in the Watson action for the realization of the mortgage security and appointing the Trust & Guarantee Company receiver by way of equitable execution, but directed that the appel- lant should show cause why that appeal should not be dismissed as frivolous and vexatious and lacking substance.\nUpon the return of the motion for this purpose on the 4th of November, the attention of the court was drawn to the fact that, although the appeal in the Watson action purports to be taken by the Imperial Steel Corporation, Limited, the defendant in the action, and also by J.A. Currie, the latter was not a party to the proceedings in the Ontario courts. His name, however, appeared as an appellant in the notice of appeal to this court and also in the bond taken as security for costs and approved by Smith J.A. in chambers. It also appeared that before the return of the motion to quash the solicitors of the Imperial Steel Corporation had written a letter to the solicitors for the respondent Watson intimating that they would not appear.\nRule 60 of the Supreme Court Rules reads as follows:\nAny person interested in an appeal between other parties may, by leave of the court or a judge, intervene therein upon such terms and conditions and with such rights and privileges as the court or judge may determine.\nSection 80 of the Supreme Court Act is in these terms:\nAn appellant may discontinue his proceedings by giving to the respondent a notice entitled in the Supreme Court and in the cause, and signed by the appellant, his attorney or solicitor, stating that he discontinues such proceedings.\nO\u2019Meara for Currie.\nRaney K.C. for respondent Watson.\nJudgment was pronounced by the court on the same day holding that Currie had no status in the appeal although he had given security without objection by the respondent. He was not a party to the case and had not appeared in the court below. If he desired to intervene, he should have taken the steps required by Rule 60. To permit him now to intervene to prosecute the appeal which the sole appellant properly in the record has evinced its intention to abandon, would seem tantamount to allowing Mr. Currie to institute an appeal contrary to the prescription of s. 69 of the Supreme Court Act. On the other hand, the appeal of the Imperial Steel Co., Ltd., was still before the court, notice of discontinuance not having been given as prescribed by s. 80. The letter written to the solicitors was not sufficient for that purpose. The court being of the opinion, however, that it was reasonably clear that the appeal lacked substance and that the only appellant who had any status did not intend to prosecute it, dismissed the appeal; but, under all the circumstances, without costs.\nAppeals dismissed.\n"

Its president was one C. H. Cahan, Sr., and amongst its directors were one C. H. Cahan, Jr., son of the former, and one B. F. Bowler, the latter acting also as secretary-treasurer. The appellant kept its bank account at the Merchants Bank of Canada in Montreal; C. H. Cahan, Sr., had bank accounts at the Bank of Montreal at Montreal, with the agency of that bank in New York, and with the Guarantee Trust Company in New York. C. H. Cahan, Jr., had a personal account with the respondent, the Home Bank, and another with the Empire Trust Company in New York; he was also, without the knowledge of his father, dealing in stock speculations and the promotion of companies, and had bank accounts at the (Montreal branch of the Sterling Bank of Canada and with La Banque Provinciale at Montreal and several other banks. As C. H. Cahan, Sr., being extensively engaged in special work during the war, was frequently absent from Montreal for prolonged periods, he gave his son, from time to time temporary powers of attorney to transact his banking business and finally gave him a general power of attorney to draw and sign cheques upon any chartered bank with which he had an account. One of the by-laws of the appellant corporation provided that \"* * * cheques * * * may be made, drawn * * * by the secretary-treasurer, acting\n(a) Appeal to the Privy Council. jointly with the manager, or with any director of the company * * *.\" Bowler, placing himself in the hands of C. H. Cahan, Jr., signed whatever cheques the latter directed him to sign. During the absence of his father, C. H. Cahan, Jr., carried on an extensive exchange of cheques and, using all the above mentioned bank accounts, practised what is commonly known as \"kiting.\" Amongst others, ninety-four cheques were thus drawn on the appellant's bank account in the Merchants Bank, which were presented for payment by or under the direction of Cahan, Jr., not at the office of the Merchants Bank, but at the office of the respondent bank, which credited the proceeds of the cheques to the private account of Cahan, Jr., or, in some cases, paid them to him in cash. These cheques were presented to the Merchants Bank by the respondent bank which received from the former the proceeds amounting in the aggregate to $205,960.37. The money which, was requisite and available in the Merchants Bank of Canada for the payment of the cheques consisted, in addition to the appellant's small balance in its bank account, of money provided by deposits by Cahan, Jr., of cheques drawn on his father's bank accounts, and on the different other banks. When Cahan, Jr., disappeared from Montreal, and his father became aware of the condition of the appellant company's affairs, the present action was instituted for the recovery of the sum of $205,960.37. The appellant company alleged that the Home Bank received the proceeds of the ninety-four cheques wrongfully, fraudulently and in breach of trust; that these cheques on their face showed that Cahan, Jr., was using them for his own purposes; that the bank to which they were delivered took them with notice and knowledge of his defective title, or wilfully abstained from making any inquiry as to the nature and extent of the power and authority of Cahan, Jr., and Bowler, and in bad faith participated in their wrongful acts, thereby enabling C. H. Cahan, Jr., to appropriate to his personal use and benefit the funds out of which these cheques were met and paid by the Merchants Bank of Canada and which always were the property of the Corporation Agencies, Limited. The bank joined issue with the appellant and, in addition, filed a special defence to the effect that it received the cheques for value and in due course, that it became the owner and proprietor of the cheques; and further pleaded that during the whole of the period when these cheques were being issued irregularly, as alleged, Corporation Agencies, Ltd., had not assets to represent, in whole or in part, the sum which it pretends to have lost by reason of the facts set up in its declaration.\nHeld, Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting, that the appellant company was not entitled to recover from the respondent bank the amount claimed by its action; that as the funds with which the cheques were met were neither the property nor in the legal possession of the appellant company, the latter had failed to show such an interest as is requisite to entitle it to bring an action at law (Art. 77 C.C.P.); that although at the time the money so withdrawn apparently stood to the credit of the appellant company in the Merchants Bank of Canada, it cannot be considered to have been in its possession, since, according to the doctrine of the Civil Law, possession in the legal sense cannot be acquired without the volition (volont\u00e9) of the possessor; and as volition cannot exist without consent or knowledge, there never was possession by the appellant company of the funds in question. There was not the intention to possess, nor possession animo domini. Held further, Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting, that the appellant cannot maintain a claim for accounting for the fund which stood in its name at the Merchants Bank of Canada, as no contractual relation existed between appellant and respondent nor any obligation on the latter's part to maintain such fund; an essential condition of the action condictio ob injustam causam, ownership of the moneys with which the cheques were paid, is wanting; if considered as an action for damages, the only damages recoverable would be the amount of the loss of the appellant and there was no loss in fact; neither could appellant succeed, even were possession admitted, under the principle of possession vaut titre, since that doctrine does not apply in the case of cr\u00e9ances, and moreover it affords essentially a plea which can be invoked only by the possessor while in possession and to repel an attack upon his possession; neither can the appellant's action be maintained as an action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'indu; nor can it be based on a possible future claim against it by Cahan, Sr., or the other corporations whose accounts were used in the kiting operations; and, finally, the assertion by the appellant of a right to the moneys deposited by Cahan, Jr., involves its ratification of the entire fraudulent scheme of the latter.\nPer Duff and Newcombe JJ., dissenting.\u2014The respondent received the proceeds of the cheques in question from the appellant's bank account out of moneys which were in the appellant's possession and without the appellant's authority, having notice, of which the cheques themselves were prima facie evidence, that Cahan, Jr., the respondent's endorser, was not entitled to the cheques or to appropriate their proceeds, and in these circumstances the appellant was entitled to recover from the respondent bank the amount so received by it as money had and received by the appellant to the respondent's use, or as money of the appellant received by the respondent which was not due to the latter, (Art. 1047 C.C.; while it may be less likely that two directors would lend themselves to the fraudulent purpose of appropriating the company's money for the private uses of one of them than that the latter alone should do so, it is nevertheless, even where two directors join, prima facie evidence of fraud that one of them is making use of the company's funds for his own individual purposes; Cahan, Jr., and Bowler had, by the appellant company's by-laws, explicit authority to endorse cheques payable to the company's order and the proceeds of such cheques so endorsed and deposited by them in the appellant's bank account came into the appellant's possession as credits belonging to the appellant and under its control, because these proceeds were so deposited by the appellant's appointed agents in its account upon which it could have operated; if the appellant's officers, other than Cahan, Jr., and Bowler, did not know that the money had been deposited before the respondent drew it out, they had means of knowledge by the exercise of which, with ordinary diligence, they would have become aware of it, and the appellant therefore could not escape liability to the owners of the money deposited upon the ground that it was ignorant of the deposits; it was unnecessary to consider the effect of the kiting of the cheques, because independently of any cheques which represented kiting transactions there was actual money in the case to an amount in excess of that which the appellant claimed; the appellant was entitled by reason of its right and title of possessor to maintain this action as against the respondent, which was a wrongdoer, and had wrongfully deprived the appellant of its possession. APPEAL per saltum from the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J., province of Quebec, dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nE. Lafleur K.C., G. Barclay and W. R. Henry for the appellant.\u2014The moment that it appeared to the respondent bank that these cheques had been drawn by C. H. Cahan, Jr., as agent, to be disposed of by such agent for his own purposes, either to pay the agent's personal indebtedness to the respondent bank, or to be credited in the agent's personal account with the respondent bank, such credits being drawn upon by the agent for his own private business and speculations, that moment the respondent bank ceased to act in good faith, and in so taking and applying the cheques participated knowingly in the wrongful acts of such agent.\nThere was no valid delivery of these cheques to the respondent, inasmuch as the respondent never became a holder in due course.\nThe authority of C. H. Cahan, Jr., to draw cheques was limited; it did not include any authority to draw cheques for his own benefit; nor did it include authority to dispose, for his own benefit, of the cheques when drawn.\nThe respondent was not in good faith; and even if acting in good faith, had notice of defect in the title of Cahan, Jr., to the ninety-four cheques.\nAlthough the credits which the appellant had', from time to time, in its account with the Merchants Bank, upon which these cheques were drawn, represented, in a considerable part, funds of other persons and companies, which had been deposited to the credit of the appellant's account, nevertheless the appellant had title to the credits in its account and legal title to its cheques, or, in any event, appellant had an interest in its cheques and in the proceeds thereof, which entitled it to maintain the present action.\nThe respondent bank cannot, by virtue of the provisions of Art. 1031 of the Civil Code, exercise, in the present action, the rights and actions of Cahan, Jr., against the appellant, if any exist, as a defence to appellant's demand herein. Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C., and W. K. McKeown K.C. for the respondent.\u2014The respondent bank was a holder in due course, and in particular had no notice of the alleged defects in the title of Cahan, Jr.\nThere was no defect in the title of Cahan, Jr., to the cheques sued on.\nThe appellant sustained no loss whatever as a consequence of the cheques sued on.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Rinfret J.J.) was delivered by\nE. Lafleur K.C., G. Barclay and W. R. Henry for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C., and W. K. McKeown K.C. for the respondent.\nRinfret J.\u2014Corporation Agencies, Limited, brought suit and prayed that the Home Bank of Canada be condemned to pay to it the sum of $209,028.12.\nThe ground of the action was that, under the circumstances stated in the declaration, the Home Bank received the proceeds of ninety-six cheques wrongfully and fraudulently and in breach of their trust drawn in the name of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., upon the Merchants Bank of Canada by C. H. Cahan, Jr., purporting to act as director of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., and one B. F. Bowler, purporting to act as secretary-treasurer; that these cheques on their face showed that Cahan, Jr., was using them for his own purposes; that the bank to which they were delivered took them with notice and knowledge of the defective title, or wilfully abstained from making any inquiry as to the nature and extent of the power and authority of Cahan, Jr. and Bowler, and in bad faith wilfully participated in the wrongful acts of the latter, thereby enabling C. H. Cahan, Jr. to appropriate to his personal use and benefit the funds out of which these cheques were met and paid by the Merchants Bank of Canada and which always were and now are the property of the Corporation Agencies, Limited.\nThe Home Bank joined issue with the Corporation Agencies, Ltd.; and, in addition, filed a special defence to the effect that it received the cheques for value and in due course, that it became the owner and proprietor of the cheques; and further pleaded that during the whole of the period when these cheques were being issued irregularly, as alleged, the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., had not assets to represent, in whole or in part, the sum which it pretends to have lost by reason of the facts set up in its declaration. Mr. Justice Maclennan, before whom the action was first tried, considered that the form of the cheques on their face was notice of the fact that C. H. Cahan, Jr., was appropriating to his own use the monies of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd. Thus the Home Bank was put upon inquiry as to his authority and right to issue and use the cheques; and, by refraining from making any inquiry, it participated in the wrongful act of C. H. Cahan, Jr.; it did not act in good faith and was not the holder in due course of the cheques. On the plea that the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., never had assets to represent, in whole or in part, the total aggregate sum of the cheques, he was of the opinion that the sources from which the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., received the monies out of which its bank paid them were irelevant in an issue between the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., and the Home Bank. He therefore condemned the Home Bank to pay to the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., the sum of $205,960.37. This sum is slightly under the amount of the original claim because evidence was lacking to show that two of the cheques were cleared by the Home Bank.\nThe Court of King's Bench (appeal side) however reversed the rulings of the trial judge which rejected evidence offered tending to show that the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., loss was less than the amount claimed, and it accordingly ordered that the record be remitted to the Superior Court and the enqu\u00eate reopened, so that the parties might be afforded an opportunity of examining further witnesses and of adducing evidence in support of this issue.\nThe reasons of each of the judges sitting in appeal are worth referring to.\nChief Justice Lamothe said:\u2014\nSans entrer dans le m\u00e9rite de la cause; je suis d'avis que la motion de la banque appelante aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. La date banque a le droit de prouver que la compagnie demanderesse-intim\u00e9e n'a rien perdu par suite des cheques tir\u00e9s sur la Banque des Marchands, vu que l'argent provenant de ces cheques a \u00e9t\u00e9 re-mis au cr\u00e9dit du compte de la date compagnie demanderesse \u00e0 la Banque des Marchands. Apr\u00e8s preuve faite sur ce point, la cour sera en position de dire si, en droit, la pr\u00e9tention de la Home Bank sur ce point est fond\u00e9e ou non. S'il est \u00e9tabli que les sommes ainsi remises au cr\u00e9dit de la compagnie intim\u00e9e proviennent d'autres sources, que ces sommes sont, par exemple, le produit d'autres vols ou d\u00e9falcations en tout ou en partie, la cons\u00e9quence l\u00e9gale pourra \u00eatre que la Home Bank ne peut en demander le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. Mais il faut d'abord que la preuve se fasse. Mr. Justice Martin said:\u2014\nWhile I express no opinion on the legal effect of any proof that may be made or whether or not appellant can successfully urge that the amount of its liability, if any, towards respondent should be reduced by amounts which Cahan, Jr., paid into the Merchants Bank to respondents' credit whether from moneys by him misappropriated from others or otherwise, I am of opinion) that the appellant should have been allowed to amend its plea in so far as it amplifies the allegations of par. 46, and that it should have been granted an opportunity to examine the witness Bowler, respondents' secretary-treasurer, who signed the cheques with Cahan, Jr., and who must have had an intimate knowledge of all the transactions in question.\nThe rights and obligations of the parties must and can only be determined after full opportunity is afforded all parties in interest to allege and urge their respective pretentions and support same if they can by legal proof.\n*****\nThe learned trial judge held that the sources from which the respondent received the moneys out of which its bankers paid) these cheques is irrelevant. In a restricted sense this is true, but as a practical business proposition, I should say it is wrong in principle. If Cahan, Jr., one day fraudulently obtained from respondent $10,000 of its moneys and the next day brought back and deposited to its credit $5,000, manifestly Cahan, Jr., could urge that and anyone else legally bound with him by reason of knowledge of or complicity in the fraud could also do so.\nMr. Justice Greenshields said:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the appellant, the Home Bank, should not be denied the right to endeavour to prove that the whole, or some part, of the money withdrawn upon the cheques signed by Cahan, Jr., subsequently reached the credit and control of the company respondent by being deposited to its credit, with its banker, the Merchants Bank of Canada. I freely admit that the respondent should not lose by reason of the illegal acts of Cahan, Jr., if they were illegally participated in by the appellant (if participation took place); but I am yet to be convinced that the respondent should be enabled to make a profit by these illegal acts. Without expressing an opinion on the merits, but solely for the purpose of my judgment on these rulings at enqu\u00eate by the trial judge I do not believe the respondent could maintain an action for a greater amount against the Home Bank of Canada (appellant) than it could against Cahan, Jr., by reason of the dealings with these cheques.\nMr. Justice Allard said:\u2014\nL'appelante, la Home Bank, a le droit de prouver que l'intim\u00e9e n'a rien perdu par suite des op\u00e9rations de banque du fils de M. Cahan, et que l'argent, tir\u00e9 du compte de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la banque des Marchands, a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au credit de son compte, \u00e0 la dite banque. Quand cette preuve sera faite, la cour aura \u00e0 decider si, en droit, la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante est bien fond\u00e9e.\nThe case was accordingly retried by Mr. Justice Duclos, who heard all the new evidence. He considered that the Home Bank obtained the cheques in question for value, in good faith and without knowledge or notice, express or constructive, of the alleged defect in the title of Cahan, Jr., that the circumstances existing at the time these cheques were paid by the bank were of a nature to allay and lull to sleep any suspicion that might have arisen in the bank manager's mind, that the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., suffered no loss by reason of the withdrawal of funds by means of these cheques, and that the money with which they were paid was not the money of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., but was stolen money to which it could acquire no title; and he therefore dismissed the action with costs.\nAn appeal is now brought directly to this court from the judgment of Mr. Justice Duclos by consent of the parties.\nIt is evident that the Court of King's Bench thought it material to ascertain whether the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., loss was less than the amount claimed by it, or whether it had met any loss at all. It would be unreasonable to assume that otherwise it would have remitted the record to the Superior Court for the purpose of this inquiry.\nBeing of opinion that the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., cannot succeed against the Home Bank, at all events unless it has shown itself to have been either the owner or the legal possessor of the monies withdrawn, and that Corporation Agencies, Ltd., never was the owner or never had possession of the kind or in the quality which might entitle it to revendicate, it is apparent that it will not be necessary to decide whether the defendant bank was a holder in due course, which would involve a difficult choice between the holdings of fact of the two trial judges on that point. To put it perhaps more precisely: if the funds with which the cheques were met were neither the property nor in the legal possession of Corporation Agencies, Ltd., it has failed to show such an interest as is requisite to entitle it to bring an action at law (C.C.P. Art. 77).\nThe first cheque upon which the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., now seeks to recover is dated the 29th March, 1919, and the last the 20th December, 1919. At the date of the issue of the first cheque, the balance standing to the credit of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., in the Merchants Bank of Canada was only $61.74. For the whole period with which we are concerned, the Corporation Agencies Ltd., was practically dormant. It had no business of any consequence during the years 1918 and 1919 and merely acted as registrar or transfer agent for certain other companies and as trustee for one company.\nThe statement of the Merchants Bank of Canada, as well as a number of other statements emanating from Corporation Agencies, Ltd., and prepared by its president himself, or at his request, were filed at the second trial. A firm of chartered accountants made an examination of them; in adition, the exhibits were placed before them. In connection with their investigation, they prepared certain schedules and made a report based entirely on the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., own figures and statements. These showed that, as a result of the transactions of C. H. Cahan, Jr., during the period of time for which the cheques in question were drawn, i.e., between 29th March and 31st December, 1919, the minimum gain in Corporation Agencies, Ltd., account was $2,887.42, and the maximum gain was $8,350.89, according as certain items are or are not charged to C. H. Cahan, Jr., or the sundry corporations which he used for the purposes of his operations.\nThis report takes into account the regular and legitimate business of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., as distinguished from the irregular transactions, as they were qualified by the president of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., Mr. Cahan, Sr., himself.\nThe accountants showed that, for the period covered by the ninety-six cheques, the deposits made in Corporation Agencies' account in the Merchants Bank by Cahan, Jr., were in excess of the withdrawals. During this same period, all that Corporation Agencies, Ltd., received from its clients and paid into its bank account was a sum of $5,890.34, while the amount which it paid out in the course of its legitimate business was $8,402.35, or a surplus of $2,512.01, which came out of the funds irregularly deposited by Cahan, Jr.\nIt was the conclusion of the chartered accountants\u2014and this was fully borne out by the statements filed\u2014that no money of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., was used to meet the ninety-six cheques irregularly issued by Cahan, Jr., and Bowler. These cheques were only items in a kiting system, or an exchange of cheques carried on by Cahan, Jr., and each of them was fully met by money provided from sources other than Corporation Agencies, Ltd.\nKiting has been described by the witnesses as a scheme \"for obtaining credit for a short period by running three or four accounts\" or \"getting credit for the time it takes to clear cheques from one bank to another.\"\nThe evidence is overwhelming, and in fact it is not disputed, that the operations of Cahan, Jr., in connection with the cheques sued upon were nothing but kiting. To give some idea of their extent, Cahan, Jr., for that purpose, used as many as twelve bank accounts, there being, in addition to the account of Corporation Agencies, Ltd., in the Merchants Bank of Canada, the accounts of his father in the Bank of Montreal at Montreal, the Bank of Montreal at New York, the Guarantee Trust Company in New York; his own personal accounts in the Home Bank of Canada and in the Empire Trust Company, in New York; and also the accounts of several companies, such as Canadian Records Press, Ltd., Dominion Operating Company, Hotel Company of St. John, Ltd., International Exploration Company, Ltd.; and also private accounts under the name of George V. Greene and Olive Trevor. Outside of the Merchants Bank of Canada, the Home Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal and the New York institutions already mentioned, several other banks were used: the Standard Bank of Canada, La Banque d'Hochelaga, La Banque Provinciale, the Sterling Bank, the Montreal City and District Savings Bank and the Bank of Toronto.\nTwo items will suffice to show at once the volume and the nature of the transactions. A recapitulation of the deposits from March 29th, 1919, to the end of the year, shows that they amounted to $2,108,452.01, of which only $5,890.34 had to do with the regular business of Corporation Agencies, Ltd. A study of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., account in the Merchants Bank discloses that it had no assets to represent, in whole or in part, the amount of the ninety-six cheques, and that they were fully met by money from other sources. The cheques that came in and went out always offset each other. It was not, as in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. La Banque d'Hochelaga[1], a case of repayment of the money withdrawn by means of cheques; but a deposit was made in the account before each cheque was presented for the purpose of meeting it. As a matter of fact, although the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., had practically no funds and notwithstanding the large amounts irregularly withdrawn, at no time was its bank account overdrawn.\nIt may be true that an examination of the total operations since 1915 would show a loss by Corporation Agencies, Ltd., although that could never exceed a sum slightly over $30,000, half of which was represented by the unauthorized sale of Victory Bonds payable to bearer and has nothing to do with the case here.\nAs observed by Duclos J. in the course of the enqu\u00eate,\nall the assets Corporation Agencies Ltd. had to lose was $30,900. They could not lose what they had not got.\nBut this money had already been lost for some time when the first of the cheques here sued on was presented by Cahan, Jr. It should not be forgotten that the present action is not brought for the recovery of the amount which Corporation Agencies, Ltd., has lost at the hands of Cahan, Jr. That would entail an accounting between the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., and the latter since 1915, and with that accounting the Home Bank of Canada is not concerned. This action is limited to ninety-six specified cheques. The charge is that by means of these cheques the funds of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., have been irregularly withdrawn. The onus is upon the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., to show that these cheques were met by its funds; and from that inquiry must be excluded funds antecedently withdrawn.\nThe trial judge to whom the case was remitted for the purpose of making such inquiry, found as a fact that none of these cheques were paid out of the funds of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd. They were paid out of funds provided by Cahan, Jr.\nUpon the evidence, these findings are correct.\nIt follows that Corporation Agencies, Ltd., failed to establish what it alleged as the basis of its declaration, to wit: that the proceeds of the ninety-six cheques\nalways were and now are the property of the plaintiff.\nThe appellant had to establish the foundation of its action. It is erroneous to say that the bank cannot raise such a question because it would be tantamount to putting forward a defence which belongs only to Cahan, Jr. Before the bank is required to enter upon its defence, the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., must prove its interest in the case and establish its right of action. It is significant that, at the outset, the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., relied on the ground that the monies with which the cheques were paid were its property and that this contention, after two trials, appeared so devoid of foundation that before this court it felt obliged to put its case on an entirely different footing.\nIt is now claimed that, even if the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., was not the owner of the funds, it is nevertheless entitled to recover them because, at the time they were withdrawn, they stood to its credit in the Merchants Bank of Canada, and should be considered to have been in its possession. It was contended that the possession of the monies which it thus had, without ownership thereof, suffices to enable it to maintain this action against the defendant bank because of their wrongful withdrawal by means of the fraudulent cheques made by C. H. Cahan, Jr., and of which the bank obtained payment as holder.\nThe monies were put into the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., account at the Merchants Bank mostly in the form of cheques, but, for the present purposes, cheques are not different from money, and the statement of Lord Halsbury in The Great Western Ry. Co. v. The London and County Banking Co. Ltd.[2], can be made with equal force\nthe supposed distinction between the title to the cheque itself and the title to the money obtained or represented by it seems to me absolutely illusory\nin a Quebec case.\nNow the deposit by Cahan, Jr., of monies or cheques which did not belong to the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., was wholly unauthorized. He was no more authorized to make the irregular deposits, than he was to make the irregular withdrawals. Even if the by-laws of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., empowered its directors or its officers to make deposits on its behalf, clearly this must be understood of regular and legitimate deposits only. For it cannot be conceived that these by-laws anticipated the possibility of there being paid into the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., bank account monies which were illegally procured or stolen. The Corporation Agencies, Ltd, could not be bound by the consequences of the irregular deposits until they had come to its knowledge and it had ratified them expressly or tacitly (Art. 1727 C.C.). Here both trial judges have found that the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., was absolutely without notice of the fraudulent transactions of Cahan, Jr., and that the monies were deposited without its consent or knowledge. Nor can the knowledge of Cahan, Jr., of the deposits which he made in fraud of Corporation Agencies, Ltd., be attributed to it for the purpose of supplying the element of volition necessary to convert its mere temporary detention of the monies so deposited into legal possession. There are no special circumstances in this case which would take it out of the general rule that notice of a fraud committed by an agent upon or against his principal and of the facts and circumstances connected with it is not imputed to the latter. Such is the well-established doctrine in English Law (Bowstead, Agency, 7th Ed., p. 336; The Commercial Bank of Windsor v. Morrison[3], and I know of no reason why it should not prevail in Quebec. See 8 Revue L\u00e9gale, n.s. 297. Moreover, by paragraph 6 of its answer to the amended plea, the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., sets up as a ground why knowledge of the acts of Cahan, Jr., and Bowler should not be imputed to it, that these acts were done in fraud and were kept hidden from any officer or employee of the company. The doctrine of imputation of knowledge to the principal because of knowledge by the agent is for the benefit of third parties; to find the principal invoking it on his own behalf savours of novelty. Finally, the volition (volont\u00e9) requisite to legal possession implies something more than merely constructive notice or knowledge by imputation.\nQuite independently of the particular character of bank deposits, which will have to be examined later, it is strictly according to the doctrine of the civil law that possession in the legal sense cannot be acquired without the volition (volont\u00e9) of the possessor; and as volition cannot exist without consent or knowledge, there never was here possession by the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., of the funds so deposited. There must be the intention to possess and the possession must be animo domini. This accords with the jurisprudence in Quebec (Lafortune v. V\u00e9zina[4]; Langelier, Cours de Droit Civil, vol. VI, p. 445) ; and with the doctrine of the French authors which is conveniently collected in Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire du Droit Fran\u00e7ais, verbo Possession; nos. 3, 4, 26, 28 and 38:\n3. * * * Il importe donc, pour mieux pr\u00e9ciser la notion de possession, de la distinguer soigneusement de deux autres institutions avec lesquelles un examen superficiel pourrait amener \u00e0 la confondre: la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la d\u00e9tention. D'une part, en effet, la possession ne doit pas \u00eatre confondue avec le droit (de propri\u00e9t\u00e9) lui-m\u00eame dont elle n'est que la manifestation ext\u00e9rieure; comme le disent les textes romains, nihil commune habet proprietas cum possessione (fgt. 12, par. 1, D. de acq. vel amitt. poss. XLI, 2) : c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans cette distinction entre le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la possession que r\u00e9side tout l'int\u00e9r\u00eat pratique de la th\u00e9orie juridique de la possession. D'autre part, il peut se faire qu'une personne tienne de fait une chose sous sa puissance, sans avoir l'intention de la soumettre \u00e0 l'exercice d'un droit r\u00e9el; ce fait prend alors plus particuli\u00e8rement le nom de d\u00e9tention.\n4. La d\u00e9tention constitue donc une situation juridique parfaitement d\u00e9finie et qui est tout \u00e0 fait distincte de la possession v\u00e9ritable; elle en diff\u00e8re par l'absence de l'animus. * * *\n26. Selon une doctrine traditionnelle qui vient du droit romain, la possession se compose de deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments: l'un mat\u00e9riel, appel\u00e9 le corpus, l'autre intentionnel, appel\u00e9 l'animus. Sur ce point, et notamment en ce qui concerne l'animus domini, les r\u00e9dacteurs du code civil s'en sont tenus aux id\u00e9es traditionnelles de Pothier, de Domat et de Dunod, et par cons\u00e9quent il n'y a point lieu, dans une \u00e9tude des textes du code civil, de se pr\u00e9occuper de la question, aujourd'hui tr\u00e8s-controvers\u00e9e, de savoir si, au point de vue des textes du droit romain, la possession supposait n\u00e9cessairement l'animus domini. On ne peut en effet, interpr\u00e9ter notre code \u00e0 l'aide de th\u00e9ories nouvelles qui constituent non un d\u00e9veloppement doctrinal ou jurisprudentiel, mais une critique de notre l\u00e9gislation.\n28. L'animus constitue l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment immat\u00e9riel de la possession. Suivant la doctrine traditionnelle, enseign\u00e9e par Savigny, l'animus est l'intention chez celui qui poss\u00e8de de se comporter vis-\u00e0-vis de la chose comme un v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire, c'est l'animus domini. Suivant une doctrine plus r\u00e9cente, expos\u00e9e par Ihering, l'animus serait seulement l'intention de poss\u00e9der, animus rem sibi habere. On peut d\u00e9finir l'animus sous une forme plus large, en disant que c'est l'intention chez celui qui poss\u00e8de d'agir pour son propre compte.\n39. L'animus \u00e9tant l'intention de se comporter \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire d'une chose ou de titulaire d'un droit, il ne peut y avoir d'acquisition de possession sans la volont\u00e9 de poss\u00e9der \u00e0 un titre quelconque. Il suit de l\u00e0 que celui qui ach\u00e8te une chose et auquel on en livre une autre qu'il prend par erreur, n'acquiert la possession ni de l'une ni de l'autre; car il ne poss\u00e8de pas celle qu'il a achet\u00e9e, puisqu'elle ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e, ni celle qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e, puisqu'il n'a pas eu l'intention de la poss\u00e9der. De m\u00eame, la volont\u00e9 de poss\u00e9der \u00e9tant de l'essence de la possession, il s'ensuit que ceux qui sont incapables de volont\u00e9, tels que les impub\u00e8res et les fous, ne peuvent acqu\u00e9rir la possession; mais ils le peuvent par le tuteur qui les repr\u00e9sente. Une femme peut acqu\u00e9rir la possession sans l'autorisation de son mari, car la possession est une chose de fait; mais elle ne pourrait, sans en \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e, exercer les droits qui r\u00e9sultent de cette possession.\nPothier, De la possession:\n40. Il est \u00e9vident qu'on ne peut acqu\u00e9rir la possession d'une chose, sans avoir la volont\u00e9 de la poss\u00e9der.\nPar exemple, on me fait entrer dans le cabinet d'une personne \u00e0 qui je vais rendre une visite: en l'attendant je prends un livre que je trouve sur son bureau, pour voir ce que c'est; il est \u00e9vident que, quoique je l'aie entre mes mains, je n'en acquiers pas la possession; car je n'ai pas la volont\u00e9 de le poss\u00e9der.\nPareillement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des h\u00e9ritages: si, dans un voyage, je vais coucher au ch\u00e2teau de mon ami en son absence; quoique je sois seul dans ce ch\u00e2teau, je n'en acquiers pas la possession; car je n'ai pas la volont\u00e9 de l'acqu\u00e9rir: Qui jure familiaritatis amici fundum ingressus est, non videtur possidere, quia non eo animo ingressus est ut possideat, lic\u00e8t corpore in fundo sit; L. 41, ff. de Acq. poss.\nDe ce principe, \"que pour acqu\u00e9rir la possession d'une chose, il faut avoir la volont\u00e9 de la poss\u00e9der,\" il s'ensuit que, si j'ai achet\u00e9 de vous une chose, et que vous m'en livriez une autre, que je prends par erreur pour celle que j'ai achet\u00e9e et dont j'ai intention d'acqu\u00e9rir la possession, je n'acquiers la possession ni de celle que j'ai acquise par erreur, parce que ce n'est pas celle dont j'ai la volont\u00e9 d'acqu\u00e9rir la possession, ni de celle que j'ai la volont\u00e9 d'acqu\u00e9rir, parce que je ne l'ai pas re\u00e7ue: Si me in vacuam possessionem fundi Corneliani miseris, ego putarem me in fundum Sempronianum missum, et in Cornelianum iero, non acquiram possessionem, nisi forte in nomine tant\u00f9m erraverimus, in corpore consentiamus; L. 34 ff. eod. tit.\nThe above doctrine is also expounded in Aubry & Rau, tome 2, paragraphs 177 and 179; Baudry-Lacantinerie & Tissier, nos. 195, 197, 203, 216; Planiol, 6th ed. tome 1, no. 2269; Laurent, 5 ed. vol. 32, pp. 273 and 276; Colin & Capitant, vol. 1, pp. 873 and seq.\nThe same doctrine will also be found in Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, verbo Possession, nos. 7, 8, 21, 23, 25, 26, 51, etc.\nBoth Laurent (vol. 32, p. 270) and Fuzier-Herman (Repertoire, verbo Possession, no. 5) allude to Troplong's opinion that\ndans la doctrine du code, les d\u00e9tenteurs pr\u00e9caires sont aussi des possesseurs, de sorte que toute d\u00e9tention serait une possession (and state that he has) vainement essay\u00e9 de soutenir que l'article 2228 C.C. s'applique aux simples d\u00e9tenteurs; que ceux-ci sont des possesseurs dans le sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du mot et que leur possession produit certains effets de droit.\nThey both show that he alone, of all the French authors, entertains such an opinion.\nSuch being the doctrine and the French law of possession, Corporation Agencies, Ltd., never had the possession because it lacked the animus possidendi or intention to possess, or what Saleilles calls \"la volont\u00e9 possessore.\" Planiol, vol. 1, p. 701, points out: \"Sans volont\u00e9, point de rapport possessore; par exemple, il n'y a pas de possession si quis dormienti aliquid in manu ponat (Paul, au Digeste XLI, 2 fr. 1, par. 3).\"\nNot only Corporation Agencies, Ltd., had not the will to possess, but it had absolutely no knowledge or notice of what was going on ; and, indeed, this has been its attitude throughout this case.\nIt had no more possession of the monies put by Cahan, Jr., into its account in the Merchants Bank than it would have had if Cahan, Jr., had simply placed them, without its knowledge, in the vault in its office and, subsequently, had taken them out and remitted them direct to the Home Bank. In neither case could it be said that, in the course of these operations, Corporation Agencies, Ltd., had, at any moment, acquired possession of the monies.\nThere is this difference however between the supposed deposit in a vault and the deposit in a bank, that in the case of banking, there is no \"d\u00e9p\u00f4t r\u00e9gulier.\" A banker is not a depositary \"bound to restore the identical thing which he has received in deposit\" (Art. 1904 C.C.). The customer parts with the title to his money and loans it to the banker, the result being to make the bank the debtor of the customer with the sole obligation of honouring the customer's drafts or cheques.\nThis conception of banking is generally accepted, as well in the other provinces of Canada and in England as it is in France and in the province of Quebec. Falcon-bridge, Banking and Bills of Exchange, 3rd ed. p. 311; Foley v. Hill[5]; Robarts v. Tucker[6]; In re Derbyshire. Webb v. Derbyshire[7]; Marine Bank v. Fulton Bank[8]; Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3rd ed. Du d\u00e9p\u00f4t et du s\u00e9questre, no. 1097; Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire, verbo Banque, nos. 3 and 4; Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire du Droit Fran\u00e7ais, verbo Banque, nos. 70-71-72 and 73; Vanier v. Kent[9].\nIn contradistinction to the depositary under the civil code (art. 1803), the banker is authorized to use the money deposited, and his only obligation is to remit an equal sum of money. Notwithstanding this difference, however, the customer may in the normal case be regarded as in possession of the credit which results from his deposit with his banker. But there the volition essential to legal possession is present, whereas what we have in the case at bar is at the utmost a mere detention.\nWe may now consider the nature of the remedy which the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., is seeking.\nIn its factum, the appellant states that, under English law, it might sustain its right to recover under various forms of action, such as an action in trover to recover the cheques, or an action for conversion, or an action for money had and received, or an action for the restoration of property. It however encounters a difficulty in finding under the law of Quebec a principle upon which to base a right of action. That difficulty really is that, in the circumstances of this case, it has no right of action whatever.\nPerhaps it is appropriate to point out here that none of the cases decided in England to which our attention has been drawn has any real application.\nIn the case of North & South Wales Bank v. Irvine[10], which most nearly resembles it, the cheque was signed by Irvine and \"paid out of Irvine's money at his own bankers,\" which had been deposited by himself. Under such circumstances, the inquiry as to \"where he got that money was irrelevant\" and the defendants were held not\nentitled to stand in the shoes of White's trustees and claim against the plaintiff what, in effect, is a set-off, arising out of an indebtedness of the plaintiff, not to themselves but to White.\nBut here the cheques were not paid out of monies belonging to the Corporation Agencies, Ltd.; and that renders the Irvine Case inapplicable.\nThis action cannot be maintained, as suggested by Mr. Lafleur, as one for the restoration of the fund which stood in the name of the appellant at the Merchants Bank of Canada. The obligation to account for that fund was not upon the Home Bank, but only upon the Merchants Bank, which alone had accepted the position of a borrower. There was not and there never existed any contractual relation between the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., and the Home Bank of Canada. Assuming that the appellant's action could be considered as a condictio ob injustam causam, the essential condition of that action, the ownership of the monies with which the cheques were paid, is wanting here (Aubry & Rau, 5th ed. vol. 6, p. 325, par. 442 bis). If the action can be regarded as an action for damages resulting from the abstraction of the funds by means of the fraudulent operations in which the Home Bank is alleged to have participated, then the measure of such damages must be the amount of the loss of Corporation Agencies, Ltd. There was in fact no such loss; the trial judge held that there has been none; and, in our view, that finding is fully justified.\nEven were possession admitted, it would not avail to enable the appellant to institute proceedings. In France, the law is (Art. 2279 C.N.): \"En fait de meubles, la possession vaut titre.\" Nevertheless, all the commentators agree that this article applies only to corporeal moveables and not to \"cr\u00e9ances,\" that it merely creates a presumption of title which may be rebutted, and that the maxim it embodies only affords a defence to a person in actual possession for the purpose of repelling a revendication. See Fuzier-Herman, verbo Possession, nos. 290, 300, 338 and 339; Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire pratique, verbo Possession, nos. 45, 90, 91; Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3rd ed. De la prescription, no, 480; Laurent, 5th ed. vol. 32, nos. 562 and seq. Guillouard, tome 2, no. 847.\nDalloz, Repertoire Pratique, verbo Possession, no. 95, says:\u2014\nL'effet de la r\u00e8gie pos\u00e9e par l'article 2279 est d'emp\u00eacher la revendication des meubles. Le possesseur d'une chose mobili\u00e8re peut repousser la revendication intent\u00e9e contre lui en all\u00e9guant seulement ea possession. (Aubry & Rau, tome 2, paragraph 183, page 158; Laurent, tome 32, n\u00b0 540; Guillouard, tome 2, n\u00b0 879; Baudry-Lacantinerie & Tissier, n\u00b0 879).\nIt is looked upon as being essentially a plea which can be invoked only by the possessor while in possession and to repel an attack upon his possession.\nIf that be true in France, with the law as it is expressed in Art. 2279 of the Code Napoleon, with how much greater force must this doctrine be held to apply here, in view of the corresponding article of the Quebec code, of which the first paragraph is:\u2014\n2268. Actual possession of a corporeal movable, by a person as proprietor, creates a presumption of lawful title. Any party claiming such movable must prove, besides his own right, the defects in the possession or in the title of the possessor who claims prescription, or who, under the provision of the present article, is exempt from doing so. It may be added moreover that, under the law of Quebec, mere possession can seldom be made the basis of an action.\nThe possessor of any immovable or of a real right, other than a farmer on shares, or a holder by sufferance, who is disturbed in his possession, may bring an action on disturbance against the person who prevents his enjoyment, in order to put an end to the disturbance and to be maintained in his possession. (The) person who has had possession of an immovable or real right for a year and a day (can bring) the action for repossession * * * against any person who has forcibly dispossessed him. Art. 1064 C.C.P.\nThis article is limited to the possessor of an immoveable property or a real right.\nIn respect of moveable property, the corresponding procedure is the attachment in revendication. But article 946 of the Code of Civil Procedure gives this remedy to the owner, to the pledgee, the depositary, the usufructuary, the institute in substitution and the substitute. As will be perceived, this enumeration does not include a mere possessor as such. The fact that the article enumerates certain classes of possessors is indicative of the intention to exclude the others. Moreover, the procedure for attachment in revendication applies to moveable property only so far as it can be identified. The appellant here does not meet the conditions required.\nIn the view which we take of the case, neither can this action be maintained as \"l'action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'ind\u00fb\" (Art. 1047 C.C.), for if Corporation Agencies, Ltd., is in a position to disregard and repudiate the cheques entirely and if the money paid out by the Merchants Bank of Canada to meet them did not belong to Corporation Agencies, Ltd., and was so paid without its knowledge and participation, it follows that the appellant has never paid anything and is therefore not entitled to be reimbursed.\nIt has been suggested however that the present action might be entertained as being in anticipation of a possible future claim on behalf of Cahan, Sr., or the other corporations whose accounts have been used in the kiting operations. It is urged that this would constitute the required interest in the appellant to enable it to assert its right of action. It will be sufficient to consider the suggestion with regard to C. H. Cahan, Sr., there being no difference in that respect between his case and those of the other corporations. We are not now called upon to decide whether the appellant company is liable to C. H. Cahan, Sr., or whether the fraudulent withdrawals by C. H. Cahan, Jr., from its bank account without its knowledge or assent would afford the appellant an answer to a claim by C. H. Cahan, Sr. That is not the ground upon which the action was taken and fought out in the court below. The appellant distinctly put its claim on the ground that it was and always had been the owner of the monies with which the cheques were paid by the Merchants Bank of Canada. In fact, the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., appears to have been careful to avoid any admission of liability towards C. H. Cahan, Sr. In view of articles 1048, 1049, 1050, 1051 and 1143 of the Civil Code, the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., being in good faith, it would seem likely that its absolute lack of knowledge of the operations of C. H. Cahan, Jr., of the irregular deposits made by him and of the subsequent withdrawals of the same amounts would protect it against any liability towards C. H. Cahan, Sr. (See Laurent, 5th ed., vol. 32, page 602, no. 585, at the end; Pothier, vol. II, pp. 497 and 498.)\nThere are besides other circumstances which make it highly improbable that a claim of that kind will ever be lodged against the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., by its own president.\nAs for the other sundry corporations or subsidiary companies, where accounts were opened and used for kiting purely and simply, the withdrawals and deposits therein tally to a cent; they never lost anything and they had really nothing to lose.\nBut suffice it to say that in our view this ground is not open here; for Corporation Agencies, Ltd., has not placed itself in a position where it could base its right of action on such an hypothetical interest. Its very allegation that it was the owner of the funds precludes the idea that it was accountable therefor to somebody else.\nAnd, moreover, if its intention was to claim the monies on the ground that it may have to return them to their respective owners, since it is admittedly impossible to reach any final decision on that point without the proper parties being in the case, as the action stands, we are not in a position to decide whether these other parties can claim from the Corporation Agencies, Ltd. If the appellant intended that to be a ground of action, it should have alleged it and should have brought all the required parties into the case so that such an issue might properly be passed upon. Whether, if the appellant be liable to C. H. Cahan, Sr., that liability would give it a right of action against the Home Bank before C. H. Cahan, Sr., asserts and establishes his right of recovery against it is, at first sight, a question admitting of the gravest doubt and which personally we would be inclined to answer in the negative (Pothier, vol. II, no. 498); but it is unnecessary to decide it until it comes up in a proper case.\nFinally it would appear that the appellant cannot assert its right to the monies deposited by Cahan, Jr., without committing itself to a ratification of the fraudulent scheme of the latter, in partial execution whereof such deposits were made, and is thus precluded from repudiating the completion of the scheme by the withdrawal of such monies from its bank account. The whole course of dealing by Cahan, Jr., with the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., bank account, whether in drawing on it or in depositing funds to meet the withdrawals, was unauthorized and the principal cannot repudiate the withdrawals and take the benefit of the deposits. The logical position must be that the whole course of dealing should either be entirely repudiated or wholly accepted. The monies which went into Corporation Agencies, Ltd., account, in the course of the kiting operations, went in for the sole purpose of meeting the incoming cheques as they were issued. They were put in with no other object in view than to cover these cheques, which would not, and could not otherwise have been paid; and all this in a kiting game, where, in most instances, no real deposit was made. There was nothing more than a mere playing with paper. It would appear entirely fallacious to add up the successive deposits and permit the appellant to retain them as against the respondent, while charging to the latter the withdrawals by means of the ninety-six cheques which it was the sole purpose of the deposits to meet when they should be presented to the Merchants Bank. It seems unquestionable, notwithstanding the large aggregate amount of deposits and withdrawals, that, in the course of the kiting operations, a very much smaller amount was actually in turn deposited and withdrawn, with the net result that in the end the real balance of the appellant was in no wise impaired. The following passage from the well-known case of Atlantic Cotton Mills v. Indian Orchard Mills[11], seems to be absolutely in point and may be adopted, at least as ratio scripta, as correctly expressing the situation:\nThe rule is general that, if one assumes to do an act which will be for the benefit of another, commits a fraud in so doing and the person to whose benefit the fraud will enure seeks, after knowledge of the fraud, to avail himself of that act, and to retain the benefit of it, he must be held to adopt the whole act, fraud and all, and to be chargeable with the knowledge of it, so far at least as relates to his right to retain the benefit so secured.\nSee also Demolombe, t. 31, no. 202; Dalloz, R\u00e9p. Prat., vo. Quasi-contrat, no. 53. In other words, the appellant cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate at the same time and in the same action. The purpose of C. H. Cahan, Jr., in making the deposits was exclusively to meet the cheques which he had drawn against them. Ratification of that purpose by the appellant involves approval of the monies being used in pursuance of the object for which they were deposited.\nIn the result, if the appellant's contention were sound, it would receive an amount of $205,960.37 on the assumption that it may have to account for it to corporations practically brought into being for mere kiting purposes and whose bank accounts balance to the cent, or to Cahan, Sr., on the ground that part of those monies were stolen from him by Cahan, Jr., and were afterwards by the latter deposited in the Merchants Bank of Canada in the name of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., although they were immediately withdrawn in the same manner, and although the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., had not the slightest suspicion that anything of the kind was going on.\nEither the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., might never be called upon or it would be held liable to account. In the former case it would have got and would keep money to which it never was entitled; in the latter, through the instrumentality of the Corporation Agencies, Ltd., Cahan, Sr., would, to the prejudice of the creditors of the Home Bank, recover the money stolen from him by Cahan, Jr., although most of that money had already been lost before the first of the cheques here in question was cashed by the Home Bank. It is satisfactory that we are not constrained to a conclusion fraught with such consequences.\nFor these reasons, the action fails and: was properly dismissed.\nThe formal judgment should, however, be modified by striking from it the direction that costs to be allowed defendant shall include\ncosts of the schedules and statements specially prepared for this case.\nThese expenses do not form part of the costs of litigation such as are allowed to a successful party on taxation. They are not covered by defendant's conclusion praying costs. While they might be recoverable as damages, as such they are not claimed. The award of these expenses would, therefore, seem to be ultra petita. Moreover, the very special circumstances requisite to justify such a recovery are not presented on the record before us.\nAs a rule, this court will refuse to interfere with the discretion of the provincial courts in disposing of costs. But this is a case where we think an exception ought to be made. The appeal is per saltum and the extraordinary disposition as to costs made by the Superior Court has not therefore received the approval of the Court of King's Bench. These seem to us to be reasons which justify our dealing with the costs as we believe the Court of King's Bench would probably have done, had it been afforded the opportunity. A well-established rule is that, though the appeal involve costs only, the Court of King's Bench will rectify the decision of the court below when the latter appears to have proceeded upon an erroneous principle. Prowse v. Nicholson[12]; Atlantic Ry. Co. v. Trudeau[13]; D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne v. Dussault[14]. This view was affirmed by this court in Archibald v. Delisle[15].\nNow, in Quebec, costs are fixed by a tariff having the force of law, after it has received the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The reports and statements of the accountants in this case were not the result of an investigation ordered or of a reference made by the presiding judge (Arts. 391, 410 C.C.P.), but were prepared at the ex-parte request and in the interest of the defendant. As such, they cannot form part of the costs prayed for by the conclusions of the defence (Laurent v. City of Montreal[16]; Hickey v. City of Montreal[17]; Robert v. Denault[18]; Layton v. City of Montreal[19]. At best, they must be made the subject of a special demand (Patenaude v. Edwards[20], and authorities therein referred to).\nThe judgment of the dissenting judges (Duff and Newcombe JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The plaintiff company (appellant) seeks to recover from the defendant bank (respondent) the amount of 94 cheques, in the aggregate $205,960.37, which were drawn upon and paid by the Merchants Bank of Canada at Montreal, together with interest from the respective dates of payment. There is no material difference between the parties as to the facts of the case; these may be stated briefly. The plaintiff is a body corporate under the laws of Canada, having its chief place of business at Montreal, and it was engaged in business as registrar and transfer-agent of the capital stock of joint stock companies and as trustee for the collection of mortgages, insurance, and other company purposes. Prior to the war the plaintiff's business appears to have been active and prosperous, but after the war broke out it became impossible to finance further undertakings; several members of the staff undertook war service, and the business of the company was reduced to the concluding of that which it had in hand, and to the execution of its agency for some companies whose affairs were being wound up. It was in this connection, and owing to losses sustained, that the capital of the company, which was previously authorized to the extent of $500,000, was, on 25th February, 1918, reduced to $50,000. Some changes were at the same time made in the directorate, and, while C. H. Cahan, Sr., who had been serving as president of the company since 1910, continued to hold that office, his son, C. H. Cahan, Jr., and B. F. Bowler became directors, the latter also being charged with the duties of secretary-treasurer. C. H. Cahan, Sr., was a successful lawyer of considerable means. He kept a bank account at the Bank of Montreal at Montreal, another with the agency of that bank in the city of New York, and still another with the Guaranty Trust Company, also in New York, and in each of these accounts there was a large credit balance. While the permanent residence of Mr. Cahan was at Montreal, he was, during the war, very extensively engaged in special work, or professional or other duties connected with the war, and, for this and other reasons which are stated in the evidence, he was frequently absent from home for prolonged periods. Mr. Cahan therefore from time to time, on such occasions, gave his son temporary powers of attorney to transact his banking business; three such powers had been given and had expired when, on 21st September, 1916, Mr. Cahan gave to Cahan, Jr., his power of attorney authorizing the latter\nto sign, endorse, deposit, draw and deliver all such cheques and other orders for the payment of money as he may deem proper in connection with any account of funds on deposit which I may now or hereafter have with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York.\nOn 30th October, 1916, Mr. Cahan gave to his son a similar power of attorney to make, sign and draw cheques on his account with the agents of the Bank of Montreal in the city of New York. On 25th August, 1917, he also gave to his son his power of attorney, until 25th August, 1918,\nto draw and sign cheques upon the Bank of Montreal, including cheques creating an overdraft, and to make, draw, accept and endorse for deposit only in my account and for my credit all bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques or orders for the payment of money or other negotiable paper.\nFinally, on 11th May, 1918, Mr. Cahan gave to his son his power of attorney to draw and sign cheques upon any chartered bank in Canada with which he (Cahan, Sr.) might have an account, including cheques creating an overdraft, but without limiting the time for execution of these powers. Cahan, Jr., was thus equipped with authority from his father to withdraw, on account of the latter, the funds which were standing to his credit in the various accounts mentioned.\nIt appears that the young man, unknown to his father, had, since early in 1915, been engaged in stock speculations, and that he had been carrying on a personal account with the defendant bank at Montreal, and another with the Empire Trust Company in New York. It appears moreover that Cahan, Jr., also without the knowledge of his father, was engaged, with one Geo. V. Green, B. F. Bowler, Morton and Trevor, otherwise known as Carter, and others, in the promotion of a number of companies, among others, Canadian Records Press, Ltd., Dominion Operating Company, Ltd., and Hotel Company of St. John, Ltd., the two first mentioned companies having bank accounts at the Montreal branch of the Sterling Bank of Canada, and the latter having an account with La Banque Provinciale at Montreal.\nCahan, Jr., was an advocate of the province of Quebec and was engaged in his father's office at Montreal, which was situated in the Transportation Building, where the offices of the plaintiff company and of the defendant bank also were; and, in addition to such practice or professional business as he may have had on his own behalf, he attended to minor duties for his father, receiving therefor, from the latter, salary at the rate of $225 per month.\nThere is in evidence by-law no. 54 of the plaintiff company, which provides that:\n54. Contracts and engagements on behalf of the company may be made, and cheques, bills of exchange, promissory notes and other negotiable paper may be made, drawn, accepted or endorsed, by the secretary-treasurer, acting jointly with the manager, or with any director of the company, or by any two directors acting together; provided, however, that cheques, drafts, bills of exchange, promissory note or other negotiable paper may be endorsed for deposit only in the company's bank account by either the manager or the secretary-treasurer acting alone.\nPreviously to 29th March, 1919, the date of the first cheque upon which the plaintiff declares, Cahan, Jr., under his father's power of attorney, had, during the years 1916, 1917 and 1918, already fraudulently withdrawn, for his own purposes, from the agency of the Bank of Montreal in New York and from the Guaranty Trust Company there, substantially the whole of the deposits standing to his father's credit in these accounts; he had also, after becoming a director of the plaintiff company in 1918, turned his attention to the account of the latter as a base of operations against his father's bank account at Montreal, and involved in this fraudulent project were the accounts of the several corporations which Cahan, Jr., appears to have had under his control. At the time of the election of Cahan, Jr., as director of the plaintiff company, and subsequently, its account in the Merchants Bank was, as has already been explained, not very active. The first fraudulent draft upon that account seems to have been made on 1st March, 1918. At that time the balance to the credit of the account was $4,591.71; the transactions in the account which are described as regular, during the period from March, 1918, to December, 1919, inclusive, amount in deposits to $81,947.60, and in withdrawals to $79,635.20. In the interval there was also a series of fraudulent withdrawals and deposits by Cahan, Jr., which were not in fact known to the plaintiff company, nor to any of its officers, except Cahan, Jr., and Bowler, and which were not discovered until after 26th December, 1919. The first draft upon which the plaintiff seeks to recover is dated 29th March, 1919. There were 94 of these cheques drawn from time to time during the period from the last mentioned date up to and inclusive of 26th December, 1919. The earlier fraudulent transactions did not come to light until after the commencement of the action. It would appear that Bowler, who was nominally secretary-treasurer of the plaintiff company, placed himself entirely under the direction of Cahan, Jr., who was acting as the company's manager, and signed such cheques as the latter directed him to sign. The cheques upon which the plaintiff claims were drawn on its bank account in the Merchants Bank, signed by Cahan, Jr., as director of the plaintiff company, and by Bowler as its secretary-treasurer; they were presented: for payment by or under the direction of Cahan, Jr., not at the office of the Merchants Bank, but at the office of the defendant bank, which credited the proceeds of the cheques to the private account of Cahan, Jr., or, in some cases, paid them to Cahan, Jr., in cash. A number of these cheques, not less than 27, including the cheque of 29th March, 1919, first drawn, served to liquidate the personal indebtedness of Cahan, Jr., to the defendant bank by covering the debit balances against him in his private account. Of the 94 cheques, 67, amounting to $146,429.87, were drawn payable to the order of C. H. Cahan, Jr., six others amounting to $16,530.50, were drawn payable to the order of the defendant bank, the first of the cheques so drawn bearing date 14th May, 1919. The remaining cheques, 21 in number, amounting to $43,000, were drawn payable to the order of C. H. Cahan, Jr., or, in several cases, to the order of an agent, his office boy, or Geo. V. Green, or Trevor, each of whom was acting under the direction of Cahan, Jr., or to bearer. The cheques were endorsed by Cahan, Jr., and were presented to the Merchants Bank by the defendant bank, which received from the former the proceeds amounting in the aggregate to $205,960.37, the principal amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the action. The money which was requisite and available in the Merchants Bank of Canada for the payment of these and other cheques consisted, in addition to the plaintiff's legitimate balance in its bank account, of money diverted by Cahan, Jr., through the fraudulent use of his father's powers of attorney, from the latter's bank accounts; deposits of some trust funds which were in the plaintiff's custody, and to which Cahan, Jr., had access; deposits made by Cahan, Jr., out of his private account, or, under Cahan, Jr's., direction, from the accounts in other banks of Geo. V. Green, who was an accomplice of Cahan, Jr., by means of cheques in plaintiff's favour drawn against Green's accounts in the Standard Bank of Canada, and in the Banque d'Hochelaga; cheques of the Hotel Company of St. John, drawn on La Banque Provinciale in plaintiff's favour; cheques of the Dominion Operating Company, drawn on the Sterling Bank; cheques to a comparatively small amount on the Montreal City and Savings Bank; a cheque of the International Exploration Company, Limited, drawn on the Bank of Toronto, and some small miscellaneous deposits of cheques and cash, the sources of which have not been definitely ascertained. These deposits amount in total to a sum much in excess of the amount of the drafts now in suit, and the total ascertained defalcations of Cahan, Jr., likewise greatly exceed the latter amount; but the net total amount admittedly drawn by Cahan, Jr., from his father's bank accounts by means of the fraudulent cheques, which he drew in his father's name in favour of the plaintiff, and which were paid into the plaintiff's account in the Merchants Bank is ascertained at the sum of $132,828.45. These facts appear not to be in dispute. The deposits made by Cahan, Jr., in the plaintiff's bank account may also include, so far as disclosed by the evidence, amounts in the sum of $97,184.21, not traced to any source other than Cahan, Jr., and which may have belonged to him. The withdrawals which Cahan, Jr., made under his powers of attorney against his father's bank accounts extended over a considerable period previous to 1919, and continued during the whole of that year down to 26th December, when Cahan, Jr., disappeared; also, during that period, large deposits were made by Cahan, Jr., to the account of his father in the Bank of Montreal. These deposits were of course made to assist or to promote and maintain the fraudulent project in which Cahan, Jr., was engaged of converting to his own use the funds belonging to his father and to the plaintiff, the immediate source of the diversion being the plaintiff's bank account in the Merchants Bank.\nThere seems to be no doubt that in the course of this fraudulent business there was considerable kiting of cheques, a process which is thus described by the expert accountant who testified for the defendant:\nKiting is a term used with regard to obtaining money by cheques passed through banks without value being deposited against the cheque, that is kiting is an effort to obtain the use of money during the process of a cheque passing through one bank or through a clearing house to another, and perhaps through many more.\nBowler, who was a party to the transactions which he describes, and who was examined as a witness for the defendant, upon commission, says that kiting is a means of getting credit for the time it takes to clear a cheque from one bank to another bank; that cheques are passed from one bank account to another and\ncredit is obtained at the bank into which they are paid for which they are debited at the bank on which they are drawn.\nIt is in this sense apparently that the word is used in the case; but, whatever may have been the nature and effect of the kiting operations, it is apparent, as I shall show, that there was, outside of these, real money involved in the deposits which went to the credit of the plaintiff's account, in addition to the credits which were the result of its ordinary legitimate transactions, to an amount greater than that of the fraudulent cheques upon which this action is brought.\nOn the night of 26th December, 1919, C. H. Cahan, Jr., who had up to that time been living at Montreal, disappeared. He has not since been seen by anybody concerned in the case, and none of these knows where he is to be found. On the following morning his father learned that he had been meddling with the accounts and misappropriating money; enquiries were made, and the case was put into the hands of accountants for investigation. Soon afterwards the action was brought, the plaintiff's declaration being delivered on 7th April, 1920; the plaintiff declared upon 96 cheques, but the claim as to two of them was subsequently abandoned because it was found that these two cheques had not been cleared at the defendant bank. The ground of the action was that Cahan, Jr., fraudulently, in breach of his trust and duty as a director of the plaintiff company, drew these cheques against the plaintiff's account at the Merchants Bank; that the defendant bank to which the cheques were presented for payment cashed them upon the endorsement and at the request of Cahan, Jr., placing the proceeds to the credit of the latter's private account, often in discharge of Cahan, Jr's., overdrafts, or paying the proceeds of them to him directly in cash at the wicket, and that, inasmuch as these cheques were, with few exceptions, made payable to Cahan, Jr., personally, who, in all cases, to the knowledge of the defendant bank, also personally had the benefit of the proceeds, the latter acquired and became the holder of the cheques and received the proceeds from the Merchants Bank with knowledge or notice that Cahan, Jr., was, fraudulently and in breach of trust, acting in excess of his authority in so procuring and disposing of the proceeds of the plaintiff's cheques for his own individual use and benefit.\nThe defendant bank pleaded a general denial, and subsequently, by amendment, raised the defences that the cheques were authorized by the plaintiff; that the defendant took the cheques in the ordinary course of its banking business in good faith, and without notice or knowledge of any defects in the title of Cahan, Jr.; that the cheques were not taken by the defendant for collection or as an agent, but in due course and for value, and that the defendant bank, upon receiving the cheques, became the holder and owner of them in due course. Moreover the defendant pleaded that, for the whole of the period during which the cheques were drawn and paid, the plaintiff had not assets to represent the amount of the cheques, and that the plaintiff did not lose the whole or any part of the sum claimed in the action by reason of the cheques, the full amount thereof having been directly or indirectly accounted for, returned or paid to the plaintiff by Cahan, Jr., and that, by reason of such accounting, return and repayment, the plaintiff's claim was not maintainable, even as against the latter.\nThe action was tried before Maclennan J., of the Superior Court, who found that the defendant did not act in good faith, and did not not become the holder of the cheques in due course; that the defendant had notice of the defective title under which Cahan, Jr., held the cheques; that the sources from which the plaintiff received the money which was standing to its credit in its bank account in the Merchants Bank, and out of which the cheques were paid, were irrelevant to the issues between the parties; that the plaintiff had established its allegations; that the defendant had failed to establish a defence, and therefore that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount claimed with interest.\nUpon appeal to the Court of King's Bench, this judgment was set aside; the rulings at enqu\u00eate which rejected evidence offered tending to show that the plaintiff's loss was less than the amount claimed were reversed, and it was ordered that the record should be remitted to the Superior Court; that the defendant should have leave to amend; that the enqu\u00eate should be re-opened, and that the parties should be accorded an opportunity to examine such further witnesses, including Bowler, as they might call in support of the issues as amended.\nDuring the first trial the defendant had endeavoured to introduce evidence to show that, upon an accounting as between the plaintiff, Cahan, Sr., Cahan, Jr., and the other individuals and corporations concerned, the plaintiff had not, in the period covered by the cheques which are the subject of the action, funds of its own available in its bank account for the payment of those cheques; that the proceeds received by the defendant were not moneys of the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff had therefore suffered no loss. This evidence was rejected as inadmissible, the court holding that the accounts could not be taken in the absence of the parties to them, who were not joined in the action, but intimating that it would receive any evidence of the repayment to the plaintiff of the sum claimed. After the conclusion of the evidence and while the case was under consideration, the defendant presented a petition for leave to amend the defence and to re-open the enqu\u00eate. The antepenultimate paragraph of the defence, as pleaded, was in these words:\n46. That defendant further pleads and puts in issue that during the whole of the period mentioned in the plaintiff's declaration it had not assets to represent in whole or in part the sum of $209,028.12, which it pretends to have lost by reason of the facts set up in its declaration, and that as a matter of fact, the plaintiff did not lose the whole or any part of the sum sued for in this cause by reason of the cheques upon which the said action is based, the full amount of the same having been directly or indirectly accounted for, returned or repaid to the plaintiff by and for the account of the said C. H. Cahan, Jr., and by reason of said accounting, return and repayment plaintiff's pretended claim upon the said cheques would not be and is not maintainable even as against the said C. H. Cahan, Jr.\nThe amendment desired was by way of supplement to this paragraph, with the object of setting out with more particularity that the moneys deposited in the Merchants Bank, out of which the cheques in question were paid, had been so deposited, or entered to plaintiffs credit, as a result of the cheques fraudulently drawn upon the account of Cahan, Sr., or deposited in the Merchants Bank by Cahan, Jr., for kiting purposes, and that the amounts paid out of the account by the Merchants Bank in discharge of the cheques upon which the plaintiff claims had been compensated or made good by the deposit of other cheques by Cahan, Jr. The defendant also desired leave to examine Bowler who had left the country, and whose place of abode was unknown at the time of taking the former evidence; also permission to examine further witnesses, and to re-examine C. H. Cahan, Sr. This application was refused by the learned trial judge; but upon appeal it was granted by the Court of King's Bench. It is clear I think that the judgment of the latter court, when interpreted in the light of the reasons given, was intended only to vacate the judgment of Maclennan J. in order that the defendant might plead the paragraphs supplementary to paragraph 46 of the defence, which set forth with further particulars the defence generally indicated by that paragraph, and to re-open the enquiry for the admission of Bowler's testimony, and such other material evidence as might be tendered. Nothing whatever was determined as to the merits of the case, or the effect of the additional evidence which the defendant desired to produce. The court seems to have been of the opinion that this evidence was of a character of which the relevancy could not be determined without hearing the testimony, and perhaps this was due to some misapprehension of the learned trial judge's reason for rejecting the evidence which is expressed in his statement\nthat any evidence of accounting between the plaintiff and outsiders, who were not parties to this action, or the evidence of any moneys put into the Merchants Bank apparently tending to diminish the total losses, would not be evidence in this case. If this action is to be maintained I should think it is to be maintained for the total amount, the Home Bank having obtained $209,000 belonging to Corporation Agencies Limited I don't think it is material to the defendant where the company got that money, or whether part of that money has been paid back through the activities of C. H. Cahan, Jr., operating on accounts which he had no right to deal with;\nthe learned judge did however subsequently intimate that if the defence had any evidence of repayment of the amount claimed he would receive it. It would appear moreover that the Court of King's Bench considered that the case was not ready for final determination upon the record submitted, and that the defendant should be allowed generally to enlarge its evidence, in addition to the introduction of the testimony which had been excluded at the trial.\nAt the second trial the case was heard before Duclos J. The plaintiff renewed its objection to an accounting with those who were not parties to the action, and to evidence of deposits which were not appropriated to reduce or satisfy the plaintiff's claim. The objection was over-ruled by the learned judge, as governed by the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, and a large volume of additional evidence was taken, including the testimony of Bowler, who had been examined in England upon commission, and the evidence of expert accountants, who had been engaged in the case on defendant's behalf, and who produced a number of statements or exhibits which they had compiled to illustrate or establish their conclusions, covering 84 pages of the third volume of evidence. In the result Duclos J. found that the defendant had received the cheques in question for value in good faith, and without knowledge or notice of the defect in title of Cahan, Jr., which the plaintiff alleged; that the circumstances existing at the times when the cheques were received by the defendant were of a nature to quiet or lull to sleep any suspicion which the defendant bank might otherwise have entertained; that the plaintiff had suffered no loss by reason of the withdrawal of the funds represented by the cheques, and that the money with which these cheques were met was not the money of the plaintiff, but was stolen money, to which the plaintiff could acquire no title.\nFinally (he says), to whom belong the moneys with which the series of cheques were paid? These moneys were stolen by Cahan, Jr., from his father C. H. Cahan, from his funds in the Bank of Montreal here, and the New York branch of the Bank of Montreal, and in the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, by means of a power of attorney which he held from his father. Being stolen money, Cahan, Jr., could not transfer the title to it to the plaintiff or to anybody else, and when he deposited these moneys in the Merchants Bank of Canada it was not intended for the plaintiff, but for himself, and he withdrew it from the bank by the legal means which the plaintiff corporation had itself placed at his disposal.\nThe plaintiff appealed from the judgment of Duclos J., directly to this court.\nUpon the merits of the case I find myself in substantial agreement with the judgment pronounced by Maclennan J. upon the first trial, and I do not think that the evidence given later changes the aspect of the case. I have come to the conclusion that the defendant received the proceeds of the cheques in question from the plaintiff's bank account out of moneys which were in the plaintiff's possession, and without the plaintiff's authority, having notice, of which the cheques themselves were prima facie evidence, that Cahan, Jr., the defendant's endorser, was not entitled to the cheques, or to appropriate their proceeds, and that in these circumstances the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant the amount so received by it as money had and received by the defendant to the plaintiff's use, or as money of the plaintiff received by the defendant which was not due to the latter. Art. 1047 C.C., Sinclair v. Brougham[21]; John v. Dodwell[22].\nThere can be no doubt that Cahan, Jr., as a director of the plaintiff company, and Bowler as director and secretary-treasurer, could not lawfully exercise the authority which they had to draw cheques upon ;the company's bank account for the business of the company in a manner to appropriate the amounts standing to the plaintiff's credit to their own purposes, or to the purposes of either of them individually. The rule is universally recognized and founded upon abundant authority that an agent, whether of a company or person, cannot be permitted so to execute his mandate as to bring his own interest into conflict or competition with that of his principal. In Parker v. McKenna[23], the Lord Chancellor (Cairns) says:\u2014\nNow the rule of this court, as I understand it, as to agents, is not a technical or arbitrary rule, it is a rule founded upon the highest and truest principles of morality. No man can in this court, acting as an agent, be allowed to put himself into a position in which his interest and his duty will be in conflict.\nIn North West Transportation Company v. Beatty[24],\nSir Richard Baggallay, pronouncing the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in a Canadian case, says:\u2014\nA director of a company is precluded from dealing, on behalf of the company, with himself, and from entering into engagements in which he has a personal interest conflicting, or which possibly may conflict, with the interests of those whom he is bound by fiduciary duty to protect; and this rule is as applicable to the case of one of the several directors as to the managing or sole director.\nIn the application of this rule the principle has been enunciated, and it is established by conclusive authority, that when an agent gives to his individual creditor, or for his personal benefit, the paper of his principal, and thus uses the latter's credit for his private purposes, without authority of his principal, not only is he guilty of fraud, but the person who accepts the paper has, from the very nature of the transaction, prima facie notice that the agent is mis-applying the security or credit of his principal, and therefore acting without due authority.\nIn re Riches Ex Parte Darlington District Joint Stock-Bank Company[25], Lord Westbury said:\u2014\nI may also adopt a passage which I find in a book of considerable merit, the late Mr. Smith's Compendium of Mercantile Law,\u2014a passage which was cited with great approbation by judges of the Court of Common Pleas in the recent case of Leverson v. Lane[26], and which is as follows:\u2014\n\"It would seem that the unexplained fact that a partnership security has been received from one of the partners in discharge of a separate claim against himself, is a badge of fraud, or of such palpable negligence as amounts to fraud, which it is incumbent on the party who so took the security to remove by showing either that the partner from whom he received it acted under the authority of the rest, or at least that he himself had reason to believe so.\"\nIt is immaterial whether the partnership security is applied in discharge of an existing debt or whether it is used by the individual partner for the purpose of obtaining money from his own bankers to be applied for his own personal purposes.\nIn John v. Dodwell & Company, Ltd.[27], Lord Haldane spoke as follows:\u2014\nHowever, it is none the less clear that, innocent of fraud as the appellants were found to be, they, by the action of their clerks, took an unmistakable and grave risk in the transactions in question. On the face of these Williams was, without showing authority to do so, drawing cheques for his own purposes on the respondents' funds at their bankers. If it turned out that the respondents had not allowed him to do so, and would not ratify his action, the notice which the appellants had got through the agency of their clerks of what was prima facie a breach of duty on his part would deprive them of all title to hold the cheques as against the respondents, if the latter should challenge the transaction.\nThere is a very apt statement in Stainer v. Tysen[28], where the defendant executed a broad power of attorney authorizing the attorney to draw and endorse notes for and in the name of the defendant, and in the exercise of this power the attorney made and delivered a promissory note to satisfy an indebtedness to the plaintiff of a firm of which the attorney was a member, but in which the defendant had no concern. The note was made in the defendant's name, payable to the firm, and by the firm endorsed to the plaintiff. The court, dismissing the plaintiff's action upon this note, said:\u2014\nThere is no doubt that a power drawn up nakedly to do acts for and in the name of the principal negatives all idea of interest in the agent, or authority to act for the benefit of any one beside the principal. This limitation therefore, the plaintiff was bound to notice. * * * When a person sees the note of a stranger made and endorsed by one of the payees to discharge their own debt, and takes such an endorsement, he has seen enough, in connection with the power, to raise a strong suspicion, not to say conviction, that the whole is a fraud upon that stranger. It is too much to allow that he may shut his eyes and say, he supposed there were some special circumstances on which the attorney had a right thus to act. The transaction is, on its face, out of the ordinary course of business.\nThere is also a lucid exposition of the law to be found in the judgment of the Circuit Court of the United States for the southern division of New York in Anderson v. Kissam et al[29], a passage which was not questioned, although the judgment was reviewed by the Supreme Court upon another point. The senior circuit judge said:\nTherefore, if there is any significance in the fact that a bank president or cashier offers negotiable paper of his corporation, made by him in his official character, in payment of his personal debt, or to raise money for his personal use, it matters not that bankers generally do not appreciate it. If they regard the transaction as equivalent to one in which the individual comes with money in hand, they ignore its real character, because in that case he comes with what purports to be his own, having the possession which implies title and ownership, and the right to use it as he sees fit. When he comes with money obligation of a corporation, which is the contract of a corporation only because he has made it, and which is not its contract if he has made it without authority, the transaction is a very different one. Every person who takes such an obligation must ascertain at his peril that the agent who has made it was authorized to do so; and the moment that it appears that the contract has been made for the agent's own use and benefit, that moment his authority is impugned and impeached. No principle of the law of agency is better settled than that no person can act as the agent for another in making a contract for himself. Therefore it is that a bank president or cashier has no implied authority to bind his corporation to negotiable paper made for his own use; and if it appears upon the face of the paper that it is payable to the individual who has made it in an official capacity, the obligation is nugatory, and no purchaser can enforce it.\nThese American decisions serve to illustrate a rule which is in conformity with the judgments of final authority in England, and, as said by Cockburn C.J., in Scaramanga v. Stamp[30]:\nThe sound and enlightened views of American lawyers in the administration and development of the law\u2014a law, except so far as altered by statutory enactment, derived from a common source with our own\u2014entitle their decisions to the utmost respect and confidence on our part.\nThe principle under consideration underlies the provisions of the Civil Code respecting mandate. By article 1704 it is provided that\nthe mandatory can do nothing beyond the authority given or implied by the mandate.\nBy article 1706,\nan agent employed to buy or sell a thing cannot be buyer or seller of it on his own account.\nThe commentaries of the French authors are practically in accord.

The Halifax Banking Company[31], where two firms were carrying on different businesses, Esson & Company, which was largely indebted to the respondent bank, and of which William Esson was a member, and Creighton & Company, of which the appellant Samuel Creighton and William Esson were also members, Creighton having no interest in the firm of Esson & Company. William Esson drew a promissory note in the name of Creighton & Company, payable to Esson & Company, without the authority of Creighton, and endorsed it in the name of Esson & Company to the respondent bank on account of the indebtedness of Esson & Company to the bank. Sir William Ritchie C.J., gave the following reasons for judgment in agreement with the other members of the court:\nWe do not think it necessary to hear further argument in this case. I think the evidence and findings of the jury afford sufficient material to establish that Esson signed the note in question in the name of the firm of Creighton & Co. without the authority of his co-partners, that he endorsed it in the name of Esson & Co.\u2014whether with or without authority is not material\u2014and that he took it to the bank and had it discounted, and I am of opinion that the bank had a fair intimation that Esson was using the name of the firm of which Creighton was a partner, for his own private purposes, which was an illegal transaction; therefore, I think it should have put the bank on enquiry as to Esson's authority, and the facts shown threw on the plaintiffs the burthen of showing that the transaction was a right and proper one. Had they made the enquiries they should have made they would have seen that Essen was using the name of Creighton & Co. without authority, and that they should not have discounted the note. Not having made such inquiries, the loss should not fall upon Creighton, the partner whose name was unlawfully used, but upon the bank.\nThere seems to be no material difference between Creighton's Case and this one, although in the former the fraud was committed by means of a promissory note, while in the latter the money was withdrawn directly from the plaintiff's bank account by means of cheques made payable to the fraudulent director or agent.\nThe incapacity of an agent in such circumstances to use the credit of his principal for his own benefit seems thus to have been so well established that upon first impression it seems wonderful that a bank would pay these cheques without any inquiry or explanation to ascertain or to show that they were issued by the plaintiff's authority. A bank cashier of ordinary experience and care should have been put on enquiry when these cheques were presented to him by a private customer, since, by the terms of the cheques themselves, it was open to doubt whether the customer had a good title to them. Ross v. London County Westminster and Parr's Bank Ltd.[32]. Mr. Scott, the manager of the respondent bank, tells us, however, why it was that he took the cheques. It was because he relied upon the integrity of Cahan, Jr., and upon his ability to discharge the obligations involved in his endorsements of them and the receipt of their proceeds. Mr. Scott explains that Cahan, Jr., had kept his account in the respondent bank from the latter part of 1913 or the beginning of 1914; that the account had been absolutely satisfactory, and that prior to the disappearance of Cahan, Jr., in 1919, he had never heard anything against his character or integrity. Mr. Scott gave the following testimony:\nQ. P.C.-85 is a cheque dated November 1, 1919, for $4,000; that cheque was brought to your personal notice and initialed by you?\nA. It must have been, yes, initialed by me.\nQ. Did you know what the capital of the Corporation Agencies Limited was at that time?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. That cheque was not accepted by the Merchants Bank of Canada at the time you initialed it for payment?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. You did not know what the financial standing of the plaintiff, the Corporation Agencies Limited, was at that time?\nA. No.\nQ. Then on what were you relying for protection of your bank at the time you initialed that cheque and authorized the payment of $4,000 in cash to C. H. Cahan, Jr.?\nA. On C. H. Cahan, Jr's., endorsation.\nQ. Did you at the time you initialed this cheque regard it as peculiar that C. H. Cahan, Jr., was drawing a cheque to his own order for so large a sum as $4,000?\nA. No, sir, I did not.\nAnd again, generally:\nQ. Did it not sound a note of warning to you, Mr. Scott, when Mr. C. H. Cahan, Jr., was depositing cheques of a company of which he was director to his own personal credit?\nA. Having the confidence in Mr. C. H. Cahan, Jr., that we had, it never entered our heads.\nQ. And really you say you were relying upon the financial credit and stability of C. H. Cahan, Jr.?\nA. Yes.\nIn these circumstances I see no reason for the contention of the respondent bank, founded upon the judgments in Morison v. London County and Westminster Bank[33], a case which is also distinguishable upon other grounds, that its officers paid these proceeds to Cahan, Jr., because they were lulled to sleep by the fact that the payment of previous similar cheques by the bank in like manner had not at the time elicited any protest or objection from the plaintiff company. I should think that Mr. Scott, if he gave the matter the least consideration, must have realized that these cheques were prima facie irregular and imported absence of authority; but he appears to have had great confidence in Cahan, Jr.; he was always ready to initial the cheques and to pass them on for payment by the bank when, as sometimes happened, his attention was especially directed to them by his clerks, and evidently it was because he relied upon Cahan, Jr., and the latter's bank account, that he abstained from enquiry.\nThe defendant put in evidence by-law no. 22 of the plaintiff company which provides as follows:\u2014\n22. No director shall be disqualified by his office from contracting with the company either as a vendor, purchaser or otherwise nor shall any such contract, nor any contract or arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the company in which any director shall be in any way interested, be avoided; nor shall any director so contracting or being interested, be liable to account to the company for any profit realized in any such contract or arrangement, by reason of such director holding that office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established, but the nature of the director's interest must be disclosed by him at the meeting of the board of directors at which the contract or arrangement is determined on, if his interest then exists, or, in any other case, at the first meeting of the directors after the acquisition of his interest.\nAnd it is contended that inasmuch as the plaintiff company had thus allowed its directors to contract with it, and inasmuch as by-law 54, which has already been quoted, provides that contracts and engagements on behalf of the company may be made and cheques drawn or endorsed by the secretary-treasurer, acting jointly with any director, the defendant bank was entitled to assume without enquiry, upon presentation of the cheques for payment, that the director, Cahan, Jr., had received them from the company in discharge of contractual obligations to him which the company had undertaken; and moreover, that because the cheques were signed not only by the director, Cahan, Jr., who was the payee, but also by the secretary-treasurer of the plaintiff company, the authority for the issue of these cheques was sufficiently certified by the latter and that this fact in itself made further enquiry unnecessary. It will be remembered, however, that the defendant paid these cheques without any enquiry whatsoever, or any information, either from the plaintiff or from Cahan, Jr., as to the reason why, or the circumstances in which, he was entitled, or claimed to be entitled, to receive from the plaintiff any of the payments for which the cheques were drawn. If there were proof that Cahan, Jr., had represented to the manager of the defendant bank that he was a contractor with the plaintiff company, and that the cheques were issued to him in payment or on account of moneys payable to him under his contract, and if the company had been informed of by-law no. 22, or if Cahan, Jr., had directed attention to it, as showing that he was not disqualified to contract with the company, it may possibly be, I do not decide it, that such an explanation would be held reasonably sufficient to justify the bank in the payment of the cheques; but neither did Cahan, Jr., nor anybody on his behalf, or on behalf of the plaintiff company, inform the bank or pretend that any contract had been made in pursuance of the by-law, or that the payments were being made on that account. Moreover, in the absence of any by-law upon the subject a director's disqualification to contract with his company is not absolute; he may, disclosing his interest, contract with the company's consent, and there is thus always a possibility that payments may be due by a company to one of its directors as a contractor. That possibility I suppose existed in every one of the decided cases, but it was never suggested that it afforded any justification or excuse. A general by-law authorizing the making of such contracts may lead to the conjecture of this explanation, but it does not by any means exclude the suspicion of fraud nor rebut the prima facie evidence of fraud which the paper itself discloses; it does not in my opinion justify the banker to abstain from enquiry, especially when, as in the present case, it is not shown that the bank considered or was even aware of the by-law, and it is not pretended that the bank was in fact influenced thereby. On the contrary, as I have already shown, the bank took the cheques because of the endorsation of Cahan, Jr. Then, as to the excuse that the cheques payable to Cahan, Jr., the defaulting director, were signed not only by him but also by Bowler, the secretary-treasurer of the plaintiff company, the answer is that two directors, no more than one, can authorize the misappropriation of the company's money, and that prima facie the payee of a cheque receives the proceeds for his own purposes, and when therefore a director, either solely or jointly with another, signs a cheque upon the company's bank account in his own favour the cheque on its face is evidence of absence of authority, or the exercise of his powers for a purpose which is incompetent to him. In Creighton v. The Halifax Banking Company[34], to which I have already referred, Strong J. quotes the following passage from the judgment of Lord Westbury in Re Riches[35]:\u2014\nIf an individual partner gives directly to his private creditor the paper of his firm for his own individual benefit and thus uses the credit of the firm for his own private purposes in that case such partner is guilty of fraud.\nAnd he adds, upon the authority of Lord Justice Lindley, that such a transaction\nis fraudulent against the firm whose name is affixed to the paper, even if the partner using it does not himself sign the name of the firm; a fortiori when he does sign it.\nMoreover it is stated in Lindley on Partnership, 5th ed., p. 171:\u2014\nAgain, although a partner may be a bon\u00e2 fide holder, for his own separate use, of the paper of his firm, yet if he gives such paper in payment of a separate debt of his own, this is prim\u00e2 facie an irregular proceeding and a fraud on his co-partners. Consequently, the creditor taking the paper must rebut this prim\u00e2 facie inference before he can compel the firm to pay.\nTherefore I conclude that, while it may be less likely that two directors would lend themselves to the fraudulent purpose of appropriating the company's money for the private use of one of them than that the latter alone should do so, it is nevertheless, even where two directors join, prima facie evidence of fraud that one of them is making use of the company's funds for his own individual purposes.\nThe irregular or fraudulent deposits to the credit of the plaintiff's account in the Merchants Bank were made by means of cheques payable to the plaintiff's order, and thus required the plaintiff's endorsement to authorize their deposit; these cheques could therefore have come to credit only by the endorsement of Cahan, Jr., or Bowler, who had the plaintiff's authority to endorse cheques payable to its order.\nThe officers who endorsed the cheques had, by the company's by-laws, explicit authority to endorse. Thus the money found its way into the plaintiff's possession as a credit belonging to the plaintiff and under its control, because it went into the plaintiff's bank account on which the plaintiff could have operated. If the plaintiff's officers, other than Cahan, Jr., and Bowler, did not in fact know that the money was credited before the defendant drew it out, it was because they blindly trusted Cahan, Jr., and Bowler. Certainly they had means of knowledge by the exercise of which, with ordinary diligence, they would have become aware of what was taking place in the company's bank account; the plaintiff cannot, I should think, permit its bank account, for a year or more, to be made the repository of other people's money by its appointed and entrusted officers, to whom was in fact committed the management of its business, and escape liability upon the ground that it was ignorant of the deposits. Marsh v. Keating[36]; Jacobs v. Morris[37], and upon appeal[38]; In re Carew's Estate[39]; Le Neve v. Le Neve[40]; In re European Bank[41]; Rolland v. Hart[42]; Boursot v. Savage[43].\nThere can be no doubt as to the validity and binding effect of the deposits as between the plaintiff and the Merchants Bank; they were made in strict accordance with authority conferred. No question of ratification, express or implied, arises involving an assumption of responsibility by the plaintiff company for the fraudulent outgoings from its account. The plaintiff having received the money became liable for its proper application. It promptly repudiated all authority for the persons concerned with the cheques by which the money was withdrawn. I have shown that the defendant bank had no title to them. It is a part of the defendant's case that it bought these cheques from Cahan, Jr., and collected their proceeds, not as his agent or mandatody, but as the owner of the cheques and for its own benefit. Thus the defendant wrongfully converted the cheques to its own use and received their proceeds.\nThe defendant bank, having acquired the cheques in suit upon the faith of the endorsement of Cahan, Jr., the payee, cannot justify its claim to them except by establishing the title of Cahan, Jr.; and if, as Lord Herschell said in The London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[44],\nWhen it is said that a person is put on enquiry the result in point of law is that he is deemed to know the facts which he would have ascertained if he had made enquiry; he cannot better his position by abstaining from so doing,\nthen it must be taken that the defendant bank had knowledge, when paying the cheques, that they were unauthorized by the company, and therefore is not entitled to urge that the payment of these cheques served lawfully to entitle it to the money by which the plaintiff's balance was reduced.\nThe deposits in the plaintiff's bank account, out of which these cheques were paid, were not the less in the plaintiff's possession because its accountability for them, or for some portions of the blended fund, may depend upon the tracing of the money to its sources, or upon other considerations affecting its ultimate ownership. The accounting for the various amounts paid in, or the application of these sums, may be a matter of some difficulty. Questions of set off or compensation and of the imputation of the payments may arise, but these do not affect the defendant's present liability to restore the amount which it withdrew without authority. The plaintiff, accepting its responsibility to make proper application of the funds which came into its possession, is entitled to have these funds in hand. It is useless to contend that there were no assets or money of the plaintiff involved. The deposits were treated as money by the Merchants Bank which gave credit for them to the plaintiff in its bank account, and subsequently paid them out to the defendant in response to the fraudulent drafts which it presented. It seems not to be questionable that the deposits in the Merchants Bank were money in the plaintiff's hands, or that when withdrawn they actually were money in the hands of the defendant. In Spratt et al v. Hobhouse et al[45], Best C.J. said: It has been established even since the case of Longchamp v. Kenny[46] that if a party gives another what may be readily turned into money, it may be treated as such in an action for money had and received. * * * The principle in all cases is, that if a thing be received as money, it may be treated and recovered as such.\nAnd Park J., said:\nAccording to all the cases, that which has been treated as money by the parties must be considered as such by the court.\nThe defendant bank has presented a number of accounts prepared by the accountants whom it retained for the purposes of the action, covering the period from the end of March, 1919, to 26th December following, during which the cheques in suit were made and issued, with the object, so far as I can perceive, of showing that, if the plaintiff's interest in this action is, as I understand the defendant to contend, limited to the amount by which the balance in its bank account at the beginning of the period exceeded the amount which stood to its credit at the end of the period, that excess is negligible. It is said that the plaintiffs balance in its account in the Merchants Bank on 27th December, 1919, after the last of the fraudulent cheques had been paid, was not less than it was nine months previously when Cahan, Jr., made the first of the cheques which are the subject of the action. But, even if this were so, it ought not to affect the plaintiff's right of recovery, because, nevertheless, in the interval, the defendant withdrew from the plaintiff's account, with which it had no authority to meddle, the total amount claimed in the action; and it cannot of course justify this trespass, and the conversion of the deposits, either upon the ground that the money which it appropriated came into the plaintiff's account and possession in the period during which Cahan, Jr., and the defendant were illegally operating upon the account, or because the balance to the credit of the account consisted for the greater part of deposits made by Cahan, Jr. Indeed this contention is but a restatement of the argument that possession of property does not give title as against a wrongdoer who converts it, and that argument, in whatever form it is stated, must, as I shall presently show, upon principle and authority be rejected.\nThe results of the accounts which the defendant submits are founded very usually upon facts which are not disputed; but in other respects they depend upon inferences which might or might not be found to coincide with the facts which would appear if the individuals or corporations concerned, and whose moneys are said to be represented in the deposits, were parties or represented in an accounting; and it is, I should think, obvious that the plaintiff's right to recover the possession of the money of which it was deprived by the defendant cannot be affected by a partial or ex parte accounting or by evidence of the character submitted. There can only be a conclusive accounting by agreement of the parties or by enquiry and judgment of the court in proceedings in which they are represented.\nIt is unnecessary to consider the effect of the kiting of the cheques, because it appears to be certain that, independently of any cheques which represent kiting transactions, there is actual money in the case to an amount in excess of that which the plaintiff claims. One of the defendant's exhibit shows that there were net defalcations of Cahan, Jr., in respect of securities and money which actually belonged to the plaintiff amounting to $38,961.92. McDonald, the defendant's expert accountant, testifies in effect that during the time from 29th March to 31st December, 1919, there were deposited in the plaintiff's account in the Merchants Bank $142,345.60 from Cahan, Sr's., account, and that during the same period there were deposited $97,184.21 from Cahan, Jr's., account in the defendant bank; it has been found impossible to ascertain the source of the latter amount; it is thought to represent profits derived by Cahan, Jr., from his stock speculations; that perhaps is mere conjecture; but although, in the absence of strict accounting, the origin of the deposits cannot definitely be ascertained, it seems to be a perfectly legitimate and indeed necessary inference from the evidence that an amount considerably more than that which is claimed in the action came from sources which had nothing to do with the kiting of cheques. I have already shown that according to the findings of the trial judge, the money which paid the fraudulent cheques was stolen from Cahan, Sr.\nThe defendant bank contends that it is entitled in this action to any relief to which Cahan, Jr., would have been entitled, if the plaintiff company had proceeded directly against him, and the defendant relies upon art. 1031 of the Civil Code, which provides that:\u2014\nCreditors may exercise the rights and actions of their debtor, when to their prejudice he refuses or neglects to do so, with the exception of those rights which are exclusively attached to the person.\nBut, to mention only one of the answers to this contention, the defendant bank is not a creditor of Cahan, Jr., and its principal defence in the action depends upon the denial of facts out of which, in the transactions involved in the case, it could become a creditor. I am satisfied that the defendant derives no advantage for purposes of the present action from art. 1031 C.C.\nIn the view of the trial judge the case of \"Mr. A.\", Robinson v. Midland Bank, Ltd.[47], is decisive of this action, and he would reject the plaintiff's claim because the moneys to the credit of the plaintiff, in the Merchants Bank, with which the cheques in question were paid, were, as he says, stolen by Cahan, Jr., from his father's funds in the Bank of Montreal (Montreal and New York branches) and the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, and he applies an observation of Lord Darling's judgment, who is reported to have said:\u2014\nThis money was stolen from an Indian gentleman. If it were stolen from him, it remained his still, and nobody could give anybody else title to it, no matter what transactions were gone through.\nUpon the assumption that it was stolen money, deposited by the thief in the plaintiff's account in the Merchants Bank, that the defendant bank received in payment of the cheques, it may be observed that to this extent there is a similitude between this case and that of \"Mr. A.,\" in that the plaintiff here seeks, as did the plaintiff in the case of \"Mr. A.,\" to recover from a bank stolen money which had found its way into the bank. But in the case of \"Mr. A.,\" the plaintiff failed because the money had not been received by the bank for his account and he had no title and no right of possession, not because the money had been stolen, while in the present case the Merchants Bank held the money for the plaintiff, and the latter has at least the right and title of possessor which is sufficient to enable it to maintain this action as against the defendant which had wrongfully deprived the plaintiff of its possession. In Gordon v. Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police[48], Buckley, L.J., said:\u2014\nThere is no ground of public policy upon which the defendant should keep that which under no circumstances is his. It may be that the plaintiff never ought to have acquired that property, but, having acquired it, his cause of action to recover it from the person who deprives him of it arises only from the fact of deprivation.\nNorth & South Wales Bank v. Irvine[49]; Kleinwort v. Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris[50]; The Winkfield[51]; British America Elevator Co., Ltd. v. Bank of British North America[52].\nIn Eastern Construction Company, Ltd., v. National Trust Company, Ltd. and Schmidt[53], Lord Atkinson, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in an appeal from the Province of Ontario, and referring to the statement of Lord Campbell in Jeffries v. Great Western Railway Company[54], that as \"against a wrongdoer possession is title,\" said:\u2014\nThat is no new doctrine. It was decided in 1721 in Armory v. Delamirie[55], \"that the finder of a jewell, though he does not by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, yet he has such a property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner, and consequently may maintain trover.\" That principle was affirmed as applicable to a bailee by the case of The Winkfield[56]. But this case and the case of Jefferies v. Great Western Ry. Co.[57], were approved of by Lord Davey in giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips[58], and it must be now taken as conclusively established.\nIn Moffatt v. Burland[59], Dorion C.J. said:\nIn 1848, the Court of Queen's Bench decided, in the case of Mills v. Philbin et al[60], that although the plaintiff had admitted on faits et articles, that he had no interest in the note sued upon, that he only held it for the purpose of collection, and that the money when collected would go to one Malo, still he was entitled to recover judgment.\nSimilar decisions had already been given by the Court of Appeals, the first on the 20th of July, 1821, in the case of Armour v. Main, and the second on the 20th of January, 1838, in the case of Ferrie v. Thompson[61].\nThese rulings were in accordance with the well known rule of law that he who has an apparent title can enforce such title in the courts of justice as against every one except the real owner of the thing claimed, or as Troplong puts it in his Trait\u00e9 du Mandat, n\u00b0 43: Ce dernier, le pr\u00eate-nom, est rev\u00eatu d'un titre apparent, qui lui donne, dans ses rapports avec les tiers, tous les droits du propri\u00e9taire. Il est \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, non pas un agent interm\u00e9diaire qui se meut sous l'influence de la volont\u00e9 d'autrui, mais un ma\u00eetre qui dispose de sa chose. Sans doute entre les parties, celui dont le r\u00f4le a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit par une contre-lettre \u00e0 la simple qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00eate-nom n'est pas autre chose qu'un mandataire.\nIn Porteous v. Reynar[62], the Judicial Committee of the the Privy Council had no hesitation in adopting the reasoning and decision of Dorion C.J., in Moffatt v. Burland[63] \"as consistent with reason and law.\"\nIn Sinclair v. Brougham[64], Lord Dunedin, said:\nBoth an action founded on a jus in re, such as an action to get back a specified chattel, and an action for money had and received are just different forms of working out the higher equity that no one has a right to keep either property or the proceeds of property which does not belong to him.\nIf I am right in the view that the defendant bank had actual notice of Cahan, Jr's., lack of title to the cheques, or to apply their proceeds for his individual benefit, or knowledge of facts which should have raised suspicion as to the validity of this title or right, and which should therefore have put it upon enquiry to ascertain or to satisfy itself that Cahan, Jr., was acting with the plaintiff's authority; and if the defendant, with this notice or knowledge, and without any inquiry or explanation, paid the cheques to Cahan, Jr., upon his endorsement, then it follows that the defendant acquired no right or title to the cheques, or to their proceeds, which the defendant received from the Merchants Bank out of the funds standing to the plaintiff's credit. Moreover it follows that, whatever may have been the legal position as between the plaintiff and Cahan, Sr., or others to whom it may have been accountable, its possession of the money as between itself and the defendant conferred a right or title, not in the nature of a limited interest, but absolute and complete. As against a wrongdoer possession is title which cannot be disturbed. The defendant bank was a wrongdoer; it had no vindicable title.\nI would therefore allow the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lafleur, MacDougall, Macfarlane and Barclay.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

It sets out that Anna M. Ferguson died at her domicile, Chicago, U.S.A., in 1920, leaving as part of her estate mortgages on land in New Brunswick; that the Royal Trust Co. as administrator cum testamento annexo obtained probate in St. John, N.B.; and submits the question whether or not the estate should pay succession duties on this mortgage property. The Appeal Division answered in the affirmative and the Trust Co. appealed to this court.\nFred R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant. It is submitted that the Succession Duty Act, 1915, does not impose any tax but if it does it is a tax upon the succession or transmission and not on the property. Wallace v. Attorney General[1]. In any case these were specialty debts located in Chicago and so not taxable. Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[2]. This specialty rule is still law. In re Mandslay, Sons & Field[3]; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Public Trustee[4].\nWinslow K.C. and E. Allison Mackay for the respondent. The corpus of the property is taxed for succession duty. Rex v. Lovitt[5].\nThe specialty rule is not general and does not apply where something is to be done outside the jurisdiction in which the specialty is found to enforce it. Hanson on Death Duties (6 ed.) 109. Receiver General v. Rosborough[6].\nThe specialty rule applies only to probate and Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope2 was a probate case. It was not applied in Walsh v. The Queen[7].\nFred R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nWinslow K.C. and E. Allison Mackay for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (The Chief Justice and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.), was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The deceased, Anna M. Ferguson, who, at her death, was domiciled in Chicago, left as part of her estate mortgages on real estate in New Brunswick. The instruments embodying the mortgage debts and the securities were in the usual New Brunswick form; that is to say, there was in each case a bond for the repayment of the loan and, in a separate deed, a mortgage securing the performance of the condition of the obligation. All these instruments were in Chicago at the death of the mortgagee. The appeal turns solely upon the question whether these assets which are alleged by the respondent to be subjects of taxation under the Succession Duty Act of 1915 had their situs at the time of the death of the testator in New Brunswick; whether, that is to say, they fall within the words of section 8 (la):\nAll property situate within the province belonging to a deceased person, whether such person was or was not domiciled therein.\nOn behalf of the appellant it is contended that these mortgage debts never had locality in New Brunswick but that by reason of the presence of the instruments in Chicago at the time of the testator's death, they had locality there; while on behalf of the respondent the contention is that in each case the substance of the asset was the security which, it is alleged, as it has been held in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, was property in New Brunswick and dutiable as such.\nThe asset in each case, from the economic or business point of view, is, of course, the security in its entirety; the personal obligation to pay money, plus the charge upon the mortgaged property by which the payment is guaranteed. But from the legal point of view, the personal obligation is for many purposes regarded as distinct from the charge, although the relation between them is such that the mortgagee cannot effectively transfer the personal debt while retaining ownership of the charge, or enforce payment of the debt without releasing the mortgaged property, or, by appropriate proceedings, converting it into money applicable in reduction of the debt. The mortgage does, unquestionably, create an interest in the mortgaged property in the jurisdiction where the property is situate, the security being, to quote the language of Lord Watson in Henty v. The Queen[8],\naccording to the principles recognized by this board in Walsh v. Reg[9], * * * as much an asset in (New Brunswick) as the real estate there which it affects.\nFor the purpose of applying the rules of private international law as recognized under the law of England, such a security is an \"immovable.\" In re Hoyles[10].\nIn theory there would appear to be several conceivable ways of viewing this question of situs. It is the contention of the appellant that the security is merely the accessory of the personal obligation, and that consequently the locality of the asset is determined by the locality of the latter. Then the view advanced on behalf of the respondent, as already mentioned\u2014the view to which effect was given in the court below\u2014is that the substance of the asset consists in the real security, and that consequently the locality of the asset is to be determined by the locality of the property charged with payment of the debt. Then there is the possible view that the asset in its entirety has not exclusive locality, either in the situs of the debt or in the situs of the property, but that the right arising from the personal obligation and the rights constituting the real security are severally assets in their respective localities.\nThere would appear to be little doubt\u2014the decisions in Walsh v. Reg.[11] and Henty v. Reg.[12] seem to be conclusive upon the point\u2014that, irrespective of the constructive situs of the personal debt, the fiscal authority of a Canadian province must embrace the power to levy duties upon interests in real estate situate within the province (whatever the limitations or conditions by which such interests may be affected) upon the creation, transfer or transmission of them. Whether, under a given enactment, an interest such as that of a mortgagee in a mortgaged property has in fact been subjected to a particular tax upon such transfer or transmission in circumstances in which the mortgage debt, as a debt, has escaped must be a question of construction. It is not necessary to pursue this subject further, because the question submitted by the stated case appears to be the question whether or not the mortgage debts as such had their situs in New Brunswick. The question is in these terms:\nThe question for the opinion of the court is whether the said specialty debts referred to in paragraph three herein are subject to the payment of the duties prescribed by the Succession Duty Act, 1915, and amending Acts. If the question submitted for the opinion of the court be answered in the affirmative, it is agreed that judgment may be entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for the amount of succession duty for which the estate is liable to the province of New Brunswick, together with costs taxed as between party and party. If answered in the negative, it is agreed that judgment may be entered for the defendant with costs as between party and party.\n\"Specialty debts,\" as used here, may not be entirely without ambiguity, but the question considered in the court below and the question presented by counsel on argument before this court was as to which of the rival contentions above indicated was to prevail as touching the seat of the mortgage debt. The litigation has proceeded upon the assumption that in each case the solution of this question is to be regulated by one or other of two circumstances the locality of the personal obligation as determined by the situs of the instruments, or the locality of the mortgagee's interest in the New Brunswick land, as determined by the situs of the land itself. Nor would the case as framed make it possible to deal with the question submitted on the hypothesis that the asset was to be dutiable to the extent only of the value contributed by the real security independently of the personal responsibility of the mortgagor.\nSuch being the question to be decided, it seems impossible to escape the conclusion that the decision is ruled by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[13]. The state of facts upon which the decision of their Lordships proceeded appears to present nothing upon which a substantial distinction between that case and this can be based. The debtors and the mortgaged property were both in New South Wales. The mortgage was given to secure the payment of promissory notes which, on the mortgagee's death, were in a bank in Victoria for collection. The question submitted by the special case, as appears from the report in[14], was whether the notes were liable to probate duty in New South Wales, probate duty being a duty leviable on all property, real as well as personal, in the colony. Their Lordships held that the promissory notes had become merged in the mortgage deed, and had acquired the character of a specialty debt which had its locality where the deed itself was, that is to say, in Victoria. Payment of the debt could not, of course, be enforced in New South Wales, either by judgment against the mortgagors personally or by proceedings to enforce the security, without obtaining probate in that colony; nor could the charge on the New South Wales lands be released otherwise than in conformity with the New South Wales law. As the mortgaged property appears to have been leasehold, it seems probable that for this purpose alone the issue of probate in New South Wales would have been necessary.\nThe principle of Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope13 which had its origin in the traditional identification of a specialty contract with the paper in which it was embodied, is no doubt a principle which, in its application to cases such as this, is open to some comment. It seems singular that fiscal jurisdiction or the incidence of a taxing statute should be determined by the accident of the locality in which a particular paper happens to be on a given date; but a similar principle has been widely applied in the case of negotiable instruments; Attorney General v. Bouwens[15]; Winans v. Attorney General[16]; State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds[17]; Blackstone v. Miller[18]; Buck v. Beach[19].\nAnd probably any system of rules for determining the constructive locality of intangible property must be more or less arbitrary.\nThe decision in Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[20] has been recognized in England and in this country, and it is only necessary to refer to the judgment of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Toronto General Trusts Corporation v. The King delivered by Lord Cave and reported in[21]. His Lordship said:\nA claim to succession duty having been made the administrator contended that the mortgages in question were, at the date of the testator's death, situate, not in Alberta, but in Ontario, and supported his contention by reference to the rule of law which provides that, whereas a simple contract debt is to be deemed to be within the area of the local jurisdiction within which the debtor for the time being resides, the locality of a specalty debt is the place where the specialty is found at the time of the creditor's death: Wentworth on the Office of Executor, ed. 1720, p. 46; Bacon's Abridgement, tit. Executors and Admistrators, (E.), p. 462; Gurney v. Rawlins[22]; Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope20. This rule has been recognized in numerous decisions both here and in the Dominion of Canada, and the general principle must be regarded as well settled.\nIn that case their Lordships found it impossible to apply the rule, and consequently it was necessary to resort to other indicia for the purpose of determining the locality of the mortgage debts there in question.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick, whose judgment was delivered by Hazen C.J., has taken the view that the circumstances of that case are not materially distinguishable from the facts now before us; but one cardinal fact, which materially affected the decision in that case, is not present here. The mortgage there had been executed in duplicate\u2014one duplicate being in Alberta and the other in Ontario\u2014the controversy being whether the asset had locality in Ontario or in Alberta. It was quite plain that the decision in Hope's Case[23] could not be successfully appealed to as establishing locality in Ontario while at the same time establishing the non-existence of locality in Alberta. At page 684, Lord Cave says:\nBut in the present case there is a difficulty in applying the rule, owing to the fact that each of the mortgages created and evidenced by duplicate deeds, and that at the date of the testator's death one of the deeds was in the province of Ontario and the other in the province of Alberta. An attempt was made to shew that, having regard to the terms of the Land Titles Act, the duplicate of each mortgage held by the testator was the principal or dominant instrument, but in their Lordships' opinion no such ascendancy was made out, and the deed produced to and retained by the registrar under the provisions of the statute was not of less importance than the duplicate delivered to and retained by the mortgagee. In these circumstances, any argument which goes to shew that, under the rule which fixes the locality of a specialty debt in the place where the specialty is found, the debts in this case were situate in Ontario at the testator's death, is equally effective to prove that they were situate in Alberta; and yet it is plainly impossible to hold that they were situate in both provinces at once. A similar difficulty in applying the rule may arise in any case where an obligation is created or evidenced by two or more deeds of collateral value which are found in different jurisdictions; and the truth appears to be that in such cases the rule gives no guidance on the question of the locality of the debt, and regard must be had to the other circumstances of the case.\nThere are, no doubt, in my own judgment delivered in this court, observations which might be cited in support of the view which prevailed in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, but any opinions expressed in this court are, of course, superseded by the judgment of their Lordships; and when that judgment is read as a whole, and especially in view of the passages quoted, it appears to be impossible to hold that the present case is in principle distinguishable from Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope (1).\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The late Anna M. Ferguson, when domiciled in Chicago, in Illinois, died there, on or about the sixth day of February, 1920, possessed of an estate in real and personal property worth $130,605.09, without making any reduction therefrom for debts due and expenses.\nAbout $55,000 thereof consisted of four mortgages on real estate in New Brunswick.\nThe mortgagors, in the case of three of the said mortgages, resided in said province, and in the case of the fourth of said mortgages, the mortgagor was an incorporated company having its head office in the city of St. John, in said province.\nThe mortgages were all recorded in the office of the Registrar of Deeds for the county of the city and county of St. John.\nThe mortgage deeds and bonds evidencing the said several specialty debts at the said time of the death of said Anna M. Ferguson were in possession of the Chicago Title and Trust Company in the said city of Chicago, and outside the said province.\nThe question raised herein is as to the liability of the respondent in its representative character to pay succession duties upon or in respect of said mortgages, and was presented to the court below by way of a special case, of which the first three paragraphs are as follows:\u2014\nSPECIAL CASE\n1. The Royal Trust Company is administrator cum testamento annexo of the estate in the province of New Brunswick of Anna M. Ferguson under Letters Testamentary issued out of the Probate Court of the city and county of Saint John, on the twenty-first day of April, A.D. 1921.\n2. The said Anna M. Ferguson was in her lifetime and at the time of her death a resident of and domiciled in the city of Chicago, in the state of Illinois, one of the United States of America, and died in the said city of Chicago on or about the sixth day of February, A.D. 1920.\n3. The said estate, if any, in the province of New Brunswick, of the said Anna M. Ferguson consisted solely of specialty debts being mortgages on real estate situate in the said province of New Brunswick as follows:\nThen follows a statement of the said mortgages, and the following:\u2014\nThe real estate which is the subject matter of the said mortgages is of value in excess of the amount of the said mortgages and interest.\nThe substance of the next three paragraphs is stated above, and paragraphs seven and eight are not material in my view of the case.\nParagraph 9 is as follows:\u2014\n9. Under the provisions of the Succession Duty Act of the province of New Brunswick, 1915, and amending Acts, the plaintiff claims that the said specialty debts are subject to the payment of Succession Duties at and after the rate prescribed by the said Succession Duty Act, 1915, as being property situate within the said province of New Brunswick within the meaning and intent of the said Succession Duty Act.\nAnd paragraph 10 sets out subsection 1 of section 8 of the New Brunswick Succession Duty Act, 1915.\nThen follows the question submitted:\u2014\nThe question for the opinion of the court is whether the said specialty debts referred to in paragraph three herein are subject to the payment of the duties prescribed in the Succession Duty Act, 1915, and amending Acts. If the question submitted for the opinion of the court be answered in the affirmative, it is agreed that judgment may be entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for the amount of succession duty for which the estate is liable to the province of New Brunswick, together with costs taxed as between party and party. If answered in the negative, it is agreed that judgment may be entered for the defendant with costs as between party and party.\nThe case seems to have been submitted to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nJudgment was given after argument by Chief Justice Hazen dealing at length with the case and maintaining the claim of the plaintiff, now respondent herein. And from that judgment the appellant, The Royal Trust Company, in its said capacity has appealed here.\nOn the authorities alone, cited by the learned Chief Justice in the court below in support of the conclusion therein reached, I am clearly of the opinion that his judgment is right, but there are many other authorities also shewing that this appeal should fail.\nThere are a number of decisions of this court in accord with my view in which I have applied substantially the same test that I did in the case of Lovitt v. The King[24], quoted by respondent's counsel in his factum herein, as follows:\u2014\nHaving regard to the terms of this statute which the executors solemnly undertook to obey upon obtaining the ancillary letters granted them by the probate court of New Brunswick, preceded by all that that grant implies it seems to me that there is an obligation resting upon them by force of the statute and the proceedings upon which the ancillary letters were got which can only be discharged by the payment of the duties claimed.\nIn that case my brother Duff and I were not in accord with the majority here but, as it turned out, the court above allowed the appeal there and practically maintained the position so taken. I am quite confident that the appellant herein could not, without probate or ancillary letters of administration, bring any action on any of said mortgages to recover from any of said mortgagors the money due upon any of said mortgages in question.\nI put a question to the counsel for the appellant early in his argument raising that test, but am yet without any explanation as to how he imagined his client could bring such an action, unless a copy of section 31 of 10 Geo. V, 1920, c. 6, known as the \"Registry Act\" sent to the registrar of this court for each of us, is so intended.\nNo memorandum in way of supplemental factum accompanied the copy of said section, and I am left to guess at the import or meaning of its being sent.\nIt simply provides for the registration of a will probated elsewhere, and, with other sections in said Act, may be very useful in protecting those concerned against loss by non-registration within specified terms provided for in said Act.\nI can see nothing in that Act enabling the executor or administrator of a foreign will to sue or recover anything.\nThe test I present is a simple but very far reaching one. Its converse case was early presented in the case of Lambe v. Manuel[25].\nOf course the legislature may claim ultra vires, and that exception to said test must, if it ever arises, be dealt with on its merits.\nBut here I see no such point and fail to see that its enactments, when the whole purview of them is considered, have failed (as counsel urged) to enact, as it claims now, though it may have approached the subject timidly, as suggested.\nI am, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Fred.

In June, 1920, the appellant made an application to the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada for permission to cross the tracks of the respondent; and the Board granted it upon the following condition amongst others: \u201cThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company shall employ and pay the signalmen necessary to operate the interlocking plant, at the joint expense of\u201d both companies. In December, 1920, an employee of the respondent met with an accident while operating the semaphore, and as a consequence of the accident, he sued the respondent company under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The respondent, without giving the appellant any notice, contested this action and was condemned to pay the sum of $3,000 with interest and costs. The appellant learned of that judgment only by receiving from the respondent a bill for $1,704.24, being half the capital and interest due under the above judgment; but it refused to pay and the respondent prayed the Board of Railway Commissioners to grant an order forcing the appellant to pay that amount. The respondent\u2019s claim was dismissed by the Board on the ground that it was not one which could be attributable to or based upon the order which is alleged to be the foundation for such a claim. Subsequently the respondent brought suit against the appellant in the Superior Court for the sum of $1,852.76. The action was maintained, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench. Both courts held that the words of the agreement above cited covered not only the actual wages of the workmen, or the obligation on the part of the appellant to pay one half of those wages, but also the obligation to pay one half of what might be called an accessory expense of the employment.\nThe appellant alleged that these judgments did not proceed upon an interpretation which the wording of the order would justify, but had the effect of rendering it liable for expenses which had not been foreseen when the order was issued; that the future rights of the parties were affected; that the decisions involve an interpretation of a public statute, the Railway Act of Canada, and that, as orders of the Board are made only when a matter of public interest is involved, their interpretation constitutes a question of public interest.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel and reserving judgment, granted the motion.

Company and Another (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nCanada Machinery Corporation Limited and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1925: June 12, 13; 1925: October 6.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Infringement\u2014Railroad rails\u2014Anti-creeping devices\u2014Claim and specifications\u2014Construction\u2014Defence\u2014Want of definitiveness\u2014Anticipation.\nThe appellants (plaintiffs) had a patent for an anti-creeping rail device, which, as they alleged, had been infringed by the respondents (defendants), who had, subsequently to the appellants\u2019 patent, manufactured and used, in Canada, a rail anchor which, it was urged, embodied the principle of the appellants\u2019 patent. Before the appellants\u2019 patent, various contrivances had been devised and used for the prevention of creeping, usually in the form of a stay or brace between the rail and the sleeper. A favourite method of applying this mode of resistance, and which had been tried in different forms and under various patents, was by means of a cross bolt or yoke, underlying the rail, bent at either end to engage on each side with the base of the rail and kept in position by a wedge inserted on one side between the yoke and the rail, a part of the contrivance extending downwards perpendicularly to form an abutment designed to press against the contiguous sleeper and thus to overcome the creeping. The invention which was the subject of the appellants\u2019 patent consisted of a steel yoke or crossbar in principle and not unlike those which were known and had been tried before, but, instead of a wedge for securing the apparatus to the rail, it made use of a locking device which was worked by means of torsion of the steel yoke. The device manufactured and used by the respondents, which was alleged to infringe, was of the wedge variety, the wedge being so formed that when driven into place the yoke was sprung into holding position. It was contended by the appellants that the respondents\u2019 device depended for its efficiency upon the torsion, spring or recoil of the steel yoke and that it therefore constituted an infringement.\nHeld, that the appellants\u2019 invention was one of mechanical detail, that the characteristic of the steel bar when sprung or twisted to resume its normal position was not the discovery of the appellants\u2019 patentees, who merely made use of a well known quality of the metal for bringing about the particular result in the specified manner; that while, if a new principle be discovered, the court will regard jealously any other method embodying that principle, yet where, as in this case, the invention consists in a particular new method of applying a well known principle, the use of other methods is not contemplated by the patentee, and that these do not fall within the ambit of the claim.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1925] Ex. C.R. 47) affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the appellants\u2019 action involving a charge of infringement of their patent by the respondents.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nAnglin K.C. and Cassels for the appellants.\nWilkie K.C. and Gibson for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014By letters patent of Canada, numbered 122, 715, of 21st December, 1909, there was granted to David Fisher Vaughan and David Lawrence Vaughan, of Riverton, New Jersey, the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing, using, and vending to others, to be used in the Dominion of Canada, an alleged new and useful improvement in anti-creeping devices for railroad rails, a description of which is contained in the specification and drawings attached to the letters patent. Subsequently, on 12th October, 1922, the patentees assigned to one of the appellants, the P. & M. Company, all rights under this patent, and thereafter the appellant, the P. & M. Company, gave an exclusive license to the other appellant company to manufacture the invention and to use and to sell it to others. No question arises as to the constitution of the action or the title of the appellant (plaintiff) companies. They claim that the respondents (defendants) infringed their patent rights by manufacturing and using the invention, and by selling it to others to be used in Canada, and they seek a declaration of the validity of the patent; a declaration of the alleged infringement; an injunction; accounting, and damages. The substantial answer is that there was no infringement, and this defence has been upheld and found for the defendants by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada who tried the cause. It is from this finding that the appellants appeal to this court. There is a large body of evidence, mostly of a descriptive and technical character.\nIt appears that the movement of railroad rails under operation, which is described as creeping, has long been known as a common fault, and many attempts have been made through numerous devices to afford a satisfactory remedy. The creeping takes place in the lengthwise movement of the rails in the direction of the traffic, and is caused chiefly by the severe stresses, jars and pounding to which the rails are subjected by the heavy locomotives, cars and loads which pass over them. The tendency to creep varies according to conditions of roadbed, grades, speed, frequency and weight of traffic. It is of course less on a single track, because there the loads, moving in opposite directions, tend in their effect to compensate for each other; but, upon double tracks, and these systems have become greatly extended, where the traffic upon each line of rails is practically all in one direction, the creeping, if not checked, develops into a cause of difficulty and of some danger in the working of the railways, especially at crossings and switches, or in localities where the nature of the soil or roadbed tends to facilitate it. Its consequences are also aggravated by the temperature and consequent expansion of the rails. Mr. Gutelius, an engineer engaged in the operation, maintenance and traffic of the Delaware and Hudson Railway lines in Canada, who has had long and important connection with railways in the Dominion, and especially in the supervision of their construction, maintenance and traffic, and who is the appellants\u2019 leading witness, gives the following testimony:\nThe string of rails that are butted against each other at a temperature of 60 degrees, will, when the temperature of the sun rises in the day time, rises to 100, push itself forward somewhere, and in cases of that kind we used to have what is known as a sun kink. A sun kink is across on a straight track along tangents where the expansion space has been used up, and the rails expand and must go somewhere, and they jump out in a sort of an S shape. Some very serious wrecks have occurred on account of sun kinks.\nHis Lordship: That is buckling?\u2014A. The buckle is a side buckle\u2014 they do not buckle vertically. The character, the shape of the rail, makes it so much, stronger vertically than laterally that the buckling is laterally.\nDuring the years before the appellants\u2019 patent various contrivances were devised and used for the prevention of creeping, and these usually took the form of some sort of stay or brace between the rails and the sleepers or ties, which were embedded underneath, and to which the rails were fastened. A favourite method of applying this obstruction or mode of resistance, and which was tried in different forms and under various patents, was by means of a cross bolt or yoke underlying the rail, bent at either end so as to engage on each side with the base of the rail, and intended to be kept in position by a wedge inserted on one side between the hook and the rail, a part of the contrivance extending downward perpendicularly to form an abutment or obstacle designed to press upon the contiguous sleeper, and thus to stay or overcome the creeping. Indeed the appellants in their factum frankly confess that:\nIt had been more or less well known before the Vaughans\u2019 invention that, assuming an anti-creeping device to be in its proper initial relation to the rail just before the creeping was attempted, the actual creeping when attempted could be best resisted and prevented by a yoke, engaging the rail base transversely, and substantially inextensible crosswise of the rail, so arranged in combination with a downward abutment at one of its sides that when creeping was attempted this abutment would be forced against a sleeper and would prevent the forward movement of one end of the yoke while the other end was permitted to move forward so that the yoke would tend to assume a slightly diagonal position across the base of the rail with a resulting substantially unyielding grip upon the rail, increasing as the effort of the yoke to assume a diagonal position increased, and operating by a cramping or shackle action in a generally horizontal direction.\nSome of these designs were found to operate with a measure of success, but the trouble appears to have been that the creeping action was not constant, and at times when the anti-creeping function of the rail anchor was not taking place, there being then no pressure of the shoe abutment upon the tie, the loads or blows and pressure to which the apparatus was subjected operated to loosen the grip or tension of the wedge, and in that manner to impair or destroy its usefulness. One after another of these designs was tried and rejected. Then the Vaughans, the patentees of the design which is said to have been infringed, contrived a special combination of means, as explained by their specification, for holding the rail in place. The apparatus consists of a yoke or crossbar, in principle and use not unlike those which were known and had been tried before; it abandons the wedge and uses a locking device the primary form of which I shall attempt to describe, although it is difficult, if not impossible, to give a lucid explanation in the absence of the drawings, which cannot here conveniently be reproduced, and the specimens used at the hearing. The invention as introduced to the specification\nconsists in the novel construction and combination of parts Which will be hereinafter fully described and claimed;\nthere follows a careful description by reference to the drawing of the applicants\u2019 device, explaining particularly its construction, parts and methods of engagement and operation. The claims upon which the appellants rely, as stated in paragraphs 1 and 4 of the specification attached to the patent, are as follows:\n(1) In an anti-creeping device for railroad rails, the combination, with the rail, of a part engaging one side of the rail foot flange, a cross bar extending beneath said flange, and provided with means on one end thereof for engaging one side of said flange, means on the other end of said bar for engaging said part, the part-engaging means on the bar being held in engaging position by the spring action of said bar in tending to assume a position from which it was sprung, and tie-engaging means acting upon said bar, substantially as described.\n(4) In an anti-creeping device for railroad rails, the combination, with the rail, of a shoe engaging one side of the rail foot flange, a cross bar extending beneath said flange and provided with means on one end thereof for engaging one side of the flange, a head on the other end of said bar holding said shoe in engagement with said flange, means on said bar for engaging said shoe, the shoe-engaging means on the bar being held in engaging position by the spring action of said bar in tending to assume a position from which it was sprung, and tie-engaging means acting upon said bar, substantially as described.\nThe device consists of two pieces of metal; one, the yoke or cross bar, which is made of steel, having a hook at one end to engage with one side of the foot flange of the rail, and which, passing under the rail, terminates at the other end in a square bolt head by which the bar may be torted or twisted by a wrench or other suitable tool in the hands of a workman, thus applying the torsion necessary for the engagement of the parts. The other member consists of the shoe, which is a casting of malleable iron, having two jaws projecting on its inner side to engage with the side of the rail opposite to that which is hooked by the yoke. The upper jaw is continuous for the entire length of the shoe, about three inches, but the continuity of the lower jaw is interrupted by an open space to form a socket into which the yoke passes, and, on the inner side of the socket, at its opening, there is a notch or slot to admit, when in proper position, a projection upon the side of the yoke with which it engages, and which is known in the evidence as a lug or spud. The opening in the side of the jaw admitting to the socket is not of sufficient width to allow the yoke to enter in its natural position, but, when the shoe is affixed to the rail flange, the yoke, hooked to the opposite flange and brought into contact with the shoe at the opening of the socket, is twisted by use of the wrench upon the bolt head, and then, by reason of a diminution in the thickness of the bar, which is somewhat flattened on the side to which it is twisted or sprung, the bar finds room to enter and is pressed into its socket. It is then allowed to spring back, and, upon the recoil, the lug on the shoulder of the yoke or bar articulates with and engages in the slot on the inner side of the socket, thus locking the parts, and causing both yoke and shoe to remain in place. By this means the anchor is secured to the rail. In this connection the patentees state in their specification that they preferably so locate the spud on the bar, that, after the bar has been sprung into the socket, there will remain in it sufficient resilience or spring action to press the spud into engagement with the shoulder of the slot, and thus firmly to hold or lock the parts together and to the rail flange. Continuance of the torsional spring action after the shoulder or lug of the yoke is in place in its socket is therefore not claimed as an essential feature of the plaintiff\u2019s device. The function of the torsion is to enable the yoke to enter the socket under conditions in which it can be released only by reverse application of the force requisite to admit it.\nThe shoe terminates in a face, known as the abutment of the shoe, which, of a width of about two inches, projects perpendicularly downward from the rail flange with which the shoe is engaged, and is intended, when in position and in action, to press against the sleeper which underlies the rail immediately in front of this projection, and, in order better to serve its object, the surface of the abutment is preferably made slightly convex. Then, to strengthen and render more secure the hold of the anchor upon the rail, the yoke, which in the process above described lies transversely of the rail at right angles to it, is forced by hammer blows at the hook into a slanting position in the direction of the tie; and here it may be said that, in order further to increase the grip, and so to prevent the turning of the bar, the hook, or portion of the bar turned over which embraces the flange of the rail on the side opposite to the shoe, is preferably made still further to extend laterally in the same direction. Mr. Gutelius says, referring to the cross bar, that:\nIn practice it should, be driven forward toward the tie so as to get a triangle toggle action.\n* * * *\nQ. Is it necessary to drive that one side of that crossbar up towards the tie after you put the apparatus in working position?\nA. It becomes in working position when the shoe touches the tie, it pushes the shoe back, and you get the same result as when you drive that side forward.\nQ. In order to get this into working position you must have the crossbar more or less diagonal to the long line of the rail?\nA. That is the way it should be when it is working. It is that diagonal position that gives the bite on the rail to resist the greatest tendency to creep.\n* * * *\nQ. Is that transverse toggle action due to the diagonal position of the crossbar that gives the apparatus its bite upon the rail?\nA. It gives it the bite. It gives it the bite on the edges of the rail base both at the shoe and on the other side. There is a bite caused by the torsion in the crossbar which affects the top of the rail on the far side and inversely the lower portion of the rail on the shoe side. * * *\nQ. You told me a moment ago the detorsion action of the spring rested against that stud on the shoe?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That is correct, is it not?\nA. What there is left of it when the apparatus is static, that is true. Q. What is true?\nA. What torsion is left in the bar when the apparatus is static is overcome, held in position by the lug. When the apparatus is working as against track creeping there is another problem in connection with the forces.\nQ. Then that torsional action against that spud or stud is parallel with the long axis of the rail, is it not?\nA. It is at right angles to the yoke or crossbar, and that yoke or crossbar should not be at right angles to the centre of the rail in working position; it should be on a diagonal.\nQ. But it is approximately parallel to the rail?\nA. Well, approximately, yes.\nQ. Now, you saw a moment ago that when one of the men relieved that stud and spring torque member back that the whole apparatus fell off from the rail\u2014you saw that?\nA. That is what it would do.\nQ. And that is what it does do?\nA. No, I do not agree with that. It did not do it except when it is unloosened.\nQ. If the torque spring action against the spring is removed the apparatus falls off?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So that the torque spring action is to keep the anchor on the rail? A. Hold the contrivance together. Q. So that it may stay upon the rail? A. Yes; perform its function.\nQ. Then that function and office is to keep the parts upon the rail?\nA. That is one of the functions.\nQ. Then tell one, if you will, if it were not for that torque action would the apparatus stay upon the rail? A. No.\nQ. Then, taking Exhibit No. 10, that crossbar must be twisted or torqued by a man\u2014is not that so, with a tool or wrench or some such tool in order to get it on?\nA. Yes, it must be sprung into this\u2019 position.\nQ. And so it must be of such size and shape that the ordinary man can with an ordinary tool twist it, or with some tool twist it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And that fixes the limit of its size. It cannot be bigger than a man can twist?\nA. It depends on your tool entirely as to what you can spring.\nQ. But that is the situation whatever else there may be said about it, it has got to be of a size and shape that it is practical twist. Perhaps you can twist anything but this must be practical\u2014is that the situation?\nA. Yes. It takes a tool about thirty inches long in the hands of a labourer\u2014and of course if the lever were lengthened the crossbar could be strengthened.\nThis explanation from Mr. Gutelius follows upon testimony in which he says that the twisting motion of the cross bar, to put it on, is necessary in all forms of the appellant\u2019s device; that it is, in the words of the witness, \u201cthe meat of the Vaughan patent,\u201d and he testifies moreover that\nthe full (force of the torsional effect of the spring is taken against the spud \u2014is exerted against the spud;\nbut, as will have been observed in the passage quoted, he says that\nwhat torsion is left in the bar when the apparatus is static is overcome, held in position by the lug.\nThere are other forms of the appellants\u2019 device which rest upon the same principle and the same combination of parts, although showing some variety in structure, but it is not I think necessary for the purposes of the case to endeavour to explain these.\nThe object to which the appellants\u2019 patentees applied themselves was not new. The novelty of the means which they devised for realizing their object is to be found in the application of the resilient force of the steel yoke by the torque produced in the manner described, and in the adaptation and combination of the selected appliances. The claim can be understood and defined only by reference to the drawings which accompany it. The device is in reality a combination of well known and tried parts for an object the achievement of which had been the subject of many trials. It had been found that a shoe abutment anchored to the rail and pressing with the traffic against the tie was effective, while firmly held in place, to overcome or materially to reduce the creeping movement of I the rail, but that the efficiency of the anchors which had been tried was of duration too brief for practical purposes, and, for the reason which I have mentioned, that these devices speedily lost capacity to resist the action of the load upon the rail, and were therefore unreliable. It had been discovered that owing to failure of the holding device the forces to which the anchor was subjected had the effect of causing it to relinquish its hold upon the rail, and so to become loose or disengaged. Up to this point there was no novelty in the appellants\u2019 device; this was the state of the art as they found it; but what their patentees secured by their monopoly, and what is involved in their claim, if it be not too broadly stated to be valid for any purpose, is the holding to the rail of the parts in engaging position by the spring action of the cross bar\nin tending to assume a position from which it was sprung * * * substantially as described.\nThe substantial description is to be found only in the specification and drawings, and by reference to these it is evident that the essence or substance, the \u201cpith and marrow\u201d in the terminology of the cases, or the \u201cmeat,\u201d to adopt the word of the expert witness, Gutelius, of the appellants\u2019 invention, which is in reality no more than an improvement, consists in the lug or spud of the cross bar, the slot or shoulder of the shoe, into or behind which the lug or spud is designed to find place, and the torsion and recoil of the cross bar by which these parts are articulated and locked together. These means are said to provide an efficient lock; but, preferably, as said in the specification, it is desirable so to locate the spud, that, after the bar has been twisted and sprung into the socket, there will remain sufficient resilience or spring action in the body of the bar to exert continuous pressure upon the spud, and thus to strengthen its engagement with the shoulder or slot in the socket; meaning thereby, as the specification may be interpreted, and as was in effect stated at the argument, that the lock would be strengthened if the natural, recoil from the torsion communicated to the cross bar by use of the wrench be not permitted entirely to exhaust itself when the cross bar is released in its socket; the purpose of this reserve of spring or recoil, which is recommended, being to aid in securing the engagement of the parts of the lock by the continued and permanent pressure of the spring.\nIt is true, as has been shewn, that the Vaughans in their claims for invention speak of the shoe-engaging means On the bar being held in engaging position by the spring action of the bar, in tending to assume a position from which it was sprung; but, when the claims and specifications are read and construed together, as they should be (Arnold v. Bradbury[2]), it would seem that for its essential purpose the torsion is employed as a means to the fitting together of the parts.\nThe spring or resilient quality of steel was of course known, and it had been manifested in previous inventions; the appellants acquired no monopoly of that; it has not been denied upon this appeal that its use and application for the purpose, and by the particular method, which has been described, became by the grant, the exclusive right of the patentees; nevertheless of course the claim for infringement fails unless it be established that the right so acquired has been infringed.\nTurning now to the evidence of the alleged infringement; on 16th May, 1922, the respondent Charles D. Ericson obtained Canadian letters patent, no. 218,561, for rail anchors; previously, on 21st March, he had become party to a deed whereby he had granted to \u2018the respondent corporation an exclusive license for the manufacture and sale of the device which was the subject of his application; net profits to be equally divided. The other respondent, Thomas H. Watson, is the president of the respondent corporation. It is the manufacture and sale of the rail anchors by the last named respondents, in which the respondent Eriscon shares the profits, which are said to infringe the appellants\u2019 device. Ericson in his specification describes his object, and I quote his language as explanatory; it should be borne in mind however that the infringement, if any, consists in what has been done, not in statement or description. He says:\nThis invention relates to devices for preventing the longitudinal creeping of railway rails and more particularly to that type in which a longitudinal wedge-shaped jaw is driven between one edge of a rail base and one end of a yoke member spanning the rail base, and my object is to devise an anchor of this type which will be cheap to construct and which will hold securely on the rail. In anchors of this type there always exists a tendency for the wedge to loosen under the stresses to which the anchor is subjected and unless there is sufficient resiliency in the parts to take up any slight initial slack, the whole anchor comes loose as soon as such initial slack takes place. I aim therefore to obtain as much resiliency as possible where resiliency does not affect the immobility of the device longitudinally of the rail base when in service. It is also desirable to provide resilient frictional locking pressure tending to resist the slipping of the wedge which does not resolve itself into component forces of which one acts in a direction parallel to the length of the wedge. I aim therefore to so design the anchor that a resilient locking friction is produced by wedge action transversely of the rail.\nIn the fitting of this device to the rail the shoe is driven firmly onto the rail base, and then the yoke is driven over the shoe. In the latter operation the shoe is not moved. The upper face of the shoe is somewhat chambered off at the end which enters the yoke for a distance of one-quarter to one-third of its length to form a slight vertical wedge which assists the driving, and, by the wedge action which it develops, has the effect of springing the large arm of the yoke into holding position. But, when the yoke has passed over the chamfered end, the upper surface of the shoe, over which it continues to move in the driving process, is horizontal or parallel to the rail, so that, when the yoke comes to rest, the plane of contact between it and the upper jaw of the shoe is horizontal and parallel with the underlying plane of contact between the lower jaw and the rail base, thus avoiding in the use of the anchor any resulting force, the action of which would tend to displace or to expel the wedge. This is a very simple expedient, and none the less meritorious because of its simplicity. The respondents have a patent for it; the question is, not the validity of the respondents patent, but whether the rail anchors which the respondents manufactured and sold infringe the appellants\u2019 patent.\nElaborate experiments were conducted by one of the appellants\u2019 expert witnesses to demonstrate, by means of scientific apparatus, that in the driving process by which the respondents\u2019 yoke was fitted to the shoe and to the rail, torsion of the yoke was necessarily, and it was suggested designedly produced, and therefore it was said that the respondents had appropriated the principle, and indeed the essential element, of the appellants\u2019 patent; but I would reject that contention, because, even were I satisfied that the respondents\u2019 contrivance is placed in position not without some twisting of the yoke when it is driven over the wedge, I would not consider that the respondents had thereby infringed the appellants\u2019 patent, because they have not adopted the appellants\u2019 method of engaging the parts, and I hold that the appellants have no monopoly of the torsion, unless, it may be, in the application of it to the particular contrivance which they describe in detail. The words of the Lord Chancellor in Tweedale v. Ashworth[3], are very pertinent. His Lordship said:\nThere are some things wherein a principle properly so called is invented, and the infringer may take the principle and may alter the details, and yet it is very obvious that he has, in truth, taken the idea which has been the subject-matter of the invention, and has simply altered the details so as to avoid the possibility of its being suggested that he has taken the same thing. The court can in such cases very often look through the mere variation of details and see that the substance and pith of the invention has been pirated, and consequently can protect the inventor. But there are some cases in which, although the principle is common to a great variety of manufacturers, there may be a good subject-matter of a patent in the particular mechanical mode by which that principle is carried into operation.\nThe appellants\u2019 invention is of the latter description, and if, using the language of the Lord Chancellor on the following page of the report, one were to endeavour to adapt it, mutatis mutandis, to the facts of the present case, I think the passage might fairly be reproduced thus:\nIf it is suggested that each of them uses a steel yoke, and that each of them fastens the shoe to the rail by the use of that yoke and the elasticity of the material of which it is composed, it occurs to me immediately that where there are two such things as we are dealing with here, where there must be a steel yoke underlying the rail to hold in position upon the rail a shoe of substantially common form and purpose, and where there must be some means or other of fastening the shoe to the rail by means of the bar or yoke, there is necessarily a considerable likeness between all the forms; and indeed in the oldest forms there must be in some sense a likeness; but that which alone seems to me to constitute the patentable article in the case of the appellants is that which the respondents have not taken at all; they have not, either in the form of the bar or by what is called the grip, taken the appellants\u2019 mode of doing it.\nIn the same case at p. 128, Lord Watson said:\nThe plain object of the invention as described in the specification is to substitute better mechanical equivalents for those already known and used as a means to the same end. It follows that, in construing the appellants\u2019 specification, the doctrine of mechanical equivalents must be left out of view. He cannot bring within the scope of his invention any mechanical equivalent which he has not specifically described and claimed.\nTo the like effect is the judgment of the same great authority in Miller v. Clyde Bridge Steel Co.[4].\nThe novel element either in the appellants\u2019 patent or in the respondents\u2019 device is somewhat fine and narrow. Both depend upon the use of the steel yoke and the rail-engaging shoe. The yoke is applied in the one case by the torque, in the other by the wedge. In either case there is of course the recoil or resiliency of the steel bar, but that was in fact a feature of prior devices; it had been specifically mentioned in two of them at least, Clawson\u2019s specification of May, 1907, and Gutheridge\u2019s of October, 1907; it was obvious or capable of being realized upon investigation, whether declared or not. It makes possible the appellants\u2019 method of locking the parts, and it is apparent that the Ericson wedge could not be worked to form a binding connection if the yoke were rigid. The appellants\u2019 patentees have made use of an ingenious means of interlocking for the purpose of making their device effective. They have produced a useful lock. The respondent, Eriscon, has succeeded in the same purpose by a simple adaptation of the form and use of the wedge.\nThe case is I think covered by the authorities. Vice-Chancellor Wood in Curtis v. Platt, as reported to the footnote to Adie v. Clark[5], among other pertinent observations, says:\nWhere the thing is wholly novel and one which has never been achieved before, the machine itself which is invented necessarily contains a great amount of novelty in all its parts, and one looks very narrowly and very jealously upon any other machines for effecting the same object, to see whether or not they are merely colourable contrivances for evading that which has been before done. When the object itself is one which is not new, but the means only are new, one is not inclined to say that a person who invents a particular means of doing something that has been known to all the world long before has a right to extend very largely the interpretation of those means which he has adopted for carrying it into effect.\n* * * *\nAnd although one is not to be too narrow in scrutinizing or interpreting a patent against a person who is a bona fide inventor, yet, on the other hand, as to all those who may be proceeding to effect similar objects by other discoveries, the court is bound to say that they are at liberty to do so provided they do not infringe the precise mechanism claimed for by the patentee.\nUpon review of the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s judgment Lord West-bury expressed his entire agreement[6]. See also the observations of Patteson J. in Jones v. Pearce[7], and Lord Davey\u2019s judgment in Consolidated Car Heating Co. v. Came[8].\nIt is true as held by Lord Justice Clerk Hope in House-hill Company v. Neilson[9], and by Viscount Haldane in British Thomson-Houston v. Corona Lamp Works[10], that a claim may be well founded to the use of a principle of manufacture so distinctive and individual in form that it may be carried out under the general direction of a skilled manufacturer without further invention. Or if you suggest and discover not only the principle but a means of applying it to practical result by mechanical contrivance and apparatus, and show also that you are aware\nthat no particular sort of modification or form of the apparatus is essential in order to obtain a benefit from the principle, then you may take your patent for the mode of carrying it into effect and are not under the necessity of describing and confining yourself to one form of apparatus.\nIt is said that in such cases the essence of the invention is independent of the form or construction of the instruments by which it is to be applied. The appellants claim that their invention is of this quality, but I think they fail to establish either the invention of a principle or a claim for the application of the principle, such as it is, which is embodied in their patent, in any manner other than that which is particularly described by their drawings. The invention is one of mechanical detail. The specification and claims of the appellants\u2019 patentees taught or suggested nothing as to the agency or usefulness of the wedge in fastening the rail anchor. They departed deliberately from the wedge and contrived a locking action of a minute and particular description, and essentially they invoked the resilient action of the steel yoke only for the purpose of bringing into place and engagement or function the specially designed parts of the anchor and the shoe. The characteristic of the steel bar when sprung or twisted to resume its normal position was not the discovery of the appellants\u2019 patentees. They merely made use of a well known quality of the metal for bringing about the particular result in the specified manner, and there is in my judgment no suggestion of or foundation for any broader application of their idea. The question raised in the case is essentially a question of fact and as I view the evidence there is nothing to suggest that practical men, working with the object of producing a contrivance answering to the appellants\u2019 specification in its broadest interpretation, would be apt by any chance to produce the device which is claimed to infringe. I have come to the conclusion, after reviewing the authorities, that the observations of the learned authors of Terrell on Patents, 6th ed. at p. 121, may be safely adopted. They say:\nBut the consideration of the question of infringement is much simplified if one remembers that inventions may foe divided roughly into two classes in respect to subject-matter. Firstly there is that kind of invention which consists in the discovery of a method of application of a new principle\u2014here what has been invented is in effect the new principle, and, generally speaking, the court will regard jealously any other method embodying that principle, for the patentee was not bound to describe every method by which his invention could be carried into effect. Secondly there is that kind of invention which consists in some particular new method of applying a well-known principle, and in this case the use of other methods is not contemplated by the patentee, and such will not fall witbin the ambit of his claim.\nIt is the second category to which the kind of invention which is involved in the appellants\u2019 patent belongs.\nWe ought not to overrule the judgment of the learned trial judge unless satisfied that he was wrong, and after having considered the findings below, and the carefully prepared and able arguments on both sides, which we had the advantage of hearing, I am by no means convinced that the judgment is erroneous.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Blake, Lash, Anglin & Cassels.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gibson & Gibson.\n[1] [1925] Ex.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1925: November 19, 20; December 10.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Bailement\u2014Warehouseman\u2014Storage of grain shipped to warehouse by lake vessel\u2014Instructions from shippers to ship grain by rail to purchasers\u2014Delivery to one purchaser without production of lake bills of lading\u2014Failure of purchaser to pay for grain\u2014Action against warehouseman to recover damage for loss.\nThe appellant, a grain merchant in Manitoba, shipped by a lake vessel 70,000 bushels of grain to the respondent, an elevator company in Ontario, for storage, and advised the respondent that the grain would be shipped out by rail from the elevator to various purchasers from the appellant. According to the documents produced in the case, it was agreed for the protection of all parties that the rail shipping bills were to be held as against the lake shipping bills and delivered to the purchaser only on delivery of or endorsement upon the lake bills and payment of the drafts attached. By letter of the 29th of May, 1923, the respondent company advised the appellant company that some 40,000 bushels of seed oats had been unloaded by the ss. Martian on the 24th and asked for advise as to where the rail bills were to be sent \u201cfor endorsation from the lake documents.\u201d The respondent company received no reply other than a letter of June 1 appraising it that the appellant company had carefully noted its request. In the meantime, on the day before May 31, the appellant company wrote to the respondent confirming \u201cwire instructions * * * to accept orders from the P. Co., covering 10,000 feeds ex ss. Martian * * *,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are forwarding to them (The P. Co.) the lake shipping bills covering this quantity and trust that our instructions will be found entirely in order with you.\u201d Another lot of 10,000 bushels were sold in a similar way. These 20,000 bushels were shipped to the order of the P. Co., the railway shipping bills being forwarded by the respondent company to the local freight agent of the C.N.R. at Woodstock. The appellant company had forwarded the lake bills, with drafts attached, to its bank at Woodstock with instructions to hand over the bills on payment of the drafts, according to the usual course of business. The P. Co. obtained delivery of the 20,000 bushels without the production of the lake bills, but took up only one of the drafts, leaving the drafts for the residue of the two shipments, 15,000 bushels, unpaid. The appellant company, on learning the facts, immediately advised the respondent company that it would be held responsible. The P. Co. having become insolvent, this action was brought by the appellant company to recover from the respondent company the value of the grain. The appellant company contends that it was the owner of this grain, which the respondent company held as its bailee and which, without authority from it, had been delivered to a person who had no title to receive it. The respondent company\u2019s defence is that the letter of May 31 was in effect a direction to ship to the P. Co. direct and to deliver the rail bills to the latter regardless of payment or of the whereabouts of the lake bills.\nHeld, that the respondent company was liable. The statement contained in the letter of 31st May that the appellant company was forwarding the shipping bill to its customer, should only be read as meaning that it was forwarding them in the ordinary course, through its bank or other agent, with the drafts for the price of the grain attached, and there is nothing in the letter justifying a departure from the understanding expressed in the respondent company\u2019s letter to the effect that the rail bills were to be held against the delivery or the endorsation of the lake bills.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (57 Ont. L.R. 1) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head\u2011note and in the judgment now reported.\nPitblado K.C. and Glyn Osler K.C. for the appellant.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant company, which carries on business as a grain dealer with its principal place of business at Winnipeg, in the spring of 1923 had a considerable quantity of grain in elevators at Port Arthur and Fort William.\nIn May of that year, arrangements were made with the respondent company, which had an elevator at Goderich, for the storing of this grain by them when arriving by vessel from the head of the lakes and for shipment of it from time to time to the appellant company\u2019s customers, in fulfilment of contracts already made or to be made. Among other contracts, the appellant had an arrangement with the Peerless Cereal Mills Limited, of Woodstock, for the sale to that concern of 60,000 bushels; and in May and June shipments were made from time to time, pursuant to this contract, which were duly paid for on delivery. On the 20th and 23rd of June, the appellant company gave authority to the respondent company to accept two several orders from the Peerless Company of 10,000 bushels each. These lots were shipped to the order of the Peerless Company, the railway shipping bills being forwarded by the respondent company to the local freight agent of the Canadian National Railways at Woodstock. The appellant company had forwarded the lake bills, with drafts attached (10 bills, representing 2,000 bushels each) to their bank at Woodstock, with instructions to hand over the bills on payment of the drafts, according to the usual course of business. The Peerless Company obtained delivery of both lots of grain, 20,000 bushels in all, without the production of the lake bills, but took up only one of the drafts, leaving the drafts for the residue of the two shipments, 15,000 bushels, unpaid. The appellant company, on learning the facts, immediately advised the respondent company that they would be held responsible. The Peerless Company having become insolvent, the action out of which this appeal arises was brought by the appellant company to recover from the respondent company the value of the grain.\nThe appellant company\u2019s case, in a word, is that they were the owners of this grain, which the respondent company held as their bailee and which without authority from them they delivered to a person who had no title to receive it. The respondent company\u2019s answer is, in effect, although the legal contention was advanced in a slightly different form, that they had the authority of the appellant company for making delivery to the Peerless Company.\nThe issue is an issue of fact, depending, however, upon documents supplemented by uncontradicted oral evidence.\nThe arrangements between the appellant company and the respondent company were all made by correspondence, and the letters outlining the procedure to be followed in shipping the grain from the Goderich elevator to the appellant company\u2019s customers are these:\u2014\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, May 4, 1923.\nGoderich Elevator & Transit Company,\nGoderich, Ont.\nGentlemen,\u2014We are pleased to advise you that some time during this month, probably the latter half, we will have shipped in your care 70,000 bushels no. 2 feed oats which will fee for domestic distribution. We will be wanting to order this loaded out on track from time to time as our orders call for and will appreciate hearing from you just what the procedure is in this connection, so that we can handle ourselves satisfactorily with you and to give you the least trouble in the matter. The above is our first shipment in your care, and when we get ourselves in line with what has to be done to facilitate the handling at your end, we will be guided accordingly and enabled to expedite the movement through your hands.\nAppreciating your early advices and favours, we are,\nYours very truly,\nThe Northern Grain Co., Ltd.\nP.S.\u2014We will give you advices of forwarding as soon as the same is loaded at Fort William.\nTo this letter the defendant sent the following answer:\nGoderich, Ont., May 7, 1923.\nNorthern Grain Co.,\nWinnipeg.\nDear Sirs,\u2014We have your favour of the 4th and note that you contemplate shipping some no. 2 feed oats in our care this month, for domestic distribution.\nThis will have our extreme care on arrival and in storing and shipping.\nThe usual method is to write or wire in your orders with complete information, backed up by shipping bills in triplicate over the road in which shipment is desired. The lake bills may be held by your bank or any eastern shipper to whom the rail bills can be sent for endorsation from, and attachment to draft on the purchaser. The usual method, however, is for us to send these rail bills to the nearest Division Freight Agent of the railway, in your territory; but we may say it is immaterial whether they go to the bank or the D.F.A. so long as all concerned are adequately protected. When the bills have been completed by shipment of the aggregate amount covered thereby, they are sent in (sic) to us for filing.\nInsurance on grain stored is taken care of by the shipper and also the cancellations as shipments are made.\nWe are enclosing herewith one of our tariffs, which will give handling, storage and insurance rate, with general conditions covering the operation of our plant. We also enclose a mileage tariff which will prove convenient for your billing.\nWe shall be glad to serve you at any time, and we quite believe that a test shipment will serve to show you that we have exceptional facilities for handling domestic shipments via the Canadian National or Canadian Pacific Railways.\nYours faithfully,\nGoderich Elevator & Transit Co., Ltd.\nWith this letter was sent a document professing to give the rules and regulations governing the Goderich Company\u2019s elevators. Inter alia, it contains the following rules:\n9. Upon payment of all freight charges being made and in exchange for lake bills of lading properly endorsed, the company will issue warehouse receipts for grain received and weighed in to the company\u2019s elevators. No transfer of such receipts will be recognized by the company, nor will the grain so designated be delivered until the original warehouse receipt has been duly endorsed by the owners of the grain and surrendered to the company or its authorized agent. 10. Elevation, storage, or other handling charges accruing to the company must be paid before securing delivery of the grain to the consignee.\n* * *\n12. Owners or their agents when sending instructions for shipment of grain from the elevators must state name of vessel, with date of lake bill of lading, from which shipment is desired.\nTo these should be added a letter of the 11th of May, in these terms:\nThe Northern Grain Company, Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Man., May 11, 1923.\nGoderich Elevator and Transit Co.,\nGoderich, Ont.\nGentlemen,\u2014We beg to acknowledge receipt of your favour of the 7th and appreciate the information you have so carefully conveyed to us in the same. This we have made careful note of and will govern ourselves accordingly.\nWe wish to thank you for the tariffs enclosed. The same will be made good use of by us.\nAs soon as our loadings go forward which we expect will be sometime the latter half of this month, we will give you additional advices.\nYours very truly,\nThe Northern Grain Co., Ltd.,\nJNS: W Per (Sgd.) J.N. Sternberg.\nComment upon these documents is, perhaps, superfluous. They manifest in the clearest way the intention that whichever of the two alternative methods of procedure described in the respondent company\u2019s letter was to be pursued, the essential thing for the protection of all parties was that the rail shipping bills (in other words, the grain itself) were to be held as against the lake shipping bills, and delivered to the purchaser only on delivery of or endorsement upon the lake bills and payment of the drafts attached. In part, no doubt, the procedure is framed with a view to the protection of the warehouseman by affording formal evidence of delivery by him to the order of the holder of the lake bills, the owner of the grain, but also for the protection of the holder of the lake bills, who is to receive payment before the rail bills become available for the purchaser.\nAs already mentioned, the respondent company justifies delivery to the Peerless Company by alleging that this delivery was made pursuant to the express authority of the appellant company. The contention is based upon these facts: By letter of the 29th of May, the respondent company advised the appellant company that some 40,000 bushels of no. 2 seed oats had been unloaded by the Martian on the 24th, and concluded with this request:\n[page 125]\nIf, perchance, you are making our shipments to individual purchases, you will please advise to whose order you wish the grain shipped, naming the party to advise, and advising where we shall send rail bills for endorsation from the lake documents.\nOn the 1st of June, the appellant company wrote in reply a letter which contains this observation:\nWe note your additional advices in connection with the procedure to facilitate the loading and shipping ex the elevator, and this we will keep in front of us for our further guidance and attention.\nIn the meantime, on the day before, May 31, the appellant company had sent this letter to the respondent company:\nThe Northern Grain Company, Ltd.\nWinnipeg, Man., May 31, 1923.\nGoderich Elevator and Transit Co.,\nGoderich, Ont.\nGentlemen,\u2014We are pleased to confirm our wire instructions to you this morning to accept orders from the Peerless Cereal Mills of Woodstock, Ont., covering 10,000 no. 2 Feeds ex ss. Martian, unloaded into store for our account May 24. We are forwarding to them the lake shipping bills covering this quantity and trust that our instructions will be found entirely in order with you.\nPlease note that on ss. Martian, ex Fort William May 28, in care of your good selves at Goderich, contained in Hold no. 3, shipment for our account of 24, 427.12 of no. 2 feed oats had gone forward. These oats also are intended for domestic consumption and you will receive loading out instructions by wire in due course of time.\nThanking you for your careful and prompt attention to this shipment, we are,\nYours very truly,\nThe Northern Grain Co., Ltd.,\nJNS:W Per (Sgd.) J.N. Sternberg.\nBy the respondent company it is now said that this letter of May 31 was in effect a direction to ship to the Peerless Company direct, and to deliver the rail bills to them, regardless of payment or of the whereabouts of the lake bills. This authority, it is now stated, was acted upon, and the same course followed in relation to subsequent shipments, without objection, until the present dispute arose. It is undeniable that the letter of May 31 seems carelessly framed, and it is quite capable in itself of an interpretation involving the suggestion at least that the shipping bills will be in the hands of the Peerless Company as the appellant company\u2019s agents, an interpretation which may receive some additional support from the consideration that the letter of May 29, asking for advice as to where the rail bills were to be sent for endorsation on the lake docu- ments, received no reply other than the letter of June 1, apprising the respondent company that the appellant company had carefully noted its request.\nThere is, however, some danger of misinterpreting commercial correspondence of this kind when a lawyer\u2019s critical apparatus is applied to it. In order to understand such letters, it is essential that one should put oneself in the position of the parties, and it is at least very difficult to suppose\u2014one is tempted to say it is incredible\u2014that any person experienced in commerce could have conceived the idea, in the absence of something much more explicit than anything in this letter, especially in view of the earlier letters, that the appellant company were forwarding the documents of title to their customers direct, without protecting themselves in the usual way. The statement that the appellant company were forwarding the shipping bills to their customers would only be read as meaning that they were forwarding them in the ordinary course, through their bank or other agent, with the drafts for the price of the grain attached. In any case there is nothing in the letter, on the most critical analysis of it, justifying a departure from the understanding so clearly expressed in the respondent company\u2019s letter already quoted, to the effect that the rail bills were to be held against the delivery or the endorsation of the lake bills. The same observations apply to the subsequent letter of the 11th of June.\nMoreover, it is undisputed that these letters were not construed by the respondent company as authorizing any delivery except upon production of the lake bills. Three communications are in evidence, written immediately upon notification to the respondent company of the default of the Peerless Co. The first is a telegram of the 14th of July, in these words:\nTelegram Rush\nWoodstock, Ont., July 14, 1923.\nGoderich Elevator & Transit Co.,\nGoderich, Ont.\nPeerless received delivery grapnel prepuce with stenting cover lake shipping bills in bank here whipsaw seedsman here care J.N. Sternberg.\nThe Northern Grain Co., Ltd.\nTranslation:\nPeerless received delivery 15,000 bushels no. 2 feed oats with drafts unpaid. Amount to cover lake shipping bills in bank here. We hold you responsible. Advise by wire here care J.N. Sternberg. The other two are letters of the 18th and 20th of July respectively, and are as follows:\nGoderich Elevator & Transit Company Limited\nGoderich, Ont., July 18, 1923.\nAgent Grand Trunk Railway,\nWoodstock, Ont.\nDear Sir,\u2014We are advised by Mr. Sternberg, of the Northern Grain Co., Winnipeg, that notwithstanding we had billed certain shipments to Woodstock to \u201cOrder\u201d of Peerless Cereal Co., for no. 2 feed oats ex Martian, and sent the rail bills to you for delivery to Peerless Cereal Co., in exchange for lake bills, or reduction therefrom, in the usual way, that you have delivered the oats to the Peerless people without cancellation of the lake documents.\nWill you be good enough to advise us immediately the numbers of the cars which were delivered in this manner, obliging,\nYours faithfully,\nThe Goderich Elevator and Transit Co., Ltd.,\nGLP\/P (Sgd.) G.L. Parsons, Manager.\nGoderich Elevator & Transit Company Limited\nGoderich, Ont., July 20, 1923.\nAgent Canadian National Rys.,\nWoodstock, Ont.\nDear Sir,\u2014Your favour of the 19th. What we requested from you was the numbers of the cars which had been surrendered without presentation of lake documents to Peerless Cereal Mills. We understand from The Northern Grain Co. that of 20,000 bushels shipped from here, all on the same billing instructions, you took up lake bills for only 5,000 bushels, is this correct? and why did you not take up lake bills for the other 15,000 bushels?\nFor your information, we have been billing grain in many cases in this way for many years, and this is the first negligence reported to us. It should be known by any agent that anything billed to \u201cOrder\u201d of anybody, requires the production of proper authority from the shipper, or his agent, before delivery is made; thus on ex-lake grain the corresponding lake bills of lading must be surrendered for cancellation, or reduction therefrom, as the quantity shipped may necessitate.\nThe shipper, Northern Grain Co., will insist upon payment of the goods, and we in handling the goods between vessel and cars here wish to have a proper record of the cars affected. Please inform us by return mail, obliging,\nYours faithfully,\nGoderich Elevator and Transit Co., Ltd.,\nGLP\/P G.L. Parsons, Manager.\nIn addition to these written communications, it was stated in evidence by Mr. Sternberg, who was called for the appellant company, that Mr. Parsons, the manager of the respondent company, some time later told him that the railway company were responsible; that with all the rail shipping bills, a document went forward to the rail- way company\u2019s agent, directing the surrender of the rail bills on exchange for lake bills or warehouse receipts. It is undeniable, in view of this evidence, that the officials of the respondent company were fully alive to their duty to retain the control of the Peerless Company\u2019s shipments until the proper lake bills had been surrendered or duly endorsed; and it seems equally undeniable that nothing in their correspondence with the appellant company led them to believe that the appellant company was relieving them from the performance of that duty.\nThe view taken in the Appellate Division appears to have been that the practice of requiring the production and delivery or the endorsation of the lake shipping documents in exchange for the rail bills is a practice devised solely for the protection and in the interests of the warehouseman. With great respect, that seems hardly consistent with the letter of the respondent company, in which it is clearly implied that the procedure outlined is for the protection of all parties. The appellant company was invited by the respondent company to rely upon the observance of this procedure for the protection of its own interest as well as those of the respondent company. It is indisputable that the appellant company did act upon this invitation.\nThe appeal should be allowed, with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of Riddell J. restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Blake, Lash, Anglin & Cassels.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\n[1] 57 Ont.

Audette for the appellant.\nA. Geoffrion K.C. and F. Fauteux for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014The respondents are the Prudential Coal Company, Ltd., a company carrying on a coal business in Montreal, and L. E. Barrett, its president and manager. The appellant, owner, of a Packard single-six sedan automobile, stolen from him in Syracuse, N.Y., in November, 1923, brought this action accompanied by a seizure in revendication of this car on the 12th of January, 1924, against the respondents in whose possession the car was found in Montreal. The plea of the respondents is that on the 20th December, 1923, they purchased the car in good faith from the Robinson Motor Car Company, Limited, and Hector Meunier, carrying on business in Montreal as dealers in automobiles, who were traders dealing in similar articles, and who bought the car at a public sale. They also set up that the car in question cannot be revendicated without reimbursing to them the price they paid, which price is not stated in the plea. They further alleged that the car was insured and that the insurance money had been paid to the appellant, who ceased to have any right of action, but this allegation was struck out on an inscription in law. They asked for the dismissal of the action.\nNo question was raised whether such a plea is the appropriate answer to an action by the owner of a thing stolen to recover its possession. As between the owner and the possessor, in the absence of prescription which of course would transform possession into ownership, the right of the former necessarily prevails over the possession of the latter, and there is, as a rule, no defence to his action. While sale, as to a determinate object, is translatory of ownership, a sale by a non-owner is without effect, saving the right of the buyer to claim damages if he was ignorant of the lack of title of the seller. This is the general rule stated by art. 1487 C.C., which says that the sale of a thing which does not belong to the seller is null. To this rule there are three exceptions mentioned in arts. 1488, 1489 and 1490 C.C. We are here concerned only with art. 1489 C.C. which is as follows:\n1489.\u2014If a thing lost or stolen foe bought in good faith in a fair or market, or at a public sale, or from a trader dealing in similar articles, the owner cannot reclaim it, without reimbursing to the purchaser the price he has paid for it.\nThis article must be read with the third and fourth paragraphs of Art. 2268 C.C. which deals with prescription of corporeal movables:\nThis prescription is not, however, necessary to prevent revendication, if the thing have been bought in good faith in a fair or market, or at a public sale, or from a trader dealing in similar articles, nor in commercial matters generally; saving the exception contained in the following paragraph.\nNevertheless, so long as prescription has not been acquired, the thing lost or stolen may be revendicated, although it have been bought in good faith in the cases of the preceding paragraph; but the revendication in such cases can only take place upon reimbursing the purchaser for the price which he has paid.\nThe advantage of possession is that it throws on the claimant the onus of proving ownership and the defects in the possession or title of the possessor. When ownership is proved, any title short of prescription acquired by the possessor of a thing lost or stolen will not avail to prevent revendication, but if the possessor bought the thing in good faith in a fair or market, or at a public sale, or from a trader dealing in similar articles, the owner cannot reclaim it without reimbursing to the purchaser the price he paid for it. As a further observation to complete this statement of the law, I may add, although nothing turns on it in this case, that a title acquired under a sale by authority of law is a complete bar to an action in revendication, even when the thing sold was lost or stolen (art. 1490 C.C.)\nThere is no possible doubt here that the automobile belonged to the appellant and was stolen from him. The respondents therefore must shew that they come within the exception of art. 1489 C.C. or, to the same effect, of the third and fourth paragraphs of art. 2268 C.C. If they do, the appellant\u2019s right of revendication is not defeated, but is subject to the condition that he must, before obtaining possession of the car, reimburse to the respondents the price they paid for it.\nI will treat the respondents as having the same interest, for Barrett purchased the car for the Prudential Coal Company, Ltd. He bought it from the Robinson Motor Car Company, Ltd.\nTwo questions of fact remain to be discussed.\n1. Was the Robinson Motor Car Company a dealer in similar articles, namely second hand, or as they are generally called, used cars?\n2. Did the respondents purchase this car in good faith? Before dealing with these two questions, it is proper to say that the learned trial judge found against the allegation of the respondents\u2019 plea that the Robinson Motor Car Company bought this car at a public sale, expressly holding that the plea in that respect was unfounded. He further stated that the pretended auction sale by U. H. Dandurand, Limited, which the respondents\u2019 witnesses Falcon and Reid swore took place on the 18th of December, 1923, appeared to have been a fictitious sale. In so holding, the learned judge necessarily discredited the testimony of both Falcon and Reid, the former the president, and the latter the salesman of the Robinson Motor Car Company. I would not interfere with this finding of fact. There is ample ground for disbelieving what Falcon and Reid said as to the alleged auction sale. An independent witness, Gilbride, employed with the Packard Motor Company, Ltd., in Montreal, testified that Falcon brought the car to that company\u2019s office with a Montreal lawyer, Mr. Paul Mercier, and a friend of the latter from St. Henry, who desired to be advised whether he could safely purchase the car. The company\u2019s employee Jones discovered that the numbers of the car had been changed, and, as a result of their investigation, they came to the conclusion that the car had been stolen from Syracuse, New York. They have in their office a record of stolen cars, and they wired to Syracuse giving information of the fact. He added that Mr. Mercier advised his friend not to buy the car. He was not asked the date of this visit, but he says that a couple of weeks afterwards, Corporal Anderson of the Royal Mounted Police brought the car which had been seized to their store. It is rather unfortunate that neither Mr. Mercier, nor his friend, nor Corporal Anderson were called at the trial.\nAs further discrediting the testimony of Falcon and Reid as to the pretended auction sale, there is the fact that they swear that they showed the car to Barrett only after the auction sale, the date of which is given as the 18th of December, 1923, while Barrett testifies that he bought the car (the date of the sale to Barrett is December 20, but apparently the contract was prepared on December 18), ten days after he saw it for the first time. He says that the employees of the Robinson Motor Car Company, he mentions Reid, made practically daily visits to him with the car, and one evening they took his wife, his sister and himself for a little drive of about five miles. It is impossible to reconcile what Barrett says with the testimony of Falcon and Reid, and it is quite evident that the learned trial judge did not believe the latter as to the alleged auction sale.\nI will now take up the two questions of fact on which the decision of this case depends.\n1. Was the Robinson Motor Car Company, Ltd., a dealer in similar articles, namely used cars?\nThis company was incorporated in March, 1921, under a Dominion charter, with authority, inter alia, to deal in automobiles. Its capital was $50,000. The original incorporators are not now interested in the company. Falcon says that he bought the company, meaning probably that he acquired control, in January, 1923. He invested $22,000 in the company, $10,000 in cash and the balance in automobiles. He, one Geo. McGown and one Lucien Mignault, the secretary-treasurer, are the shareholders and also the directors, Falcon being the president and no doubt the ruling spirit in the company. Falcon says that besides his investment, $2,000 was put into the company by others. In July, 1923, the company hired from Morgan Realties, Ltd., a building and a garage in the rear on St. Alexander street, near Ste. Catherine street. In the same month, it obtained a license from the province of Quebec to keep a garage not in the premises on St. Alexander street, but at no. 221 Ontario street west. It filed certain statements of its business up to December, 1923, showing an operating deficit. A page of its cash book was copied into the record but is of no use, for it has no dates opposite the entries which are of mere sums of money.\nAs to the business carried on by the company in December, 1923, we have only the statements of Falcon, Reid and Lucien Mignault. It does not however appear to be seriously contended that the company did not carry on the business of selling used cars, but the appellant endeavoured to prove that the cars it dealt in were stolen cars. In that regard, the proof is not conclusive, although it shews that suspicions were entertained as to the honesty of the business.\nIn the absence of a finding of the learned trial judge, based on his appreciation of the trustworthiness of these witnesses, that the Robinson Motor Company was not a dealer in used cars within the meaning of art. 1489 C.C. I think we must assume, as was held by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, that the purchase of the car in question was made from a trader dealing in similar articles.\n2. But was this purchase made in good faith?\nI accept the definition of good faith adopted by the learned trial judge: bonae fidei emptor esse videtur qui ignorat rem alienam esse. Barrett, in answer to questions put to him by counsel for the appellant, swore that he was perfectly satisfied and that he had no doubt that the Robinson Motor Car Company were bona fide dealers. It was open to the learned trial judge to refuse to believe Barrett, and had he based his decision that Barrett was in bad faith on his disbelief of this testimony, it might have been difficult to set it aside.\nThe learned judge however gave reasons derived from the circumstances of the sale for inferring that Barrett was not a purchaser in good faith. These reasons must be carefully scrutinized, the more so as the Court of King\u2019s Bench came to the opposite conclusion upon consideration of the same circumstances.\nBarrett explains that he had a new Hudson touring car, 1923 model, which had cost him $2,300. He desired to exchange this car for a closed automobile. His nephew, one Smetzer, was employed by the Robinson Motor Car Company, and through him he was brought into connection with that company. The latter offered him successively a Paige car and a Cadillac car which did not suit. They then showed him this Packard Sedan car, and, after having tried it for some ten days, he decided to make the exchange. He says that Reid told him that the Robinson Motor Car Company had obtained this car from responsible dealers in New York, which Reid denies, but I prefer to accept Barrett\u2019s statement because Reid does not seem very reliable. There was some bargaining as to the sum which the Robinson Motor Car Company would allow him for the Hudson car and the amount he would have to pay in order to complete the exchange. Finally it was agreed that the Hudson car would be taken at $1,500 and that Barrett would pay in addition $1,600, in all $3,100, which with the sales tax and some accessories formed a total purchase price of $3,185. The amount payable in cash was settled by giving twelve notes for $148.75 each.\nBarrett had the shrewdness to make an inquiry of Brad-streets as to the financial standing of the Robinson Company and also to require a guarantee that the car was free from all incumbrances, duty, etc., and that, in the event of any claims from Government or insurance companies, the Robinson Motor Car Company would refund the full purchase price of $3,100. That he was wise in requiring this guarantee was shewn by the event, for some days after the sale the car was seized by Corporal Anderson of the Mounted Police, on behalf of the Canadian Government, for customs duty due on the entry of the car from the United States. Barrett went to see Falcon in connection with this seizure, and Falcon testifies that he paid the duty, a sum exceeding one thousand dollars. At all events, the car was returned to Barrett. It was on this occasion that Corporal Anderson brought the car to the Packard Motor Car Company\u2019s office in Montreal, as already mentioned.\nComing now to the reasons of the learned trial judge for inferring that Barrett purchased the car in bad faith, they are, as briefly as can be stated, the following, which I give under the letters used by the trial judge:\u2014\n(a) Smetzer, Barrett\u2019s nephew, was the latter\u2019s agent, and his knowledge of the fraud should be imputed to Barrett. Smetzer was not called on behalf of the respondents.\n(b) Barrett inquired from Bradstreets as to the solvency of the Robinson Motor Car Company and did not take the trouble to ascertain from the Montreal agents of the Packard Motor Car Company whether they knew where the Robinson Motor Car Company had obtained the car.\n(c) Barrett did not notice the initials on the car doors or the filing of the numbers of the car, although they were fairly evident.\n(d) No explanation is given why the amount of the sale was raised from $3,000 to $3,100 and of the change of the date of the contract from December 18 to December 20, the former being the date of the guarantee.\n(e) The sale was not made at the vendor\u2019s place of business, but at the purchaser\u2019s office, and Barrett knew that one Hector Meunier had an interest in the car.\n(\u0192 and g) Barrett insisted on the vendor giving him the guarantee mentioned above and, as such guarantee cannot be treated as\nthe legal warranty against eviction which is of the nature of the contract of sale,\nit is an indication that Barrett was doubtful as to the origin of the car and wanted this additional assurance.\n(h) Barrett bought for $3,100, part of which was represented by an old car, a motor car worth from $3,800 to $4,200.\nWith all possible deference, I think that the only reasons that need be discussed are those indicated under letters (c), (e) and (\u0192 and g). As to the others, they appear devoid of any significance. Smetzer was not Barrett\u2019s agent, Unless it be assumed that Barrett\u2019s suspicions had been aroused, it was not an indication of bad faith not to inquire as to the origin of the car at the Packard Motor Car Company\u2019s office, although Barrett would have been saved much annoyance had he done so. There was some bargaining about the price to be paid and the raising of the price from $3,000 to $3,100 is without importance. The car exchanged was not an old car and there is not, under the evidence, such a disproportion between the price paid and the value of the car as to warrant a conclusion that the buyer must have suspected that the car had been obtained by criminal means.\nNow as to reason (c), Barrett says that he did not see the initials on the doors of the car, and he may be readily believed when he states that he did not observe that the car numbers had been filed or effaced. He was getting a second hand car, and, had he seen the initials, he might well have supposed that the owner did not wish to scratch them out and spoil the appearance of the car. Nothing here is inconsistent with good faith or an indication that the car had been stolen.\nReason (e) might have some significance, were it not well known how eager agents are to run after purchasers who, left to themselves, would never go to the dealer\u2019s place of business. Moreover, in this case, Barrett, having expressed to his nephew, an employee of the Robinson Motor Car Company, his desire to exchange his open car for a closed one, the visit of Reid to Barrett is explained. The important point was whether or not Barrett purchased the car from a trader dealing in similar articles. If so, the place where the bargain was made is immaterial.\nReasons (\u0192 and g) refer to the special guarantee which Barrett demanded before committing himself to the purchase of the car. Reid told him the car had come from New York and that the customs duties had been paid. It was purely a business precaution to require a guarantee against a claim by the custom authorities. There is perhaps more significance in the guarantee demanded against a claim by an insurance company, but standing alone, if Barrett\u2019s story be believed\u2014and that is really the test\u2014it does not import bad faith on Barrett\u2019s part, for it does not necessarily mean that Barrett suspected that the car had been stolen. With great respect, I cannot help thinking that the learned trial judge placed the duty of a purchaser of a second hand car on much too high a plane. Good faith does not need to be une bonne foi \u00e9clatante, it suffices that it be an honest belief that the vendor is the owner of the thing sold. Nor if there be an error on the part of the purchaser is it necessary that the error be an invincible one. I do not think the authorities cited by the learned judge should be given that effect, for it would not be justified by the language of the code.\nBarrett\u2019s story, which I have given in full, is a perfectly consistent one. The learned trial judge has not said that he did not believe it, but has indicated reasons why he inferred that Barrett was in bad faith. Under these circumstances, I do not think that this court should reject Barrett\u2019s testimony.\nI have not adverted to the fact that the name of Hector Meunier was inserted in the contract as seller of the car. The circumstances under which this was done are fully explained. Meunier obtained the discounting of the notes given in payment by Barrett. It was at the latter\u2019s request that Meunier signed the contract. The intervention of Meunier, whether or not he was a dealer in used cars, has no other significance.\nI think therefore that the respondents are entitled to the protection of art. 1489 C.C., having bought the car in good faith from a trader dealing in similar articles. This means that the appellant cannot reclaim it without reimbursing to the respondents the price they paid for it. He has not offered to do so, but the whole question submitted by his counsel at the hearing was whether the respondents were entitled to reimbursement. He fails in this and therefore his appeal must be dismissed. As an act of indulgence, however, and to avoid any difficulty in the future, we think that the dismissal of the appellant\u2019s action should be without prejudice to his right to revendicate the car on reimbursing the price paid by the respondents.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Audette & Garneau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fauteux & Fauteux.\n"

After some repairs had been made, D. entered into a conditional promise of sale of the barge to the R. Co., which, apparently, undertook to pay for the repairs. D. wrote to the respondents that he had \u201csold\u201d his barge to the R. Co. \u201cwho will take immediate possession. The R. Co. will arrange with you about payment of repairs Which have been done thereon.\u201d The R. Co. became insolvent and D. retook possession of the barge, the purchase money being unpaid. The respondents sue both D. and the R. Co. to recover the whole costs of repairing the barge.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that D. was liable for all the repairs done to the barge. While, as directed by D., the respondents appear to have rendered their account for repairs to the R. Co. and to have made some arrangement with it for payment, the evidence does not establish intent on their part to discharge D. as their debtor\u2014an intent essential to novation (Art. 1173 C.C.) and never to be presumed (Art. 1171 CO. In the absence of this \u201cevident intention\u201d the notification given by D. is to be deemed to be a simple indication by him of a person who was to pay in his place, which does not suffice to effect novation. (Art. 1174 C.C.)\nPer Duff J. dissenting.\u2014The letter of notification by D. to the respondents was an unmistakable intimation of his intention not to be responsible for any repairs done after its date and, as the possession of the barge then passed to the R. Co., the respondents had no authority to proceed with the repairs except with the latter\u2019s consent. Upon the evidence, the inference is justified that both the respondents and the R. Co. understood that the repairs were to be charged to the latter only.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondents\u2019 action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. T. Brosseau K.C. for the appellant.\nP. St-Germain K.C. and P. N. Pontbriand for the respondents\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The respondents sue to recover the cost of repairing a barge. The instructions for these repairs were given by the owner, the defendant Dansereau. After some repairs had been made, Dansereau entered into a conditional promise of sale of the barge to his co-defendant the Richelieu Transportation Co., which, apparently, undertook to pay for the repairs. Dansereau notified the respondents of this arrangement, without, however, disclaiming responsibility for work yet to be done, and he instructed them to deliver the barge when ready to the company. Delivery was made accordingly. The barge was used by the company until it became insolvent. When this occurred, the purchase price being unpaid, Dansereau retook possession under the terms of his agreement with the Richelieu Transportation Company.\nWhile, as directed by Dansereau, the respondents appear to have rendered their account for repairs to the Richelieu Transportation Company, and to have made some arrangement with it for payment, the evidence does not establish intent on their part to discharge Dansereau as their debtor\u2014an intent essential to novation (Art. 1173, C.C.) and never to be presumed (Art. 1171, C.C.). In the absence of this \u201cevident intention\u201d we have a case of simple indication by the debtor of a person who is to pay in his place which does not suffice to effect novation. (Art. 1174, C.C.). The text of these articles of the code is so clear and explicit that recourse to authorities to elucidate their scope or application is quite unnecessary.\nThe evidence negatives the giving of orders for any part of the repairs by the Richelieu Transportation Co. They were all made upon Dansereau\u2019s orders. It is sufficiently shewn that all the repairing done was necessary and that the charge therefor is reasonable. The findings of fact in the following consid\u00e9rant in the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench are warranted by the evidence: Consid\u00e9rant que les demandeurs ont prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ont fait les r\u00e9parations \u00e0 cette barge, au montant de $2,785.89, suivant les instructions donn\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 Dansereau, que ces r\u00e9parations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utiles, n\u00e9cessaires m\u00eame, ont ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la valeur de la barge et qu\u2019elles l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage du dit d\u00e9fendeur qui en \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire et que, quant \u00e0 la question de novation, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve de novation expresse, et que bien qu\u2019il y ait quelques-\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019existence de novation tacite, ou par les faits, notamment, dans le fait de l\u2019acceptation, par les demandeurs, des billets de la compagnie \u201cBiche-lieu Transportation Co., Ltd.\u201d, de l\u2019envoi de compte des demandeurs uniquement \u00e0 cette compagnie, pour des r\u00e9parations, de la production, par les demandeurs, dans la faillite de cette compagnie, de leur r\u00e9clamation, n\u00e9anmoins, ces quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont insuffisants pour d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence de telle novation, la novation, d\u2019ailleurs, ne pouvant pas se pr\u00e9sumer, l\u2019intention de l\u2019op\u00e9rer devant \u00eatre \u00e9vidente, (article 1171, C.C.) et cette intention n\u2019\u00e9tant pas \u00e9vidente d\u2019ans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que dans le cas de doute sur l\u2019existence de la novation, la cour doit juger qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de novation.\nThe appellant has had the full benefit of the work for which payment from him is claimed. The barge on which the repairs were made admittedly always remained his property. He alone gave instructions for the making of these repairs. His only substantial defence to this action was novation. His attempt to establish that has failed. There was a simple delegation which may have given to the respondents a new debtor, but did not amount to a complete novation because proof of evident intent to effect novation by discharging the debtor who made the delegation is lacking.\nTaking this view of the case it is unnecessary for us to pass upon the alleged misrepresentation by the appellant of the nature of his sale to the Richelieu Transportation Co., or upon its effect on the novation claimed. This we might have been called upon to do had the essential elements of a novation been established.\nWe accept the view taken in the Superior Court and maintained in the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the respondents had lost the privilege on which they based their conservatory attachment.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014Certain undisputed facts seem to me to be conclusive in their effect against the respondents. The letter of the 31st of July, informing the respondents that the barge had been sold to the Richelieu Transportation Company, who would take possession of it immediately, and advising the respondents that this company would arrange about the payment of repairs already done, was an unmistakable intimation of the intention of the appellant Dansereau not to be responsible for any repairs done after that date. As the learned trial judge finds, it sufficiently expresses the intention, as regards work to be done in the future at all events, to put an end to the contractual relations between the parties. It is undeniable, also, as the learned trial judge also finds, that the respondents acquiesced in this declaration of Dansereau. Not only did the respondents treat the Richelieu Transportation Company as their debtors; they accepted their promissory notes, extending the time for the payment of the debt, without consulting Dansereau. It is impossible to maintain that, consistently with good faith on the part of the respondents, this conduct can, after the notification of the 31st of July, be reconciled with the continued existence of an intention on their part to hold Dansereau responsible for repairs executed subsequent to that date. If Dansereau\u2019s own evidence be accepted as to the nature of the original arrangement between himself and the respondents, there could be no question that he was at liberty at any time to direct the continuance of the work. The learned trial judge appears to have been satisfied with his evidence.\nIt should be observed, also, that the possession of the barge passed to the Richelieu Transportation Company. It is difficult to see how, without the consent of the Richelieu Transportation Company, and in face of the notification of the 31st of July, the respondents possessed any authority to proceed with the repairs. The respondents deny that any authority was in fact given by the Richelieu Transportation Company, but this denial does not appear to have impressed the learned trial judge, and that contention is open to the destructive criticism that the respondents, although required to produce their books by subpoena, failed to do so. In view of all the facts, the inference is justified that both the respondents and the Richelieu Transportation Company understood that the repairs were to be charged to the Richelieu Transportation Company, and that the repairs proceeded on that footing; and the question, consequently, whether there was or was not an explicit arrangement between the Richelieu Transportation Company and the respondents, appears to have little importance.\nAs to the repairs done before the 31st of July, a different question arises. In respect of them, the obligation to pay was in existence, and the appellant Dansereau is responsible, in the absence of sufficient evidence of release. The question is a doubtful one, and on the whole I am disposed to think that as regards that question, the conclusion of the Court of King\u2019s Bench ought not to be set aside. The respondents have failed to establish in this action the amount to which they are entitled under this head, and the learned trial judge appears to treat that amount as negligible. It will be sufficient, I think, to protect them by reserving any right they may have to recover for such repairs.\nThe appeal should be allowed, with costs, and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. G. Magnan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P. N. Pontbriand.\n"

These debentures were payable at the Merchants Bank of Canada at Camrose in Canadian currency. On or about the 21st November, 1913, Thompson executed a declaration of trust, whereby he declared that he held the debentures in trust for four of his children named therein, and deposited the declaration of trust with the said bank in whose hands it has ever since remained. Thompson died in 1923. During his lifetime he never received or attempted to take any benefit from the debentures. He, through agents, invested and re-invested the proceeds therefrom and the income and proceeds of the debentures and of the subsequently acquired securities were all passed through an account in the said bank entitled \"Alexander Thompson trust.\"\nThe Crown claims to be entitled to succession duty upon the amount of the accumulated trust funds as they stood at the date of Thompson's death under clauses (a) and (b) of section 6 of the Succession Duties Act, R.S.A. [1922], c. 28. Duty was paid subject to its being refunded in the event of its being found that duty was not payable and the question was referred by special case to the Supreme Court of Alberta, which by a majority decided in favour of the plaintiffs (respondents).\nW. S. Gray for the appellant. The doner must make his gift in such manner that possession and enjoyment may be assumed immediately. The retention of possession by the donor is fatal to the respondent's case, otherwise sections 6 and 7 of the Act are rendered useless.\nN. D. MacLean, K.C. for the respondent. The cestuis que trustent had full possession and the said Alexander Thompson only had such control as it was necessary for him to have to function as a trustee.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The debentures, which were the subject of the declaration of trust, were payable to bearer, negotiable, and part of the currency of the country. The declaration of trust operated just as it would have operated had the debentures been bank-notes. The late Alexander Thompson, in consequence of the declaration, became trustee for the persons named, but he retained possession and entire control. In point of law, Thompson's possession was the possession of the cestuis que trustent; but the real question is whether this possession of theirs, which was only theirs by virtue of the declaration of trust, was \"possession\" of the character contemplated by section 6. The question does not lend itself to extended discussion; I confess it does appear to me to be very clear that, within the meaning of the statute, \"possession\" was not \"assumed\" by the beneficiaries. I think the section contemplates possession by the beneficiaries as contradistinguished from possession by the donor; and not a possession which, in fact, is that of the donor, and is attributable to the beneficiaries in point of law solely by force of the instrument under which the title of the beneficiaries is created.\nThe appeal should be allowed. The question of costs may be spoken to.\nAppeal allowed.\n"

The appellants sought to recover $6,000 as money lent. Their transactions were with the respondent, C. R. Tufford, and the liability of the other respondents depended upon the agency of Tufford. The judgment at the trial proceeded upon the view that all three respondents were jointly and severally liable.\nHeld that while, if the agency were established, there might be an alternative liability, that liability continued only until the election of the appellants to accept one, either the principal or the agent, as their debtor and then only he could be sued to judgment.\nHeld, in view of the facts, that the appellants might elect to have judgment against the respondents, the C. R. Tufford Company, Limited, or C. R. Tufford, but that, as against the other respondent, the Delta Company, Limited, the appeal should be dismissed, because there was no proof that either of the respondents was authorized to borrow on its credit.\nAN APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, the Honourable Mr. Justice Ives.\nThe judgment appealed from was reversed in part.\nThe facts are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nMaclean K.C. for the appellant.\nWoods K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The Delta Copper Company, one of the defendants (respondents), was in possession of a copper mine in British Columbia which it was endeavouring to develop under an option to purchase, and it was trying to raise the necessary capital for the purchase and development of the property by the sale of shares of its capital stock. The defendant, C. R. Tufford, Ltd., was the exclusive agent for the sale of these shares upon the terms of a written agreement of 12th February, 1917, and the defendant, C. R. Tufford, was the president of the latter company and the agent and director of its activities in the sale of the stock. The head offices of the two defendant companies were established at Edmonton, where the defendant, C. R. Tufford, who was a broker, also had his office. The plaintiffs (appellants) resided at Caledonia in Ontario; they had acquired some of the stock of the Delta Company in December, 1916. In the following spring the defendant, Tufford, went to Ontario for the purpose of disposing of the stock or a portion of the stock which the Tufford Company was authorized to sell, and in April and the early part of May he had some interviews with the plaintiffs at Caledonia. Payments upon the Delta Company's option to purchase were accruing, and the defendant Tufford Company's agency for sale of the shares was conditional upon the making of sales and payment of the proceeds to the Delta Company in fixed amounts within the times limited therefor by the agency agreement; one of the provisions being that if the agent paid or procured to be paid to the Delta Company, in respect of shares sold under the terms of the agreement, the sum of $10,000, on or before 15th May, 1917, the agreement should continue until 15th June, 1917. Upon the former date, 15th May, 1917, it was also necessary for the Delta Company to make a considerable payment in order to save its rights under its option of purchase. The defendant, Tufford, in addition to his interest in the business of stock selling under the agency agreement, was a shareholder of the Delta Company, either individually or through the Tufford Company, of which he was president and had the control. In these circumstances it was necessary to provide $10,000 on or before 15th May. Negotiations took place between Tufford and the plaintiffs which resulted in the latter paying to the former, on that day, an amount of $6,000, which was immediately transmitted to Tufford, Ltd., at Edmonton, and by that company paid to the Delta Company, and 6,000 shares of the Delta Company's stock were then allotted to and placed in the name of the plaintiff, Moore, in trust. The main question at issue is as to whether this payment was made by the plaintiffs as a loan upon the security of the stock, or as consideration for the purchase of the stock. There was an agreement in writing executed at the time between Tufford, party of the first part, and the plaintiffs, parties of the second part, whereby it was mutually agreed:\nThat the party of the first part hereby agrees to sell six thousand shares of capital stock of the Delta Copper Company, Limited (N.P.L.) standing in the name of Thos. G. Moore in trust for the parties of the second part at or for the price of six thousand dollars on or before three months from date in the following manner, namely, one thousand shares within thirty days from date, two thousand shares within sixty days from date, and the balance within three months from date, and to prove his good faith he hereby agrees to deposit five thousand shares of his own stock in above described company with said Thos. G. Moore as trustee, said stock to be forfeited if party of first part does not carry out his agreement. Provided party of the first part does carry out his agreement his five thousand shares are released by above mentioned trustee to said party of first part, and said party of first part immediately transfers one thousand of said shares to each of the parties of the second part, thereby liquidating any and all claims which the parties or any of them of the second part have or may have whatsoever against party hereto of first part.\nThe plaintiffs, Murray and Moore, testified in effect that they and their associates had, previously to 15th May, purchased all the stock of the Delta Company which, at the time, they were willing or could afford to purchase; that therefore they declined to entertain Tufford's solicitation for the purchase of further stock, but that they finally yielded to his entreaties for assistance in the urgent circumstances of the case, so far as to agree to lend the sum of $6,000, upon the security of the 6,000 shares, and subject to the terms mentioned in the agreement, which amount they borrowed from Thomas Patterson, a neighbour. Tufford on the other hand testified that he sold the 6,000 shares to the plaintiffs at $1 per share and that the money was raised and paid as the purchase price. During the following year there was considerable correspondence between the plaintiffs and Tufford, and the plaintiffs acquired some additional stock.\nThe mine did not realize the hopes or expectations of its promoters and shareholders; it was unproductive, and this action was instituted and brought to trial against the three defendants upon various counts, including one for the recovery of the sum of $6,000 as money lent.\nAt the close of the trial, the learned judge expressed the view that the $6,000 was a loan, and that the plaintiffs should succeed upon that issue, but he suggested a question as to whether the Delta Company, as distinguished from the other defendants, was liable to repay it, because it had received the money under the agency for sale agreement with Tufford Limited. Some discussion upon this topic followed, and the case stood over for judgment. Then, after consideration and further examination of the correspondence, the learned judge, having disposed of the other issues, which do not now arise, announced that he was of the same opinion as expressed when the evidence was completed at the trial; he said that the $6,000 was undoubtedly a loan, and he added:\u2014\nTufford was bound to find $10,000, and pay it to The Delta Company that day (15th May, 1917), under the terms of the agreement between Tufford, Limited, and the Delta Company. He induces the plaintiffs\u2014 stampeded them\u2014with a story of material loss to the company in which 'they were shareholders, if the money was not found. They get it on their credit and handed it over to him. He sends it to Tufford, Limited, and that company in turn hands it to the Delta Company. And as a further inducement, Tufford delivers to Moore to be held by him in trust, 6,000 shares of the Delta Company stock as security, and further he undertook to sell this security stock within three months to the public, and at the same time the plaintiffs also were authorized to sell it. These shares were to be sold at not less than one dollar, but eventually, as a consideration in other transactions, these shares and all others that had been sold at one dollar were reduced to fifty cents by doubling the number of shares. Neither Tufford nor the plaintiffs have sold these shares. They are still held by Moore as security for the loan. And certainly this sum remains a loan until paid or until plaintiffs expressly agree that its character be changed. I have examined all the correspondence, and I find no clear voluntary consent on plaintiff's part to accept this stock, now held as a security, in payment of the loan. There is much confusion in the letters of all parties but not sufficient for me to believe that any of these men intended at any time to release their claim for a return of this money, or that Tufford ever thought they had.\nOn appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta that court allowed the appeal and dismissed the action, but the learned judges gave no reasons which are reported in the case, although we are informed that Beck J. dissented from the judgment of the majority.\nAt the argument I was impressed with the view that no sufficient or satisfactory reason had been shown for disturbing the finding of the trial judge upon the issue of loan or purchase, and now, after carefully reading the evidence and exhibits in proof, I am confirmed in that opinion. It is not the view of the learned judges of the Appellate Division upon the merits involved in the issue of fact which should govern the disposition of the case. It was for the Appellate Division to ascertain whether there is evidence upon which the trial judge could find as he did find; and, if there be evidence of the facts found to which he could reasonably give effect, having due regard to the weight of evidence, it was for the court to consider further whether his finding is based upon any misdirection, occasioning a substantial miscarriage of justice, or the judgment, in the light of the evidence, and having regard to the course of the trial, discloses any error of law. If there be no error in these particulars the judgment should be permitted to stand. It is by s. 51 of the Supreme Court Act the duty of this court to give the judgment which the court below should have given; and, in the endeavour to discharge this duty, I am satisfied that there is evidence reasonably to justify the finding that the money was advanced by way of loan upon the security of the stock, and not as payment for stock purchased. This was clearly the intention of the transaction according to the testimony of the defendants, Murray and Moore, and there are moreover passages in the subsequent correspondence which are inconsistent with the view that the parties intended to become purchasers of the stock. It is urged that there are to be found in the circumstances of the case, and in other places in the correspondence, considerations or statements which are compatible only wish an intention to purchase the shares; but I think the appellants failed to establish this, and I do not find in the circumstances, or in the evidence upon which the appellants rely, anything which demonstrates error in the trial judge's finding of fact.\nThere is a minor point, involving the liability of the borrower for $1,000, part of the loan, which it is said the learned trial judge overlooked. It appears that his attention was not directed to this point; but, upon examination of the facts, I do not think they justify any reduction of the amount found. By the agreement of 15th May, Tufford agreed to sell 1,000 shares within thirty days. On 2nd June following, he wrote Moore and his associates explaining that, by reason of a deal which he had completed in Toronto, he could not raise the $1,000 before 15th June, and he added\nthat means default on my part unless you get busy and either sell or buy the thousand shares.\nMoore, in his reply of 10th June, said:\u2014\nWe have decided to take care of the thousand shares mentioned in your letter.\nIt is urged that this correspondence should be interpreted to mean that, as to the thousand shares, part of the 6,000, the plaintiffs had become the purchasers, and that therefore, to that extent, the loan was satisfied. I think it very doubtful however that the plaintiffs in stating that they had decided to take care of the thousand shares intended to purchase them, or to take them in part payment of the money lent. I think it probable that they intended no more than to intimate that in the circumstances they would not insist upon Tufford making the sale of these shares within the thirty days stipulated by the agreement, and it is to be observed that by a later agreement of 3rd September, 1917, between Tufford and the plaintiffs, which is signed by all of them, it was agreed that Tufford\nwith the assistance of one, or more, if required) (of the plaintiffs), shall forthwith, upon demand of the latter in writing, sell all or any part of the 6,000 shares at $1 per share.\nIt was anticipated of course, according to the plaintiffs' case, that the loan would be repaid by the proceeds of the sale of the shares, and, if in the interval 1,000 of these had been purchased by the plaintiffs, it is remarkable that in the later agreement they should have adhered to the project of selling the whole of the 6,000 shares which still stood in the name of the defendant, Moore, in trust.\nThen it is said that inasmuch as the agreement of 15th May, 1917, provided that the defendant, Tufford, should deposit 6,000 shares of his own stock with the plaintiff Moore as trustee, to be forfeited if Tufford failed to carry out his agreement, and inasmuch as those 5,000 shares were deposited and forfeited, the plaintiffs, receiving the benefit of the forfeiture, could not thereafter insist upon payment of the loan, because of the rule that, where a penalty is provided for non-performance of a contract, the penalty if recovered shall be taken as a satisfaction of the contractual liability to secure which the penalty is stipulated. Harrison v. Wright[1]. It must be observed, however, that the agreement Which stipulated for the deposit and forfeiture of Tufford's 5,000 shares did not expressly provide for the loan or for the repayment of it. The agreement to lend the $6,000 upon the security of an equivalent amount of the Delta Company's shares was an oral agreement, concluded between the plaintiffs and Tufford, and the purpose of the written agreement was merely to bind the defendant, Tufford, to realize by sale of these shares within the times limited, so as to provide for payment of the loan; and, to ensure that he would do this, or, as the agreement states, \"to prove his good faith,\" he deposited his own 5,000 shares. The agreement of 15th May, and the forfeiture of the 5,000 shares of Tufford's stock, are concerned with the security for the loan, not with the loan itself. The validity of the forfeiture is not in question. It would seem that Tufford acknowledged the forfeiture and surrendered his interest; but there is no proof, except the agreement itself, that the forfeiture was intended to satisfy the loan; and, for the reasons which I have mentioned, I do not consider that the agreement bears that interpretation.\nFinally, it is urged on behalf of the respondents that, if the $6,000 paid by the appellants to Tufford was money lent, the loan was to C. R. Tufford personally and that neither of the defendant companies is liable for it. This defence was not raised by the pleadings, nor does it appear to have been suggested at the trial as affecting the liability of C. R. Tufford, Limited, although the learned trial judge did, in the discussion at the close of the trial to which I have alluded, suggest doubt as to the liability of the Delta Company; but he does not refer to the question in the reasons for judgment which he subsequently delivered. C. R. Tufford, Limited, is said to have consisted of C. R. Tufford, his wife, mother and stenographer; he was the president of the company, and no doubt was acting as its agent in his efforts to dispose of the stock of the Delta Company, and to maintain the agreement under which the Tufford Company had authority to sell the stock. It was the latter company to which he reported and to which, under his instructions, the $6,000 paid by the plaintiff were remitted, and I am not disposed to disturb the finding involved in the judgment of the learned trial judge that Tufford, in his transaction with the plaintiffs, was acting with the authority and on behalf of C. R. Tufford, Limited. Tufford borrowed the money, but as between him, or the Tufford Company, and the Delta Company the transaction was treated as a purchase of the 6,000 shares by the plaintiffs; Tufford agreed to sell them, and it was anticipated that they would realize enough to pay the loan, but the transaction is not capable of an interpretation which would exclude personal liability of Tufford to repay the money borrowed. If, as I assume, he acted as agent of the Tufford Company, he nevertheless pledged his individual credit for the repayment of the loan.\nNow the judgment at the trial proceeds upon the view that all three defendants are jointly and severally liable. The judgment is that the\nplaintiffs do recover judgment against the defendants and each of them for the sum of $6,000, etc.\nBut the liability of the defendants, the Delta Copper Company, Limited, and C. R. Tufford, Limited, depends upon the agency of Tufford and upon the assumption that the loan was contracted on their behalf, Tufford undertaking at the same time personal responsibility for repayment. I find it difficult to justify a judgment holding the parties jointly and severally liable. The ordinary rule is that the principal and agent may be liable to the other contracting party in the alternative, which alternative liability continues until the election of the latter to accept one, either the principal or the agent, as his debtor. In Priestly v. Fernie[2], where the master of a ship had signed a bill of lading in his own name and was sued upon it to judgment, it was held that an action did not lie against the owner of the ship for the same cause, although satisfaction had not been obtained against the master, and Bramwell B., pronouncing the judgment of the Court of Exchequer, said:\nIf this were an ordinary case of principal and agent, where the agent having made the contract in his own name, has been sued on it to judgment, there can be no doubt that no second action would be maintainable against the principal. The very expression that where a contract is so made the contractee has an election to sue agent or principal, supposes he can only sue one of them, that is to say, sue to judgment.\nThis case was cited with approval by Lord Cairns in Kendall v. Hamilton[3], and followed by the Court of Appeal in Ireland in Sullivan v. Sullivan[4].\nAs to the Delta Company however there are additional and different considerations. That company was in possession of the mine under option to purchase. There was first an agreement of 24th June, 1916, between Bernard Halloran and Robt. W. Thomson, of the first part, and Byron R. Jones, of the second part, whereby the parties of the first part gave to the party of the second part the sole and exclusive right and option to purchase, for $50,000, certain mineral claims which comprise the mine in question, payable in instalments of varying amounts half yearly, the last payment to be made on or before 15th November, 1918, the party of the first part having immediate possession of the areas and the right to develop and to mine them. Then there is an agreement of 12th May, 1917, between Bernard Halloran and Robt. W. Thomson of the first part and the Delta Copper Company of the second part, which recites that the parties of the first part are the owners of the Delta group of mineral claims; that by the agreement of 24th June, 1916, they granted to Byron R. Jones an option to purchase them, and that Jones had granted a further option to Robt. Spencer, who had assigned his option to the Delta Copper Company; this agreement provided for the reduction of the payments under the Jones option which were to mature. The agreement between Jones and Spencer and the assignment by Spencer to the Delta Company are not in evidence, but I infer that the Delta Company acquired a mere option and undertook no obligation for payment of the stipulated price. Now there is no evidence that the Delta Company gave to either of the other defendants any authority to borrow money on its account. The agreement between the Delta Company and C. R. Tufford, Limited, is in proof, and it confers no authority except for the sale of shares. There is no evidence that the Delta Company was informed of the facts with regard to the $6,000 transaction between the plaintiffs and Tufford, or had any knowledge or reason to suspect that the amount which the latter remitted was a loan. On 14th May, 1917, C. R. Tufford had telegraphed his firm at Edmonton from Caledonia as follows:\u2014\nStandard Bank here wired two thousand our credit Standard Bank, Edmonton, to-day. Turn to (Delta) company immediately.\nThis refers to a payment of $2,000 which Tufford had obtained from the plaintiffs on the date last mentioned. In the meantime he was endeavouring to arrange for $6,000 additional, and, on the same day, he telegraphed his firm at Edmonton, saying:\u2014\nWatch Standard Bank, Edmonton, to-morrow for more money wired through to-morrow, but do not be disappointed if none comes, and do not depend on it.\nThen on 15th May, he telegraphed again to his firm, in these words:\u2014\nHave company allot and issue to Thomas G. Moore, box forty-four Caledonia, Ontario, out of this issue, eight thousand shares; money wired Standard Bank, Edmonton, covering same yesterday and to-day. Draw full commission under contract thirty per cent before delivering money, then buy two thousand shares our name, and again draw full commission. Complete to-day, sure.\nThese 8,000 shares include the 6,000 shares, which, upon the finding in the case, were to be deposited as security for the plaintiffs' loan, and, in addition, 2,000 shares, which were to be issued in the transaction referred to in Tufford's first telegram of 14th May. The telegrams, it will be per- ceived, convey no information or reason for conjecture, that the $8,000 represented anything but proceeds of the sale of shares, or that the 8,000 shares, or any part of them, were to be issued as security for a loan. On the contrary, Tufford, by his telegram of 15th May, directed that the Tufford Company's commission as selling agent should be withheld, and the taking of commission involved a direct representation of sale. No doubt the money was received by the company, and it may have been used to make up the payment to Halloran and Thomson, which, by the terms of the Delta Company's option, was to be paid on 15th May; but, if so, while in one sense the Delta Company had the benefit of the payment, the money did not go to discharge any obligation of the latter company. It was evidently the policy of the Delta Company that the mine, which was of course speculative property, should pay for itself; the optional payments and cost of development being provided for by money received from the sale of the shares. The plaintiffs now contend that, even if there be no evidence upon which it can be found that the Delta Company authorized the borrowing, nevertheless it is liable to repay them as recipient of the benefit, but I do not think this contention can be maintained.\nThe Delta Company received the money in circumstances which justified it to conclude, and no doubt it dealt with the money upon the assumption, that it was received as proceeds of the sale of its shares. The plaintiffs knew the defendant, Tufford, not otherwise than as agent for sale of the Delta Company's stock, and that agency was certainly not suggestive of any authority in Tufford to borrow money upon the company's credit. If therefore they paid the money to Tufford as a loan to the company, he must be regarded as their agent for the purpose of making the loan, and not as the company's agent to receive it; and, seeing that Tufford caused the money to be paid to the company as proceeds of the sale of the 6,000 shares of stock, which the company, under his instruction, allotted to the plaintiff, Moore, in trust, the plaintiffs have no recourse against the company for the recovery of the money, or by reason of the application of it to the company's purposes. I hold therefore that the plaintiffs cannot recover the $6,000 from the Delta Company upon the allegation of the statement of claim as money lent, or by reason of any benefit which it enjoys through the use or application of the money which it received.\nTherefore, as against the Delta Company, the appeal should be dismissed with costs, but as to the other defendants the appellants may elect to have judgment against one of them with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed in part.\n[1] [1811] 13 East. 343.\n[2] [1865] 3 H. & C. 977.\n[3] [1879] A.C. 504.\n[4] [1912] 2 Ir.

[1922], c. 110 The appellants, licensees of timber berth No. 2335, of which 3,884 acres are situated within the territory of the respondent municipality, were assessed in 1920 by the respondents at a total sum of $35,000, subsequently reduced by the Assessment Equalization Board to $32,882.40. The land subject to the licence is the property of the Crown in right of the Dominion and under s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act is not liable to taxation. The assessment was made for a five-year period beginning in 1921. Notice of assessment was sent to the appellants and later tax notices based on it were also sent in that year and in following years. The appellant did not appeal to the Court of Revision against the assessment, but upon being sued for taxes based thereon together with statutory penalties, contended that the assessment was null and void, alleging fraud on the part of the respondent in making the assessment. The assessment was based upon the value of the land, upon which the timber stood, as farm lands, whereas the appellant's interest is in the timber only.\nHeld, that the legislature of a province may authorize the assessment of the interest of an individual in property belonging to the Crown in right of the Dominion and that such assessment is not obnoxious to sec. 125 of the B.N.A. Act. Smith v. Council of Rural Municipality of Vermilion Hills; City of Montreal v. Attorney General for Canada followed. Held, a case of over-valuation of the timber berth. The appellant should have availed itself of its right of appeal under the Municipal Districts Act, R.S.A., c. 110.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, affirming a judgment of the trial judge in favour of the respondent.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above headnote and in the judgment now reported.\nMacLean K.C. for the appellant.\nWoods K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The appellant, for some years, has held under a license to cut timber from the Dominion Government timber berth no. 2335 of which 3,884 acres are within the territory of the respondent. The license is a yearly one, with right of renewal subject to the conditions therein specified, and vests in the licenses all right of property whatsoever in all trees, timber, lumber and other products of timber which it is entitled by the license to cut, and which have been cut during the continuance of the license. The land subject to this license is of course the property of the Crown in right of the Dominion, and under section 125 of the British North America Act is not liable to taxation.\nIn the year 1920, the respondent assessed against the appellant what was described as timber berth no. 2335, containing 3,884 acres, at a total sum of $35,000, subsequently reduced by the Assessment Equalization Board to $32,882.40. This assessment, under the law governing the respondent, was made for a five-year period beginning in 1921. Notice of the assessment was duly sent to the appellant, and subsequently tax notices based on it were also sent in that year and in the following years. The appellant did not appeal to the Court of Revision against the assessment, but being now sued for the recovery of $2,338.15 for taxes imposed in 1921, 1922 and 1923, and based on this assessment, together with statutory penalties, it contends by way of defence that the assessment is null and void. It also alleges fraud on the part of the respondent in making this assessment. I will at once dispose of this allegation of fraud by saying that it is totally unsupported by the proof. The most that the appellant can contend under the testimony is that the assessor committed a mistake in making this assessment.\nEliminating the question of fraud, the appellant's grounds of attack on the assessment are sufficiently set out in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the statement of defence:\n8. The plaintiff in the year 1920 purported to assess the defendant and its interest in the said (timber berth no. 2335 at the sum of $32,882.40, but in arriving at the said value assessed the value of lands on which the said timber stood, and which lands stand in the name of and are owned by the Government of the Dominion of Canada and are exempt from taxation * * *\n9. The said plaintiff in the year 1920 did not assess the defendant's interest in the said timber berth at its actual cash value as it would be appraised as a just debt from a solvent debtor as required by the Municipal Districts' Act, but on the contrary assessed the defendant's interest at a far higher rate than its actual cash value, and in the said assessment included the value of the land on which the said timber stood, and the said purported assessment in 1920, assessed the defendant's interest at a far higher value than it assessed the land of residents within the plaintiff district.\n10. Wherefore the said purported assessment in 1920 was and is illegal, null and void and made on a wrong principle.\nThe evidence relied on by the appellant is contained in the cross-examination of Mr. Hooper, secretary-treasurer of the respondent, and its assessor during the years in question in this case. Mr. Hooper, who made this assessment, is perfectly frank in speaking of his method of valuation. Formerly lands were assessed on an acreage basis, but afterwards at a valuation. He knew that the only interest of the appellant was under its license and that it owned no land in the district. He made very little personal inspection of this berth on account of the depth of the snow on the ground. He had struck a rate on the land that he knew well and he worked it out in accordance with whether the land was better or poorer, and in assessing had reference to the soil, the situation and so forth. He assessed the appellant on a farm land basis, taking into consideration the soil and the location. In making the valuation, he did not consider the timber on the land, of which he appears to have had little knowledge. His valuation has not included in it any reference to the timber. If he had proceeded to assess the value of the timber in the municipality, he supposes that his assessment probably would have been in the neighbourhood of $2,600 which is suggested to him as its value. He adds that the berth had always been previously assessed exactly the same as farm land, on the acreage basis, and at the time he made the assessment he was not certain how to proceed, but there did not seem (to be) any definite instructions, so he went along; and he thought, at any rate, they had the right to appeal and it would probably be brought up and heard of.\nIt is quite possible in this case that there may have been an over-valuation, a point on which it is not necessary to express any opinion, for there seems to be a marked difference between the value of this tract of land, considered as farm land, and what is stated to be, after a cruise was made in 1924, the value of the timber which the appellant is entitled to cut. But this brings up the question on which the case turned in the appellate divisional court: Should not the appellant have appealed against this assessment to the Court of Revision and, if its appeal failed, to the district court judge, and not having done so, is it entitled to resist payment of the taxes claimed by the respondent? The appellate court decided this question adversely to the appellant, following a previous decision of its own in another case affecting this same appellant: Municipal District of Pershing v. North West Lumber Co.[1]. The answer of the appellant is that the assessment is null and void as made without jurisdiction over the subject matter, thus raising the only question which need now be considered, for, as stated, there is no proof of fraud.\nA short statement of the legislation governing the assessment of lands in the municipal districts of Alberta, at the time of the assessment complained of, will assist us in deciding this question.\nThis legislation is contained in the Municipal District Act, statutes of 1918, c. 49, frequently amended, and forming now chapter 110 of the revised statutes of Alberta. The Act (s. 2) defines \"land\" or \"property\" as including lands, tenements and hereditaments and any estate or interest therein, including, inter alia, the interest of a holder of any lease of grazing, hay or marsh lands, or of any timber limit, or of any mineral rights from the Dominion of Canada. \"Occupant\" means the inhabitant occupier of any land exempt from taxation in a municipal district, or, if there be no inhabitant occupier of such land, the person entitled to the possession thereof. \"Owner\" means any person who appears by the records of the Land Titles Office to have any interest in any land in the district, other than as mortgagee, lessee or incumbrancee.\nAssessments in the municipal districts are made for five-year periods beginning in 1920, and a statement showing the total assessed value of the land in the district is forwarded by the assessor to the department of municipal affairs and is then considered by a board called the Assessment Equalization Board which may confirm the total assessed value as the equalized assessment of the municipal district, or may fix some other amount as such equalized assessment, and the amount so confirmed or fixed is the local assessed value for the year 1921 and each year thereafter until the next equalized assessment is made, 1920, c. 30, s. 28.\nAll land in every municipal district is liable to assessment and taxation subject to certain exemptions, comprising inter alia all lands belonging to Canada or to the province. R.S.A. 1922, s. 224. Land is assessed at its actual cash value as it would be appraised in payment of a just debt from a solvent debtor, exclusive of the value of any buildings erected thereon or of any other increase in value caused by the expenditure of labour or capital thereon. R.S.A. 1922, s. 226.\nIf any person thinks that he or any other person has been wrongly assessed or assessed too high or too low, he may, within the time limited by the Act, appeal from the assessment to the council which is constituted a Court of Revision for revising the assessment roll, and from the decision on this appeal he has a further right of appeal to a judge of the district court. The decision and judgment of the judge is final and conclusive in every case adjudicated upon. R.S.A. 1922, s. 241 and following, 258 and following, 271. I refer merely to the sections of the revised statutes which consolidate provisions in force at the time of this assessment.\nUpon the termination of the sittings of the Court of Revision, or, where there are no appeals, upon the expiry of the time for appealing thereto, the secretary enters over his signature at the foot of the last page of the roll the fol- lowing certificate, filling in the date of such entry: \"roll finally completed this\u2026\u2026day of\u2026\u202619\u2026\" And the roll thus finally completed and certified is the revised assessment roll for the year, subject to amendment on appeal to a district court judge and to amendment necessary to bring the roll into conformity with the assessment made by the Assessment Equalization Board and any directions of the board with respect thereto, and is valid and binds all parties concerned, notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll. R.S.A. 1922, s. 254.\nThere is no doubt that where the assessor in making an assessment acts without jurisdiction, e.g., by assessing against a ratepayer property not subject to assessment, the failure to appeal to the Court of Revision or to the district court judge does not preclude the ratepayer from setting up the nullity of the assessment in answer to a demand for taxes levied on the basis of such an assessment, unless, perhaps, where jurisdiction is conferred on the court or judge to deal with such matters, as would appear to be the case under s. 83 of the Ontario Assessment Act. I may merely refer here to the latest decisions bearing on this question: Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[2]; Donahue Brothers v. Corporation of the Parish of St. Etienne de la Malbaie[3].\nOn the other hand, it is settled that the legislature of a province may authorize the assessment of the interest of an individual in property belonging to the Dominion of Canada, and that such assessment is not obnoxious to s. 125 of the British North America Act. Smith v. Council of the Rural Municipality of Vermillion Hills[4]; City of Montreal v. Attorney General for Cacnada[5].\nFinally, if the complaint of the ratepayer, who has an interest in the assessed property, is that he has been assessed too high, in other words, if he objects to the excessive valuation of a subject matter of assessment which is within the jurisdiction of the assessing authority, and an appeal is afforded him by the assessing statute, he cannot be heard to attack the assessment in answer to an action claiming the tax, if he has not availed himself of this right of ap- peal, or if, having asserted an appeal, the decision has sustained the assessment. Town of MacLeod v. Campbell[6]; Shannon Realties Limited v. Ville de St. Michel[7].\nThe able argument of Mr. Maclean has not convinced me that this is not really a case of alleged over-valuation of the timber berth of the appellant, and therefore my opinion is that the latter should have availed itself of its right of appeal under the statute. The cross-examination of the assessor, as well as the assessment roll, clearly shew that what was assessed in this case was the timber berth or the interest of the appellant under its license from the Crown, and not the lands themselves, although they were considered for purposes of valuation. The assessor thought that he was entitled to assess the appellant's interest in this land, and he knew it had no other interest than its license, at the value of the land on a farm land basis. It would probably be vain to expect that the persons whom the district municipal councils employ to assess property and prepare an assessment roll, should have expert knowledge of the principles of valuation. To guard against and correct their mistakes, the statute provides what may be called a domestic tribunal, with a further appeal to a judge. Here the searching enquiry into the motives or state of mind of the assessor does not show that an attempt was made to assess anything else than the appellant's interest in the land, however much the assessor's mode of valuation may be criticized. If a mistake was made, it could have been corrected by an appeal under the Act.\nI have not failed to notice Mr. Maclean's contention at the argument that the interest of the appellant under its timber license would not come within the definition of \"owner\" under the Municipal District Act. I am inclined to think that it would, for the appellant does not appear to be a lessee within the meaning of the exception in the definition, but could be better described as a licensee, and it certainly had an interest in the land subject to its license. I think the whole gist of the appellant's case is that it had an assessable interest in the lands, but that it was illegally assessed for the lands themselves. To my mind, in the last analysis, we have nothing more here than an attempt to resist payment of taxes by complaining of an over-valuation of the subject matter of the assessment.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs, but I think it unnecessary to express any opinion on the ground relied on by the learned trial judge in giving judgment for the taxes claimed, that the matter was concluded by the 1923 amendment to the Municipal District Act.\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014I acquiesce in the conclusion because I think it is impossible to decide otherwise, having regard to the judgment of the Judicial Committee in City of Montreal v. Attorney General for Canada[8]. There, although it is provided by s. 125 of the British North America Act 1867, that no lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation, it was nevertheless held that a provincial legislature might authorize the taxation of a tenant in respect to lands belonging to the Dominion, as if he were the actual owner; and therefore an assessment was upheld which differed in no respect from an assessment of the property against the Dominion Crown, except that by the statute, it was the tenant who was held to pay the tax, and the land was nominally assessed against the tenant. If this legislation did not offend against the Constitutional Act, I do not perceive how it can be successfully maintained that anything is involved except the amount of the assessment, when, in the present case, the assessor, in the absence of a statutory direction, valued the land as if the tenant were the owner, and charged the assessment against the tenant in the assessment roll.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1923] 19 Alta.

Act, ss. 91, 92\nSection 189 of the Railway Act, 1919, c 68, which enables railway companies with the consent of the Governor in Council to take possession of Crown. Lands applies to Provincial Crown Lands and is within the competence of the Parliament of Canada to enact.\nIt is within the discretion of the Governor in Council to grant or refuse the consent required by said section. The (condition which requires consent imports no more than an incidental power of regulation.\nThe Nipissing Central Railway Company was incorporated by a statute of Canada 6-7 Ed. VII, c 112, and was authorized amongst other things to construct its railway from the town of Latchford in the province of Ontario northerly into and through part of the province of Quebec. The company obtained from the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada tas required by the Railway Act, an order approving of its general location plan, and a further order sanctioning the plan and profile, etc., of a portion of the line between Larder Lake in Ontario to Osisko Lake in the township of Rouyn, in the province of Quebec, a distance of 37 miles, and which passed through lands vested in the Crown in the right of the province of Quebec. The company thereupon applied to the Governor in Council for leave to take possession of the said Crown Lands pursuant to section 189 of the said Railway Act, which provides as follows:\n(1) No company shall take possession of, use or occupy any lands vested in the Crown, without the consent of the Governor in Council.\n(2) Any railway company may, with such consent, upon such terms as the Governor in Council prescribes, take and appropriate, for the use of its railway and works, so much of the lands of the Crown lying on the route of the railway which have not been granted or sold\u2019, as is necessary for such railway, and also so much of the public beach, or bed of any lake, river or stream, or of the land so vested covered with the waters of any such lake, river or stream as is necessary for making and completing and using its said railway and works.\n(3) The company may not alienate any such lands so taken, used or occupied. (4) Whenever any such lands are vested\u2019 in the Crown for any special purpose, or subject to any trust, the compensation money which the company pays therefor shall be held or applied by the Governor in Council for the like purpose or trust.\nThe Attorney General of the province of Quebec objected to the Governor in Council giving the leave asked for, and claimed that the expression \u201clands vested in the Crown\u201d in said section 189 was limited to lands vested in the Crown in the right of the Dominion and not of any province. He further contended that if the said lands did include lands vested in the Crown in right of the province, the section in question was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Thereupon pursuant to the provisions of section 60 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. [1906], c. 139, the following questions were referred to the Supreme Court:\n1. Is it within the competence of Parliament to enact the (provisions of section 189 of the Railway Act, 1919, with regard to provincial Crown lands?\n2. If the answer to question 1 be in the affirmative, is said section 189 as it now stands applicable to provincial Crown lands?\n3. Is it obligatory upon the Governor in Council to give his consent under the provisions of subsection 2 of said section upon any proper application therefor, or has he discretion to grant or refuse such consent as he may see flit?\nLafleur K.C. for the Attorney General of Canada contended that by virtue of subsection 29 of section 91, and subsection 10 of section 92, B.N.A. Act, the railway in question was under the sole jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, and as a necessary consequence Parliament was vested with the necessary powers to enable the railway to be constructed and operated without assistance or hindrance from the provincial legislatures, and that the question was settled by the judgments of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Corporation of the City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co.[1]; Attorney General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[2].\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and Parmenter for the Nipissing Central Railway Company relied on the same cases, and also emphasized the fact that section 189 had its origin before the passing of the B.N.A. Act. Substantially the same language is to be found in the Railway Act of 1868, 31 Vict. 68, s. 7. Lanctot K.C. and Geofirion K.C. for the Attorney General of Quebec contended that the land in question was public property of the province of Qudbec under the B.N.A. Act. St. Catherine\u2019s Milling and Lumber Co. v. Queen[3]; Attorney General for Canada v. Attorneys General for Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia (The Fisheries Case)[4]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v.

Attorney General for Quebec[13]; Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. and Corporation of Toronto[14]; Cushing v. Dupuy[15]; City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[16]. They also distinguished the decision of Attorney General of British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway8, as in that case the harbour in question was the property of the Dominion under section 108 of the B.N.A. Act, and was subject also to the over-riding provisions of the Canadian Pacific Railway charter, 44 V.C. 1.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014By order of the Governor General in Council of 11th June, 1925, the following questions were referred to this Court for hearing and consideration, under the authority of section 60 of the Supreme Court Act:\n1. Is it within the competence of Parliament to enact the provisions of section 189 of the Railway Act, 1919, with regard to provincial Crown lands?\n2. If the answer to question 1 be in the affirmative, is said section 189, as it now stands, applicable to provincial Crown lands?\n3. Is it obligatory upon the Governor in Council to give his consent under the provisions of subsection 2 of said section upon any proper application therefor, or has he discretion to grant or refuse such consent as he may see fit?\nThe order proceeds upon a recital that there is pending an application of the Nipissing Central Railway for the consent of the Governor in Council, under the section mentioned, to take possession of, use and occupy Crown Lands of the province of Quebec for the purposes of a proposed extension of its Larder Lake branch into the Rouyn mining district, and that the Government of Quebec opposes such consent upon the grounds that the section applies only to Crown Lands of the Dominion, and that, if interpreted as applying to Provincial Crown Lands, it is ultra vires of Parliament, in so far as it is intended to affect them.\nThe Nipissing Central Railway Company was incorporated by Act of the Dominion, c. 112 of 1907. The lines of railway which it is authorized to construct and operate are particularly described, and include a line extending from Latchford in the province of Ontario, through certain named townships, and thence, in a northerly direction, to a point on the line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in the province of Quebec, at or near the Matagami River. Thus the work authorized to be constructed is of the class described in the 10th enumeration \u00f6f s. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, as a line of railway connecting one province with another, or extending beyond the limits of a province, and therefore within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of. Canada under the 29th enumeration of s. 91 of the last mentioned Act.\nSection 189, the enactment with regard to which the questions are propounded, is the first of a group of sections comprised in the Railway Act, 1919, under the general title or description, \u201cThe taking and using of lands\u201d; it is introduced under the special caption, \u201cRestrictions\u2014Crown Lands,\u201d and is expressed in the following words:\n189. (1) No company shall take possession of, use or occupy any lands vested in the Grown, without the consent of the Governor in Council.\n(2) Any railway company may, with such consent, upon such terms as the Governor in Council prescribes, take and appropriate, for the use of its railway and works, so much of the lands of the Crown lying on the route of the railway which have not (been granted or sold, as is necessary for such railway, and also so much of the public beach, or bed of any lake, river or stream, or of the land so vested covered with the waters of any such lake, river or stream as is necessary for making and completing and using its said railway and works. (3) The company may not alienate any such lands so taken, used or occupied.\n(4) Whenever any such lands are vested in the Crown for any special purpose, or subject to any trust, the compensation money which the company pays therefor shall be held or applied by the Governor in Council for the like purpose or trust.\nA few brief observations are necessary in order to bring out the setting or context. The Railway Act, 1919, is the general Railway Act of the Dominion, providing for the construction and working of railways, other than Government railways, and authorizing, subject to its provisions, the compulsory taking and using of lands for railway purposes; it provides for the powers and regulation of railway companies, subject to the special or particular legislation affecting them individually; it applies to Government railways only so far as specially provided; it provides also for a Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and this board exercises large powers and jurisdiction with relation to railways under the provisions of the Act.\nUnder the general powers conferred, a railway company may, by s. 162, for the purposes of its undertaking and subject to the provisions of its special Act:\n(a) enter into and upon any Crown lands without previous license therefor, or into or upon the lands of any person whomsoever, lying in the intended route or line of the railway, and make surveys, examinations or other necessary arrangements on such lands for fixing the site of the railway, and set out and ascertain such parts of the lands as are necessary and proper for the railway;\n* * * * *\n(d) make, carry or place the railway across or upon the lands of any person on the located line of the railway;\n* * * * *\n(q) do all other acts necessary for the construction, maintenance and operation of the railway.\nIt is provided by s. 166 that the company shall not commence the construction of its railway, or any section or portion thereof, until the general location shall have been approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, nor until the plan, profile or book of reference of the railway shall have been sanctioned by the Board. Then by s. 167, it is enacted that the company shall prepare, and submit to the Board, a map showing the general location of the proposed line of the railway, the termini, and principal towns and places through which it is to pass, with some additional particulars which are specified, and such further or other information as the Board may require. This map may be approved by the Board, subject to such changes and alterations as may be deemed expedient, and, when so approved, the company is, by s. 168, required to prepare a plan, profile and book of reference of the railway with precise particulars, showing, among other requirements, the areas, length and width of the lands proposed to be taken, giving the numbers of lots, and defining the portion of each lot proposed to be taken, and stating the names of the owners and occupiers, so far as they can be ascertained. By s. 170, the plan, profile and book of reference are to be submitted to the Board, which, if satisfied therewith, may sanction them, and by such sanctioning, the Board shall be deemed to have approved the location, grades and curves as shown; and, by s. 172, the plan profile and book of reference, when sanctioned, are to be deposited with the Board, and copies thereof are also to, be deposited in the office of the registrars of deeds for the districts or counties within which the lands lie. The company may then proceed, subject to the provisions of the Act, to take, for the purposes of its railway, the lands so defined or ascertained; but, so far as concerns lands vested in the Crown, the requirements of s. 189 are interposed. We are informed that the Board of Railway Commissioners has approved the location map of the Nipissing Central Railway, and sanctioned the plan, profile and book of reference of that portion of it which lies between Larder Lake, in the province of Ontario, and Osisko Lake, in the province of Quebec, a distance of about thirty-seven miles; but, as the railway so located necessarily traverses Crown Lands of Quebec, the work is stayed in the absence of the Governor General\u2019s consent to the taking of the lands required.\nThe course of the legislation is important, because, as I shall show, the section now in question was, in an earlier form, both as to its interpretation and enacting authority, the subject of conclusive determination by decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which is directly binding upon this court.\nAnd, first, it is pertinent to observe that the Railway Act of 1919 is a consolidation, with some amendments, of preceding legislation; s. 189 finds its prototype in the pre-union consolidation of the statutes of the province of Canada in 1859, c. 66, s. 133, an Act which apparently has not been expressly repealed, either by the Parliament of Canada or by the legislature of Quebec, and which survived the union of the province, subject to the provisions of s. 129 of the British North America Act, 1867. A corresponding provision was enacted at the first session of Parliament after the Union by s. 7, ss. 3, of c. 68 of the Railway Act, 1868; it reads as follows:\n3. No railway company shall take possession of, use or occupy any lands vested in Her Majesty, without the consent of the Governor in Council; but with such consent any such company may take and appropriate for the use of their railway and works, but not alienate, so much of the wild lands of the Crown lying on the route of the railway, as have not been granted or sold, and as may be necessary for such railway, as also so much of the public beach or of the land covered with the waters of any lake, river, stream or canal, or of their respective beds, as is necessary for making and completing and using their said railway and works, subject, however, to the exceptions contained in the next following subsection.\nThe exceptions are of no present consequence; they make special provision for lands reserved for naval or military purposes. This provision agrees precisely in effect with s. 133 of the Railway Act as found in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 1859, except that the public beach is not mentioned in the Act of 1859, and the exceptions include Indian as well as Military or Naval Reserves.\nEleven years later, Parliament enacted the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, c. 9, and s. 7, ss. 3, of this Act reproduces in place and in terms the provision of 1868 last quoted.\nSince the Act of 1879 there have been no less than five consolidations. When the Act of 1879 was consolidated in the general revision of the Public Statutes of 1886, c. 109, s. 7, ss. 3, was reproduced, without any material change, by paragraph 17 of s. 6; but when that section reappeared in the consolidation of 1888, c. 29, s. 99, some changes and an addition were introduced, making the section read as follows:\u2014\n99. No company shall take possession of, use or occupy any lands vested in Her Majesty, without the consent of the Governor in Council; but with such consent, any such company may, upon such terms as the Governor in Council prescribes, take and appropriate, for the use of its railway and works, but not alienate, so much of the lands of the Crown lying on the route of the railway as have not been granted or sold, and as is necessary for such railway, as also so much of the public beach, or of the land covered with the waters of any lake, river, stream or canal, or of their respective bed\u2019s, as is necessary for making and completing and using its said railway and works; and whenever any such lands are vested in Her Majesty for any special purpose or subject to any trust, the compensation money which the company pays therefor shall be held or Applied by the Governor in Council for the like purpose or trust.\nC. 29 of 1888 stood until the consolidation of 1903, c. 58, wherein it was reproduced as ss. 1 of s. 134, under the heading \u201cTaking or Using Lands but, in the latter section, the words \u201cthe Crown\u201d were substituted for \u201cHer Majesty,\u201d where they occurred in the provision of 1886, and the word \u201ccanal\u201d was omitted in the mention of the lands covered with water, which, by the Act of 1888, the company was empowered to take. In the general consolidation and revision, of 1906, c. 37, the provision respecting the taking possession of, use or occupation of lands vested in the Crown appears as s. 172, and it differs in no respect from ss. 1 of s. 134 of 1903, except that it is divided into four subsections with a view, I suppose, to simplify and improve its structure.\nSection 172 of c. 37 of the Revised Statutes, 1906, is reproduced without material change in s. 189 of the Consolidation of 1919, the enactment which is now submitted for hearing and consideration.\nArgument seems unnecessary to show that s. 189 is intended to apply to Provincial Crown Land\u2019s, or that it is, in relation to those lands, within the enacting authority of Parliament, if the previous corresponding enactments to which I have referred, and from which it is mediately or immediately derived, had that application, and were competently sanctioned. Now s. 189 does not differ, as to its intention and legislative effect, from the original Dominion provision of 1868 in any particular material to the questions submitted. There can be no doubt of course that, in the Consolidated Act of 1859, the parent provision applied to all Crown Lands; the separate rights of the Crown in relation to the Dominion and the provinces had not then been created; neither can there be any doubt that in 1868, when the Parliament of Canada re-enacted the clause of 1859, that re-enactment was expressed in terms which, in one particular at least, did not fail to describe lands belonging to the provinces. It must be remembered that at that time the only provinces comprised in the union were the four original ones, Ontario and Quebec, previously united as the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; and, in these provinces, by s. 109 of the British North America Act, 1867, the public lands, including all which would be understood as comprised in the description \u201cwild lands of the Crown,\u201d were to belong to the several provinces in which they were situated. It was not until 1888, after the North West Territories had been incorporated in the Union, and after the constitution of the province of Manitoba, and after the provinces of British Columbia and Prince Edward Island had joined the Union, that the expression, \u201cwild lands of the Grown,\u201d gave way to the general and more comprehensive description,\u201d lands of the Crown,\u201d as a more apt and enlarged definition of the lands to which the provision was to apply.\nThe legislative authority of Parliament to give effect to s. 189, in its application to Provincial Crown Lands, might, however, present some difficulties were it not already affirmed by ultimate authority; but, in view of the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Vancouver Case, Attorney General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[17], neither the meaning of the section nor the power to enact it is questionable in this court. That case was tried in 1904; the action was by the Attorney General of the province for a declaration that the public had a right of access to the waters of Vancouver harbour through certain streets of the city of Vancouver. The main line of the defendant company\u2019s railway extends from Calendar Station, near lake Nipissing, to Port Moodie, in British Columbia, and the company had constructed, under its statutory powers, a branch or extension of its railway from Port Moodie to Vancouver, the line of which ran along the foreshore on the south side of the harbour, crossing the ends of these streets, where the company had constructed yards and wharves which obstructed them. It was found that these streets were at the time public highways, extending to low water mark, and that the public right of passage over them to the waters of the harbour existed at the date of the admission of British Columbia into the Union. At the trial the action was dismissed; and, upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the province, sitting en banc, the question as to the authority of the company under its statutory powers to take these lands for its railway purposes, seeing that they belonged to the Provincial Crown, was very fully discussed, both at the hearing and in the judgments of the learned judges who gave their reasons for dismissing the appeal. The authority of the company depended upon s. 7, ss. 3, of the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, as modified or affected by the special legislation relating to the company, c. 1 of 1881. By ss. 17 and 18 (a) of the Company\u2019s Act of incorporation, which is embodied in a schedule to the Act last mentioned, it is provided that:\u2014\n17. \u201cThe Consolidated Railway Act, 1879,\u201d in so far as the provisions of the same are applicable to the undertaking authorized by this charter, and in so far as they are not inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions hereof, and save and except as hereinafter provided, is hereby incorporated herewith.\n18. As respects the said railway, the seventh section of \u201cThe Consolidated Railway Act, 1879,\u201d relating to powers, and the eighth section thereof relating to plans and surveys, shall be subject to the following provisions:\u2014\n(a) The company shall have the right to take, use and hold the beach and land below high water mark, in any stream, lake, navigable water, gulf or sea, in so far as the same shall be vested in the Crown and shall not be required by the Crown, to such extent as shall be required by the company for its railway and other works, and as shall be exhibited by a map or plan thereof deposited in the office of the Minister of Railways. But the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any beach or land lying east of Lake Nipissing except with the approval of the Governor in Council.\nThe last four lines should not be overlooked; it is only with the approval of the Governor in Council that the provisions of the subsection apply to any beach or land lying east of Lake Nipissing, territory which could not be reached by the company save in the exercise of its very comprehensive powers to construct branches or extensions of its main line, as expressed in clause 14 of the contract, and in s. 15 of the Act of Incorporation, scheduled to c. 1 of 1881. Ordinarily, therefore, ss. 3 of s. 7 of the Railway Act, 1879, is left to its unqualified operation east of Lake Nipissing; beyond Lake Nipissing it applies subject to the special modification enacted by s. 18 (a), c. 1 of 1881. It must follow that when the Crown is spoken of, both in the main provision of 1879 and in s. 18 (a) of 1881, to which the main provision is made subject, it is the same Crown in both cases that Parliament had in mind; the rule and its exception must operate with relation to a common subject matter; east or west of Lake Nipissing, the Crown Lands which are provided for in subs. 3 of s. 7 of 1879, and in s. 18 (a) of 1881, include Crown Lands of the province.\nIt is noticeable in perusing the judgments of the learned judges of the provincial court upon the appeal that the arguments and the authorities which had been submitted to them, and to which they gave careful consideration, embrace all those, except the cases subsequently decided, which were so forcibly presented at the hearing of this reference in opposition to an affirmative answer to the first question submitted. From the judgment of the provincial court, sitting en banc, there was an appeal direct to His Majesty in Council, which was heard by Lord Macnaghten, Lord Davey, Sir Ford North and Sir Arthur Wilson, the latter pronouncing the judgment on 27th February, 1906. Their Lordships observe that the learned trial judge had found that the rights of way contended for existed when British Columbia entered the Union, and when the railway company, by the construction of its works, interrupted the free access to the sea, and that the learned judges of the full court did not dissent from this finding, \u201crightly addressing their minds to the more important general questions arising in the case\u201d. Their Lordships state that they propose to follow a similar course, and they proceed to consider the two distinct grounds upon which it was urged at the argument that the Dominion Parliament had the right to legislate; and, first, it was held that under s. 108 and the third schedule of the British North America Act, 1867, the harbour of Vancouver was a public harbour at the time of the Union, and therefore became the property of Canada. Then they consider the second ground which is thus described in the judgment:\nThe second contention in support of the right of the Dominion Parliament to legislate for the foreshore in question is rested upon s. 91, read with s. 92 of the British North America Act, which secured to the Dominion Parliament exclusive legislative authority in respect of lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works, and undertakings connecting any province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province, a description which clearly applies to the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nUpon this question they conclude that:\nTo construe the sections now in such a manner as to exclude the power of Parliament over provincial Crown lands would, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, be inconsistent with the terms of the sections which they have to construe, with the whole scope and purpose of the legislation, and with the principle acted upon in the previous decisions of this board. Their Lordships think, therefore, that the Dominion Parliament had full power, if it thought fit, to authorize the use of provincial Crown lands by the company for the purposes of this railway.\nWith regard to the suggestion that s. 18 (a) of the Canadian Pacific Railway\u2019s Act of incorporation did not authorize the closing of public highways, their Lordships observe that the latter Act incorporated the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, in so far as its provisions were not inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of the Incorporating Act; that there was a variety of inconsistent provisions in the general Act, but that it was unnecessary to enquire whether these would or would not apply to the rights of way in question, and they concluded that:\nIt is enough to say that the language of the Canadian Pacific Railway Act must prevail over that of the Consolidated Railway Act which applies only so far as it is not inconsistent with the special Act. And it is clear, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, that the power given to the company to appropriate the foreshore for the purposes of their railway of necessity includes the right to obstruct any rights of passage previously existing across that foreshore.\nIt follows, I think, from the judgment of their Lordships that, in relation to railways, the authority given to Parliament by s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, necessarily involves the power to take provincial lands for railway purposes. That, I think, is the effect of the Vancouver decision. Their Lordships had before them the judgment of the provincial court in which the whole question of legislative power was elaborately considered; and, although the decision of either of the two more important general\u2019 points before them might have been sufficient for the disposition of the case, these two questions were treated as of co-ordinate importance, and their Lordships emphasized the propriety of addressing their minds to the question of the legislative power, which they affirmed. It is impossible therefore to deny that the observations upon this branch of the case were strictly intended to form part of their judgment; New South Wales Taxation Commissioners v. Palmer[18]; Membery v. Great Western Railway Coy.[19]. I think that this court ought to follow the decision of their Lordships. It was given nearly twenty years ago, and it has ever since been acted upon in practice. The provision which it upholds has, in the interval, been enacted and re-enacted by Parliament without any material change affecting the questions with which we are now concerned, and has thus become as firmly established in the legislation of the country as any statutory enactment, emanating from a legislature of limited powers, can possibly be.\nIt was said that s. 189 does not provide for adequate compensation, and is therefore ultra vires under the authority of the very recent decision of the Judicial Committee in the Montreal Harbour Commissioners Case[20]. There are several answers. In the first place, it may be said that s. 189, at least, does not fail in the provision for indemnity more than did the legislation which was under review in the Vancouver Case[21]; and, to the extent to which ss. 4 is intended to provide for compensation, that provision is additional to anything contained in the statutes which were considered in the latter case. We are not asked expressly to determine the effect of this subsection; but, whatever its interpretation may be, it must certainly be upheld along with the preceding subsections which accompany it. Then, if, as is suggested, the section do not provide for indemnity to the provinces for their Crown lands, the use of which may be taken under its provisions, it could therefore be considered ultra vires only if the powers conferred upon Parliament by ss. 91 and 92 (10) of the British North America Act with relation to railways are to be interpreted as subject to an implied condition or proviso to the effect that such lands are not to be taken or used thereunder without compensation; but there is not a word in the decision in the Harbour Commissioners Case to suggest that their Lordships were disposed to interpret the Dominion railway powers, which are expressed in the most general terms, as subject to any implied restriction, and such an implication would be inconsistent with the conclusion in the Vancouver Case21, of which their Lordships have not intimated any disapproval. It is true that in considering the general power conferred by s. 91 (10), as to navigation and shipping, in regard to legislation which, in the execution of that power, authorized the construction of an embankment and railway on the bank of the river, quays, a dry-dock and ship repairing plant, works the construction and use of which, could not, as their Lordships observe, be effected without an exclusive occupation of the soil equivalent to possession, it did not appear to their Lordships\nthat the right of the Dominion extends so as to authorize them to vest in a body like the Commissioners an exclusive right to occupy property of the province without compensation, and to erect upon it permanent works, such as quays, docks and railways.\nOne must take it from this decision that, in the execution of the ancillary or incidental powers which are attendant upon the power of navigation and shipping, the Dominion may not authorize the taking of provincial property for the construction of railways without compensation; but different considerations arise when one is concerned with the powers derived from ss. 91 (29) and 92 (10). Their Lordships particularly point out that the railway in question, which was a mere harbour adjunct or facility, was not governed by s. 92 (10), because it had not been declared by the Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. The powers which the Dominion may exercise with relation to works so declared, or with regard to railways, such as the Nipissing Central Railway, which connect one province with another or extend beyond the limits of a province, are not considered or expounded in the Harbour Commissioners Case. It is, of course, requisite to the effective working of the latter section that the Parliament of Canada, to which the exclusive power is committed in regard to that which is essentially the construction and working of a railway, and nothing else, shall have the power to bring about that construction. It was in that view I apprehend that the Judicial Committee considered in the Vancouver Case[22] that the power would be inadequate and incapable of execution in cases calling for its exercise, if it were held not to embrace authority for the taking of the land required for the use of the railway; and, whatever may be the view upon which their Lordships suggest a power in the Dominion to take lands for purposes incidental to a harbour which cannot be exercised without compensation for the taking, I do not find anything in the decision which conflicts with the judgment in the Vancouver Case[23]. That case I am sure did not excepe consideration, and it is an authority which, I should think, would stand perfectly well along side of what is held in the Harbour Commissioners Case.\nThere remains the third question of the reference with regard to the obligation of the Governor in Council to give his consent. It is too well established to require argument or the citation of authority that there is nothing obligatory upon the Governor General in Council, giving rise co-relatively to a right on the part of the railway to require his consent upon any application which may be submitted It was contended for the Nipissing Central Railway Company that it was nevertheless the duty of the Governor in Council to give his consent in what, for lack of more exact definition, was described as a proper case; but I think it became apparent in the course of the discussion that the question submitted was strictly a question of law, as distinguished from any question which sought to ascertain the limits within which, as a matter of just or fair and reasonable decision, the Governor in Council might be justified to withhold his consent, and that he had a discretion to refuse. The company is constituted and its powers are conferred by Parliament which, as a condition to the taking of Crown Lands, has required the consent of the Governor in Council, who thus, as the donee of Parliament, is entrusted with the power of consent, to be exercised as an incident of the good government of the country; there is a duty to consider and to exercise sound discretion, but it is a duty involving political rather than legal responsibility, and in respect to the execution of which the Governor in Council is not answerable to the judicial tribunals. It was said that the construction of the railway upon the statutory route makes necessary the occupation of provincial Crown Lands, and that therefore refusal of consent to the taking of any such lands would in effect defeat the intention of Parliament in authorizing the construction of the railway. No statement of the facts in this particular is submitted with the case; but the condition which requires consent imports no more than an incidental power of regulation, and it cannot be assumed that the Government would exercise this power in a manner to frustrate the execution of the statutory project. The question appears to be governed in this court by the case of Lake Champlain and St. Lawrence Ship and Canal Co. v. The King (1).\nFor these reasons I would answer the first and second questions in the affirmative, and to the third question, subject to what I have said, I would answer that it is not obligatory upon the Governor in Council to give his consent, and that he has, in point of law, discretion to grant or refuse such consent, as he may see fit.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: W.

VII, c. 58). The plaintiff in returning home from his labours followed a short cut across the defendant\u2019s railway tracks, which the employees were accustomed to take to save time. In so doing, he attempted to climb and pass between two adjoining cars of a train and was injured. Under the English authorities, the plaintiff could not recover, as although the accident arose \u201cin the course of his employment\u201d it did not arise \u201cout of the employment.\u201d The Saskatchewan Act, however., by s. 6 ss. (c) provides that the employer shall be liable to pay compensation whether or not \u201cthe workman contributed to or was the sole cause of the injury or death by reason of his own negligence or misconduct.\u201d\nHeld, that s. 6 did not enlarge the right given the plaintiff by section 4. as s. 6 deals solely with the exclusion, in cases within the statute, of what would be matters of defence to a claim for damages in an action at common law.

He states the facts and quotes the governing statutory provisions. If I add a few words to what he has written, it is merely in an effort to bring more into relief, if possible, what I consider to be the precise grounds of our decision.\nSection 4 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Saskatchewan, first enacted by c. 9 of the statutes of 1910-11, confers the right to compensation and defines the case in which it arises as that of\npersonal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment caused to a workman.\nThe first paragraph of this section is a substantial reproduction of the first paragraph of the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1906 (6 Edw. VII, c. 58). The words quoted are taken verbatim from it.\nApart from a question presently to be considered, no reason has been advanced why these words should not here be given the construction put upon them in the English courts. So construed, while the injury by accident caused to the plaintiff arose \u201cin the course of his employment,\u201d it did not arise \u201cout of the employment.\u201d What he was doing when it occurred was not reasonably incidental to his employment; in doing it he was not acting in the sphere of that employment. He was unnecessarily and unreasonably and without lawful excuse adding to it a peril which it did not normally entail. Lancashire and Yorkshire Ry. Co. Co. v. Highley[1]; St. Helens Colliery Co. v. Hewitson[2]. We are, I think, bound by these and other decisions of the highest courts in England (See Willis\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation, 22nd ed., p. 42), as to the scope and effect of the words \u201carisinig out of the employment.\u201d Catterall v. Sweetman[3]; Trimble v. Hill[4]; City Bank v. Barrow[5]; Lovell & Christmas Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxes[6]; Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps[7]. Highley\u2019s Case1 is really indistinguishable. On this aspect of the case I cannot usefully add to the judgments in the Court of Appeal.\nBut the crucial question on the present appeal is whether the construction placed by the English courts on the words quoted from s. 1 of the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is rendered inapplicable to the same words in s. 4 of the Saskatchewan statute by the presence in the latter of clause (c) of s. 6, which has not a counterpart in the English Act. I am, with great respect, unable to appreciate the ground on which the appellant urges an affirmative answer.\nI fully agree that the whole statute must be read together \u2014s. 4 in the light of s. 6. But that does not imply that the application of the former section, which confers the right of claim and defines its basis, is to be enlarged by the latter, which deals solely with the exclusion, in cases within the statute, of what would be matters of defence to a claim for damages in an action at common law. That such is the nature and scope of s. 6 is manifest ex facie. Its introductory words are \u201csuch employer shall be liable to pay such compensation whether or not\u201d i.e. notwithstanding that. \u201cSuch employer\u201d and \u201csuch compensation\u201d make it obvious that s. 6 is dealing with a liability imposed and a right conferred by an earlier provision of the statute. The only such provision is s. 4. Therefore s. 6 postulates a right of claim conferred by s. 4. Its purpose is to ensure, possibly ex majore cautela, that certain matters which would have afforded the employer a defence had he been sued in tort at common law shall not avail against a claim for compensation within s. 4. In a case where the workman\u2019s negligence is the cause, sole or contributory, of the accident, if he fails to recover it will not be because of fault on his part \u2014clause (c) of s. 6 provides against that\u2014but because what he was doing, irrespective of any such fault, was a thing outside the scope of his employment,\u2014something not necessarily incidental thereto. Plumb v. Cobden Flour Mills Co.,[8]. Adapting Lord Atkinson\u2019s language in Bourton v. Beauchamp[9], negligence\ndoes not bring within the sphere of a workman\u2019s employment a work or an act which, apart from that (negligence) would have been outside it. The provision with regard to (negligence) has really no application until you first get the act, in the doing of which (negligence) has been committed, inside the scope of his employment.\nThat the office of clause (c) of s.6 is not further to define the right conferred by s. 4, but to preclude a defence based on default of the plaintiff is, if possible, made still more clear from its collocation. Thus by clause (a) the defence of common employment is excluded; by clause (b) the possible coexistence of another statutory right under employers\u2019 liability legislation is rendered immaterial; by clause (d) the defence volenti non fit injuria is taken away. I cannot understand how a section whose obvious office is, unnecessarily it may be, to preclude certain matters being set up by way of defence can be used to modify, either by enlargement or restriction, the right, conferred by an antecedant section, which it postulates\u2014how a claim not otherwise within the right-conferring section can be brought within it by a provision which assumes its existence and merely enacts that it shall not be defeated by certain matters ordinarily available as defences in actions of tort. Section 6 (c) does not confer on the workman a right to compensation where what he is doing when injured is not within s. 4, merely because the doing of it involved negligence.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur with Newcombe J.\nMignault J.\u2014The question on this appeal is whether the appellant is entitled to recover compensation from the respondent under the Saskatchewan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (R.S.S., 1920, c. 210) for injuries suffered by him in March, 1923. The action, as brought, was an ordinary action based on negligence, but at the trial the appellant withdrew his demand under the common law, and asked the court to assess compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as permitted by section 8 of the Act. The question we have to decide is whether he has made out a case for relief under the statute.\nThe facts found by the learned trial judge can be stated in his own words:\u2014\nThe plaintiff was employed as a mechanic at the roundhouse of the defendant at Melville for some months prior to March 22, 1923. At midnight on March 22 he finished his shift and [proceeded to his home by the road which he and his fellow workers had followed during the whole time of his engagement and which had been followed !by the workmen for years; that is to say, he proceeded from the shop where he was employed to the office where he \u201cclocked out\u201d and thence across the defendant\u2019s railway tracks of which there were several, toward his home northwest of of the tracks. There was another way by which he could have gone home which was much longer and which went around one end of the defendant\u2019s yard, emerging into a Government road allowance and which necessitated the crossing of only the company\u2019s main or lead track. But the evidence is that no workmen went that way and none of the witnesses called on either side could recall of ever having seen a workman go in that direction. On one of the tracks in the yard, which had to be crossed if this path were followed, the plaintiff and another workman found a freight train standing. The plaintiff endeavoured to climb and pass through between two adjoining cars. As he was about to do so the train moved, presumably without any signal, and the plaintiff was permanently injured in one of his feet.\nThe learned trial judge refused compensation on the ground that, assuming that the appellant, with the implied consent of the respondent, had the privilege of going home after his work by the path he followed on the night of the accident, he was nevertheless limited to a reasonable user of that way, and his attempt to climb and pass between two cars in a train which he knew was liable to move, and would undoubtedly move in a very few minutes, was not a reasonable user by him of the privilege permitted by the respondent.\nThe appellant having appealed to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, that court allowed him to adduce additional evidence to show, if such were the fact, that the workmen were in the habit, with the acquiescence of their employers, of crossing the respondent\u2019s railway in the way he did, by passing between the cars if the line was blocked by a standing train. Evidence was led by both parties on this issue, and, by the final judgment on the appeal, this evidence was considered inconclusive, and it was held that the appellant was not entitled to compensation, Mr. Justice Lamont dissenting. The appeal is from that judgment.\nThe learned judges of the court below have exhaustively discussed the questions raised by this appeal and have reviewed all the English cases bearing upon the right to compensation in circumstances similar to those found by the learned trial judge. It is obvious, however, that decisions where there is a mere similarity of circumstances are an insecure guide, and moreover the provisions of the Saskatchewan statute must be carefully considered, for if they differ from those of the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, decisions under the latter Act, even if the facts are identical, and they rarely are, cannot assist us in determining whether this appellant is entitled to compensation.\nThe two sections of the Saskatchewan statute which must be examined are sections 4 and 6. The first deals with the right to compensation; the second excludes certain defences which at common law would be available to the employer in an action based on negligence. I will give these two sections in full.\n4. (1) If in any employment to which this Act applies personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman, his employer shall be liable to compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act; Provided that the employer shall not be liable under this Act in respect of any injury which does not disable the workman for a period of at least one week from earning wages at the work at which he was employed.\n(2) Any contract whereby a workman relinquishes any right to compensation from the employer for personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be void and of no effect.\n6. Such employer shall be liable to pay such compensation whether or not:\n(a) the injury or death resulted from the negligence of any person engaged in a common employment with the injured employee; or\n(b) the injury or death was caused by the negligence of the employer or of any person in his service, or by reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, building or premises connected with, intended for or used in the business of the employer; or\n(c) the workman contributed to or was the sole cause of the injury or death by reason of his own negligence or misconduct; or\n(d) the injury or death resulted from a risk arising out of or incidental to the nature of the employment and which the workman expressly or impliedly assumed.\nWe are here concerned with paragraph 1 of section 4 and paragraph (c) of section 6. Reading them together, as they should be read, the Saskatchewan statute provides for compensation to workmen for personal injury by \u201caccident arising out of and in the course of the employment,\u201d and the employer is liable to pay \u201csuch compensation\u201d whether or not the workman contributed to or was the sole cause of the injury or death by reason of his own negligence or misconduct.\nParagraph 1 of section 4 is taken almost verbatim from section 1 of the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1906, and the words \u201caccident arising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d are textually those of the English statute. Paragraph (c) of section 6 is not in the English Act, nor in any other Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act that I have been able to discover, and counsel for the appellant informed us that this paragraph was drafted by the Attorney General of the province and not taken from any other statute. The English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as amended in 1923, has a section (section 7) providing that an accident resulting in the death or serious and permanent disablement of a workman shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of his employment, notwithstanding that the workman was at the time when the accident happened acting in contravention of any statutory or other regulation applicable to his employment, or of any orders given by or on behalf of his employer, or that he was acting without instructions from his employer, if such act was done by the workman for the purposes of and in connection with his employer\u2019s trade or business. Paragraph (c) of section 6 of the Saskatchewan statute was of course enacted before the English amendment of 1923, and no useful purpose would be served by comparing the two provisions, both intended further to protect the workman. It may be added that the Saskatchewan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act has not reproduced the enactment of the English Act concerning the \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d of the workman (section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (c), which, in England, and in several of the Canadian provinces, is a limitation upon the employer\u2019s liability.\nTo determine what is the right of action which the statute confers on the injured workman, it is clear that we must look at paragraph 1 of section 4 of the Saskatchewan statute. It is \u201csuch compensation,\u201d that is to say the compensation granted by that paragraph, that the employer, under section 6, paragraph (c), is liable to pay whether or not the workman contributed to or was the sole cause of the injury or death by reason of his own negligence or misconduct. On the one hand therefore, the accident must arise out of and in the course of the employment, and on the other the employer is liable to pay the compensation although the workman contributed to or even was the sole cause of the injury or death by reason of his own negligence or misconduct.\nIt was stated by Lord Finlay, L.C., in Davidson v. M\u2019Robb[10], that \u201carising out of the employment\u201d signifies arising out of the work which the man was employed to do and what is incident to it\u2014in other words, out of his service, and that \u201carising in the course of the employment\u201d must mean in the course of the work which the man is employed to do and what is incident to it\u2014in other words, in the course of his service. It does not mean during the currency of the time of engagement.\nIn a later case, St. Helens Colliery Co. v. Hewitson[11], Lord Atkinson, at pp. 75-76 said that the words \u201carising out of\u201d suggest the idea of cause and effect, the injury by accident being the effect and the employment, i.e., the discharge of the duties of the workman\u2019s service, the cause of that effect.\nAt first reading of paragraph 1 of section 4 and paragraph (c) of section 6, it may seem difficult to appreciate how an injury or death by accident, of which the workman was the sole cause by reason of his negligence or misconduct, can be said to be the effect of another cause, the employment, so as to arise out of the employment. But without entering into any metaphysical discussion of cause (remote, proximate or determining) and effect, and giving to the language of the statute the meaning which no doubt the legislature of Saskatchewan placed on it, there is no necessary inconsistency between an injury by accident arising out of the employment, as explained or defined by Lords Finlay and Atkinson, and an injury by accident of which the workman was the sole cause by reason of his own negligence or misconduct. Excluding a deliberate in- jury inflicted by the workman on himself, which could not be described as an accident, a workman may by his negligence or misconduct be the sole cause of his injury by accident, for instance by negligently placing his hand in contact with rapidly moving machinery, or by using his hands when a regulation directed the use of another instrument, and yet the accident may, none the less, arise out of the employment, that is to say out of the work which the man was employed to do. In that way, it may be said, perhaps rather loosely, that the employment or the work the man was employed to do, for instance the man\u2019s proximity to the machinery, was the cause of the injury inflicted, although without the man\u2019s negligence or misconduct there would have been no injury. It is not a question here of discussing the strict accuracy of the language of the statute when it speaks of the workman being the sole cause of an injury which, to give right to compensation, must arise out of the employment. It is our duty to place on this language a reasonable construction as applied to the every day conditions of the industrial world. This being understood, for the legislature certainly contemplated here an accident arising out of the employment and not foreign thereto, there is no real inconsistency or contradiction between the two enactments. Negligence or misconduct of the workman, which, within the meaning of paragraph (c), is the sole cause of the injury, is excluded as a defence for the employer only when the latter is liable for the injury under section 4 as arising out of and in the course of the employment. So the statute necessarily supposes that liability exists under section 4, when it states that the employer shall be liable to pay the compensation granted by that section whether or not the workman contributed to or was the sole cause of the injury by reason of his own negligence or misconduct.\nApplying now the statute as construed to the circumstances of this case, we have to consider the finding of the learned trial judge that the appellant, having finished his shift and \u201cclocked out\u201d at the office, proceeded across the track by the usual road followed by the workmen to go to his home northwest of the tracks. He found the lead track occupied by a standing freight train which had been there some time, and instead of waiting for the train to move, or going round it, and not being able to see whether there was or was not an engine on the train, he endeavoured to climb between two adjoining cars. At that moment the train started to move and the appellant\u2019s foot was crushed in the couplings.\nI am inclined to think that when he crossed the tracks in the usual way to go to his home after finishing his work, the appellant was acting in the course of his employment, that is to say in the course of the work which he was employed to do and what was incident to it. It was his duty when his work was done not to loiter on the premises but to leave them without delay, and he was entitled to go by the accustomed road. Had he taken the other and longer road mentioned by the learned trial judge, and which nobody followed, he would still have had to cross the main tracks of the respondent, for his home was on the other side of the railway. He could not leave his work without passing over some tracks.\nThe crucial question however is whether the injury sustained by the appellant, when he endeavoured to pass between the two cars, arose \u201cout of his employment,\u201d and here we must not lose sight of paragraph (c) of section 6. But, as I have said, to establish liability against the employer, the accident must have arisen out of the employment, and then the negligence or misconduct of the workman is immaterial. That there was negligence or misconduct of this appellant is obvious. This, however, would not disentitle him to recover compensation if he could show that the accident arose out of the employment.\nIn my opinion this accident did not arise out of the employment of the appellant. It certainly did not arise out of the work which he was employed to do, or anything incidental thereto. Granting that the appellant could return to his home by crossing the railway where he did, nothing in any way connected with his work required or allowed him to climb between two cars to get to the other side of the railway track, when he could have gone around the train, or have waited until it moved away. He assumed a risk which did not arise out of and was not incidental to the nature of his employment and which is not within the contemplation of paragraph (c) of section 6, or paragraph (d) of the same section. The learned trial judge thought that the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Gane v. Norton Hill Colliery Co.[12], had been overruled by the House of Lords, otherwise he would have accepted it as entitling the plaintiff to succeed.\nIn that case, the workman had completed his work and was injured while crawling under the buffers of a train which blocked the road that the workmen always followed to leave their place of work, and the finding of fact was that this was the usual way and manner the workmen left the works to the knowledge of the company. The Court of Appeal granted compensation.\nThe Gane Case12 was not overruled by the House of Lords, but on the contrary the decision was approved as applicable to the facts found by the trial judge. In Lancashire and Yorkshire Ry. Co. v. Highley[13], Lord Findlay, L.C., said that it proceeded entirely upon the finding that passage across a line of railway by going under the trucks which were upon it was recognized and authorized by the company. And, in the same case, Lord Atkinson (at pp. 336369) discusses the Gane Case12 at length and approves of the decision of the Court of Appeal on the finding that the workmen were authorized by their employers not only to cross the rails at the particular point, but that when they should find their progress obstructed by trucks standing upon the rails they were also authorized to get through the line of tracks by passing under the buffers. He added (pp. 368-369) that if the Court of Appeal\nmeant to decide that, wherever permission or authority is given by an employer to his workman merely to cross a line of railway, that necessarily impliedly authorizes them to pass under or over any trucks they may, when crossing, find in front of them, even when they can readily deviate and walk round those trucks, then in my view the decision was erroneous, and I refuse to follow it.\nIt was to give the appellant the opportunity to establish, if he could, a state of facts similar to those found in the Gane Case12 that the Court of Appeal in this case allowed him to adduce additional evidence. I agree with the majority of that court that he has failed to show that the railway employees were authorized by their employers to pass between cars liable to move which blocked their egress. Unless facts sufficiently establishing such an authorization are proved, the appellant cannot rely on the Gane Case (1) as explained by the House of Lords.\nThe argument which the appellant bases on the Gane Case (1) and like cases shows the danger of relying on decisions merely because of an assumed similarity in the facts. To use the language of Lord Haldane, Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co. (2), there are few more fertile sources of fallacy.\nAnd the argument founded on subsection (c) of section 6 of the Saskatchewan Act really seeks to find a cause of action in a provision the object of which is merely to exclude certain defences to an action based on section 4. If the appellant cannot bring his case within the latter section, my opinion is that he has no right of action.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nNewcombe J. (dissenting).\u2014If the plaintiff, when proceeding to his home on the night of his injury, had found the railway tracks unencumbered by cars, but nevertheless, using due care in the crossing, had met with an accident, causing him personal injury, I apprehend that it could not reasonably be said, consistently with the true interpretation of the statute or the decisions, that the accident did not arise out of and in the course of his employment; and the statutory consequence would have been that his employer would have been liable to pay him the compensation for which the Act provides.\nTo say that it was an extremely hazardous and uncontemplated proceeding on the plaintiff\u2019s part to attempt to pass between the cars of the train, which occupied the crossing, when he knew that the train was about to start, or when he did not know whether it would move or not while he was between the cars, is merely to express in other words a cause of liability which is directly within the statutory condition enacted by s. 6 (c) which declares that the employer shall be liable whether or not \u201cthe workman contributed to or was the sole cause of the injury * * * by reason of his own negligence or misconduct\u201d. The real defence which the railway company urges is the workman\u2019s negligence, and, upon my reading of the Act, that is to be excluded as a consideration affecting the question whether\n(1) 78 L.J.K.B. 921.\n(2) [1914] A.C. 25, at p. 40. the accident arose out of and in the course of the workman\u2019s employment.\nIf it be said that when the workman attempted to pass between the cars he added a peril or risk of accident to which, in the language of the English Decisions, his employer had given no sanction, or to which the workman was not required or authorized to expose himself by reason of anything connected with his employment, or which was foreign to the ordinary perils of his employment, the answer is that the peril or risk arose by reason of his own negligence or misconduct, a cause notwithstanding which the statute provides that the employer shall be liable.\nI have no doubt that it was contemplated and known by the railway authorities having charge of the service at the station where the injury took place, that the workmen employed at the round house, who lived on the further side of the tracks, would cross and did cross these tracks by the direct route which the plaintiff was endeavouring to pursue when he met with his unfortunate accident, and that this course of going and coming was consequent upon the employment at the round house of workmen who resided on the other side of the railway yard, and therefore incident to or arising out of and in the course of that employment.\nEffect must be given to s. 6 (c), which is one of the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Alberta distinguishing it from that of the United Kingdom, and it serves, I think, in accordance with the obvious legislative intent, to make inapplicable many of the numerous and instructive decisions which have been pronounced in the exposition of the latter Act.\nFor the reason which I have thus briefly stated, I would allow this appeal.\nRinfret J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by my lord the Chief Justice and by Mr. Justice Mignault.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Anderson, Bayne & Bigelow.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

Petrolia. In answer to this a price of $19 per thousand was quoted. This was met by a counter offer of $18. The plaintiff then suggested a price of $18.50. An interview followed as to which the only evidence is that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff says that Mr. Schoen, the defendant\u2019s president, stated that he would need about 1,500,000 of brick for the buildings and the plaintiff then agreed to deliver the bricks at $18. Following this interview and after the delivery had started, a letter was sent by the defendant to the plaintiff to confirm the verbal order given. Enclosed with this letter was an order form in which the goods sold were described as \u201call brick required for the Petrolia Sugar Factory, to be delivered at such time as ordered by us. * * * This is to confirm verbal order given your Mr. Howlett. Price $18 per thousand.\u201d Some half million bricks were delivered and paid for. In October, 1923, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff that it had decided not to use brick for the main building and would not be able to take any more. The plaintiff sued for breach of contract, declaring upon the written order.\nHeld that, although there were several expressions of expectation on the part of the defendant as to the quantity of bricks to be taken, there was no warranty and no fraudulent representations; that the purchase was not of 1,500,000 bricks, but merely of such brick as the defendant should require and order for the building of the factory, and that there had been no breach of the contract.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, reversing the judgment of the trial judge and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\u2014Appeal allowed with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head\u2011note and in the judgment now reported.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the appellant\nG.W.G. Winnett for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The defendant company (appellant) was proposing to construct a sugar factory at Petrolia, to consist of a main building, sugar warehouse, boiler house, lime house and machine shop. The plaintiff (respondent) was a brick and tile manufacturer at the same place. By letter of 29th September, 1922, the defendant asked the plaintiff for a price for 500,000 bricks, f.o.b. cars at Petrolia, to be delivered that fall. On 30th September, the plaintiff wrote in reply, quoting a price of $19 per thousand, f.o.b. defendant\u2019s factory. A short time afterwards Mr. Schoen, the president of the defendant company, went to the plaintiff\u2019s brick yard and had a conversation with the plaintiff, of which the latter gives the following account:\nHe said, \u201cYour price is too high.\u201d And I said, \u201cI do not think so, Mr. Schoen. I have been getting $20; the Canadian Oil Company ordered brick from us and they gave us $20 for them.\u201d He said, \u201cOh well, they never bought only a few. This is practically\u2014we will need a million and a half of brick. Look at the amount off brick we are using.\u201d He talked for a considerable time that way; anyway, before he left I asked him to make me an offer, \u201cif $19 was too much make me an offer for them\u201d; and he said \u201cWell, I will give you $18 and give you the contract for all we need.\u201d \u201cWe will need about a million and a half,\u201d he said, \u201cI have built these factories before and I know just what we will need,\u201d and he said \u201cWe will need that many anyway\u201d; \u201cbut, (he says) you do not need to tell me now, you can sleep over it; let me know in a day or two.\u201d\nOn 28th October, the plaintiff wrote to Mr. Schoen that after considering his offer for $18 he had decided to meet him half way \u201cwhich would be $18.50, f.o.b. sugar plant.\u201d While this letter was in transit Mr. Schoen called the plaintiff on the telephone. The plaintiff testifies to the conversation which then took place:\nHe asked me what I thought about the $18, and I said \u201cWe will split the difference, $18.50\u201d; and he said \u201cNo, we will give you $18 and you can furnish all we need.\u201d He says \u201cWe will need about a million and a half.\u201d He said that quite a few times, so I told him \u201call right, I would accept the order.\u201d\nThe plaintiff says that he commenced to deliver \u201cjust a short time afterwards,\u201d before he received the written order to which I shall now refer. The date of the conversation by telephone, when the price was agreed upon, is not precisely fixed, but it must have been after the plaintiff\u2019s letter of 28th October, and before the letter of 4th November, which was written to the plaintiff by Mr. Schoen in the defendant\u2019s name as follows:\nEnclosed please find purchase order no. 8 covering brick required for the Petrolia sugar factory. This is to confirm verbal order given you by the writer a few weeks ago. As we want to finish the sugar warehouse by Christmas at the latest, you are supposed to deliver at least 300,000 brick at such times that work may not be interrupted.\nThe purchase order enclosed was written on a printed form; I quote the material portion of it:\nNov. 4, 1922.\nTo F. Howlett:\nPlease ship to Peninsular Sugar Company, Petrolia, Ont., f.o.b. site, the following goods:\nAll brick required for the Petrolia Sugar Factory; to be of good quality kiln run brick, well burned and of uniform colour. Brick to be uniform in size and to be delivered at such time as ordered by us, so that our work may not be interrupted.\nThis is to confirm verbal order given your Mr. Howlett.\nPrice $18 f.o.b. site.\nPeninsular Sugar Co., Limited,\nPer A. Shoen. The letter of 4th November, with the confirming written order, was received by the plaintiff, presumably in due course. There is no evidence of any answer to this letter, but the plaintiff says that\neverything went along first class, there was no hitch came.\nHe delivered 504,000 bricks, for which he was paid, and I infer that these satisfied all the orders for delivery which he received. On 21st June, 1923, Mr. Schoen, in the name of the defendant company, wrote to the plaintiff:\nAs the board of directors of the Peninsular Sugar Company has decided not to start delivering brick again, until the arrangements for financing the company, which are at present pending are concluded, we hope that we will get to work again within two or three weeks.\nYou do not need to be alarmed about the amount of brick furnished us by J.J. Kerr & Co. as the amount is comparatively small.\nThere is no desire on our part to curtail your order, but as we could save a little money we purchased this brick. The amount still to be furnished by you is very considerable and am quite sure will keep you busy for quite a while.\nAnd on 12th October, 1923, Mr. Schoen, in the defendant\u2019s name, wrote again to the plaintiff:\nKindly refer to our purchase order no. 8, dated November 4, 1922, covering our requirements in the brick for this plant.\nPleased be advised that we have now all the brick on hand that we need for the sugar\u2011warehouse, boiler house, lime house and machine shop. It is not our intention to use brick on the main building, but in all probability will resort to reinforced concrete construction.\nWe therefore will not be able to take any more brick from your yards.\nThe action was commenced on 3rd November, 1923. The plaintiff, by his statement of claim, alleges that:\n2. On or about the month of October, 1922, the defendant called for tenders for all brick needed for the erection of a factory in the town of Petrolia, estimated at one and a half million brick, f.o.b. their factory.\n3. The plaintiff tendered to supply said brick at $19 per thousand.\n4. Shortly after the plaintiff\u2019s tender was put in, the defendant company, through their president, offered to buy from the plaintiff their total requirements, estimated at one and half million brick, at $18 per thousand, which offer was accepted by the plaintiff, and on the fourth day of November, 1922, the defendant confirmed the said arrangement by giving the plaintiff purchase order no. 8, in the words and figures follows:\nThe purchase order, of which the material portion has already been quoted, is then set out in full, and, by the next following paragraph, it is alleged that:\n5. In pursuance of the said order the plaintiff proceeded to manufacture and did manufacture, 850,000 bricks, of which 550,000 have been delivered to the defendant.\nThe defendant\u2019s letter of 12th October, 1923, is alleged as a breach of the contract, and the plaintiff claims damages for the breach. The defence is that the defendant engaged to purchase from the plaintiff only such number of bricks, of the description specified, as it might require for its Petrolia sugar factory, to be delivered as ordered, and to be paid for at the rate of $18 per thousand.\nThere is no dispute about the facts. I have stated in substance all the material evidence for the plaintiff. None was introduced on behalf of the defence.\nThe action was tried before Riddell J. of the Supreme Court of Ontario who, after consideration, found that:\nThe defendants agreed to purchase from the plaintiff the quantity of bricks they should require for their factory\u2014there were several expressions of expectation but nothing binding the defendants to take more than they should require. No fraud is charged, and I remain of the opinion, expressed at the trial, that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim for more bricks than the defendants required, i.e., in good faith determined that they should use. On the main ground therefore the plaintiff fails.\nIt developed at the trial that the defendant, after the making of its contract with the plaintiff, had purchased for its factory 100,000 second-hand bricks from J.J. Kerr & Co., Ltd., which, if bought from the plaintiff, would have yielded him a profit of $400, and for that amount the defendant was held bound, but as to that part of the claim there is no question upon this appeal. These are the bricks, purchased from J.J. Kerr & Co., referred to in the defendant\u2019s letter of 21st June, 1923, above quoted.\nThe plaintiff appealed from the judgment of Riddell J.; his appeal was heard by the second Divisional Court, and Middleton J.A., pronounced the judgment, reversing the judgment of the learned trial judge. The learned justice of appeal was of the opinion that the contract between the parties was an oral contract for 1,500,000 bricks; that although when the written order went forward the expression used was \u201call brick required,\u201d yet, in view of the fact that to complete the building as contemplated 1,500,000 bricks were necessary and would be required according to the plans,\nthe failure of the plaintiff to note and repudiate the change in the expression used is not sufficient to defeat the action. \u201cAll brick required\u201d is ambiguous and may as readily mean, as the plaintiff contends, all brick required to complete factory building as per plans and specifications, as all brick which the defendant may choose to use after making changes in their plans and substituting concrete for brick, as contended by the defendants and interpreted by the trial judge.\nThe appeal was therefore allowed, and the damages were assessed at $4,000, for which amount the court directed judgment to be entered.\nI am disposed, notwithstanding the judgment of the Court of Appeal, for which I entertain very great respect, to accept the findings of the trial judge.\nIf by the passage which I have quoted from the judgment on appeal it be intended to suggest that the expression \u201call brick required\u201d was used anywhere in the correspondence or negotiations between the parties with express reference to plans and specifications of the buildings which the defendant proposed to erect, with the intention thereby of affording a means to ascertain a number of bricks which were to be the subject of the order, I must observe that there is no such evidence in the case; neither is there any proof upon which it can reasonably be found that the defendant intended by any stipulation with the plaintiff to restrict or qualify its freedom of design and choice of materials for the construction of its buildings. It would seem improbable that, as a business transaction, the defendant company would make arrangements for the supply of bricks for its projected factory which, in the event of enlarged requirements of material in the course of the work, would leave these requirements unprovided for, and, in case of a diminution of the building project, would involve the company in liability for loss of profit on the material comprised in the reduction. No plans or specifications were produced, and it is not shewn that the plaintiff ever saw any. There was no warranty or representation as to them. The plaintiff knew that some of the works were in course of construction, and that he had un order for 300,000 or perhaps 500,000 bricks, and an estimate that about 1,500,000 would be required altogether. Was it anything more than, as alleged in the statement of claim, an estimate? It would have been very easy for the parties to stipulate for the sale and purchase of 1,500,000 bricks if they had been so minded. When, on 29th September, the defendant wanted to purchase 500,000 bricks it submitted a definite inquiry for so many; there is no proof of any calculations or evidence that any requirements were definitely ascertained in excess of 500,000. Apparently, in 1922, the company had in contemplation to use bricks for the structure of the main building, and it was for this reason that Mr. Schoen said that they would need about a million and a half, and he fortified his statement by saying that he had built these factories before and knew just what they would need; it may be that the project of supplying the bricks for the main building influenced the defendant\u2019s consideration of the price; but there was no fraud, and therefore no representation the breach of which gave the plaintiff a right to damages. It is unlikely that the defendant would warrant the number of bricks to be used in the main building, which, consistently with the proof, had not even been designed; and, seeing that a warranty would have been given for no other purpose than to define or to ascertain the number of bricks to be purchased, it is remarkable that the parties would resort to this roundabout method when it would have been so easy to specify the number in the memorandum, if the company were willing to commit itself to a stated quantity. There is no warranty in the memorandum; the plaintiff made no objection to it as containing a fair statement of the terms agreed upon; he adopted and declared upon it in terms in his statement of claim. I see no ambiguity in its provisions. It calls for\nall brick required for the Petrolia sugar factory.\nThere can be no requirement without a requiring will or intention, and it is expressly stipulated that the bricks are to be delivered at such time as ordered by the defendant. If one attempts to interpret the word \u201crequired\u201d in an intransitive or passive sense, as the equivalent of \u201cfound requisite\u201d or \u201cnecessary,\u201d immediately the difficulty is encountered that there is no standard set or defined by which a requisite or necessary quantity can be ascertained; neither the design nor the dimensions of the buildings nor the extent of the brick work have been made known, or are capable of definition or ascertainment, except according to the determination of the builder, and there is no proof of this, save the company\u2019s letter of 12th October, 1923, stating that it had then on hand all bricks needed for the structures mentioned, and did not intend to use brick on the main building, a conclusion which I think it was quite competent to the company to reach without incurring any obligation to the plaintiff.\nThere is a judgment of Lord Justice Bowen, Fell v. The Queen[1], where a contract had been made between Her Majesty\u2019s Deputy Commissary\u2011General and one Fell for the supply of mealies for the use of the troops in the Transvaal war. It was stipulated that Fell would provide and deliver for the use of Her Majesty\u2019s forces at Fort Napier, Natal, all such quantities of mealies as might be required for the period of twelve months from 1st April, 1881, and that the Commissary-General, on behalf of Her Majesty, would pay 11s. 9d. per 100 pounds. Fell, by petition of right, complained that the Government had purchased mealies from other sources during the continuance of his contract, but the learned Lord Justice held that it was for him to say as a judge what in his view was the meaning of the contract, and that, in terms, it imposed upon the Crown no obligation to take any mealies at all. The contract, he said, was in two parts, the first binding the contractor to supply all that was required, the other binding the Crown to pay for all mealies supplied. The question was whether the Crown had, by implication, made a contract certainly not made in terms. He pointed out that the contractor must necessarily receive orders for the quantities required, and he held that there was nothing in the contract, express or implied, binding the Government to take from the contractor all the mealies which might be wanted. See also Churchward v. The Queen[2]; The Queen v. Demers[3].\nIt was found at the trial that there were in the negotiations several expressions of expectation, but nothing binding the defendants to take more than they should require. This finding commends itself to my judgment as just and reasonable and it should, I think, be restored. The rule enunciated by Holt C.J., that \u201can affirmation at the time of the sale is a warranty provided it appear on evidence to be so intended\u201d was quoted with approval and followed in the House of Lords in Heilbut, Symons & Co. v. Buckleton[4], and Lord Moulton said at the end of his speech that\nit is of the greatest importance in my opinion that this house should maintain in its full integrity the principle that a person is not liable in damages for an innocent misrepresentation, no matter in what way or in what form the attack is made.\nI would allow the appeal with costs, including the costs of the appeal to the Appellate Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.G.R.

Pacific Coast shipping point. The contract contained four terms and conditions which were given special prominence, viz.,\u2014\u201cDestination\u2014St. John, N.B.; Routing\u2014Delivery routing may be given later; Consigned to\u2014Order of seller; Time of shipment\u2014October.\u201d Other terms of importance were: \u201cBoxing specifications may be changed by buyer, provided such changes are received at this office prior to September 1, 1920.\u201d \u201cSeller shall, where possible, recognize routing named by buyer, but seller has option of selecting the initial line.\u201d \u201cNo unimportant variation in the performance of this contract shall constitute basis for a claim.\u201d \u201cBrokers or salesmen not authorized to sign this contract nor change terms or wording without written authorization by the seller.\u201d The sale was arranged through a representative of Sainsbury Bros., who advertised themselves to be the \u201cdirect representatives in Canada\u201d of the appellant with its knowledge and acquiescence. Boxing specifications were given by the respondents to the agent and the same were acted upon by the appellant, and later routing instructions were given in writing to the agent and provided that the car should be routed C.N.R. from Chicago to destination. The car was, in fact, routed C.P.R., and upon its arrival in Saint John the respondents refused to accept the goods, holding that the failure to comply with their routing instructions was an important variation in the contract entitling them to repudiate. The appellant thereupon brought this action to recover damages for the alleged breach of contract.\nHeld, that the notice to the agent as to the routing of the goods was given in the manner contemplated by the contract.\nHeld also, that the mode of shipment is a material and indeed an essential term of the contract. The consequence is that its non-performance is not \u201can unimportant variation,\u201d which should in the present case be excluded as constituting a \u201cbasis for a claim,\u201d but on the contrary \u201cmay fairly be considered by the other party as a substantial failure to perform the contract at all.\u201d (Wallis v. Pratt [1911] A.C. 394).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, affirming a judgment of the trial judge, Mr. Justice Crockett, and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action. Appeal dismissed with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nWallace K.C. and W. R. Scott for the appellant.\nHarrison K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014By a contract made in writing and dated the 27th day of May, 1920, the respondent (a New Brunswick firm), bought and the appellant (a California company), sold one carload of prunes to be delivered f.o.b. Pacific Coast rail shipping point.\nThe following terms and conditions were set forth on the contract with special prominence:\nDestination: Saint John, N.B.\nRouting: Delivery routing may be given later.\nConsigned to: Order of seller.\nTime of shipment: October.\nThere were further stipulations, amongst others, as follows:\nBoxing specifications may be changed by buyer, provided such changes are received at this office (meaning no doubt the office at San Jos\u00e9, California), prior to September 1, 1920.\nSeller shall, where possible, recognize routing named by buyer, but seller has option of selecting the initial line.\nNo unimportant variation in the performance of this contract shall constitute basis for a claim.\nBrokers or salesmen not authorized to sign this contract nor change terms or wording without written authorization by seller. On October 15, 1920, the appellant shipped from Red Bluff, California, to the respondent at Saint John, N.B., and consigned to the order of the appellant a carload of prunes of the brand and assortment conforming to the specifications provided by the respondent.\nThe carload of prunes was sent from Chicago to Saint John, N.B., over the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway and arrived in Saint John early in December.\nThe price of the prunes, with the freight added, amounted to $8,604.21. A sight draft for that amount, with bill of lading attached, was presented to the respondent, who refused to accept it. They moreover disclaimed any obligation on their part to receive the prunes and to pay for them. Their ground was that, by a notice in writing, they had directed the appellant to route the carload of prunes via Canadian National Railways from Chicago; that the appellant had failed to comply with the terms of this notice, which were in effect part of the contract; that the change in the routing as ordered was an important variation in the contract and that they were thereby relieved from any liability.\nWhether the breach complained of gave rise to a right to reject the prunes and treat the contract as repudiated is therefore the important question to be determined in this case.\nThere is, however, another point raised by the appellant and which must first receive our attention.\nIt is admitted that no notice of delivery routing was given to the appellant direct; but, by letter under date of August 30, 1920, the respondent requested W. S. Clawson & Co., of the city of Saint John, to instruct the appellant to ship the carload of prunes by Canadian National Railway from Chicago to Saint John. The appellant alleges that this was not a delivery routing given in the manner contemplated by the contract.\nAs against this contention, there stands in the appellant\u2019s way the concurrent findings of the two courts of New Brunswick. The trial judge said:\nI have not the slightest doubt of the truth of Mr. Clawson\u2019s evidence and have no hesitation in finding that he negotiated this contract with the defendants as the agent of Sainsbury Bros. Neither have I any doubt that Sainsbury Bros, were the direct representatives in Canada of the plaintiff as they advertised themselves to be, and as the plaintiff by its circular letter of February 15, 1919, addressed to Canadian buyers, informed the trade in Canada they were. I am of opinion that the defendants gave the delivery routing in the manner contemplated and in ample time to entitle them to have the goods shipped as directed by them.\nMr. Justice White, delivering the unanimous judgment of the appeal division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, confirms the holding of the trial judge in these words:\nI have carefully read the evidence in the case and am satisfied that the learned judge could not properly have found the facts otherwise than as he found them.\nOn this matter, therefore, the appellant finds itself in a position of considerable difficulty.\nIt is not disputed that Mr. William S. Clawson was the agent of Sainsbury Bros, at Saint John.\nA member of the firm of Sainsbury Bros., Arthur H. Sainsbury, was asked what was its chief business. He answered:\nIt was the agent for Canada for the California Prune and Apricot Growers, and three or four other California dry fruit concerns.\nHe states there was no agreement in writing, but said:\nWe had a letter that they (the appellant) had issued to the trade in Canada advising that we were the agents for the Canadian territory for the sale of their products.\nThis letter was produced. It is dated at San Jos\u00e9, March 14, 1918, and reads:\nThis will introduce Mr. A. H. Sainsbury, who, with his brother, Mr. G. O. Sainsbury, will be the direct representatives of the California Prune & Apricot Growers Inc., in the Dominion of Canada.\n(Sgd.) CALIFORNIA PRUNE & APRICOT GROWERS, INC.,\nH. G. coykendall,\nGeneral Manager.\nThis was supplemented by a circular letter from the appellant addressed \u201cto Canadian buyers,\u201d on February 15, 1919, which states:\nWe have just completed our arrangements with the firm of Sainsbury Bros, for our exclusive and direct representation throughout entire Canada * * * We feel that the interests of this association and the interests of the wholesale trade of Canada as well will be in the proper hands, as Sainsbury Bros, have been with this association ever since its incorporation and are thoroughly conversant with the prune and apricot business from start to finish. We feel that no one is better qualified to handle a prune and apricot account. * * * * Furthermore, it is only through Sainsbury Bros, that you will be able to purchase our \u201cSunsweet brand\u201d of either prunes or apricots.\nOn their own letterheads, Sainsbury Bros, styled themselves \u201cdirect representatives\u201d of the appellant. These were used regularly in their correspondence with the latter and no exception was taken by them. In 1919, the year before the present contract, the respondent purchased a carload of prunes from the appellant. The bought and sold note then given to the respondent by Mr. Clawson was signed by Sainsbury Bros. Again it described them as the representatives of California Prune and Apricot Growers Inc., and asserted that they sold \u201cfor account of California Prune & Apricot Growers Inc.\u201d This contract was acted upon by the appellant, who then treated Sainsbury Bros, as their agents for purposes of receiving boxing specifications and routing instructions.\nOn such previous occasion, the course of dealing between the parties was exactly the same as that followed in the present case. In fact, it appears to have been the almost invariable practice for the buyer to give routing instructions in the manner which is shown to have been adopted here.\nMoreover, all negotiations regarding the present contract took place between the respondent and Mr, Clawson. The appellant never had any correspondence with the respondent. Any communications on its behalf were given to the respondent by Sainsbury Bros, through Clawson. It was the latter who arranged the sale, took the written contract to the respondent to be signed, and later was requested to find out from the respondent and got from them the specifications as to assortment and boxing and also as to routing.\nThe respondent\u2019s instructions with regard to boxing specifications were given in precisely the same way as their routing instructions; no exception was taken to the method of notifying the sellers and the notice so given as to the former was acted upon.\nUnder all these circumstances, and even although there may be on the part of the traffic or sales managers of the appellant some statements, here and there, tending to the contrary, it is impossible to conclude that the concurrent holdings of the two courts below should be reversed.\nIt must be taken therefore that Sainsbury Bros. were the agents of the appellant and that they had authority to receive on its behalf routing instructions in connection with the contract in question.\nIt follows that the notice in the letter of August 30 from the respondent to Mr. Clawson: bill our car of prunes to Saint John and route it Canadian National Railway from Chicago\namounted to a stipulation which, having been made in ample time, must be read into the contract.\nThere remains the question whether the breach of this stipulation gave rise to a right to reject the goods.\nThe law is now well settled that in mercantile contracts the time and the place of shipment are material or essential parts of the description of the goods sold and full compliance therewith is a condition precedent to the seller\u2019s right to recover.\nIn Bowes v. Shand[1], the contracts were for 8,200 bags of rice to be shipped at Madras during the months of March and April. The bags of rice (outside of 1,080), were put on board vessel, at Madras, in February. The rice was refused because it had not been shipped during March and April. The House of Lords held that the contract had not been complied with.\nNorrington v. Wright[2], is a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States to the same effect. The time of shipment was there declared to be a material element in a contract, which must be strictly complied with and a breach of which justifies repudiation of the goods by the buyer.\nThe same court, in the case of Filley v. Pope[3], held that the place of shipment was also\na statement descriptive of the subject matter or of some material incident.\nin a mercantile contract, and was to be regarded as a condition precedent, upon the non-performance of which the party aggrieved may repudiate the whole contract.\nIn that case, Pope & Bros., of New York, had sold to Mr. Filley, of St. Louis, 500 tons of pig iron to be shipped from Glasgow as soon as possible. The pig iron was shipped from Leith instead of Glasgow, because an earlier vessel could be got from that port. The iron in fact arrived sooner than if it had been shipped at Glasgow. The pig iron was refused on the ground that the seller had not complied with the terms of the contract as to place of shipment. In an action for non-acceptance, and without any evidence of damage being adduced, this sole ground of rejection was held good. It will be well to examine the reasons given in these cases to see how far they can be made to apply to the present one.\nIn Bowes v. Shand[4], Lord Cairns L.C., said (p. 463):\nMy lords, if that is the natural meaning of the words, it does not appear to me to be a question for your Lordships, or for any court, to consider whether that is a contract which bears upon the face of it some reason, some explanation why it was made in that form, and why the stipulation is made that the shipment should be during these particular months. It is a mercantile contract, and merchants are not in the habit . of placing upon their contract stipulations to which they do not attach some value and importance, and that alone might be a sufficient answer.\n* * * * *\nMy Lords, I must submit to your Lordships that if it be admitted, as the Lord Justice is willing to admit, that the literal meaning would imply that the whole quantity must be put on board during a specified time, it is no answer to that literal meaning, it is no observation which can dispose of, or get rid of, or displace, that literal meaning, to say that it puts an additional burden on the seller, without a corresponding benefit to the purchaser; that is a matter of which the seller and the purchaser are the best judges. Nor is it any reason for saying that it would be a means by which purchasers without any real cause would frequently obtain an excuse for rejecting contracts when prices had dropped. The non-fulfilment of any term in any contract is a means by which a purchaser is able to get ride of the contract when prices have dropped; but that is no reason why a term which is found in a contract should not be fulfilled.\nLord Hatherly said (p. 474):\nNow under these circumstances, and with the plain meaning of the contract lying, as it appears to me, on its surface, we are not entitled to speculate on the reasons and motives which have induced those who are engaged in this particular trade, those who have this \u201cusual run,\u201d as the witness describes it, of contracts before them from time to time, and who must have pondered upon the matter, to frame their contracts in the manner which pleases them best.\nLord O\u2019Hagan said (p. 479):\nI do not think that we are at liberty to speculate as to motives, or to consider what comparative benefit might practically have arisen from a shipment in February or a shipment in March.\nLord Gordon said (p. 485):\nNow, the terms which are used in these contracts are naturally the result of the intelligence of the merchants who are engaged in making them, and we may rely upon this, that they have considered well the terms of the contract before they entered into it. What your Lordships are proposing to do is to adhere to the words of the contract. -\nIn Filley v. Pope[5], Mr. Justice Gray said (p. 219):\nThe court has neither the means, nor the right, to determine why the parties in their contract specified \u201cshipment from Glasgow,\u201d instead of using the more general phase \u201cshipment from Scotland,\u201d or merely\u201d shipment,\u201d without naming any place; but is bound to give effect to the terms which the parties have chosen for themselves. The term \u201cshipment from Glasgow\u201d defines an act to be done by the sellers at the outset, and a condition precedent to any liability of the buyer. The sellers do not undertake to obtain shipment, nor does the buyer agree to accept iron shipped, at any other port. The buyer takes the risk of delay in getting shipment from Glasgow or of delay or disaster in prosecuting the voyage from Glasgow to New Orleans. But he does not take the risk of delay or of sea perils which may occur in the course of the different voyage from Leith to the same destination.\nThere does not seem to exist any sound reason why the principles thus enunciated with regard to time and to place of shipment should not receive equal application to a stipulation in respect of mode of shipment.\nLord Blackburn, in Bowes v. Shand[6], had already said (p. 480):\nIt was argued, or tried to be argued, on one point, that it was enough that it was rice, and that it was immaterial when it was shipped. As far as the subject matter of the contract went, its being shipped at another and a different time being (it was said) only a breach of a stipulation which could be compensated for in damages. But I think that that is quite untenable. I think, to adopt an illustration which was used a long time ago by Lord Abinger,, and which always struck me as being a right one, that it is an utter fallacy, when an article is described, to say that it is anything but a warranty or a condition precedent that it should be an article of that kind, and that another article might be substituted for it. As he said, if you contract to sell peas, you cannot oblige a party to take beans. If the description of the article tendered is different in any respect it is not the article bargained for, and the other party is not bound to take it. I think in this case what the parties bargained for was rice, shipped at Madras or the coast of Madras. Equally good rice might have been shipped a little to the north or a little to the south of the coast of Madras. I do not quite know what the boundary is, and probably equally good rice might have been shipped in February as was shipped in March, or equally good rice might have been shipped in May as was shipped in April, and I dare say equally good rice might have been put on board another ship as that which was put on board the Rajah of Cochin. But the parties have chosen, for reasons best known to themselves, to say: We bargain to take rice, shipped in this particular region, at that particular time, on board that particular ship, and before the defendants can be compelled to take anything in fulfilment of that contract it must be shewn not merely that it is equally good, but that it is the same article as they have bargained for\u2014otherwise they are not bound to take it.\nBenjamin on Sale (6th ed., p. 679), expresses the view that\nthe extract from Lord Blackburn\u2019s opinion above quoted shows that the place or mode of shipment may be as material a part of the description of the goods as the time.\nAt p. 401, the same author had written:\n* * * if a particular mode of transmission be expressly or impliedly prescribed by the contract, as, for example, delivery to a specified carrier or by a particular route, the goods must be delivered to that carrier, or by that route.\nSee also Williston on Sales, 2nd ed. 585-587.\nMoreover, this very question came up squarely for decision before the British Court of Appeal in the case of L. Sutro & Co. v. Heilbut, Symons & Co.[7].\nThe contract was for the sale of rubber\nto be shipped during the months of March, April, 1916, by vessel or vessels (steam or motor) from the east to New York direct and\/or indirect with liberty to call and\/or transship at other ports.\nThe cargo was sent by steamship to Seattle and thence by rail to New York. The buyers refused to accept it because it had not been conveyed by sea to New York. No particular damage was shown.\nUnder a clause in the contract, the buyers\u2019 objection was submitted to arbitration; and the arbitrators found that, owing to the outbreak of war, it had become usual, at the time of this contract, to send by sea and rail shipments from the east which heretofore had gone the whole distance to New York by water. It was well known to those engaged in the trade that rubber sold on contracts in the form of the one in question would be forwarded by steamer to a port of the United States; hence they would be transmitted by rail to destination.\nThe Court of Appeal however held, affirming Mr. Justice Lush\nthat the contract provided for a sea carriage from the port of loading to New York; that the usage (assuming it was a usage), found by the arbitrators was inconsistent with the terms of the contract, and therefore was not applicable thereto; and that the tender was not a good tender and the buyers were not bound to accept the same.\nSwinfen Eady L.J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said (page 355) that it was not necessary for the buyers\nto justify in a court of law the mercantile reasons for inserting any particular stipulation in a contract. The observations on this point of Lord Cairns in Bowes v. Shand[8] are very relevant.\nHe then proceeds to quote from Lord Cairns\u2019 judgment in the latter case the passage at page 463 to which reference has already been made above; and he goes on to say:\nThe court assumes that a merchant, in entering into a mercantile transaction, has regard to his arrangements for paying for goods purchased, and his intention about reselling them in the ordinary course of his trade.\nand he concludes by saying that where a particular method of conveyance is stipulated for, it is not permissible to inquire whether there is not some other usual method; and a finding that there is another usual method is irrelevant.\nThe same underlying principle will be found in this decision of the Court of Appeal as in Bowes v. Shand[9] and Filley v. Pope[10] that\nit is not for the court to speculate on the reasons or motives which have induced the parties to a mercantile contract to agree upon any particular term or to consider what practical benefit might have arisen from the performance of any particular term of the contract.\nIn the words of Williston on Sales, 2nd ed., p. 585,\nthe property will not pass if the goods are too many, or too few, or they are sent at a materially different time, or by a different route or method of shipment, or are misdirected. Bidwell v. Overton[11].\nIn that view, the mode of shipment is a material and indeed an essential term of the contract. The consequence is that its non-performance is not \u201can unimportant variation\u201d which may, under the present contract, be excluded as constituting a \u201cbasis for a claim;\u201d but, on the contrary,\nmay fairly be considered by the other party as a substantial failure to perform the contract at all.\n(Wallis v. Pratt[12]).\nIf it were necessary, attention may be drawn to the fact that in the contract itself the parties, in this case, have given to \u201crouting\u201d the same conspicuous place as they have to \u201cdestination,\u201d \u201cconsigned to\u201d and \u201ctime of shipment.\u201d These are the four conditions of the contract which appear to have been singled out as specially important.\nWhen instructing Mr. Clawson, on the 30th August, the respondent wrote:\nWe want you to be particular to call their attention to the routing, as this car must come by C.N.R. from Chicago.\nAnd, when transmitting these instructions to his principals, Mr. Clawson in turn insisted:\nBe sure and see that car comes \u201cCanadian National Railway from Chicago.\u201d\nMoreover, the variation in the routing of this shipment has proven in the event to be of importance to the respondent. The evidence shows that the latter had an agreement with the Canadian National Railway for the hauling of its carload from Chicago to Saint John, whereby it would have been able to ship portions of the carload to its branches in New Brunswick while the car was in transit. The breach made this impossible. Both courts in New Brunswick have decided that the appellant\u2019s action to recover damages for non-acceptance of the prunes should be dismissed with costs. For the reasons which we have given, we think those decisions ought to be upheld.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacRae, Sinclair & MacRae.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Barnhill, Sanford & Harrison.\n[1] [1877] 2 App. Cas. 455.\n[2] [1885] 115 U.S.R. 188.\n[3] [1885] 115 U.S.R. 213.\n[4] 2 App. Cas. 455.\n[5] 115 U.S.R. 213.\n[6] 2 App. Cas. 455.\n[7] [1917] 2 K.B. 348.\n[8] 2 App. Cas. 455.\n[9] 2 App. Cas. 455.\n[10] 115 U.S.R. 213.\n[11] 26 Abbott\u2019s Cas.

C.R. 173) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition.\nBy an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada dated June 5, 1924, the appellant company was directed inter alia to construct a subway on Bloor St., Toronto, after plans of work had been filed with and approved by the Board. Under provisions of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C., c. 143, the railway company took certain land owned by the respondent who resisted the expropriation proceedings contending that provisions for taking land in s. 257 (2) of the Railway Act, 1919, were applicable to the case and not those of the Expropriation Act. The appellant\u2019s petition to the Exchequer Court of Canada under the provisions of s. 21 of the Expropriation Act for a warrant to put it in possession was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\nPending an appeal by the railway company, the following questions were referred to this court by order in council of May 29, 1925, pursuant to the authority of s. 60 of the Supreme Court Act:\nIn the case of lands or interests therein taken by the Canadian National Railway Company under the provisions of chapter 13 of the statutes of Canada, 1919:\n1. Are the provisions of the Railway Act or the Expropriation Act applicable to proceedings by the company to obtain possession of such lands?\n2. Has the Exchequer Court of Canada, or a judge thereof, jurisdiction to entertain an application by the company for a warrant of possession under section 21 of the Expropriation Act as made applicable mutatis mutandis to the company by section 13 of the Canadian National Railways Act, 1919?\n3. If question 2 be answered in the affirmative, has such court or judge power to issue such warrant prior to the commencement of proceedings by notice of expropriation or otherwise to ascertain the compensation payable in respect of the taking of such lands or of interests therein?\nThe appeal and the reference were heard together.\nLafleur K.C. for Attorney General of Canada, upholding the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court.\nGeoffrion K.C. for Attorney General of Canada, contra.\nGeo. F. Macdonnell for the Canadian National Railway Company.\nSmyth K.C. for respondent Boland.\nThe judgment of the court on the reference (and on the appeal), was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014In regard to \u201cthe taking or using of lands,\u201d s. 13 of the statute 9-10 Geo. V, c. 13, enacts, by exception, that the provisions of the Expropriation Act (R.S.C., c. 143), shall apply to the Canadian National Railway Company in lieu (inter alia) of the sections of the Railway Act which deal with these subjects. The answers to the questions submitted by Order in Council for our consideration depend upon whether proceedings to obtain possession of lands to be acquired compulsorily for the purpose of the railway are to be regarded as included in the exception so made by s. 13 to the general application of the Railway Act, or whether they should be regarded as incidental to proceedings for the ascertainment of compensation with which they are grouped in the Railway Act (ss. 215-243, 9-10 Geo. V, c. 68) under the heading expropriation proceedings, whereas a preceding fasciculus (ss. 189-214) carries the heading the taking and using of lands.\nApart from any inference to be drawn from collocation in the statute, the obtaining of possession would seem to fall naturally within \u201cthe taking of\u201d lands rather than within \u201cthe ascertainment of the compensation\u201d to be paid for them.\nUpon careful examination the entire set of provisions embraced in ss. 189-243 of the Railway Act are seen to relate to the acquiring of lands for the purposes of the railway and it seems clear that, notwithstanding the fact that the heading expropriation proceedings is in the same type as the earlier heading the taking and using of lands, namely small capitals, whereas sub-headings in the same statute are printed in italics, the sections dealing with proceedings for acquisition by expropriation, commencing with no. 215, must be regarded for present purposes as relating to, and a sub-division of, what is comprised under\nthe taking and using of lands. S. 214, which is found under that heading and immediately precedes the heading expropriation proceedings makes this abundantly clear. It reads as follows:\n214. In cases of disagreement between the parties or any of them, all questions which arise between them shall be settled as hereinafter provided.\nSections 215 et seq. proceed to provide for the mode of acquisition where transfer of the lands and settlement of matters incidental thereto by agreement under s. 213 is not feasible.\nIn this view of the matter ss. 239 et seq. which deal with the obtaining of possession in cases of resistance, must be regarded as having to do with \u201cthe taking or using of lands\u201d and therefore within the purview of the exception to the application of the Railway Act made by s. 13 of the Canadian National Railway Company Act.\nIn conformity with this view we find a specific provision made by clause (c) of subs. 2 of s. 13 for the application to expropriations by the Canadian National Railway Company of the provisions of the Railway Act respecting the ascertainment of compensation, which might otherwise be deemed to have been excluded under the general exception made in regard to \u201cthe taking or using of lands.\u201d\nWhile, therefore, the subsequent proceedings in regard to the ascertainment and payment of compensation for lands to be acquired by the Canadian National Railway Company are to be taken under the sections of the Railway Act commencing with s. 215, which provides for the notice of expropriation, it is the jurisdiction for the acquisition of possession conferred by s. 21 of the Expropriation Act (R.S.C., c. 143) which the company must invoke in order to obtain possession compulsorily.\nAlthough the Canadian National Railway Company is admittedly a corporation entirely distinct from the Crown and is not to be regarded as a department of the Government of Canada, its national character and the fact that it is an instrument created by statute for the management, operation and control of the Canadian National Railway System must not be ignored. Lands to be acquired compulsorily by it being vested in the company (s. 13. (2) (b), 9-10 Geo. V, c. 13), by and upon the deposit of plans under the Expropriation Act, no good reason has been suggested why immediate possession of such lands should not be available to the company as provided for by s. 21 of the Expropriation Act. The provisions of ss. 239-240 of the Railway Act as to payment into court of compensation money or the giving of security therefor would seem to be unnecessary and inappropriate.\nBy subs. 1 of s. 13 of the Canadian National Railway Company Act the provisions of the Expropriation Act are made to apply only when not \u201cinconsistent with this Act\u201d and mutatis mutandis. But we are unable to discern anything in s. 15 of the Canadian National Railway Company Act which excludes, as inconsistent, the exercise by the Exchequer Court of the jurisdiction conferred on it by s. 21 of the Expropriation Act where lands are acquired by the Canadian National Railway Company. The jurisdiction of the judge of the Exchequer Court under s. 21 of the Expropriation Act is concurrent with that of \u201cany judge of any superior court.\u201d S. 15 of the Canadian National Railway Company Act is permissive; it is declaratory of the powers of a judge of any court of competent jurisdiction in Canada; the definition in subs. 2 of a court of competent jurisdiction, is not framed as exclusive; the entire section is consistent with the existence of jurisdiction in the judge of the Exchequer Court concurrent with that of the judges of the provincial superior courts. The apparent office of s. 15 is to dispense with the necessity of a fiat which might otherwise have been deemed a prerequisite to proceedings against the company in view of its national character, and to provide for the right of appeal, notwithstanding that the judge acting under s. 15 might be regarded as persona designata. Unusual as it undoubtedly is that the Exchequer Court should entertain proceedings as between subject and subject, except in matters concerning patents, copyrights and trade-marks, having regard to the national character of the Canadian National Railway Company and its relation to the Government of Canada, it seems not inappropriate that that court should be vested with the jurisdiction here in question.\nTo the questions submitted we, therefore, make the following answers:\nQuestion No. 1: The provisions of the Expropriation Act apply.\nQuestion No. 2: Yes.\nQuestion No. 3: Yes.\nIn re C.N.R. v. Boland\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014For the reasons stated above we are, with respect, of the opinion that the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court declining jurisdiction in this case was erroneous.\nFor the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Middleton in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[2], affirming the judgment of Orde J., in Boland v. Canadian National Railway Co.[3], we agree with the conclusions of that court that the impugned expropriation\nfalls within the provisions of the Railway Act, 1919, and that the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada was sufficient to justify all that has been done by the railway company.\nThe appeal will accordingly be allowed with costs and the proceedings will be remitted to the learned judge of the Exchequer Court to be pursued under s. 21 of the Expropriation Act.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the Canadian National Railway Co.: George F. Macdonnell.\nSolicitors for the respondent Boland: Macdonell & Boland.\n[1] [1925] Ex. C.R. 173.\n[2] 56 Ont.

The Belgo Company, in July and August, 1920, agreed to purchase from the respondent company 5,000 barrels of cement. On account of the press of orders at its Montreal plant, the respondent company agreed to deliver this cement from its plant at Exshaw, Alberta, for a price inclusive of freight of $6.55 per barrel, any increase in the freight rates to be borne by the Belgo Company. Under this contract, certain quantities of cement had been shipped from Exshaw, when, on October 1, 1920, an agreement was arrived at to hold up further shipments from Exshaw. Seventeen cars of cement alleged to have been sent in September from Exshaw were charged to the appellant at Exshaw price. Out of that shipment six cars had previously been shipped in September to a firm in Alberta and refused by it as failing to pass the test of fitness and the same six cars had been re-shipped to the appellant on October 1. The latter, having also refused delivery of these six cars, undertook, on October 12, to pay the Exshaw price on six cars of cement shipped from Montreal to replace those refused, upon the representation by the respondent company that these oars had been shipped before the 1st of October. The Belgo Company paid the Montreal price for these six carloads of cement and the respondent claimed that it should have paid the Exshaw price. The appellant\u2019s demand is for payment of the difference between the latter price and the Montreal price, $4,354.18, forming with interest the sum of $4,556.67.\nThe respondent failed in the Superior Court, but obtained judgment for the amount of its claim in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Greenshields and Guerin JJ. dissenting.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel on behalf of both parties, the court reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, allowed the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nPerron K.C. and Genest K.C. for the appellant.\nLaurendeau K.C. and Chipman K.C. for the respondent.\n"

Therefore a motion for leave to appeal from a judgment dated 1st December, 1925, although made returnable within the delay of thirty days provided in rule 72, was dismissed as notice of the motion had been served only on the 17th December, 1925. In re Gilbert ([1925] S.C.R. 275). complemented\nMOTION for leave to appeal to this court in bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe Hudson Fashion Shoppe, Limited, was an incorporated company carrying on retail businesses in Hamilton and in London, Ontario. On May 22, 1925, an interim receiver in bankruptcy was appointed under an order of the court and took possession of both shops; and thereafter a final receiving order was made on June 1, 1925. The creditors subsequently appointed a trustee and inspectors. All goods not sold thus passed into the possession of the trustee. The Royal Dress Company, Limited, a manufacturing concern doing business in Montreal, Quebec, moved before a judge in the Ontario courts for an order and judgment annulling and resiliating for all purposes, as of right, the sale from that company to the insolvent company of certain merchandise and for its immediate return and delivery to the applicants. The two main points for determination were: (a) was the contract of sale made in the province of Quebec, and (b) if made there, do the terms of art. 1998 of the civil code of that province apply to the sale and goods in question and entitle the unpaid vendors to revendicate the latter in the province of Ontario.\nThe trial judge held that the whole contract of sale was not made in Quebec and that the civil code of that province, having regard to the facts of the case, was not effective or operative in the province of Ontario[1]. This judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division on the first day of December, 1925[2].\nThe trustee then made a motion for special leave to appeal to this court. The motion was returnable before a judge of this count on the 31st day of December, 1925, being the last day of the thirty days allowed by rule 72 of the Bankruptcy Act for bringing on such a motion; but notice of the motion was served on the counsel for the Royal Dress Company only on the 17th day of December, 1925.\nUpon hearing of the motion and after argument by counsel, Anglin C.J.C. in chambers pronounced judgment, dismissing the motion with costs, holding that notice of the motion had not been given at least fourteen days before the date of its return and that a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada was not empowered to abridge that period since it was fixed by a statutory rule.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSinger and Schroeder for motion.\nRobinson and Hill contra.\n[1] [1925] 57 Ont.

This grant was and still is commonly known under the name of the seigniory of Lake Metis. According to the topography, it is not a single body of water which is to be found at the source of the River Metis, but three bodies of water,, two of them being approximately of the same altitude above sea level and the third being of an altitude approximately eight feet above the other two; all three discharged naturally, from one to another by channels of flowing water which form no part of the lake expanse. At the time of the grant, these bodies of water were situated in a remote locality and uninhabited unless by Indians. After various changes of ownership, the respondent became the proprietor of the seigniory in 1922 and it then instituted a petition of right for the purpose of determining the extent of the property. It alleged that, at the time of the grant, it was not known that there was any difference of level between the three bodies of water and that what are now shown in the modern maps and known generally as three lake sections with .connecting channels were, by the grant, considered and described as a single lake; and it concluded by asking for a declaration that the three bodies of water should foe considered as \u201ca lake\u201d within the meaning of that term in the grant. In 1875, the seigniory had been sold under a sheriff\u2019s warrant to one B., the respondent\u2019s predecessor and the sheriff\u2019s deed described the property as follows: \u201call that tract of land forming and known under the name of seigniory of Lake Metis * * * with one league of land all around the said lake * * *.\u201d Prior to the sheriff\u2019s sale, from November, 1868, the provincial government had granted to the respondent\u2019s predecessors timber licences on two limits which, according to their description, included all the land which would be comprised within the boundaries of the seigniory if they were those as claimed now by the respondent to have been fixed by the grant of 1693; and the respondent\u2019s predecessors exercised their rights of cutting timber within these limits. At the trial, the respondent produced a number of maps which were admitted in evidence on its behalf: they came originally from various sources but were mostly selected from the collection of maps at the Dominion Archives. The earliest are of the date of 1765 and) in all these maps down to 1863, there is a single lake shown at the head of the River Metis.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the area of the grant must be limited to one lake, the upper lake, with the surrounding league, as, upon the evidence, the grant cannot be given an interpretation or construction of wider import than the restricted literal meaning of the language used carries with it.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014The preponderance of evidence favours the view that, at the beginning of the 19th century and previously as far as known, the expanse of water, consisting of the upper, middle and lower sections, with connecting stretches, from the southern extremity of the upper section to the point Where the river proper debouches from the lower section, bore the designation of Lake Metis, the whole expanse being treated as a unum quid.\nHeld, also, that maps generally, are of little or no value to prove the facts which they depict or represent, geographers often laying them down upon incorrect surveys or information and copying the mistakes of one another; but they may be useful as admissions against the party who produces them. Idington J. expressed no opinion. Duff J. held that although they may not be conclusive for the purpose of construing the grant of 1693, they are at least very cogent evidence in support of the contention advanced by a report of a surveyor in favour of the respondent as to the denotation of the name Lake Metis according to the contemporary usage of persons familiar with the locality.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Newcombe JJ.\u2014Maps, when they have no conventional or statutory significance, should be regarded merely as representing the opinions of the persons who constructed them; they furnish at best no adequate proof, and none when it appears that they are founded upon misleading or unreliable information or upon reasons which do not go to establish the theory or opinion represented, and when they have not the qualifications requisite to found proof of reputation.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and \u2018Mignault and Newcombe JJ.\u2014A map prepared by a private person, although filed with a provincial government, is not admissible as a public document against the Crown; it merely illustrates and the proof must come from sources outside the maps.

Derme ([1904] 2 Ch. 534) disc.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014At the time of the seizure and sale, the sheriff cannot have meant, nor could he have intended the public to understand that he had seized and was selling other than the only lake which then was known by the name Lake Metis, that is the body of water furthest from the St. Lawrence. The buyer B., who was perfectly aware of the whole situation, cannot have imagined that his sheriff\u2019s deed granted him rights over the other two lakes; and the respondent\u2019s predecessors, when they bought from B. in 1876, cannot have intended, in view of the licences held by them since 1868, that they were getting more than the land around the upper lake, not already covered by their Crown licences.\nPer Anglin (C.J.C. and Mignault and Newcombe JJ.\u2014The report of a surveyor employed by one of the parties to a dispute affecting the title to land to survey that land, when made post litem motam, is not admissible as evidence, either of reputation or of fact; it serves only as notice of the claim.

For I cannot conceive of a lake having such an outlet and fall having ever been confused with another lake, or river as forming part thereof.\nI cannot conceive of people blundering into asserting that two lakes were in fact one.\nSuch seems to have been the case with the late Mr. Ballantyne, chosen by Mr. Rouville in 1835 to survey the territory he had then acquired under the above mentioned grant of 1693, and successive grants or divisions thereof, by which it was passed on by said grantee and through others to Rouville.\nRouville, apparently, knew as little as the rest of us about this acquisition, and employed Ballantyne as his surveyor to enlighten him.\nIn the report Ballantyne made he uses the following expression:\u2014\nThe whole extent of the lake, i.e., from the point A to the point B, is almost a perfect level.\nI am not inclined to believe that Mr. Ballantyne was intentionally dishonest, but I cannot believe that he took the same pains as either Johnston or Joncas, in 1923, or Breen, in 1870, who arrived at almost exactly the same results in making a survey of said outlet from lake M\u00e9tis (properly so called) and demonstrating that there was a fall in the level of the water rushing out from that end of lake M\u00e9tis which absolutely forbade, in my view of such things, anyone, taking due care, from reporting those three sections of water, draining the surrounding country and emptying the results into the so-called river M\u00e9tis, as one lake.\nOwing to the erection of a dam by respondent at the end of these three lakes the level between Lac \u00e0 la Croix and Lac aux Anguilles in its natural state was not, and, I imagine, could not possibly be made as clear as the fall from the M\u00e9tis, properly so called, to La Croix.\nBut how did the latter get the names they acquired and when?\nWe were told in argument that La Croix had a tradition attached to it but as I do not find the tradition or its origin clearly testified to by oral evidence, perhaps it resulted from the necessities of those visiting there for business or pleasure promoting in these later times what anyone so doing must have seen necessity for instead of the absurdity of calling the second and third sections, part of lake M\u00e9tis.\nI am quite confident that there must have been some of these people intelligent enough to recognize the absurdity of calling all those stretches of water by one name and as if one lake.\nIt takes time, under such conditions as existed in that far away district to have each spot given a name which adheres to it.\nI have no doubt that as lake M\u00e9tis, properly so called, was the chief body of water at all like a lake, in 1693, and that no reasonable person could then claim for the other sections, now claimed as lakes, any necessity for having a name given them, there was no grant made of any lake but that I have been designating the one properly so called.\nThen the outlet from it at the river M\u00e9tis was clearly a recognition of the lower parts of its outflow, as part of the river M\u00e9tis.\nSuch a view may be said to be unfounded in the evidence. I reply thereto that for such speculation there is quite as much evidence as for accepting in whole the report of Mr. Ballantyne, as if evidence.\nI cannot accept that as evidence of anything but the fact that he had been so retained and so reported.\nOn that report we have much argument based, as if it proved the facts stated as such, therein, when they are not proven, and are only good for evidence of what occurred relative to the filing of same in the Crown records when all relative to the truth or falsehood of the statements made therein was expressly reserved for future determination.\nI cannot, therefore, accede to the respondent\u2019s argument based on Mr. Ballantyne\u2019s statements of fact. Much less can I as helping to prove the actual facts and circumstances surrounding the execution of the original grant.\nNor can I assent to the suggestion that the commutation deed of 1853 extended, or ever was intended to extend, the rights originally granted.\nThe mere power given by the imperial statute of 1820, on which the said deed of 1853 rests, never contemplated more than a mere change of tenure.\nI observe that the court below seems to have adopted the opinion of Mr. Justice Greenshields who wrote at greater length than some of the others writing; and he certainly seemed to start out in his conclusion as if the statements of Ballantyne were to be accepted as fact, instead of simply proof of his having, acting on behalf of his client Rouville, presented his opinions to the Government, and which were received for future consideration, but not as proven evidence. And that was so clearly put on record at the time as to rather lead one to doubt the sincerity of argument rested thereon.\nThat argument seems nevertheless to have pervaded the minds of the court below and, without that state of mind I, with great respect, submit that the judgment appealed from would not have been given.\nAs, with great respect, I cannot accept that view, or any other than as above indicated as briefly as can be at present, I am decidedly of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, and the petition in question herein dismised with costs.\nThere are many other grounds taken by respondent which I am of opinion have no evidence to support them, and I have no time to deal with them herein, and yet they are put forward with apparent confidence which the respondents could not have felt half a century, or more, ago, when accepting licenses from appellant, recognizing his rights, though under protest.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The crucial question on this appeal is mainly a question of fact, which has been elaborately and ably examined by the trial judge, Mr. Justice Gibson, and by Mr. Justice Greenshields, in the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The powerful argument addressed to us for the Crown has not, in my opinion, seriously shaken their conclusion. The consideration of the question can be most conveniently approached by referring first to the report and plan of Ballantyne, of 1836. The report is, in part, in these words:\u2014\nReport of the survey of Lake Mitis, surveyed in November and December, 1835, by D. S. Ballantyne, D.P.S.\nPursuant to the instructions directed to me by J. B. Tach\u00e9, Esq., dated the 8th October, 1835, I have surveyed the Lake Mitis situated about 36 miles south east of the river St. Lawrence, conformable to the plan and field notes hereto annexed, and in the manner hereafter mentioned.\nBeginning at the south extremity of the said lake, towards the north extremity of said lake, in scaling the different courses and distances and taking intersections, to the entrance of the river Mitis. The parts surveyed by scaling are coloured on the plan in pink and those by intersections are coloured in yellow.\nRemarks\nThe general features of the county around the lake is level for one mile and from thence begins rising hills.\nThe average depth of water in the expanded parts may be from 4 to 6 fathoms and in the contracted parts from 4 to 15 feet.\nThe average breadth of the expanded parts is from 24 to 16 arpens and the contracted parts from 4 to 24 perches. The contracted parts is dead water and the soil on the banks is alluvial for 3 to 5 arpens each side and from thence begins the flats, extending from half a mile to a mile and afterwards begins the rising ground.\nBoth in the expanded and contracted parts of the lake, the bottom is composed of sand and clay and the bed of the river Mitis, stoney. At the point B, where the river takes the name of river Mitis, the average breadth may be about 3 perches and very rapid, the average fall may also be about forty feet to one mile. The whole extend of the lake, i.e., from the point A to the point B is almost a perfect level.\nThe river discharging in the lake is small and run with a gentle current, and are not connected with any lakes.\nThe islands are of a sandy soil rather inclined to be loamy and elevated above the level of the lake about 3 to 4 feet, the timber growing on them is firs and white birch of a middle size.\nThe hunters and old settlers of Mitis and Rimousky that have often frequented those parts gives the appelation of Lake Mitis to the whole extend, i.e., from the point A to B and the river takes the name of river Mitis at the point B.\nFrom the features of the country its locality and the tenure of the title of concession, my humble opinion, is that the grant was made for the whole extend, i.e., from the point A to B for the following reasons:\nWhen Mr. Rouer in 1693 made application for a grant of Lake Mitis, he certainly applied for the whole extend, as the aborigines of that part of the country, then\u2019 and do now consider it to be all Lake Mitis, i.e., the whole extend from the point B to A and as also the south section only; could not induce any person to apply for a grant being such a distance from the St. Lawrence, and also the same reasons only for the second section.\nIf the intention of the grant was merely for one section, by giving one length in depth round either of the lakes one of the sections most evidently encroach on the other.\nTrois Pistoles, 10 January, 1836.\nD. S. Ballantyne, D.P.S.\nThe effect of this report is, when read in light of the plan, that, at the date of the report and previously, so far as known, among the hunters and settlers of Metis and Rimouski, the expanse of water, consisting of the upper, middle and lower sections, with connecting stretches, from the southern extremity of the upper to the point where the river proper debouches from the lower section, bore the designation of \u201cLake Metis\u201d; the whole expanse being treated as a unum quid. The preponderance of evidence favours the view that at the beginning of the nineteenth century it was to this expanse as a whole that the term \u201cLake Metis\u201d was applied.\nBallantyne\u2019s report was referred to Bouchette, the surveyor-general, and Bouchette, whose report is dated about six weeks later than the date of Ballantyne\u2019s, while personally not unwilling to accept the view advanced by Ballantyne, advised the executive that this should be subject to verification in the manner suggested by Colonel de Rouville, the owner of the seigniory, in support of whose application Ballantyne\u2019s report had been made and filed. De Rouville\u2019s application has not been found, and we are ignorant of the nature of his suggestions as to verification. About a month later, the surveyor-general was authorized by the executive to make Ballantyne\u2019s report and plan part of the records of the surveyor-general\u2019s office, it being understood that Ballantyne\u2019s survey was not to be construed as settling \u201cconclusively\u201d the boundaries of lake M\u00e9tis. The object of Colonel de Rouville\u2019s application was, of course, to fix in principle the extent of the seigniory, by establishing the identity of lake M\u00e9tis within the meaning of the grant of Louis XIV, in 1693, and this was apparently the question intended to be reserved.\nThere is no evidence of any formal acceptance of Ballantyne\u2019s report and plan as correctly defining lake M\u00e9tis for the purpose of giving effect to the grant of Louis XIV, except such as may be found in the grant of 1855 and the map of 1853 hereinafter mentioned. The learned trial judge seems rightly to have held that the dominating purpose of this last-mentioned grant was to effect a change of tenure, pursuant to the powers and duties created by the Act of 1822. This, of course\u2019, is not necessarily inconsistent with the existence of an intention manifested by that grant to accept Ballantyne\u2019s survey as correctly ascertaining the subject of the earlier grant, and rightly construed in light of the facts known to the Crown officials as well as to the grantees this grant of 1855 does appear, inferentially at all events, to involve a declaration upon that subject.\nThe description of the land which was the subject of the grant in the deed of 1855 is in the following words:\u2014* * *\nall that certain tract of waste and uncultivated land, lands and tenements known by the name of the fief and seigniory of the Lake Metis situate in the county of Rimouski in the district of Kamourska heretofore forming part of the district of Quebec, which said lake, lying on the south bank of the river St. Lawrence, discharges itself into a river of the same name (Metis) emptying itself into the said river St. Lawrence and being at a distance of about ten or eleven leagues from the said\u2019 river St. Lawrence, together with all the isles, islands and islets which may be found therein and one league of land in depth all round the said lake and) the appurtemances bounded on all sides by the waste lands of the Crown.\nIn the original grant of 1693, the distance of the lake from the river had been given as from twelve to fifteen leagues. There appears to be little doubt that the figures given in each grant are intended to express the distance, reckoned according to the sinuosities of the river, and not in a straight line, and give the length of the river proper, so measured, from the lower end of the lake described as lake M\u00e9tis to its embouchement at the St. Lawrence. For nearly twenty years before the grant of 1855, the Crown had been in possession of Ballantyne\u2019s plan and report, which had been official records of the department of Crown Lands. Ballantyne had reported the \u201cdistance\u201d as \u201cthirty-six miles.\u201d This was not adopted in preparing the description for the deed of 1855. No doubt in the meantime more accurate information had been obtained upon this point; and the \u201cten or eleven leagues,\u201d mentioned in the description as the length of the river, accords with the fact as deposed to by Cimon (who, as the result of his measurements, gives the length of the river as thirty-three miles and a fraction), if \u201cLake M\u00e9tis,\u201d in the description, is to be read as designating the whole expanse which is delineated and so designated in the plan and survey of Ballantyne. That this is the purport of the description is borne out by a map of the west part of Rimouski, which appears to have been returned, in 1853, to the two houses of the Quebec legislature, with a report by the department of Crown Lands. That map professes to give the boundaries of the seigniory; and the lake, as there delineated, obviously comprises all three sections.\nThis delineation depicts the river proper as debouching from the lake at a point which must obviously be the lower end of the lower section\u2014the lake, as depicted on the map, discharging itself into the river at that point. In this respect, the lake and river as shown in this map, returned to the two houses of the legislature by the department of Crown Lands, answer the description in the grant of 1855, as well as in the grant of 1693, construed according to the contention of the respondents; but does not answer the description in either grant, construed according to the contention of the Crown. The length of the river given, moreover, ten or eleven leagues, is wholly irreconciliable with the contention of the Crown that lac M\u00e9tis embraces the upper section alone.\nThe description in the deed of 1855, interpreted in light of these facts\u2014in light, that is to say, of the documents of 1836, of this map of 1853, of the fact that ten or eleven leagues is an approximately correct statement of the actual distance, measured from the lower end of the lower section to the St. Lawrence, according to the sinuosities of the river, and of the adoption of these figures in substitution for the figures in the original grant\u2014appears to afford satisfactory evidence that the Crown and its grantees under the grant of 1855 did accept, for the purposes of the deed, the claim advanced in 1836 as to the identity of the expanse of water designated by the name \u201cLake M\u00e9tis.\u201d\nAssuming that this is not conclusive for the purpose of construing the grant of 1693 (and leaving out of view the surrender of the earlier grant involved in the acceptance of the grant of 1855), it seems at least to be very cogent evidence in support of the contention advanced by Ballantyne as to the denotation of the name \u201cLake M\u00e9tis,\u201d according to the contemporary usage of persons familiar with the locality. The admissibility of Ballantyne\u2019s survey, plan and report has been challenged, but Bouchette\u2019s report upon them, and the letter of advice from the Governor\u2019s secretary to M. de Rouville, are indisputably admissible, and the documents to which they relate can unquestionably be referred to for the purpose of explaining them. Moreover, Ballantyne\u2019s report and plan, having been received as part of the records of the Crown Lands department, can be inspected for the purpose of estimating the significance of the map returned in 1853; and it is impossible to doubt that they can be referred to for the purpose of construing and applying the description in the grant of 1855.\nBallantyne\u2019s report and plan evidently remained a part of the official records in the Crown Lands office, and without official challenge as to their correctness, as representing the state of affairs existing in 1836, and they formed the basis of official and other maps and plans of Rimouski for nearly half a century after the grant of 1855. Ballantyne\u2019s boundaries of Lake M\u00e9tis are reproduced in a series of maps, many of them official, beginning with 1863, and ending about the end of the century.\nIn 1870, a departmental map was issued, with the authority of the commissioner of Crown Lands and the assistant commissioner, in which the seigniory is shown as embracing all the three sections of the lake with the surrounding land; and again, in 1880, a departmental map, prepared by Mr. Tach\u00e9, the assistant commissioner, exhibits the boundaries of the seigniory in the same way as the map of 1870. There are similar maps in 1893, 1898, 1904 and 1914. In 1895, for the first time, there is a map issued to the public in which the boundaries of the seigniory are traced in accordance with the view now advocated by the Crown; as circumscribing, that is to say, the upper lake alone. But again, in 1898, an official map, signed by the commissioner of colonization and mines, gives the boundaries of the seigniory according to the plan of Ballantyne. It is not until 1870 that we first hear of the designations \u201cLac \u00e0 la Croix\u201d and \u201cLac d\u2019Anguilles\u201d as attaching to the middle and lower lakes as quite distinct sheets of water. The latter designation appears in none of the published maps produced, and the former\u2014until 1914\u2014only as an alternative designation in this legend, \u201cLac Milieu, ou Lac \u00e0 la Croix.\u201d\nThen there is another series of maps, beginning with the year 1798 and ending about the year 1830, in which the lake source of the river M\u00e9tis is shown under the designation of \u201cLac M\u00e9tis,\u201d and circumscribed by the boundaries of the seigniory, and delineated in such a way as to indicate an intention to include the whole lake source in the body of water so described. From the dimensions, moreover, of this lake source, as delineated on nearly every one of these maps, it must be inferred that the map-maker conceived the body of water delineated as having a much greater longitudinal extent than four and a half miles, the length of the upper lake as ascertained by Johnston\u2019s report. As a rule, this body of water is shown as having a length, when scaled, of from ten to fourteen miles. It is quite clear, from the legends on some of these maps, that the delineation of this body of water proceeded on no survey or report but from information gathered from people familiar with the locality.\nThese maps, however, afford some evidence that Ballantyne\u2019s view was in conformity with the general repute and the fair inference appears to be that, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the whole chain of lakes was the subject designated by the term \u201cLake M\u00e9tis,\u201d according to the usage of those familiar with the locality.\nThis, of course, is by no means necessarily conclusive as to the construction of the grant of 1693, but it is sufficient to establish a prima facie case in favour of the suppliants on the question of fact as to what was the subject or what were the subjects designated in 1693 by the appellation \u201cLac M\u00e9tis.\u201d\nNothing in the maps of the eighteenth century is at all inconsistent with this. Against it there can be urged only this, namely, that the grant of 1693 itself describes the subject of it as \u201cun lac,\u201d and that this forbids the adoption of a reading of the description as a whole which makes it embrace three distinct bodies of water, each of which might be described in technical, as well as in popular language, as \u201cun lac.\u201d To this the answer appears to be that the phrase of the grant of 1693 \u201cun lac appelle M\u00e9tis\u201d may not improperly be read as a mere paraphrase of the proper name, Lac Mitis; and if it be true that under . this latter description the whole chain or expanse now in question was embraced, then effect ought to be given to the grant according to this nomenclature.\nThe appeal should be dismised with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Newcombe.\nNewcombe J.\u2014I see no reason to doubt the conclusion\nof the learned trial judge expressed in the finding that the identification, situation and extent of the lands referred to in the re-grant of 1855 are to be determined from the primordial title, to wit, that of 10th February, 1693.\nIt is the affirmative determination expressed in the next following paragraph of the judgment; which is at the foundation of the respondent company\u2019s case:\u2014\nConsidering that it appears that, at the time of the primordial grant, it was not known that there was any difference of level between the uppermost section of (sic) the other two, and that the intention of the grantor was not affected by the consideration of such circumstance, but, on the contrary, it appears that what are now shown on the maps and plans as three lake sections with connecting channels, were, by the primordial grant, considered and described as a single lake, regardless of there being separate sections, and regardless of there being a difference between the natural level of one section and that of the other two.\nI accept the finding that according to the topography it is not a single body of water called \u201cLake M\u00e9tis\u201d which is to be found at the source of the river M\u00e9tis, but three bodies of water; the learned judge says that\ntravelling up stream there is a first lake, now called \u201cLac \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille\u201d; connected to it, by a rather widened channel, is, at a distance of about two miles further up stream, a second lake, now called\u2019 \u201cLac \u00e0 la Croix\u201d; then further up, connected by the river at its normal width, is a third lake, the distance between the second and the third lake is about one-half mile, the third lake now called \u201cLake Mitis.\u201d The first and second lakes are approximately of the same altitude above sea level; the channel between them is sluggish; but the third lake is of an altitude approximately eight feet above the other two, and the stream in the connecting channel has a flow consequent upon the fall of eight feet in the half mile.\nIt is to be observed however by reference to the report of Mr. Johnston of the Geological Survey, who surveyed these lakes, that he gives the distance between the upper and middle lakes as fifteen hundred feet. He shows moreover that the levels of the middle and lower lakes have been raised by reason of the dam which has been constructed at the discharge of the lower lake, and that the middle and lower lakes were formerly connected by a channel in which there was probably a small amount of fall, but because of the effects of the dam at the outlet of the lower lake, in raising the level of the water, the two lakes are now at the same level.\nMr. Johnston also found that\nthe difference in level between the water above and below the dam when the gates were closed varied from 9.7 to 10.2 feet, so that under natural conditions at times of low water there would be a difference of level of 12 to 13 feet, between the level of the water of the lower lake and that of the upper lake.\nThere are thus three lakes lying at different levels, and these discharge naturally, from one to another, by channels of flowing water which form no part of the lake expanses, and it serves only to misunderstanding and confusion to call these lakes three lake sections or separate sections. This misdescription finds its origin in the report of Mr. Ballantyne, a surveyor, who was sent by the proprietor of the granted rights to survey the seigniory in 1835, at a time when questions had arisen and were pending as between the proprietor and the Crown as to its extent. Unfortunately Ballantyne\u2019s survey and plan were permitted to find their way to the records of the Crown Lands office at Quebec, and, although the Government declined to accept or to act upon his report, and has never acquiesced in or become bound by it, it has nevertheless, as a document of reference, exercised a confounding influence upon the subsequent cartography and description.\nThe grant was made in 1693, upon the request of Augustin Rouer, for and in the name of Louis Rouer, his son, for the concession of a lake, or one lake (d\u2019un lac), called M\u00e9tis, which discharges itself into a river of the same name, with one league of land all about the lake, which is at a distance of about twelve or fifteen leagues from the river St. Lawrence, and the land is granted by the same description \u00e0 titre de fief. This was less than ninety years after the establishment of the first settlement at Quebec. The lakes are situated at the head waters of the river Metis, a stream which flows into the St. Lawrence from the southward, 200 miles or more below Quebec, and which comes down from the height of land or watershed between the St. Lawrence and the Baie des Chaleurs, and has a length, exclusive of the lakes, following its sinuosities, of about 33 miles, or, in a direct line, about 10 miles less. The region was at the time uninhabited, unless by Indians, or at places on the St. Lawrence convenient for the fishery, it may be that it was due to the proximity of the natives to a settlement at the estuary that the river M\u00e9tis derived its name. The chain of lakes, upper, middle and lower, including the connecting channels, is about fifteen miles in length; the upper lake, four and one-half miles; the middle lake, about five miles; the lower lake, about three miles, and the connecting streams about two and one-half miles. There is no evidence except from the grant, and such as comes from the maps to which I shall refer, as to what any of these lakes was called at the time. They were situated in a remote locality and probably not much was known about them. If they were named, it is most unlikely that the three lakes would have the same name; if one of them were named \u201cM\u00e9tis,\u201d it may perhaps have been the lower because the name is French, and the discovery would naturally come from the settlements on the St. Lawrence; or, the existence of the three lakes were known, it may have been the upper one as the source of the river, which had received the name \u201cMitis\u201d The application of the name is thus left somewhat to conjecture, but certainly if the grantee before making his application had explored these waters, or caused them to be explored, to the head of the upper lake, and if it had been his intention to obtain a grant of the land surrounding all three, it is inconceivable that he would have described the area in his application as one lake and the surrounding league. He could not have ascended the channel which carried the discharge of the middle lake and was two miles in length without realizing that it was a river or stream, and not a lake, and he would not have thought of using the name \u201cLac M\u00e9tis\u201d as descriptive either of it or of the upper channel.\nThe inference to be drawn from the maps of the 18th and early 19th centuries, which were introduced by the respondent, is that, according to the knowledge or reputation of the time, there was only one lake on the river M\u00e9tis, and this, as early at least as 1755, bore the name of Lake M\u00e9tis, and it was from this lake that the river took its rise. I see no evidence to suggest that the name was applied to three lakes; and it is noteworthy that it is the upper lake, the source of the river, to which the name \u201cM\u00e9tis\u201d adheres, and that we find the middle lake known under the name of \u201cLac \u00e0 La Croix,\u201d and the lower one as \u201cLac \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille.\u201d\nBallantyne on his plan puts the letter A at the head of the upper lake, and the letter B at the foot of the lower lake, and he says that the hunters and old settlers of M\u00e9tis and Rimouski applied the name \u201cLake M\u00e9tis\u201d to the whole extent from A to B, and that the river takes the name of M\u00e9tis at B. Moreover, he says that\nthe aborigines of that part of the country then (1693) and) do now consider it to be all Lake Metis, that is the whole extent from point B to A.\nThere are subjoined to Ballantyne\u2019s report under the title \u201cremarks\u201d a few paragraphs, the first group of which is descriptive, while the concluding group of paragraphs is evidently designed to set forth his reasons and argument for projecting the boundary lines of the seigniory around all three lakes. It is here that he refers to the hunters and old settlers of the time, and to the aborigines of 1693. In my view, neither one of these declarations or statements can have any probative effect, because of the partizan source from which they come post litem motam, and because, seeing that Ballantyne reports as a fact the use which the Indians made of the name \u201cLake M\u00e9tis\u201d in 1693, a subject upon which he could possibly have had no information, there is no reason to suppose that he was adequately informed when he tells of the application of the name by the hunters and old settlers of M\u00e9tis and Rimouski. It is, I think, just, having regard to the occasion and context of Ballantyne\u2019s remarks, to consider them as put forward by the surveyor merely as argument to support the case of his employer, and not as evidence which can be permitted to influence the findings.\nI am not aware of any principle upon which the self-serving statements in Ballantyne\u2019s report can be accepted as evidence for the respondent, either of reputation or of fact. His survey and his enquiries, if he made any, were for the purpose of establishing or supporting this very claim, which was then in controversy. In my view, Ballantyne\u2019s report serves as notice of the claim which it was prepared to advocate and may be used only for that purpose.\nThe respondent produced a number of maps which were admitted in evidence on his behalf. These came originally from various sources, but were mostly selected from the collection of maps at the Dominion Archives. The earliest are of the date 1755 arid in all these maps down to 1863 there is a single lake shown at the head of the river M\u00e9tis. In Holland\u2019s map of 1803, the lake is shown under the name \u201cLake M\u00e9tis\u201d surrounded by lines presumably drawn to represent the boundaries of the grant, but the lake is according to the scale somewhat less than ten miles in length and has an extreme breadth of upwards of five miles. It was not until 1863 that a map emerged showing a long narrow crescent-shaped lake corresponding somewhat to the lakes depicted upon Ballantyne\u2019s plan, but this map makes no attempt to separate the three lakes and shows all of more or less uniform width. Later maps follow Ballantyne\u2019s draft more closely.\nMaps are from their nature of very slight evidence. Geographers often lay them down upon incorrect surveys or information, copying the mistakes of one another. This may be illustrated by reference to Holland\u2019s map of 1803, where it is said, under the figure of Lake M\u00e9tis, surrounded by lines to represent the boundaries of the seigniory, that\nthese lakes are laid down not from actual survey but from information of travellers.\nNow this drawing which is the first representation of a lake which is of any use for the purpose of realizing its size or shape was certainly laid down without any reliable information; there is no lake of its outline or size upon the ground, and yet the lake as shown here re-appears in subsequent maps with considerable regularity until 1863, a time considerably subsequent to Ballantyne\u2019s survey. It must be remembered that these are all maps of an unsure-veyed district, and they are really of little or no value to prove the facts which they depict or represent; they may however be useful as admissions against the party who produces them; and, in this aspect, the inference which they support is that, until the time of Ballantyne\u2019s survey, everybody, both cartographers and the persons from whom they got their information,, were under the impression that the river M\u00e9tis had its source in one lake only. It may be that the description of the grant is apt or sufficient to include the upper or the lower lake as a lake, or one lake, called \u201cM\u00e9tis,\u201d which is the subject of the grant, but upon what principle the description can be extended to include more lakes than one I am unable to realize. I see no convincing evidence that the three lakes were called \u201cM\u00e9tis;\u201d but, if they were, how does that improve the respondent\u2019s case? If there were three lakes called \u201cM\u00e9tis\u201d discharging into the river M\u00e9tis the grant is surely void for uncertainty, or because it is impossible to apply the description to any defined subject matter; and, if it be only the lower lake which discharges into the river M\u00e9tis, that fact, while perhaps sufficient to identify the lake as the subject of the grant, does not entitle the respondent to include also two other lakes called \u201cM\u00e9tis\u201d which do not discharge into the river M\u00e9tis.\nMaps, when they have no conventional or statutory significance, should be regarded merely as representing the opinions of the persons who constructed them, they furnish at best no adequate proof, and none when it appears that they are founded upon misleading or unreliable information or upon reasons which do not go to establish the theory or opinion represented, and when they have not the qualifications requisite to found proof of reputation. Some of the later printed or coloured maps issued by the department of Colonization or of Crown Lands represent the seigniory in accordance with the respondent\u2019s contention, others adopt that of the .Crown. These maps embrace large districts, if not the whole province; they are issued for departmental use. One realizes that publications, documents and information not infrequently find their way into the Crown Lands and other departments of the Government from which inferences may be drawn adverse to the public right. Claimants are vigilant to avail themselves of any consent which may be afforded to introduce to the records information which may serve their interests. Territorial limits and the boundaries of wilderness grants are, perhaps more frequently than not, lacking in definition or precision of statement, and when a general map of a province or district is in course of preparation, the attention of the departmental draftsman is not apt to be specially directed to careful consideration of the particular features or details upon which claims may depend, and sometimes, not unnaturally, particulars creep into the draft without due consideration of their use or trustworthiness. They are matters of detail, perhaps proper to be shown if verified, but not contributing to the main purpose of the work, which is not essentially concerned to verify them. These-maps are prepared and issued not for the purpose of establishing facts or as admissions; they merely illustrate, and the proof must come from sources outside the maps. Mercer v. Denne[3]. Neither the minister nor the Governor in Council can in the reasonable course of administration consider and conclude all the particulars or details which find place in a general map, or all the questions which, if the map import admission or proof, it might be used to determine. The map makers of the department use the information which is available, and they in turn, no matter how carefully they execute their work, are not proof against oversight or errors, the consequences of which might be very serious if these erroneous representations are to be taken as determining the facts with relation to pending claims. It is not in this manner that the Crown domain can be alienated.\nIt is a remarkable fact that whereas, according to the original grant, the distance of the lake called M\u00e9tis is about 12 or 15 leagues from the St. Lawrence, the grant in free and common soccage of 1855, known as the commutation, gives a distance of about 10 or 11 leagues; and, although nothing else appears by the latter grant to indicate an intention to enlarge or to alter the area or location of the lands granted in 1693, there is no explanation or suggestion of any reason why the statement of the distance from the St. Lawrence is thus varied. It appears in fact that the outlet of the upper lake is about 30 miles from the St. Lawrence, and that of the lower lake about 23 miles, and it may have been that the draftsman of the grant of 1855 considered that, as the distance stated in the original grant was then known to be excessive, it ought to be reduced, and that he stated the distance of 10 or 11 leagues as his appreciation of the true distance, which, in fact, as will have been perceived, corresponds very closely to the actual distance of the outlet of the upper lake from the St. Lawrence. Certainly the distance of 10 or 11 leagues was not taken from Ballantyne\u2019s report which states that the lake M\u00e9tis is situated about 36 miles southeast of the St. Lawrence.\nIt is the upper lake which the Crown identifies as the lake M\u00e9tis of the grant, and expresses its willingness to concede, and it would answer all the requirements not unreasonably if the stream between the upper and middle akes be regarded as the beginning of the river M\u00e9tis into which the lake discharges. On the other hand, the lower lake undoubtedly discharges into the river M\u00e9tis, and if, at the time of the grant, it were called lake M\u00e9tis, it would satisfy the grant in all particulars, except as to distance from the St. Lawrence. I do not think the grant necessarily fails or is utterly void for uncertainty, or that it is impossible to define the subject of the grant upon the ground. The object of the litigation is to extend the grant, which admittedly and upon the common view includes the upper lake, to the middle and lower lake, and I would reject that contention.\nRinfret J.\u2014Price Brothers & Company, Limited, par sa p\u00e9tition de droit amend\u00e9e, conclut:\u2014\nThat by the judgment to intervene herein your suppliant be declared the true and lawful proprietor and owner of that territory or tract of land, lands and tenements situated and lying within the counties of Rimouski and Matane, in the province of Quebec, commonly known under the name of the seigniory of Lake Metis and comprising that certain body of water at the head of the river Metis in the counties of Rimouski and Matane composed of\u2019 three sections or parts known collectively as Lao Metis, together with all the isles, islands and islets which may be found therein, and one league of land in depth around the said body of water, together with all rights, members and appurtenances appertaining thereto or in connection therewith.\nLa compagnie demande, en outre, qu\u2019il soit proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un bornage entre le territoire de la seigneurie et celui de la Couronne.\nLes parties ont consenti \u00e0 suspendre l\u2019adjudication sur la question du bornage jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le jugement final ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la seigneurie.\nL\u2019acte de concession original du fief \u00e0 Louis Rouer remonte au 10 f\u00e9vrier 1693 et fut ratifi\u00e9 par Louis XIV, le 15 avril 1694.\nLe plan de D. S. Ballantyne, que la compagnie d\u00e9sire faire accepter, porte la date du 10 janvier 1836.\nM. Ballantyne \u00e9tait un arpenteur qui agit sur les instructions de M. Hertel de Rouville, le seigneur d\u2019alors. Il pr\u00e9para un rapport et un plan dont M. de Rouville voulut faire la base de ses r\u00e9clamations relatives \u00e0 la superficie du territoire compris dans la concession originale, et qu\u2019il pria la Couronne d\u2019admettre pour les fins du bornage qu\u2019il sollicitait.\nLa difficult\u00e9 peut se r\u00e9sumer comme suit:\nLa concession originale d\u00e9crit la seigneurie\nLe lac appelle Mitis avec une lieue de terre de profondeur tout autour d\u2019iceluy, \u00e0 titre de fief.\nBallantyne, en 1836, rapporta qu\u2019il existait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 trois nappes d\u2019eau reli\u00e9es par des bras de rivi\u00e8re; mais qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient toutes trois presque sur le m\u00eame niveau et qu\u2019elles devaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es plut\u00f4t comme un seul lac divis\u00e9 en trois sections qui, de tout temps, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 connues par les chasseurs et les indig\u00e8nes sous l\u2019appellation commune du lac M\u00e9tis.\nCe que la compagnie demande donc de d\u00e9terminer, c\u2019est la question de savoir si la d\u00e9signation dans ses titres couvre les trois nappes d\u2019eau conform\u00e9ment au rapport et au plan de Ballantyne, ou si elle n\u2019en comprend qu\u2019une seule; et, dans ce cas, laquelle doit lui \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e.\nIl est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que les trois sections dont il s\u2019agit sont maintenant connues sous les noms de Lac \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille, Lac \u00e0 la Croix et Lac M\u00e9tis, et que, par rapport au fleuve Saint-Laurent, le Lac \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille est le plus rapproch\u00e9 et le Lac M\u00e9tis est le plus \u00e9loign\u00e9; le Lac \u00e0 la Croix se trouvant, par cons\u00e9quent, au milieu. La diff\u00e9rence entre les superficies r\u00e9clam\u00e9es et conc\u00e9d\u00e9es de part et d\u2019autre constitue 52,477 acres et repr\u00e9sente donc une valeur consid\u00e9rable.\nA la fois parce que la compagnie est demanderesse, parce que le texte de son octroi (\u201cun. lac\u201d) est de prime abord oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9tention, parce qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Couronne, et, au besoin, par application de l\u2019article 1019 du code civil, il ne para\u00eet pas y avoir de doute que le fardeau de la preuve lui incombe.\nLe compagnie, dans sa p\u00e9tition, a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 toute la lign\u00e9e de ses titres depuis 1693; mais, \u00e0 l\u2019examen, il appara\u00eet tr\u00e8s clairement que l\u2019on doit se borner \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de trois \u00e9tapes seulement: la concession originale, la commutation de 1855 et le titre du sh\u00e9rif de 1875.\nIl semble que c\u2019est en r\u00e9trogradant de la derni\u00e8re jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re de ces \u00e9tapes que l\u2019on peut le plus avantageusement tirer une conclusion des faits et des nombreux documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis.\nLa compagnie p\u00e9titionnaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e sous le nom qu\u2019elle porte en 1920. Elle succ\u00e9dait \u00e0 une premi\u00e8re compagnie du m\u00eame nom incorpor\u00e9e en 1904. Le titre en vertu duquel elle d\u00e9tient actuellement la seigneurie du Lac M\u00e9tis est une vente qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie par la premi\u00e8re compagnie le 17 mai 1921.\nLa premi\u00e8re compagnie avait elle-m\u00eame acquis la seigneurie, le 29 ao\u00fbt 1878, d\u2019un monsieur George W. Bartholomew, lequel tenait son titre comme adjudicataire du sh\u00e9rif en vertu d\u2019un acte de vente en date du 6 avril 1875.\nL\u2019acte du sh\u00e9rif d\u00e9crit la seigneurie comme suit:\nAll that tract of land heretofore forming and known under the name of seigniory of Lake Metis, namely, the said Lake Metis, which discharges itself into the river of the same name (Metis), with one league of land in depth all around the said lake, being distant about twelve or fifteen leagues from the river St. Lawrence, lying within the county of Rimouski, province of Quebec, with all the islands and islets which may be found therein, with all rights belonging thereto, appurtenances and dependencies of any kind, the whole now in free and common succage, bounded on all sides by the waste lands of the Crown.\nCette description a \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9e identiquement dans les titres subs\u00e9quents; et c\u2019est donc celle qui se trouve dans la vente en vertu de laquelle la compagnie actuelle est devenue propri\u00e9taire. Il convient d\u2019ajouter que cette description est conforme \u00e0 celle du proc\u00e8s-verbal de saisie et de l\u2019avis de vente publi\u00e9 dans la Gazette Officielle.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le code de proc\u00e9dure alors en vigueur (articles 638 et 648), la saisie d\u2019un immeuble \u00e9tait constat\u00e9e par un proc\u00e8s-verbal contenant\nla description des immeubles saisis en indiquant la cit\u00e9, ville, village, paroisse ou township, ainsi que la rue, le rang ou la concession o\u00f9 ils sont situ\u00e9s, et le num\u00e9ro de l\u2019imtmeuble, s\u2019il existe un plan officiel de la localit\u00e9, sinon les tenants et aboutissants,\net l\u2019annonce dans la Gazette Officielle devait contenir \u00e9galement \u201cla d\u00e9signation de l\u2019immeuble\u201d de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on.\nIl ne s\u2019agit pas naturellement d\u2019envisager la d\u00e9signation, que le sh\u00e9rif a alors donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble qu\u2019il a saisi et vendu, au point de vue de l\u2019irrigularit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pouvait comporter. La Couronne ne se pr\u00e9vaut pas de cette insuffisance. Mais la comparaison entre la d\u00e9signation du sh\u00e9rif et la situation telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait alors connue des parties nous semble \u00eatre de la plus haute importance pour la d\u00e9cision que nous avons \u00e0 rendre.\nEn effet, d\u00e8s 1835, M. de Rouville avait soumis \u00e0 la Couronne ses pr\u00e9tentions bas\u00e9es sur le plan et le rapport de Ballantyne. Elles d\u00e9montrent que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque les droits du seigneur sur ce que nous appellerons les trois sections en litige n\u2019\u00e9taient pas reconnus. Or, ces pr\u00e9tentions ne furent pas alors accueillies. Sur r\u00e9ception de ce rapport et de ce plan, l\u2019arpenteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, M. Joseph Bouchette, fit rapport au gouverneur que l\u2019\u00e9loignement de la seigneurie ne permettait pas de contr\u00f4ler les donn\u00e9es fournies par Ballantyne et recommanda de diff\u00e9rer toute d\u00e9cision\nuntil it was the intention of the Government to settle that portion of the waste lands * * * provided the survey of Mr. Ballantyne on which it is (based shall have been found upon verification correct and satisfactory, and have been approved by His Majesty\u2019s Government.\nSur quoi le Secr\u00e9taire Civil \u00e9crivit, le 24 mars 1836, \u00e0 M. de Rouville\nthat His Excellency will authorize that report and plan (ceux de Ballantyne) to form part of the records of the Surveyor General\u2019s office but with the understanding that whenever His Majesty\u2019s Government shall see fit to lay out townships to be bounded by the seigniory of Mitis and that the verification of the survey of the lake shall become necessary to establish the boundaries of that seigniory legally\u2014you will be prepared to contribute the proportion of the expense to which you are liable by the law and usage of the province without reference to any disbursement which you may have made for the outline of the lake as laid down on Mr. Ballantyne\u2019s survey, which survey is not to be considered as conclusively settling the outline of the lake.\nCe n\u2019est que le 9 mars 1870 que M. Thomas Breen, arpenteur provincial, re\u00e7ut de l\u2019assistant commissaire des terres instruction de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019arpentage de la rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tis,\nthe above stated survey having been deemed expedient preliminarily to establishing the position and extent of the seigniory of Lake Mitis in connection with the delimitation of the divisional line of boundary between that seigniory and the adjacent lands of the Crown in rear of the projected township of Mass\u00e9.\nCes instructions recommandaient \u00e0 M. Breen de contr\u00f4ler l\u2019exactitude du rapport de Ballantyne et de v\u00e9rifier les variations de niveau des trois sections, ainsi que le cours des eaux dans les parties r\u00e9tr\u00e9cies par lesquelles ces trois sections communiquaient entre elles. On voit, par une lettre, en date du 23 octobre 1871, \u00e9crite par l\u2019assistant-commissaire des terres au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que cette mission fut confi\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Breen parce que M. G. W. Bartholomew avait demand\u00e9, par l\u2019entremise de son agent,\nque le d\u00e9partement des Terres de la Couronne vint \u00e0 confier au plus t\u00f4t \u00e0 un ou deux arpenteurs comp\u00e9tents, le soin d\u2019\u00e9tablir les limites entre ce territoire et les terres adjacentes du domaine public.\nM. Breen fit rapport:\nAyant trouv\u00e9 un courant tr\u00e8s fort dans la d\u00e9charge du lac de la premi\u00e8re section, ou Grand Lac M\u00e9tis, j\u2019en ai d\u2019abord fait un relev\u00e9 exact puis constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe r\u00e9ellement entre les points A et B sur le plan une diff\u00e9rence de niveau de huit pieds et demie (8\u00bd pieds) faisant de ce lac un lac tout particulier et ne laissant le nom de lac M\u00e9tis qu\u2019aux lacs de la Croix et de la P\u00eache \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille dont le niveau ne varie que de quelques pouces d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\nLa lettre de l\u2019assistant-commissaire, M. Tach\u00e9, \u00e0 laquelle il vient d\u2019\u00eatre fait allusion, est un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 complet de la situation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de 1871. Elle soumet toute la question au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral parce que le commissaire des terres d\u00e9sire obtenir une d\u00e9cision\nafin de pouvoir donner \u00e0 M. Gauvreau (agent de M. Bartholomew) une r\u00e9ponse claire et pr\u00e9cise sur la valeur des pr\u00e9tentions de M. Bartholomew.\nElle d\u00e9clare que, depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t aux archives du rapport et du plan Ballantyne\njusqu\u2019\u00e0 la demande de M. Gauvreau, il n\u2019est plus question au d\u00e9partement des Terres de la Couronne de la seigneurie du lac M\u00e9tis, et les cadastres pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les commissaires seigneuriaux n\u2019en font point mention.\nElle ajoute que M. Bartholomew est inform\u00e9 par son agent du r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations de M. Breen et que n\u00e9anmoins, dans une lettre adress\u00e9e, le 30 janvier 1871, \u00e0 l\u2019honorable commissaire des terres, il persiste \u00e0 demander que la superficie \u00e9tablie sur le rapport de Ballantyne lui soit reconnue. M. Tach\u00e9 signale les \u201cdonn\u00e9es gravement en erreur\u201d du rapport de Ballantyne, et dit qu\u2019il\ndevient n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer lequel de ces trois lacs doit \u00eatre reconnu comme \u00e9tant le lac M\u00e9tis proprement dit,\net qu\u2019il lui semble\nplus rationnel que le troisi\u00e8me, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 la source de la rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tis, sur un plan \u00e9lev\u00e9 et portant de plus le nom de grand lac M\u00e9tis, soit celui autour duquel la seigneurie devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e.\nNous ignorons si le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a rendu une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la suite du rapport que lui a fait alors M. Tach\u00e9. Le dossier ne le d\u00e9voile pas. Il reste acquis cependant que, d\u00e8s cette \u00e9poque, M. Bartholomew \u00e9tait en instances pour faire reconna\u00eetre des droits \u00e0 ce que nous continuerons d\u2019appeler les trois sections, et que non seulement le gouvernement refusait d\u2019admettre ses pr\u00e9tentions, mais, au contraire, soumettait que son titre devait se borner au grand lac M\u00e9tis, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 celle des trois nappes d\u2019eau qui \u00e9tait la plus \u00e9loign\u00e9e du fleuve Saint-Laurent.\nEn outre, le rapport de M. Breen et la lettre de M. Tach\u00e9 font voir que, d\u00e8s lors, les trois nappes d\u2019eau \u00e9taient connues comme trois lacs diff\u00e9rents, portant respectivement les noms de Grand Lac M\u00e9tis, Lac \u00e0 la Croix et Lac de la P\u00eache \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille. Cela est d\u2019ailleurs confirm\u00e9 par un monsieur Isra\u00ebl Fontaine, t\u00e9moin offert de la part de la compagnie, dont les souvenirs remontent au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1877, et qui parle m\u00eame d\u2019un quatri\u00e8me lac connu sous le nom de Tr\u00e9panier.\nD\u2019autre part, vers le 22 novembre 1868, le gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec avait conc\u00e9d\u00e9 aux auteurs de la p\u00e9titionnaire des licences pour l\u2019exploitation de deux limites \u00e0 bois dans le canton appel\u00e9 M\u00e9tis East; et, par leur description, ces limites incluaient tout le territoire situ\u00e9 de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tis, du lac \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille et d\u2019une partie du lac \u00e0 la Croix.\nDu 22 novembre 1868 au 6 avril 1875, date de la vente du sh\u00e9rif, les auteurs de la compagnie Price \u00e9taient en possession de ce territoire et y avaient pratiqu\u00e9 la coupe du bois en vertu de ces licences qu\u2019ils avaient obtenues de la province.\nAu moment de la saisie et de la vente du sh\u00e9rif, par cons\u00e9quent, ce dernier, en d\u00e9clarant lui-m\u00eame qu\u2019il saississait le territoire autour du lac M\u00e9tis, ne pouvait pas avoir en vue de saisir et de vendre et ne pouvait donner \u00e0 entendre au public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu\u2019il saisissait et vendait autre chose que le seul lac qui \u00e9tait alors connu sous ce nom, \u00e0 savoir celle des trois nappes d\u2019eau qui \u00e9tait la plus \u00e9loign\u00e9e du fleuve Saint-Laurent.\nEt Bartholomew, qui fut \u00e0 la fois le cr\u00e9ancier saisissant et l\u2019adjudicataire, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 du rapport de Breen et des pr\u00e9tentions de la Couronne et qui ne pouvait non plus ignorer l\u2019existence des licences octroy\u00e9es \u00e0 Price Bros., n\u2019a pu croire que son acquisition du sh\u00e9rif lui conf\u00e9rait des droits \u00e0 d\u2019autres lacs qu\u2019\u00e0 celui qui \u00e9tait alors connu sous le nom de Lac M\u00e9tis avec une lieue de terre de profondeur tout autour dudit lac. C\u2019est l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus normale que l\u2019on puisse donner au texte de la description dans le titre d\u2019adjudication et \u00e0 l\u2019intention de l\u2019adjudicataire, qui \u00e9tait alors parfaitement au courant de toute la situation. On ne peut pas supposer autrement que la Couronne et Price Bros eux-m\u00eames eussent laiss\u00e9 pratiquer une saisie et parfaire un d\u00e9cret dont l\u2019effet e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019adjudicataire la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur un territoire qui, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 m\u00eame, \u00e9tait depuis 1868 et a continu\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 1876 \u00e0 \u00eatre subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exercice des droits de coupe conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par les licences. Il convient d\u2019ajouter que Price Brothers, lorsqu\u2019ils achet\u00e8rent de Bartholomew, le 29 ao\u00fbt 1876, la seigneurie du lac M\u00e9tis dans les termes m\u00eames dont le sh\u00e9rif s\u2019\u00e9tait servi dans son acte d\u2019adjudication n\u2019ont pu comprendre, en vue des droits de licences qu\u2019ils exer\u00e7aient depuis 1868, qu\u2019ils acqu\u00e9raient un autre domaine que celui qui encerclait le grand lac M\u00e9tis et qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas couvert d\u00e9j\u00e0 par ces m\u00eames licences qu\u2019ils tenaient de la Couronne.\nBien entendu, nous ne voulons par l\u00e0 tenir aucune compte du fait que, post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 leur acquisition de Bartholomew, Price Brothers continu\u00e8rent de payer une rente de droit de coupe au gouvernement; car ils pr\u00e9tendent avoir\nfait ces paiements toujours sous la r\u00e9serve de leur prot\u00eat contenu dans une longue suite de correspondance,\nce que, dans son plaidoyer, la Couronne admet. Mais, de toute \u00e9vidence, ce prot\u00eat ne peut dater que de l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019acte de vente qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par Bartholomew. Il ne saurait avoir d\u2019effet pour la p\u00e9riode de temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9e depuis l\u2019octroi des licences, en 1868, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils devinssent eux-m\u00eames propri\u00e9taires.\nLa Couronne s\u2019appuie, dans son plaidoyer, sur l\u2019existence de ces licences, en vertu desquelles Price Brothers ont reconnu son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl nous para\u00eet que, dans toutes les circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 la vente du sh\u00e9rif, on ne saurait trouver une r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation que l\u2019adjudication \u00e0 Bartholomew n\u2019a comport\u00e9 que le Grand Lac M\u00e9tis et une lieue de terrain autour; de m\u00eame que, dans l\u2019intention des parties \u00e0 l\u2019acte de vente du 29 ao\u00fbt 1876, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits tels qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient alors connus, Price Brothers, les auteurs de la compagnie p\u00e9titionnaire, n\u2019ont pu acqu\u00e9rir de Bartholomew un terrain plus \u00e9tendu.\nLa description, aussi claire et aussi pr\u00e9cise que possible, de l\u2019immeuble saisi et vendu judiciairement, est une condition imperative de la loi. Le code fixe les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de cette description. Il l\u2019exige non seulement pour les parties imm\u00e9diatement int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, le saisissant et le saisi, dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal du sh\u00e9rif; mais pour l\u2019adjudicataire, dans l\u2019acte de vente; et pour le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, dans l\u2019avis qui annonce cette vente.\nSans doute, dans le cas qui nous occupe, le sh\u00e9rif commence par les termes suivants: Toute cette \u00e9tendue de terre ci-devant formant et connue sous le nom de la seigneurie du Lac M\u00e9tis;\nmais ensuite il pr\u00e9cise ce qu\u2019il entend dire par l\u00e0:\nsavoir: ledit lac M\u00e9tis qui se d\u00e9charge dans la rivi\u00e8re du m\u00eame nom, avec une lieue de terre de profondeur tout autour dudit lac, qui est \u00e9loign\u00e9 de douze \u00e0 quinze lieues environ du fleuve St. Laurent.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 une d\u00e9finition de la seigneurie adress\u00e9e au public dans un avis et dans des documents officiels, et destin\u00e9e \u00e0 lui d\u00e9crire la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 saisie d\u2019apr\u00e8s les informations qu\u2019on poss\u00e9dait en 1875. Cette d\u00e9finition devient encore plus importante du fait qu\u2019elle est fournie au nom de ce m\u00eame M. Bartholomew, qui est le cr\u00e9ancier saisissant et qui deviendra l\u2019adjudicataire, puis l\u2019auteur de Price Bros.\nOr, le rapport de Breen de 1870 et le t\u00e9moignage de Fontaine \u00e9tablissent qu\u2019en 1875, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la commune renomm\u00e9e et pour le public tout autant que pour le d\u00e9partement des Terres, \u201cledit lac M\u00e9tis\u201d indiquait le lac le plus au sud, et les deux autres lacs \u00e9taient connus par d\u2019autres noms. On savait \u00e9galement que la distance de douze \u00e0 quinze lieues du fleuve ne pouvait s\u2019appliquer qu\u2019au seul lac sup\u00e9rieur, et que les deux autres ne concordaient pas avec cette d\u00e9signation.\nLe langage du proc\u00e8s-verbal de saisie, de l\u2019annonce de vente et du titre de l\u2019adjudication, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des connaissances acquises d\u00e8s 1875 et d\u2019apr\u00e8s le sens qu\u2019il comportait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, d\u00e9limitait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 une lieue de terre de profondeur autour du seul lac qui \u00e9tait alors d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans le public sous le nom de M\u00e9tis.\nEt il semblerait qu\u2019on ne peut l\u00e9galement soutenir une autre pr\u00e9tention; car si l\u2019avis public de saisie et de vente avait \u00e9tendu la description de la seigneurie au del\u00e0 du seul lac du sud et du territoire circonvoisin, il est logique de conclure que la Couronne, qui r\u00e9clamait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et Price Brothers, qui en \u00e9taient en possession comme d\u00e9tenteurs de licence, n\u2019auraient pas manqu\u00e9 de faire opposition.\nLes limites \u00e0 bois sur lesquelles la Couronne avait octroy\u00e9 le droit de coupe \u00e0 Price Bros. sont minutieusement d\u00e9crites dans les octrois de 1868. Elles couvrent tout le territoire du Lac \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille et partie du Lac \u00e0 la Croix, de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la Rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tis, et y sont cat\u00e9goriquement indiqu\u00e9es comme suit:\nbeing bounded by the west and south outline of the seigniory of Metis aforesaid, being at the distance of one french league from the lower end of Upper Lake Metis dans la premi\u00e8re; et comme suit dans la seconde:\nThe northerly outline of the seigniory of Metis Lake aforesaid being at a distance of one french league from the lower end of the upper Lake Metis.\nCes d\u00e9signations circonscrivent la seigneurie \u00e0 une lieue de profondeur autour du seul lac sup\u00e9rieur. Le r\u00e9sidu du territoire, qui fait maintenant l\u2019objet de la p\u00e9tition de droit, \u00e9tait donc alors en la possession de Price Brothers pour le compte de la Couronne et sans aucune objection de la part du seigneur. On ne peut assumer que le sh\u00e9rif aurait saisi et vendu super non possidente. La r\u00e8gle veut qu\u2019il ait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et qu\u2019il se soit confin\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il a trouv\u00e9 en la possession du d\u00e9biteur.\nOn est en droit de tirer de tous ces faits l\u2019argument que, en 1876, le vendeur, Bartholomew, et les acheteurs, Price Bros., n\u2019ont pu beaucoup se m\u00e9prendre sur la port\u00e9e du titre qui faisait l\u2019objet de leur n\u00e9gociation. Et il n\u2019est pas facile de comprendre comment Price Brothers, les auteurs des p\u00e9titionnaires, ont pu penser qu\u2019ils acqu\u00e9raient de Bartholomew le territoire autour des lacs \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille et \u00e0 la Croix (pour partie), lorsque, depuis 1868, ils reconnaissaient pour ce m\u00eame territoire le domaine sup\u00e9rieur de la Couronne dans des octrois de licences de coupe d\u00e9limitant la seigneurie d\u2019une fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise et formelle.\nAssumons cependant que (malgr\u00e9 le sens que les circonstances, connues en 1875, imposaient au texte de la description telle qu\u2019on la trouve dans la vente du sh\u00e9rif), on doive quand m\u00eame, au lieu de l\u2019envisager comme un seul tout, en d\u00e9tacher les mots:\nToute cette \u00e9tendue de terre ci-devant formant et connue sous le nom de seigneurie du Lac M\u00e9tis.\nAssumons qu\u2019il faille donner effet \u00e0 cette d\u00e9signation vague et ill\u00e9gale, ind\u00e9pendamment du second membre de la phrase qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que nous avons dit plus haut, a pour but d\u2019en d\u00e9finir et d\u2019en pr\u00e9ciser la premi\u00e8re partie, et de la rendre plus conforme \u00e0 la loi. Acceptons, pour les besoins de l\u2019argument, qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une cession de toute la seigneurie quelle qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt, et remontons donc \u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape: la commutation de 1855.\nD\u2019accord avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, nous croyons que les lettres patentes alors \u00e9mises n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019autre but que de changer, conform\u00e9ment au statut imp\u00e9rial de 1822 (3 Geo. IV, c. 119), la tenure f\u00e9odale en celle de franc et commun saccage. On y chercherait vainement une d\u00e9claration expresse que la Couronne et le seigneur ont entendu par l\u00e0 r\u00e9gler les questions qui \u00e9taient rest\u00e9es en suspens en 1835. Il est impossible d'y voir la moindre intention d'accepter les pr\u00e9tentions remises dans le rapport de Ballantyne.\nEn 1855, la Couronne n'avait pas encore fait contr\u00f4ler l'exactitude de ce rapport. Cela n'est venu qu'en 1870, lors des instructions donn\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Breen. La correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9 alors entre le d\u00e9partement des Terres et M. Bartholomew le d\u00e9montre.\nCes lettres patentes, il est vrai, modifient la description du lac autour duquel s'\u00e9tend la seigneurie en en fixant la distance a \" about ten or eleven leagues from the said river Saint-Lawrence \"; mais en l'absence d'aucun \u00e9claircissement\nsur le motif de cette modification, on ne saurait en tirer une conclusion satisfaisante.\nCette diminution de distance ne se retrouve pas dans les actes subs\u00e9quents. La vente du sh\u00e9rif et celles qui ont suivi conservent la distance indiqu\u00e9e dans la concession originale. A aucun moment, les propri\u00e9taires successifs de la seigneurie n'ont pr\u00e9tendu que les lettres patentes de 1855 avaient d\u00e9fini leurs droits. Toute leur conduite incline dans le sens contraire. Ce n'est pas en s'appuyant sur ces lettres patentes, mais en se r\u00e9clamant du plan de Ballantyne que M. Bartholomew s'est adresse au Commissaire des Terres, en 1871. Et la p\u00e9tition de droit elle-m\u00eame n'invoque pas ces lettres patentes comme base de ses revendications. Au contraire, elle affirme d'un bout \u00e0 l'autre que les territoires respectifs de la seigneurie et du domaine de la Couronne n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9limit\u00e9s.\nLa commutation de 1855 ne peut donc aider \u00e0 la solution que nous cherchons.\nIl nous reste a consid\u00e9rer la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape et \u00e0 nous reporter \u00e0 l'acte de concession originale.\nII se lit:\nConc\u00e9dons par ces pr6sentes, en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9. Le lac appelle M\u00e9tis, avec une lieue de terre de profondeur tout autour d'iceluy, \u00e0 titre de fief.\nCe texte n'est pas ambigu et it n'indique qu'un seul lac. Mais la pr\u00e9tention de la compagnie p\u00e9titionnaire est que, en 1693, ce nom s'\u00e9tendait \u00e0 ce que Ballantyne a appel\u00e9 les trois sections. En plus, on fait remarquer que le pr\u00e9ambule de l'acte de 1925 concession, qui r\u00e9cite la requ\u00eate d'Augustin Rouer, parle d'un lac appelle M\u00e9tis qui se d\u00e9charge dans une rivi\u00e8re du mesme nom. L'on ajoute que le lac sup\u00e9rieur ou plus au sud (qui re\u00e7oit dans le rapport de M. Breen le nom de Grand Lac M\u00e9tis) ne se d\u00e9charge pas apparemment dans la rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tis et que l'indication attribu\u00e9e a la requ\u00eate ne peut donc s'appliquer \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re section.\nLa preuve ne permet pas d'admettre les pr\u00e9tentions de la compagnie p\u00e9titionnaire. Les rapports de MM. Joncas et Johnston, et les explications verbales qu'ils y ont ajout\u00e9es au tours de leur t\u00e9moignage, \u00e9tablissent que \" l\u2019\u00e9tat des lieux au point de vue topographique \" \u00e9tait lors de la concession originale, sensiblement le m\u00eame que celui de l'\u00e9poque actuelle. Il y avait, alors comme aujourd'hui, trois nappes d'eau a niveaux diff\u00e9rents, dont chacune correspondait s\u00e9par\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que le langage attribue au mot \" lac \". La d\u00e9finition lexicologique d'un lac et sa marque caract\u00e9ristique proviennent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la fixit\u00e9 de son niveau. A proprement parler, le terme \" un lac \" ou \" ledit lac \" peut s'appliquer a chacune des trois sections, mais ne peut signifier les trois sections \u00e0 la fois.\nL'indication suppl\u00e9mentaire du pr\u00e9ambule: \" qui se d\u00e9charge dans une rivi\u00e8re du m\u00eame nom \", quand on l'examine de pr\u00e8s, ne complique pas vraiment la situation. Les informations qui nous sont fournies par le dossier ne permettent pas de dire que l'une ou l'autre des \u00e9tendues d'eau avait re\u00e7u un nom ant\u00e9rieurement a la concession; et il est tout aussi logique d'en d\u00e9duire que le nom M\u00e9tis aurait pu alors s'appliquer \u00e0 la section nord autant qu'a la section sud. Si l'on tient absolument \u00e0 ce que la rivi\u00e8re ne commence qu'a\nla d\u00e9charge de la section nord, ce serait alors cette section qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9e sous le nom de lac M\u00e9tis, mais il n'y a pas de difficult\u00e9 insurmontable \u00e0 penser que, au contraire, la rivi\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame sous le nom de M\u00e9tis \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme remontant jusqu'a la d\u00e9charge de la section sud.\nEn effet, les deux bras qui relient les trois sections constituent, dans la v\u00e9ritable acception du mot, une rivi\u00e8re. Les exemples sont fr\u00e9quents dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec (pour ne pas parler d'ailleurs) de fleuves ou de rivi\u00e8res qui, \u00e0 certains endroits, \u00e9largissent leurs rives en nappes d'eau auxquelles on a donn\u00e9 le nom de lacs, sans que pour cela ces fleuves ou ces rivi\u00e8res cessent de former une unit\u00e9 conservant le m\u00eame nom en de\u00e7\u00e0 et au del\u00e0 de ces lacs. Nous ne voyons pas d\u2019objection s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 dire que la rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tis commen\u00e7ait alors et constitue encore aujourd\u2019hui tout le cours d\u2019eau qui s\u2019\u00e9tend de la d\u00e9charge de la section sud jusqu\u2019au fleuve Saint-Laurent et qu\u2019elle est entrecoup\u00e9e, en deux ou peut-\u00eatre trois endroits distincts, par les lacs Tr\u00e9panier, \u00e0 la Croix et \u00e0 l\u2019Anguille. Il n\u2019y a rien dans la preuve qui impose une conclusion contraire et qui sugg\u00e8re qu\u2019on a donn\u00e9 un nom diff\u00e9rent aux deux bras de rivi\u00e8re reliant ces deux ou trois lacs.\nEn plus, le pr\u00e9ambule contient cette autre d\u00e9claration que le lac dont il s\u2019agit\nest esloign\u00e9 d\u2019environ douze ou quinze lieues du fleuve St-Laurent.\nLa section sud est celle qui le plus exactement concorde avec cette d\u00e9signation.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que les termes m\u00eames de la concession, en donnant aux mots leur sens usuel, correspondent mieux avec le lac du sud et semblent exclure les deux autres sections ou lacs. On peut douter, dans les circonstances, qu\u2019il f\u00fbt loisible de chercher \u00e0 \u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e naturelle de ces termes pour leur faire inclure trois lacs, alors que le texte n\u2019en mentionne qu\u2019un et que les deux autres ne remplissent pas les conditions de la description.\nIl eut fallu, semble-t-il, une preuve tr\u00e8s explicite pour faire adopter une interpr\u00e9tation aussi contraire aux mots employ\u00e9s.\nOn ne saurait trouver cette preuve dans les seuls plans ou cartes g\u00e9ographiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits et qui vont de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1755 \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1830. Sans discuter pour l\u2019instant la valeur probante de ces plans, il appara\u00eet \u00e0 leur face m\u00eame qu\u2019ils ne pr\u00e9tendent en aucune fa\u00e7on repr\u00e9senter la r\u00e9gion dont il s\u2019agit. Ce sont plut\u00f4t des compilations sans caract\u00e8re de pr\u00e9cision. Quelques-uns d\u2019ailleurs se chargent d\u2019eux m\u00eames de nous avertir qu\u2019il ne faut pas y chercher l\u2019exactitude. Ils portent les l\u00e9gendes suivantes:\nThese lakes are laid down not from actual survey, but from information of travellers. (ou) These lakes are described from reports, not having been surveyed.\nIl n\u2019est pas m\u00eame certain qu\u2019on puisse leur accorder le poids restreint d\u2019une preuve de commune renomm\u00e9e: car il est aussi possible que le lac M\u00e9tis y ait \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme un seul lac \u00e0 raison m\u00eame de la mention qui est faite dans la concession du roi de France. Les pr\u00e9tentions \u00e9mises dans la p\u00e9tition de droit apparaissent pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans le rapport de Ballantyne, en 1835, soit: cent quarante-deux ans apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9mission du titre du fief. Ce rapport ne peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de document scientifique, quoiqu\u2019il soit pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par un arpenteur-g\u00e9om\u00e8tre. Toute la partie qui y concerne la question qui nous occupe est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en la forme argumentative et a pour but \u00e9vident de soumettre une cause et d\u2019appuyer une r\u00e9clamation.

Judgment of the Exchequer Court of. Canada, Nova Scotia Admiralty District (Mellish L.J.A.), holding defendant steamship liable for damages for collision between it and plaintiffs\u2019 schooner, affirmed.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 schooner held, in the circumstances, not to have been a vessel \u201cnot being under command, or unable to manoeuvre\u201d within art.\n15 (e) of the Regulations, and not to have erred in her signals. Semble, a sailing vessel lying to in a fog, but having some of her\nsails up, is \u201cunder way,\u201d and is governed by art. 15 (c) (Burrows V. Gower, 119 Fed. Rep. 616).\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Nova Scotia Admiralty District (Mellish L.J.A.) given 18th June, 1925, holding the defendant steamship Clackamas solely responsible for a collision between it and the plaintiffs\u2019 schooner Cape d\u2019Or, and giving judgment for the plaintiffs for damages to be assessed.\nC. J. Burchell K.C. for appellant.\nW. C. Macdonald K.C. for respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The schooner Cape d\u2019Or, while on a voyage from Turk\u2019s Island to La Have with a cargo of salt, was sunk off the south coast of Nova Scotia, about ten miles from La Have Head, in collision with the ss. Clackamas, which was making her way from Newport News to Halifax, laden with a cargo of coal. This happened in the afternoon of 30th April, 1925, at about 4.30 o\u2019clock. There was a thick fog and strong easterly breeze. At noon on the day of the accident the schooner had come within about five miles of the coast, standing in by the wind about N.N.E., when, finding it too foggy to attempt to go closer or to enter the harbour, she wore or came about and hove to, heading off shore, waiting for the weather to clear. The fog increased during the afternoon; the wind hauled somewhat to the southward; at the time of the collision it was about E.S.E., and the schooner, as described, was hove to on the port tack, heading about south, and making three or perhaps four points of leeway; speed estimated at about three-quarters of a knot.\nThe course of the steamship is given as N. 80 E.; the sea was quite heavy, and at times broke over the ship\u2019s bow; her speed as found was four miles or more through the water. Both vessels were sounding the prescribed fog signals at the proper intervals; but, according to the testimony of the steamship\u2019s witnesses, the schooner\u2019s horn was not heard on board the steamship until the vessels were very close to each other. The steamship was heavily laden and down by the head; her lookout was stationed on the (bridge. The second mate who was in charge of the watch, when asked if a lookout could not have been placed on the bow, answered:\nNot with safety. The sea was breaking over and might have washed him off his feet and washed him overboard. There is no protection on the boat.\nThe distance from bridge to stem is more than 100 feel. James Poole, able seaman, who says he is a certified quarter-master, and who came on duty with the watch at four o\u2019clock, was charged with the duty of keeping the lookout. He tells us that he was stationed\nright on the port side of the bridge, the wing of the bridge on the port side.\nThe effect of his evidence is that he heard from the schooner, first, \u201cone blast close to our port bow, close to, ahead.\u201d This he reported to the officer of the watch. Asked what came next, he said:\nThere were two blasts in succession, but not directly after\u2014probably several seconds; probably minutes\u2014I could not be sure about that, and then there was a vessel (the schooner) hove in sight.\nIn cross-examination he said that, after reporting the one blast, he reported the two blasts; and, in answer to the court, he said, regarding the orders from the bridge, that, following the first blast, the order was port,\nand then, when the next blast was heard at the longer interval, it was hard aport, and, as soon as the second blast and the second signal was given, it was hard aport again.\nThe distance at which the vessels became visible to each other is variously estimated at from 600 feet to 300 feet; the master of the schooner considers that the collision took place perhaps two minutes from the time he saw the loom of the steamship; the mate says that about three minutes elapsed between the time when he saw the steamer break through the fog and the actual impact; Dunsworth, the only member of the crew who survived, can give no estimate, either of distance or of time. The master of the steamship and his officer of the watch say that the interval was about one minute. These are, of course, mere estimates or impressions of distance and of time, and were not intended to be exact, but they are useful to show, and indeed make it evident, that the interval of vision was very brief; moreover, it is noteworthy, and not without significance, that, in the judgment of the officers of the schooner, who were aware of the approach of the steamship some ten minutes before they could see her, and were therefore alert to the situation, the limit of visibility was appreciably greater than that given by the officer of the steamship\u2019s watch.\nThere was no change of course or speed by the schooner; on the steamship there were the port and hard aport movements of the wheel, to which the ship is said to have responded two points, and the reduction of speed consequent upon the execution of reverse orders.\nHere I may observe, although my decision is not affected by the doubt which I entertain, that I am by no means convinced that the port and hard aport orders which were given by the officer of the watch were compatible with that careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions which the regulations require; he realized that he was in thick fog; he realized also, if alive to his duty, that he was in a locality where vessels were not unlikely to be met, and that the transmission of signals was unreliable, owing to natural caprice and the noises of the elements and of his own ship; suddenly there was reported by his lookout, and he heard, one blast from the fog horn of a sailing vessel close to ahead on his port bow; no vessel could be seen; his speed against wind and sea was at the time at least between four and five knots. Was he, in these circumstances, reasonably entitled to assume that the sailing vessel was going away from him on the starboard tack to the northward, when in fact she was standing to the southward across his bow, and so to put the steamship hard aport, with the object of increasing the intervening distance; or was it not rather the part of prudence and good seamanship to stop and make sure of the position and course of the signalling vessel before the execution of any man\u0153uvre, especially one which in the result served to aggravate, if not to cause, the collision?\nThe master of the steamship testifies that previously to the first dog watch he had been on the bridge practically all of the afternoon, but that when the watch was changed at four o\u2019clock, he went to the chart room, which is directly under the wheel house, and is reached by a stairway of nine steps leading down from the bridge. What happened is tersely described by the second mate as follows:\nQ. The fog was thick?\u2014A. Yes, fog, quite thick at the time.\nQ. Will you tell us just what happened in connection with the collision, the first thing you heard, and all about it?\u2014A. The first thing I heard one blast of a horn, just at the same instant the lookout man reported one blast of a horn. I immediately went in the wheel house and gave the order hard aport. The captain rushed up and grabbed the telegraph and started to put it on for full speed astern. Just as the words were out of my mouth, the vessel appeared out of the fog, a little on the port bow, not much more than the length of our own ship (269 feet) from us. I stayed on the bridge until we came together, and then I left the bridge, immediately to get the lifeboat out.\nQ. How long elapsed between the time you heard this one blast of the horn and the actual collision?\u2014A. About a minute.\nThe learned trial judge found no fault on the part of the schooner.\nThe steamship was proceeding in thick fog in the track of the coastwise traffic; seaward only a few mules from La Have and Lunenburg, which are ports of considerable resort; prevented by her structure and equipment, or lack of equipment, and the breaking of the sea over the forecastle head, from placing a lookout aloft or within 100 feet of her bow. In these circumstances prudence and due regard to the existing conditions required very cautious navigation; the master of the schooner testifies that other steamers were in the immediate vicinity; it is not unreasonable therefore to hold that the speed of the steamship should have been so regulated as, at least, to enable her to avoid another vessel which it was her duty to avoid. The fact that she not only came into collision with such a vessel, but also with such force as to cause that vessel immediately to sink, is very suggestive of excessive speed or of deficient lookout by the steamship, or perhaps of both; and, when these faults are found against her at the trial, the appellants must, in order to succeed upon the facts, demonstrate very clearly that the findings are against the evidence. This I think they failed to do.\nThe appellants contend that the collision was the result of inevitable accident, but the learned trial judge was not satisfied with the lookout which was kept on the steamer, and moreover, he considered that in the circumstances of the case her speed was excessive. He says, very justly, that the requisite speed, which, according to the regulations, must be \u201cmoderate,\u201d should be determined relatively, having regard to the attendant conditions, and he finds that the steamship was going too fast if, by reason of her speed in the fog, she \u201cwas unable to avoid a collision with the vessel from which she was bound to keep clear, and the risk of whose proximity she would reasonably be assumed to anticipate under existing conditions\u201d. No doubt each case must depend upon its own facts, but in this general conclusion the learned judge follows a rule which has frequently been enunciated and is well established by authority, The Resolution[1], The Campania[2], a decision of Gorrell Barnes J., which was reviewed and upheld by the Court of Appeal, in which the facts of the case and the authorities are carefully reviewed; reference is made to the fact that in some cases four miles an hour, and in one case three and a half miles an hour, were held to be an improper rate of speed, and it is there laid down as a general rule that\nspeed such that another vessel cannot be avoided after being seen is excessive.\nThe Oceanic[3] was held to be at fault by the House of Lords in a case which bears her name, because\nshe was going at a speed which rendered it impossible to stop within the limit of observation,\nand in that case Lord Halsbury observes that:\nA good deal depends in each case upon the facts and circumstances as they are proved, and the President of the Admiralty Court had an opportunity of judging the evidence of the different witnesses in a way which we have not. So far as the judgment is affected by the particular facts put in proof I must accept what he has found, but, of course, a great deal turns, not upon any conflict of testimony, but upon the inferences which are to be drawn from facts which hardly appear to be disputed on either side. Now the rule appears to me to be a very intelligible and commonsense one to avoid danger to vessels in the navigation of the seas, and the question what is or is not a moderate speed in a fog must depend in a great measure whether the fog is slight or dense, and whether there is an opportunity of seeing the near approach of a ship so as to know what can be done or ought to be done by nautical skill to avoid collision. Apart from any rule, one would think that where it was known that two bodies were approaching, and that there was no absolute means of knowing the direction in which they were coming and the danger which was to be avoided, the commonsense thing would be to stop until the direction was ascertained, and also whether it was possible to avoid the serious danger which might arise.\nIn The Counsellor[4], Bargrave Deane J. states the rule thus: I think a very fair rule to make is this, and it is one which has been suggested to me by one of the Elder Brethren: You ought not to go so fast in a fog that you cannot pull up within the distance that you can see. If you cannot see more than 400 feet you ought to be going at such a speed that you can pull up. If you are going in a fog at such a speed that you cannot pull up in time if anything requires you to pull up, you are going too fast. If you cannot retain steerage way at such . a speed, then you should manage by alternately stopping and putting \u2018 the engines ahead.\nThe same rule is applied in the District Court of the United States, The Normandie[5], and in the Circuit Court, The Raleigh[6], where it is said with reference to the ship:\nit is enough to establish her liability that she was proceeding at a speed under which she could not, by any degree of promptitude and skill, avoid a collision by reversing her engines within the distance at which she could discover approaching or stationary vessels. The rule is that such speed only is lawful or moderate speed in a fog as will permit a steamer seasonably and effectually to avoid a collision by slacking speed, or by stopping and reversing, within the distance at which another vessel can be seen. If this rule is a severe one, and practically requires a steamship to come to a stop, and remain stopped, when navigating a river having an extensive commerce, or in a crowded harbour, it is too well established to be disregarded.\nTo the same effect is the decision of the Circuit Court in The Bolivia[7], where the ship was held to blame because\nunder the existing state of the fog, and exercising the best vigilance, she could not discover another vessel more than 300 or 400 feet away, yet maintained such a speed that, after reversing, her headway through the water could not be stopped within three times that distance. The locality was one frequented by numerous vessels in the coasting trade, and lay in one of the paths of the ocean traffic between Europe and the principal commercial port of this country.\nThere is some contradiction or confusion as between the lookout and the officer of the steamship\u2019s watch; they agree that the first signal heard from the schooner was a single blast, which would indicate that the schooner was on the starboard tack, and it was presumably for this reason that the officer immediately gave the orders, \u201cport\u201d and \u201chard aport\u201d; but the officer, according to his evidence, did not hear the two blasts which the lookout says he heard and reported, following the single blast, before the schooner, came into sight through the fog. The steamship was sounding her prolonged blast regularly, and there was, of course, considerable noise due to the wind, and the breaking of the seas, which may have interfered with the reception and report of the signals. It is not and, having regard to the evidence and findings, cannot be denied that the schooner was at intervals sounding two blasts upon her fog horn, the efficiency of which is not in question; but it is a ground of the appeal that the master of the schooner erred in moving the schooner\u2019s fog horn, after he first heard the steamship\u2019s signal, from the gallant forecastle deck to the lazarette hatch, abaft the deck house, where the captain himself took charge of the horn and worked it up to the time of the collision. This was done, as the captain explains, in order that the signals, might be heard better by the oncoming ship which seemed to be directly abeam. He says\nhe was of the opinion it would be heard better by the approaching ship from a position aft, clear of all sails, different wind currents.\nUpon this there is no evidence in conflict with the opinion so expressed.\nIt is said, however, that the schooner\u2019s blasts were not sounded at the intervals prescribed by the regulations relating to sound signals for fog. A sailing vessel under way should sound, at intervals of not more than one minute, when on the port tack, two blasts in succession. It was not suggested at the trial that two blasts in succession were not the appropriate signals; the master of the schooner testified that he gave these blasts at intervals of about one minute, and he was not asked for anything more definite than this answer; it was not suggested to him that the interval was either too long or too short; he had been personally sounding the fog horn aft for about ten minutes before the collision; nevertheless an objection is now taken by reason of the following evidence, given by the officer of the watch in his direct examination:\u2014\nQ. Had your course remained the same from the time you first heard the signals until the collision?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Were your signals being sounded?\u2014A. Yes, continuously, with the proper intervals between.\nQ. Remember how many signals there were given?\u2014A. Two blasts every 1\u00bd minutes.\nAnd, although the officer was not cross-examined upon his answer, \u201ctwo blasts every one and one-half minutes,\u201d it is urged upon the appeal that the schooner did not comply with the regulation which requires the signals to be given, in the words of the rule, \u201cat intervals of not more than one minute.\u201d I do not consider, however, in view of the master\u2019s testimony, the course of the trial as explained, and the questions which were there in controversy, that the learned judge\u2019s finding can foe disturbed.\nFinally, it is submitted by the appellant\u2019s factum, although the point was neither discussed nor mentioned at the hearing of the appeal, nor, so far as appears, at the trial, that the schooner was\na vessel under way which was unable to get out of the way of an approaching vessel, through not being under command, or unable to manoeuvre as required by these rules,\nwithin the meaning of art. 15 (e), rather than \u201ca sailing vessel under way,\u201d within the meaning of art. 15 (c) of the regulations, and therefore that she erred in giving two blasts in succession; it is said that the signal ought to have been one prolonged blast, followed by two short blasts. But, in my view, although the schooner was in the circumstances justified in not attempting to execute any manoeuvre in order to avoid the steamship, and, although, having regard to the wind and sea and set of her sails, and the course and bearing of the steamship, it may not have been possible for the schooner, after the position of the steamship was discovered, to keep out of the way by the execution of any manoeuvre on her part, nevertheless she cannot accurately be described as a vessel not under command or unable to man\u0153uvre. Indeed her master says that she could have manoeuvred, although not usefully, having regard to the conditions to which I have referred, and the second mate of the steamship, the officer in charge, testifies in direct examination that the proper signal for a schooner hove to on the port tack is two blasts; therefore he was not misled by the signals actually given. I observe moreover that it was held in the United States District Court in Burrows v. Gower[8], that a sailing vessel lying to in a fog, but having some of her sails up, is \u201cunder way,\u201d and is governed by art. 15 (c), and that therefore, when on the starboard tack, the proper fog signal is one blast, adopting the application of the article as expounded by Marsden on Collisions, see 8th ed., p. 345.\nI conclude, applying the words of Lord Halsbury in the case of The Oceanic[9], that the local judge in Admiralty\nhad an opportunity of judging the evidence of the different witnesses in a way which we have not. So far as the judgment is affected by the particular facts put in proof, I must accept what he has found, but of course a great deal turns, not upon any conflict of testimony, but upon the inferences which are to be drawn from facts which hardly appear to be disputed on either side.\nNeither the findings nor the inferences are, in my opinion, unjust, and I would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

L.R. 113) was affirmed (Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting), sustaining plaintiff\u2019s right to be credited in the Canadian equivalent of New York funds, according to the rate of exchange prevailing on the dates when the moneys were received in the transactions, in arriving at the profit for which defendant, his broker, was accountable to him on transactions carried out by defendant\u2019s correspondents in New York. Barthelmes v. Bickell (62 Can. S.C.R. 599) applied.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that upon the facts there was an understanding or implied agreement that all accounts were to be settled in Canadian funds was negatived by the court on the evidence, Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming in part the judgment of Mowat J. in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff, who resided in Toronto, Ontario, employed the defendant broker in Toronto, as his broker in respect of certain purchases and sales which were carried out on the New York Cotton Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. The defendant had an arrangement with its New York correspondents under which the latter made purchases and sales on the Exchanges upon the defendant\u2019s instructions. The correspondents had an account in a bank in Toronto and moneys payable by the defendant were deposited to the credit of the correspondents in this account, while moneys payable to the defendant by the correspondents were paid to them by cheques drawn upon it. The correspondents and defendant accepted payments reciprocally in Canadian funds, the understanding being that no charge was to be made for exchange in respect of any of such payments. The plaintiff did not know of this arrangement. During the period in which the transactions in question were carried out Canadian funds were at a discount in New York. The transactions resulted in a profit to the plaintiff. He claimed that in arriving at the profit for which the defendant was accountable to him as his agent he was entitled to be credited in terms of New York funds for the moneys received in respect of the transactions, in other words, that he was entitled to be credited in Toronto in respect of any New York funds so received in their equivalent in Canadian funds, according to the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of receipt, and that debits, of course, should be dealt with on a like principle. The defendant contended that the facts established an understanding and agreement between the parties that all accounts between them were to be settled in Canadian funds, and that the facts differentiated the case from that of Barthelmes v. Bickell[2].\nW.N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nA.G. Slaght K.C. and F.J. Hughes for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C., Mignault and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN, C.J.C.\u2014The material facts of this case sufficiently appear in the judgments of the learned trial judge and of the Appellate Divisional Court[3].\nThe question before us is purely one of fact\u2014whether the circumstances in evidence warrant the inference of an implicit agreement by the respondent that the defendant, admittedly his broker, should, in addition to its regular commission and charges for the transactions carried on for him, be allowed to retain for its own benefit, or for that of its sub\u2011agents, out of the profits made on sales of commodities for the respondent, a sum equal to the exchange difference between Canadian and United States funds at the dates of such sales. That the respondent is entitled to the profit of the exchange in the absence of a special agreement, or a custom binding on him, entitling the appellant to retain these moneys, is concluded by the authority of the decision of this court in Barthelmes v. Bickell2, if, indeed, authority for anything so elementary in the law of fiduciaries be needed. No such custom was alleged or proved. That no such agreement was explicitly made is admitted. The learned trial judge and the Appellate Divisional Court affirming him have held that the circumstances in evidence do not justify an inference of assent by the respondent to such an arrangement.\nAny successful attempt to affect the respondent\u2019s rights by the custom or arrangement which is said to have obtained between the appellant and its New York correspondents, but was unknown to the respondent, is also precluded by the authority referred to. Other matters relied upon to show that the respondent had knowledge during the currency of the transactions of the appellant\u2019s intention to assert the right to retain the moneys in question, such as the rendering of a few statements showing credits to him at par for Canadian funds deposited by him with it, and balances apparently arrived at on the basis of treating Canadian and United States funds as of equal value, fall short of establishing such an appreciation by him of the appellant\u2019s assertion of a claim in derogation of a right which the law ordinarily imputes to a principal as would be essential to an inference of assent by him to forego that right. When the respondent demanded the moneys in question from the appellant his right thereto was not challenged on the ground of any arrangement to the contrary express or implied. Acquiescence on his part in the appellant\u2019s retention of them was not even suggested. The arrangement between the appellant and its New York correspondents was then communicated to him, which he was told prevented the appellant recovering the sum in question from its correspondents, and it was suggested that the adjustment of the matter should be deferred until the respondent\u2019s brother should come to Toronto, as he \u201cknew the way cotton was handled and traded in\u201d. The evidence discloses that when Mr. A.W. Cutten came he did not agree with the appellant\u2019s view of its rights in the matter.\nWe have carefully considered all the evidence. No useful purpose would be served by attempting to review it. Not only are we satisfied that it does not disclose the case of manifest error requisite to entitle the appellant to a reversal of the concurrent findings in the provincial courts, but it rather leaves us with the impression that had it been held below that the respondent had assented to the broker\u2019s retention of the moneys in question, that holding could not have been supported.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff and Newcombe J.J., dissenting, was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014This litigation originated in a dispute touching the reciprocal rights and liabilities of the appellants and the respondent arising out of certain transactions carried out by the appellants in New York pursuant to orders from the respondent between the 9th of April, 1919, and the 16th of January, 1920. During this period, Canadian funds were at a discount in New York. The appellants had an arrangement with their New York correspondents, who were members of the New York Cotton Exchange and of the New York Stock Exchange, under which these correspondents made purchases and sales on the exchanges upon the instructions of the appellants. The New York correspondents had an account in a bank in Toronto, and moneys payable by the appellants were deposited to the credit of the correspondents in this account, while moneys payable to the appellants by the correspondents were paid to them by cheques drawn upon it. The correspondents and the appellants accepted payments reciprocally in Canadian funds, the understanding being that no charge was to be made for exchange in respect of any of such payments.\nThe dealings on behalf of the respondent resulted on the whole in a very considerable profit; and the respondent contended, and still contends in this litigation, that in arriving at the profit for which the appellants are accountable to him as his agents, he is entitled to be credited in terms of New York funds for the moneys received in respect of the transactions carried out for him by the appellants\u2019 New York correspondents in New York; in other words, that he is entitled to be credited in Toronto in respect of any New York funds so received in their equivalent in Canadian funds, according to the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of receipt; and that, of course, debits should be dealt with on a like principle.\nIn the absence of any agreement expressed either in words or by conduct to the contrary, the respondent would indisputably be entitled to call upon the appellants to account for all profits realized out of transactions undertaken for him on the New York Exchange, and would at the same time be bound to indemnify the appellants in respect of any losses entailed by such transactions. The arrangement between the appellants and their New York correspondents was not communicated to the respondent, whose rights are not therefore in any way affected by it. The question in controversy is a question of fact, whether, namely, the appellants have established by satisfactory evidence an agreement between the respondent and themselves that the business was being conducted on the footing that, as between them, the risk of fluctuations in exchange between New York and Canada was to be borne entirely by the appellants.\nExpress agreement in words is not contended for. Broadly, it is said on behalf of the appellants that the respondent was informed by them and became aware early in course of the dealings between them that the appellants considered, and were acting upon the belief, that the business between them was being conducted on the footing that moneys received in New York on behalf of the respondent should be credited to him in corresponding figures in Canadian funds, and that moneys paid for him in New York were to be debited in the same way; and that the respondent, having become aware that the appellants were proceeding on this basis, acted in such a way as to preclude himself from disputing that such were the terms of the understanding between them. The sole question is: does the evidence establish this? The evidence relied upon consist of the accounts and statements furnished from time to time, as above mentioned, beginning with the ninth of April, and the evidence of Cashman and Bickell on behalf of the appellants, and of Cutten himself. In the documents, credits and debits are dealt with on the principle mentioned. It will not be necessary to examine the documents in detail, but one or two illustrative entries may be mentioned: In April, 1919, a sum of $10,000, paid by the respondent in Toronto in Canadian funds as margin, was credited to him without deduction, Canadian funds being then in New York at a discount of a little more than two per cent; in September, 1919, a loss of twenty-three thousand odd dollars in New York funds on the sale of 2,000 bales of March cotton was debited to him in Canadian funds at par, the exchange being then about four per cent; in November, 1919, the sum of $3,000, received on behalf of the respondent on the 31st of October as dividends in New York, and in New York funds, was credited to him in Canadian funds as $3,000. In the same month, $100,000 paid to the respondent in Canadian funds on account of his profits on a sale of cotton, was charged to him at par, the exchange being then at four per cent. Later, in the same month, the respondent paid the appellants $50,000 as margin in Canadian funds, and this sum was also debited to him at par, the exchange being then at five per cent.\nIn all the numerous statements of account, during this period, debits and credits were treated in the same way; moneys paid and received in Canada are debited and credited without deduction in Canadian funds; moneys received and paid out in New York are credited and debited in terms of Canadian funds in figures identical with those expressing in New York funds the sums received or paid there. In every case the balance is struck on the principle that all credits and debits are computed and expressed according to the same standard, that standard being obviously, to anyone who compared the figures of the accounts with the facts of the transactions, the Canadian dollar. It is undisputed that the respondent understood this; and when one looks at the form which these statements assume, one cannot doubt that the respondent must have realized that the appellants were proceeding upon the assumption that such was the footing on which the business was being conducted. It is hardly denied that the accounts and statements were carefully checked by the respondent personally. He admits that therein the appellants were dealing with the moneys \u201cas Canadian funds in a Canadian account\u201d; that he recognized the profits or losses shown in them as net profits or losses in Canadian funds, \u201cwithout anything being added for American exchange.\u201d He says:\nthe accounts I received from Mr. Bickell were accounts in Canadian funds; no question about that; (and) when I got any statement from Mr. Bickell, I naturally would see it was in Canadian funds.\nNor is there any room for suggestion that Cutten regarded the principle of the account, as manifested by these documents, as merely provisional, and subject to revision. His attention was attracted to the subject early in November. He tells, indeed, of a conversation with Cashman, manager of the appellants, in which he says he raised the question of the payment of profits in American funds. For reasons to be mentioned presently, it seems quite clear that this conversation did not occur until after the transactions now in question had been closed. But that the question of his right to be paid in New York funds was actually present to his mind in the course of these transactions seems to be made clear by what he says about a credit for dividends already mentioned, received on the 31st of October and included in a November statement. He says:\nI came to the conclusion\u2014I saw the dividend somewhere\u2014that the dividend was earned in New York, and that dividend should have been given to me in American funds.\nAsked why he made no protest, his explanation was that they had already refused to allow him American exchange, and that it had been agreed that the question should stand over for further discussion with his brother. As I have said, it is impossible to accept his statement that this last mentioned incident took place earlier than January. But the evidence leaves little room for doubt that he understood the appellants\u2019 statements as involving a notice to him that the appellants were dealing with him on the basis of crediting and debiting all moneys received and paid respectively as Canadian funds. Had the appellants in express terms informed the respondent during the course of these transactions that this was the basis upon which their dealings with him were being conducted, and he had proceeded without demur to enter into further dealings and to receive accounts and statements without protesting, nobody, of course, would argue that he could, as to later transactions affected by an abnormal rise or fall in exchange, seek to take advantage of this situation by repudiating his previous tacit acquiescence in the proposal or declaration of the appellants. His failure to demur in such circumstances could only be construed as an acceptance of the appellants\u2019 declaration as constituting the terms governing their relations. And if such was the effect of the communications which in fact passed from the appellants to the respondent as the respondent, as a reasonable business man, ought to have conceived it, and as he did in fact conceive it, then the result must be the same. With great respect, I can entertain no serious doubt that such was the effect of these communications as the respondent ought to have conceived it and as he did in fact conceive it, and that the appellants, having proceeded to conduct their affairs without any protest or demur, according to the principle expressed in their communications, are entitled to insist that such was the arrangement between them. The principle, that a man is bound by the reasonable interpretation of his words and conduct by another who reasonably interprets such words or conduct as meant to be acted upon, is a principle which, as Lord Haldane said, in London Joint Stock Bank Ltd. v. McMillan[4],\nis essential to the conduct of business between the members of every well-ordered community. It is generally recognized in ordinary social life as imposing obligation of honour as much as of law.\nThe business would have borne an entirely different colour had the respondent succeeded in establishing, as he sought to do, that he did protest, and that by arrangement with Cashman the matter of exchange was left open. Cashman\u2019s evidence as to the date of the conversation is explicit, and the failure of the respondent to refer to this conversation in the correspondence in January, when the fact that it had occurred would have been a complete answer to the position assumed by Cashman in his letter, seems to show clearly enough that at the trial the respondent\u2019s recollection was seriously at fault.\nWhile the question involved in the appeal is purely the question of fact, it is a question which does not depend, except as regards the conversation just mentioned\u2014and as to that there is no finding by either court\u2014upon any view as to the credibility of witnesses. The primary facts are not seriously in controversy; the sole question is, what is the proper inference to be drawn from them? Nor is it at all useful to consider the previous decision of this court in Barthelmes v. Bickell[5]. The view taken in that case was that the facts did not afford sufficient ground to support the inference of any understanding between the customer and broker on the subject of exchange. There, as here, it was a question of fact. The considerations pointing to the conclusion that such an agreement ought to be inferred in this case are vastly more powerful than in the former case. But it is, perhaps, not unimportant to add, in view of some observations in the courts below, that it is a misconception of the doctrine which governs the use of precedent in the law of England to suppose that it applies to decisions which are decisions solely upon points of fact. Lord Halsbury said, in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons, at p. 208[6]:\nIf, as I believe, it be accurate that the question is one which is to be determined upon the facts of the case, no one case can be an authority for another;\nand Lord Herschell said, at p. 221, speaking of Sheffield v. The London Joint Stock Bank[7]:\nIt may, perhaps, be a binding authority as to the conclusions of fact arrived at, where the facts are identical, but not otherwise.\nThere are observations much to the same effect by Lord Macnaghten in Colls v. Home & Colonial Stores Limited[8].\nThe appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tilley, Johnston, Thomson & Parmenter.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hughes & Agar.\n[1] 57 Ont.

Code\u2014Appeal to court of appeal on objection as to qualification of juror not raised at trial\u2014Right of appeal to court of appeal without leave\u2014Court of appeal judgment conflicting with judgment of another court of appeal in like case.\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia quashed a conviction for manslaughter on the ground of disqualification of a juror by deafness, which disqualification that court found to be established by evidence taken subsequent to the trial. The defendant had not before the verdict raised objection as to the juror's qualification. The Court of Appeal held that the question as to the deafness of the juror and its effect in respect to the trial and conviction was a question of law only, and under s. 1013 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code an appeal to it lay without leave, and it therefore refused leave to appeal as being unnecessary. The Attorney-General for British Columbia moved for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, that, having regard to clauses (b) and (c) of s. 1013 (1), and to s. 1011, of the Criminal Code, the motion should be favourably considered if the pre-requisite of jurisdiction to entertain the projected appeal, viz., conflict between the judgment from which it was sought to appeal and that of any other court of appeal in a like case (Criminal Code, s. 1024A) existed; that decisions prior to the enactment of s. 1013 in 1923 on some of the matters covered by that section might properly be regarded as having been rendered in like cases; that such conflict as aforesaid existed by reason of the cases of Reg. v. Earl (10 Man. R. 303), and Rex v. Battista (21 Can. Cr. Cases 1) ; and the motion should be granted.\nMOTION under s. 1024A. of the Criminal Code by counsel representing the Attorney-General of British Columbia for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] setting aside the conviction of the defendant for manslaughter. Leave to appeal was granted by the judgment now reported. The subsequent judgment of this court on the merits has been already reported[2]. J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the motion.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. contra.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014Counsel representing the Attorney General of British Columbia moves under s. 1024A of the Criminal Code (10-11 Geo. V., c. 43, s. 16) for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia setting aside the conviction of the defendant for manslaughter. The defendant appealed upon one notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal under s. 1013 of the Criminal Code (13-14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9) on grounds of misdirection, non-direction and irregularities in the course of the trial. He also appealed by a second notice on the ground that two of the petit jurors\u2014George Keown and Thomas Worledge\u2014who sat on the trial, were incapacitated by deafness from serving on the jury. Moreover, he at the same time moved the Court of Appeal, on a third and distinct notice of appeal, to quash the indictment on which he had been tried and convicted on the ground that five of the jurors who sat on the alleged grand jury by which it was found had not been \"summoned\" as grand jurors (Criminal Code, s. 921).\nNotice of motion for leave to appeal was given in connection with the matters covered by the notice of motion first mentioned but not in connection with the alleged defects in the constitution of the grand and petit juries. An application for leave to appeal would appear to have been made, however, on the hearing of the appeal in connection with the alleged disqualification of the petit jurors.\nThe court directed that separate judgments should be pronounced by its several members. (Criminal Code, s. 1013 (5)).\nNo allusion is made to the subject matters of the notice of motion, first above referred to, in any of the judgments of the appellate judges beyond the statement that error in the judge's charge formed one of the grounds of appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal consisted of five members. Two of the learned judges (Martin and M. A. Macdonald J.J.A.) would have acceded to the motion to quash the indictment; two (Macdonald, C.J.A. and Galliher, J.A.) would have refused it; McPhillips, J.A., while alluding to it as a ground of appeal, expresses no opinion upon the alleged defect in the constitution of the grand jury.\nThe alleged disqualification of the juror Worledge was either not pressed or was not regarded as of sufficient importance to be noticed in the judgments delivered.\nThree of the learned appellate judges (Martin, Galliher and McPhillips) held that the question as to the deafness of the juror Keown and its effect in respect to the trial and conviction of the defendant was a question of law and not a question of fact or a question of mixed fact and law and on that ground refused leave to appeal as unnecessary. They found that the disqualification of Keown was established by evidence taken subsequent to the trial\u2014no doubt under s. 1021 of the Criminal Code (13-14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9) (and vide Rex v. Syme[3] )\u2014 and on that ground quashed the conviction and directed a new trial. Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald expressed no opinion on this aspect of the case. The learned Chief Justice dissented holding the question raised as to the disqualification of Keown to be essentially a question of fact or of mixed fact and law, on which an appeal does not lie without leave and that, under the circumstances, which he details, leave to appeal should be refused.\nThe learned Chief Justice appears to assume the competency of an appeal by leave on this ground; but does not advert to the question, now raised by the Attorney General, whether such an appeal, by the present defendant, is not precluded by the fact that he first raised the objection to the disqualification of the jurors after the verdict.\nThe decision of the majority of the court clearly involves an adjudication that such an appeal lies; that failure to object to the jurors' disqualification before the verdict does not debar the defendant from making it; and that the Court of Appeal may determine the fact on which alleged disqualification of a juror is based on evidence taken under s. 1021 of the Criminal Code. That the appeal involved merely a question of law and therefore fell within clause (a) of s. 1013 (1) and lay without leave is distinctly affirmed by the formal order of the court. Upon both points\u2014the competency of the appeal on an objection to the qualification of the jurors not raised at the trial and the right to have brought the appeal without leave\u2014the judgment from which leave to appeal is now sought is asserted by counsel for the Attorney General to conflict with judgments of other courts of appeal. (Criminal Code, s.2 (7)).\nProceedings in error in criminal cases and the procedure and practice in provincial courts of criminal appeal in respect of motions for or the granting of new trials of persons convicted on indictment have been entirely superseded (Criminal Code, s. 1013(3)). The Court of Appeal must, therefore, have dealt with the defendant's application in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction conferred on it by s. 1013(1). Indeed the Chief Justice said that\nredress in all cases like the present one must be sought by an appeal only.\nHaving regard to the provisions of clauses (b) and (c) of s. 1013(1) in respect to the need of leave to appeal and to the provisions of s. 1011 that no omission to observe the directions of any Act as to (inter alia) the qualification of a juror shall be ground for impeaching any verdict or shall be allowed for error on any appeal, I think the application of the Attorney General for leave to appeal to this court should be favourably considered if the pre-requisite of jurisdiction to entertain the projected appeal, viz., conflict between the judgment from which it is sought to appeal and that of any other court of appeal in a like case (s. 1024A), exists.\nSection 1013 having been enacted only in 1923, a conflicting judgment under it is scarcely to be looked for. But earlier decisions on some of the matters covered by that section are in point and may properly be regarded as having been rendered in like cases.\nI regard the decision, in 1894, of the Court of Queen's Bench in Manitoba\u2014then the Court of Appeal for that province (55-56 Vic., (D.) c. 29, s. 3 (e) )\u2014in Regina v. Earl [4] as sufficiently in consimili casu. The court there rejected an appeal based on the ground, first raised after the trial, that one of the petit jurors was unable to understand the language in which the trial had been conducted. The observations of Killam, J., at pp. 312, 313, of Taylor, C.J., at p. 308 and of Bain, J., at p. 317 are in point. I do not overlook the distinction between the two cases that deafness is a ground of disqualification under the British Columbia statute (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 123, s. 6), whereas ignorance of English is not a disqualification under the law of Manitoba.\nOn the question whether alleged disqualification through deafness is a ground of appeal which falls within clause (a) or within clause (b) of s. 1013(1), the decision of the Court of King's Bench (Que.) in Rex v. Battista (1) is in conflict with the judgment now before us. The appeal there was based on the qualification of a petit juror which it was held \"was a question of fact and not a question of law\" and \" should have been raised before verdict was rendered.\"\nBut it may well be that the questions of fact or of mixed fact and law covered by clause (b) are confined to questions in issue between the Crown and the defendant on the trial and that the ground of appeal in the present case arising out of the constitution of the petit jury falls rather under clause (c). (Archbold Cr. PI. Ev. & Pr. (26th Ed.) 338).\nFor these reasons leave to appeal will be granted. I advisedly refrain from any observation affecting the merits of the case to come before the court. The case may be set down as the first case on the Western list for the session of this court commencing on the 5th of May next.\nMotion granted.\n[1] 35 B.C.

V, c. 41, s. 37.\nR., who was a member of the firm of B. & Co., stockbrokers, retired from the firm in May, 1920. The business was continued\u2019 by B. alone, under the same firm name. The plaintiff became a customer of the firm in March, 1920, and continued to deal with the firm, until it became bankrupt in 1924. The plaintiff filed a claim under the Bankruptcy Act against the insolvent estate of B. & Co.; but, so far as appeared, received no dividend upon his claim. In this action he sought to recover from R. the amount of his claim against the firm, alleging that at the time his claim arose R. was \u201ca known partner of B. & Co. without notice of his retirement as a partner of the firm.\u201d\nHeld, that in the absence of notice to the plaintiff of his retirement, R. would be liable; that the onus did not rest on the plaintiff of establishing that he was unaware of R\u2019s retirement from the firm of B. & Co., but that it rested upon R. to (prove either direct notice thereof or, at least, facts and circumstances from which knowledge of such retirement might fairly be inferred.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (57 Ont. L.R. 329) reversed and new trial ordered.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the County Court and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nH. J. Scott K.C. for the appellant.\nW. Nesbitt K.C. and J. A. McEvoy for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014From the 31st of May, 1919, to the 31st of May, 1920, the defendant was a member of the brokerage firm of J. G. Beaty & Co. During that period the plaintiff became a customer of the firm. After the defendant had retired from the firm in 1920, a brokerage business was carried on by J. G. Beaty alone under the name of J. G. Beaty & Co. until he became insolvent in 1924. As a result of transactions with J. G. Beaty & Co. entered upon subsequent to the defendant\u2019s retirement, the plaintiff became a creditor of J. G. Beaty for $2,818.90, and preferred a claim for that amount with Beaty\u2019s assignee in bankruptcy. In this action he sues the defendant for this sum\nas a known partner of J. G. Beaty & Co., without notice of his retirement as a partner of the said firm.\nIn the County Court the action was dismissed on the ground that by making his claim against the insolvent estate of J. G. Beaty & Co. the plaintiff had elected to forego any rights he might have against the defendant. On appeal the judgment dismissing the action was upheld[2], but on the ground that, assuming the circumstances to be such that the plaintiff, if not apprised of the partnership dissolution, would be entitled to recover, he had\nnot succeeded in satisfying the learned trial judge or (the Appellate Divisional Court) that he did not in any way know of Ross\u2019s retirement before 1922, when the transactions in question were had.\nFor the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Riddell the Divisional Court (in our opinion rightly) rejected the ground on which the judgment of the County Court had been based; but, with deference, we are of the opinion that the onus did not rest on the plaintiff of establishing that he was unaware of the defendant\u2019s retirement from the firm of J. G. Beaty & Co., and that the judgment of the Appellate Division, therefore, cannot be supported on the ground on which it has been put. In the absence of notice to the plaintiff of his retirement, the defendant would be liable. It rested upon him to prove either direct notice thereof or, at least, facts and circumstances from which knowledge of such retirement might fairly be inferred. A finding that the plaintiff had such knowledge was essential to the defence.\nWe do not discern in the circumstances of this case anything which takes it out of the general rule embodied in s. 37 of the Partnership Act, 10-11 Geo. V, (Ont.), c. 41, and thus stated in Lindley on Partnership, 9th Ed., p. 291:\nWhen an apparent partner retires, or when a partnership between several known partners is dissolved * * * those who dealt with the firm before the change took (place are entitled; to assume that no change has occurred) until they have notice to the contrary.\nOn a mere perusal of the evidence in the record (which we advisedly refrain from discussing), we are not prepared to find that notice to the plaintiff of the defendant\u2019s retirement in 1920 has been established. But there is some evidence from which notice might-be inferred: (Leeson v. Holt[3]; Barfoot v. Goodall[4]; Hart v. Alexander[5]), and we have not had the advantage of observing the plaintiff\u2019s demeanour when under examination in regard to the various matters relied upon as warranting the inference of knowledge which the defendant urges should be drawn. Upon the vital question whether knowledge by the plaintiff of the defendant\u2019s retirement at the time the transactions resulting in the present claim took place was established, there is no finding by the tribunal peculiarly competent, under circumstances such as this case presents, to make it\u2014the trial court.\nAs already stated, when the plaintiff shewed that the defendant had been a member of the firm with which he dealt, the burden rested on the defendant to procure such a finding. He did not obtain it. He can have another opportunity to do so only as a matter of indulgence\u2014and upon proper terms. On the other hand, there is no finding against him on this issue.\nUnder all the circumstances, we are of the opinion that, while the judgment dismissing the action must be set aside, a new trial should be directed upon payment by the defendant to the plaintiff of his costs of the appeals to the Appellate Division and to this court, and that the costs of the abortive trial should abide the event of the new trial.

The city may exact and recover from any person, partnership, corporation or company operating public or private abattoirs situated in or in the vicinity of the city, in order to pay the salary of the health officers appointed by the council to inspect the cattle and other animals slaughtered at any such abattoirs, a sum of not more than one thousand dollars per annum for each public abattoir, and a sum of not more than two hundred dollars per annum for each private abattoir operated by any such person, partnership, corporation or company.\nThe amounts to be recovered shall be fixed every year by a resolution of the council, on a report of the board of commissioners before the first of July, and shall be payable on the first of September following.\nThe city proceeded to exercise the authority thus conferred in the following way.\nOn the 14th May, 1917, the Board of Commissioners passed a resolution\nde fixer \u00e0 $200 la taxe sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 exiger des abattoirs priv\u00e9s et \u00e0 $1,000 celle \u00e0 exiger des abattoirs publics, et de faire rapport au conseil conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 541 de la charte.\nA report in consequence was submitted to the city council, which, on the 23rd May, approved of it and resolved accordingly. The company objects that the city neither appointed health officers to make the inspection of cattle and other animals slaughtered in the company\u2019s abattoirs, nor fixed any salary or remuneration for them; that it made no inspection of these abattoirs and consequently it has not, under section 541, the right to exact any amount for a service which it did not render.\nThe strength of this objection depends entirely on the nature of the imposition contemplated by the section referred to: whether it provides for a tax, or for the bare right to recover a compensation for services.\nIn our opinion, it provides for a tax.\nIn construing tax statutes, the substance and not the form is to be considered, so as to carry into effect the legislative intent. (Cooley\u2014Taxation\u20144th ed. parag. 502). The substance of the enactment in section 541 is that the city may enforce from any abattoir a contribution towards its expenditure for the preservation of public health. It has no relation to the value of the services performed. It does not call for the organization of a special system of supervision. No obligation is placed upon the municipality to visit the abattoirs of the company or any such establishment in particular \u201csituated in or in the vicinity of the city.\u201d The motive of the section is not to meet the request or to serve the interest of the company, but to help the city in carrying out a public purpose of prime importance. It is therefore a burden which comes properly under the definition of a tax (Dillon, Municipal Corporations, 5th ed., vol. IV, par. 1351; Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v. The City of Montreal[1]).\nIt follows that the company cannot object to it on the ground that it receives no direct benefit from the application of its proceeds or that it is not as much benefited as others (Cooley, 4th ed., vol. 1, pars. 20 and 89).\nLes revenus de l\u2019\u00e9tat (says (Montesquieu (Be l\u2019esprit des lois, Liv. XIII, c. 1er)) sont une portion que chaque citoyen donne de son bien, pour avoir la suret\u00e9 de l\u2019autre ou pour en jouir agr\u00e9ablement.\nTaxes are sacrifices for the public good (Mill, Political Economy, vol. 11, pp. 370, 372) and for their contribution the government or the municipal corporation\nrenders no return of special benefit to any property, but only secures to the citizen that general benefit which results from protection to his person and property, and the promotion of those various schemes which have for their object the welfare of all. Illinois Central Ry. v. Decatur[2].\nIt is no defence to the collection of a tax that a ratepayer liable for it is not benefited by the expenditure of the proceeds of the tax. The distribution of these proceeds rests in the discretion of the municipal corporation; and if it is unwisely exercised, the remedy is with the electors and not with the court. Moreover, taxes are generally collected in advance of the requirements (and such is the case in Montreal charter, ss. 332 and foll.). The distribution is therefore quite independent of the levy of the tax, and the former cannot affect the validity of the latter (Cooley, pars. 89 and 1813).\nWhile, however, these considerations on the legal aspect of the taxing power would be sufficient to defeat the contentions put forward by the company, it was shown in this case that there are, in the city of Montreal, by-laws concerning public health. The city keeps a regular staff of employees and inspectors, whose duties are to carry out the provisions of these by-laws. Their salary is voted every year in the budget; and it is not insignificant to point to the fact that, during the relevant years, the amount spent in that connection was substantially in proportion with the total imposts levied on the abattoirs.\nThe company further insists that by force of two contracts, to which the city was a party, it must be regarded as exempt from the operation of section 541.\nThe first contract was made on the 16th January, 1903, with the Montreal Stock Yards Company. It is not lightly to be assumed that the advantages therein conferred by the city, principally in respect of the establishment of a \u201clive stock market for the city of Montreal,\u201d enured to the benefit of the appellant, since it purchased only the abattoir business of the Montreal Stock Yards Co. However, it is admitted that this contract concerns solely what is known as the western abattoir. Amongst other stipulations, it provides that\nthe officials of said city shall at all times be at liberty to inspect the same, the said company also agrees to allow the meat inspectors of the city to inspect the cattle at all times whenever desired before being slaughtered as well as to make inspection after the cattle have been slaughtered; the said meat inspector to be paid by the city.\nThe city does not seek to recover from the company an amount paid to its meat inspector to examine \u201cthe cattle brought to the yards of the company.\u201d It does not pray for the reimbursement of money spent for the inspection at the company\u2019s premises. It claims a tax levied on its abattoirs for public purposes.\nThere cannot be read into the contract an undertaking on the part of the city not to impose such a tax on the company. This would be tantamount to an exemption from taxation which can there be found neither in clear and unmistakable terms nor by necessary implication from the language used.\nBut the contract furnishes an additional reply to the contention of the company. The power to exact a charge from abattoirs situated in the city was not delegated to it for the first time in 1916, by the statute 7 Geo. V, c. 60, s. 10. It dates back to 1899, when the present charter of the city of Montreal was granted by the provincial parliament. The only material difference between the section as it was then enacted and the present section 541 lies in the maximum amount of the charge per annum. It was then $500; by the amendment of 1916, it was increased to $1,000.\nAs a result of what has already been said and by force of section 366 of the charter, this charge is a tax. At the date of the contract of 1903, the city had already full authority to levy this tax and, far from contracting itself out of that authority, it carefully avoided to make any express stipulation having the effect of excluding it.\nAs for the second contract, it is a deed of the 22nd July, 1885, between La Compagnie des Abattoirs de Montr\u00e9al, The Dominion Abattoirs & Stock Yards Limited, the city of Montreal and l\u2019Union des Abattoirs de Montr\u00e9al. When this deed was passed, a certain by-law no. 129 was in existence and provided that charges for the slaughtering and dressing of animals at public abattoirs were not to exceed those contained in a subjoined tariff. It is claimed that the parties to this deed took this tariff into consideration when executing it, that they were entitled to rely upon receiving the fees mentioned therein and that the imposition of the tax under section 541 had the effect of reducing these fees and thereby infringes vested rights. The appellant has certainly not made clear its right to invoke any benefit under the deed in question. Whatever privileges it may have acquired from The Montreal Stock Yards Limited by the contract already considered, it is manifest that the mere holding of a controlling interest, however extensive, in l\u2019Union des Abattoirs de Montr\u00e9al cannot have the effect of vesting the rights of that company in the appellant. But, moreover, there is in the contract of the 22nd July, 1885, no reference to by-law 129 or to the annexed tariff. The city did not guarantee that it would maintain the charges for slaughtering at the maximum rates fixed in such tariff, still less that it would never do any act of a nature indirectly to affect these rates. So far as taxation is concerned, there is no vested right to the continuance of any particular tax or particular apportionment of taxes. (Cooley, par. 134.) We therefore think that these contracts fail to support the appellant\u2019s contentions.\nOn the whole, the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Monty, Duranleau, Ross & Angers.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Damphousse, Butler & St.-Pierre.\n[1] [1889] 16 Can.

V, c. 85), the municipality of Notre Dame de la Victoire was annexed to the city of L\u00e9vis; and it was stipulated that the city, within two years from the date of the annexation, should provide systems of aqueduct and drainage for the annexed municipality. The city of L\u00e9vis introduced these systems into the populated part of the annexed territory, but did not extend them as far as the appellant\u2019s property, which was the most distant lot built upon and was situated at a considerable distance from the nearest house. The appellant, by way of mandamus, prayed for an order from the court to compel the city respondent to supply his house with the water and drainage systems. Held that this special Act did not impose upon the city of L\u00e9vis the obligation to establish systems of aqueduct and drainage indiscriminately throughout the whole annexed territory, and had not deprived the council of the city of its discretion in exceptional cases. The respondent could not compel it to supply him by way of mandamus; the city of L\u00e9vis, in refusing to do so, having exercised, in good faith and without discrimination, the discretion conferred upon it by the general law as contained in the Cities and Towns Act and by its own charter.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 39 K.B. 545) reversed\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nDe Billy K.C. for the appellant.\nB\u00e9langer for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014M.

Elle explique pourquoi, alors qu\u2019elle a procur\u00e9 ce service au quartier Villemay en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, elle a d\u00fb en omettre le requ\u00e9rant \u00e0 cause de circonstances sp\u00e9ciales qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer ici parce qu\u2019elles rel\u00e8vent de questions d\u2019administration.\nElle pr\u00e9tend que la loi annexant la municipalit\u00e9 de Notre-Dame-de-la-Victoire ne la contraint pas \u00e0 donner le service de l\u2019eau et des \u00e9gouts \u00e0 toutes les maisons du nouveau quartier.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 M. B\u00e9gin des fins de sa requ\u00eate. La Cour du Banc du Roi, compos\u00e9e de trois juges[2], a ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9mission du bref p\u00e9remptoire; mais l\u2019honorable juge Rivard \u00e9tait dissident, \u00e9tant d\u2019avis que le jugement a quo devait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que cette cause nous est maintenant soumise apr\u00e8s un partage \u00e9gal d\u2019opinion entre les savants juges qui l\u2019ont entendue dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Cette divergence de vues n\u2019existe cependant qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il faut donner \u00e0 la disposition du statut d\u2019annexion.\nIl est reconnu que ni la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, \u00e0 laquelle L\u00e9vis est subordon\u00e9e, ni la charte de la cit\u00e9, ne l\u2019obligent \u00e0 fournir le service d\u2019aqueduc et de drainage \u00e0 chacune des maisons ou dans chaque portion de son territoire, mais que le conseil a l\u00e0-dessus une discr\u00e9tion \u00e0 exercer qui d\u00e9pend de l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 et des circonstances. Th\u00e9mens v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[3]. Nous avons d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019avantage de trouver dans la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec deux arr\u00eats qui se sont prononc\u00e9s sur ce point dans des cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de d\u00e9finir les devoirs statutaires de la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis: Juneau v. La Corporation de la Ville de L\u00e9vis[4],o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que:\nUne corporation municipale autoris\u00e9e par sa charte \u00e0 faire des travaux d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique (dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tablir un syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9gouts), peut y proc\u00e9der pour le tout \u00e0 la fois, ou par parties, et dans les subdivisions de son territoire qu\u2019elle juge convenable, le mode \u00e0 suivre \u00e9tant laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion. Est partant valable, un r\u00e8glement de la ville de L\u00e9vis pour \u00e9tablir un syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9gouts dans la ville, except\u00e9 dans un de ses quartiers.\nMinister of Justice for the Dominion of Canada v. City of Levis[5], o\u00f9 lord Parmoor, pronon\u00e7ant le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9, dit (p. 511):\nThere is no article which in terms imposes upon the respondents an obligation to give a water supply to any of the houses or other buildings within the area of supply and there is an absence of any general provision either as to the method or system of supply or as to the quality of the water.\nApr\u00e8s avoir ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les lois qui r\u00e9gissent la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis, il en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que cette derni\u00e8re ne pourrait refuser le service de l\u2019eau aux propri\u00e9taires et occupants de maisons situ\u00e9es sur le parcours de l\u2019aqueduc; mais il r\u00e9p\u00e8te jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sati\u00e9t\u00e9 que ce devoir se limite aux constructions \u201cwithin the area of supply\u201d.\nSans doute, les motifs de la d\u00e9cision du conseil doivent \u00eatre sages, inspir\u00e9s par la bonne foi et justifi\u00e9s par les conditions particuli\u00e8res. Il ne saurait agir avec partialit\u00e9. Il doit traiter sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 tous les contribuables qui se trouvent plac\u00e9s dans une situation semblable. Il ne pourrait accorder le service aux uns et le refuser aux autres, si cette distinction entre les contribuables n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bas\u00e9e sur de justes raisons. Dillon, Municipal Corporations, 5th ed., vol. 3, par. 1317.\nMais l\u00e0 s\u2019arr\u00e8tent les obligations du conseil en vertu de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Si aucune injustice n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise, si aucun droit n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, les tribunaux ne doivent pas intervenir dans l\u2019exercice de la discr\u00e9tion des autorit\u00e9s municipales, ni mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence. Mayor, etc., of Westminster v. London and North Western Ry. Co.[6].\nCes principes, qui sont de jurisprudence constante, ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 admis pour arr\u00eater l\u2019action des tribunaux dans l\u2019emploi de leur juridiction ordinaire; \u00e0 plus forte raison, doivent-ils recevoir leur application lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure par voie de mandamus, qui est un bref de pr\u00e9rogative auquel le code de proc\u00e9dure civile (art. 992) permet de recourir seulement\nlorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre rem\u00e8de \u00e9galement appropri\u00e9, avantageux et efficace.\nEn effet, l\u2019octroi de ce bref d\u00e9pend essentiellement de l\u2019omission, de la n\u00e9gligence ou du refus par une corporation \u201cd\u2019accomplir un devoir que la loi lui impose ou un acte auquel la loi l\u2019oblige\u201d. Il ne saurait jamais \u00eatre accord\u00e9 lorsque la loi laisse la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du corps public.

B\u00e9gin est discr\u00e9tionnaire, le conseil de la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, a agi avec sagesse.\nVoici comment la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure appr\u00e9cie les circonstances sp\u00e9ciales de cette cause:\nIl appert que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du requ\u00e9rant est situ\u00e9e sur la route de St-Henri et elle se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de la ville sur cette route, savoir qu\u2019elle est \u00e0 environ 1886 pieds de la rue St-Georges; et il appert que les services d\u2019eau et d\u2019\u00e9gout sont install\u00e9s sur la route St-Henri seulement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 chez un nomm\u00e9 P. Carrier, savoir: une distance d\u2019environ 830 pieds de la rue St-Georges et que chez Carrier les tuyaux sont \u00e0 environ 4 pieds de la surface; que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du requ\u00e9rant est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 environ 1050 pieds plus loin que chez Carrier et qu\u2019il ne serait gu\u00e8re possible \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le terrain du requ\u00e9rant est moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui chez Carrier, de prolonger le tuyau d\u2019\u00e9gout actuel; que le co\u00fbt d\u2019installer les services jusqu\u2019\u00e0 chez le requ\u00e9rant serait de pas moins de $3,000 d\u2019apr\u00e8s les preuves ou requ\u00e9rant et de pas moins de $7,000 d\u2019apr\u00e8s les preuves le l\u2019intim\u00e9e; que la seule propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 desservir au del\u00e0 de chez Carrier serait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du requ\u00e9rant dont la contribution serait environ $30 par ann\u00e9e, que ce sont ces circonstances qui ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ne pas se rendre aux demandes du requ\u00e9rant;\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance ajoute ensuite que la d\u00e9cision adopt\u00e9e par (la cit\u00e9) est une d\u00e9cision juste, adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi, et que cette cour Saurait aucune justification pour la.mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 moins que le statut d\u2019annexion ne l\u2019y contraigne.\nIl est confirm\u00e9 en cela par le juge dissident en appel; et les deux juges qui ont form\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 dans cette derni\u00e8re cour n\u2019ont pas exprim\u00e9 d\u2019opinion contraire: leur conclusion quant au r\u00e9sultat du proc\u00e8s leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 dict\u00e9e par des raisons de droit. Ainsi pos\u00e9, le probl\u00e8me se r\u00e9duit donc \u00e0 une simple question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\nNous ne croyons pas que la loi 7 Geo. V, c. 85, s. 6, ait voulu imposer \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis l\u2019obligation d\u2019installer le syst\u00e8me d\u2019aqueduc et d\u2019\u00e9gouts absolument partout dans le nouveau quartier de Villemay et qu\u2019il ait donn\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant un droit absolu de le demander. Sur ce point, nous partageons l\u2019avis de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de l\u2019honorable juge Rivard, qui a exprim\u00e9 son dissentiment en Cour du Banc du Roi. Nous ne pensons pas que cette clause exige que les tuyaux de l\u2019aqueduc et des \u00e9gouts soient construits dans tout le territoire du nouveau quartier.\nLa r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation nous para\u00eet \u00eatre pos\u00e9e par Maxwell, On the Interpretation of Statutes (6th ed., pp. 148 and 149) d\u2019une fa\u00e7on lumineuse:\nThere are certain objects which the legislature is presumed not to intend. * * * One of these presumptions is that the legislature does not intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear implication; or, in other words, beyond the immediate scope and object of the statute. In all general matters beyond, the law remains undisturbed. It is in the last degree improbable that the legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness; and to give any such, effect to general word\u2019s, simply because they have that meaning when used either in their widest, their usual or their natural sense, would be to give them a meaning other than that which was actually intended. General words and phrases, therefore, however wide and comprehensive they may be in their literal sense, must, usually, be construed as being limited to the actual objects of the Act, and as not altering the law beyond.\nL\u2019on est d\u2019accord pour dire, qu\u2019en vertu de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des cit\u00e9s et villes et de la loi sp\u00e9ciale de L\u00e9vis, cette cit\u00e9 avait une discr\u00e9tion absolue pour d\u00e9cider o\u00f9 les canaux d\u2019\u00e9gouts et d\u2019aqueduc seraient construits, et qu\u2019il ne lui incombait en aucune fa\u00e7on de fournir le service d\u2019eau et d\u2019\u00e9gouts \u00e0 toutes les parties du territoire ou \u00e9galement \u00e0 toutes les parties d\u2019un m\u00eame quartier.\nLa loi d\u2019annexion oblige la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis \u00e0 introduire l\u2019eau de l\u2019aqueduc, \u00e0 construire des canaux d\u2019\u00e9gouts pour le drainage et \u00e0 placer des bornes-fontaines dans les rues et avenues du quartier Villemay. Dans ce sens, elle a supprim\u00e9 la discr\u00e9tion que la ville poss\u00e9dait en vertu de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et de sa charte; et elle a impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la ville une obligation \u00e0 laquelle cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019aurait pas autrement \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise. La ville \u00e9tait donc forc\u00e9e d\u2019accomplir son devoir, selon l\u2019expression de Dillon,\nwithout discrimination between persons similarly situated and under circumstances substantially the same. (Dillon, loc. cit.).\nOr, sous ce rapport, la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis s\u2019est conform\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019injonction de la l\u00e9gislature; elle a fait ce que la clause d\u2019annexion lui ordonnait. Mais cette clause ne va pas au del\u00e0. Elle n\u2019a pas enlev\u00e9 la discr\u00e9tion municipale quant aux cas particuliers et exceptionnels, comme celui de B\u00e9gin. Il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une cause d\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui est diff\u00e9rente de celle que les tribunaux ont eue \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer dans l\u2019affaire de Mountain Sites, Ltd., v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[14]. Dans cette cause, la loi d\u00e9clarait que la corporation municipale devait ouvrir une rue, en indiquant le point de d\u00e9part et le point d\u2019arriv\u00e9e de la rue. Le choix du parcours \u00e9tait laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9. La Cour de Revision a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que cela ne rendait pas la loi tellement vague qu\u2019elle ne p\u00fbt \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e, et qu\u2019on ne pouvait admettre qu\u2019une corporation municipale p\u00fbt se lib\u00e9rer d\u2019une obligation statutaire en pr\u00e9textant qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas les moyens suffisants pour s\u2019y conformer, lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait volontairement employ\u00e9 son argent \u00e0 d\u2019autres fins. Dans ce cas, les expressions \u00e9taient claires: la l\u00e9gislature avait ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019ouverture de la rue. On a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al n\u2019avait plus de discr\u00e9tion et ne pouvait pas se demander si cette rue \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et s\u2019il \u00e9tait opportun de d\u00e9penser \u00e0 cette fin une somme consid\u00e9rable alors que, par l\u00e0, beaucoup d\u2019autres travaux imp\u00e9rieux seraient forc\u00e9ment retard\u00e9s. La l\u00e9gislature seule pouvait changer sa d\u00e9cision sous ce rapport.\nMais, dans le cas qui nous occupe, la l\u00e9gislature n\u2019a rien dit qui soit de nature \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre la discr\u00e9tion particuli\u00e8re en ce qui regarde les circonstances exceptionnelles. Il n\u2019entrait pas dans son intention de priver la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis du droit qui l\u2019autorisait, en vertu de sa charte et de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 \u00e9liminer de son service les maisons qui se trouvaient dans des cas distincts et diff\u00e9rents des contribuables du quartier Villemay en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Nous ne pouvons pr\u00e9sumer que le l\u00e9gislateur ait voulu enlever \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de L\u00e9vis ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire; et, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition claire et expresse, nous ne croyons pas, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, devoir intervenir, surtout par le bref de mandamus, o\u00f9\nthe duties sought to be coerced must be of so plain and unmistakable a nature as to leave no room for doubt.\nHigh, Extraordinary Legal Remedies, 3e \u00e9d., par. 423; State v.

(1906) c. 140, s. 23 and rule 16.\nThe appellant, to whom a Canadian patent upon an apparatus for electric heating had been granted in the interval between the commencement of his action and its coming on for trial, sought to impeach certain patents of the respondent company alleged to cover similar devices. At the trial, the appellant, in order to avoid an adjournment applied for by the respondent, offered to refrain from giving evidence in respect of certain foreign patents, and on these terms the trial proceeded. At the conclusion of the argument, the respondent for the first time raised the question of the appellant\u2019s status to maintain the action. The trial judge held that the appellant had adduced no evidence showing that he was a \u201cperson interested\u201d within the meaning of rule 16 of the Exchequer Court Act and had no locus standi; and he accordingly dismissed the action.\nHeld that effect ought not to have been given to the respondent\u2019s objection without first giving the appellant an opportunity of producing the foreign patents as evidence to meet it. Held, also, that, in the circumstances of this case, the appellant possessed a sufficient \u201cinterest,\u201d within the meaning of rule 16, to qualify him to maintain the action.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1925] Ex.

A patent was granted on this application on September 23, 1924. By an action commenced on the 25th of February, 1924, the appellant sought to impeach certain patents of the respondent company alleged to cover devices similar to that which was the subject of the appellant\u2019s application. When the action came on for trial, in February, 1925, counsel for the respondent company applied for an adjournment, alleging the necessity of taking the evidence of certain witnesses in France touching the issue of priority raised by the appellant\u2019s allegation that the devices which were the subjects of the respondent company\u2019s patents were not new but had been previously invented by the appellant or by others. The appellant, with a view to facilitating the early trial of the action and in order to avoid an adjournment, offered to refrain from giving evidence in respect of certain patents set up in the particulars of objections, and on these terms the trial proceeded.\nBy s. 23 of the Exchequer Court Act, the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction in actions to impeach or to annul a patent or invention; and by rule 16 of the Exchequer Court Rules, such an action or proceeding may be by information, by a statement of claim filed by any person interested, or by scire facias.\nAt the conclusion of the argument at the trial, for the first time the respondent company raised the question of the appellant\u2019s status to maintain the action. The learned trial judge gave effect to the objection, without pronouncing on the merits of the action, holding that as he had adduced no evidence shewing that he was a \u201cperson interested\u201d within the meaning of rule 16 at the date of the filing of the statement of claim, the appellant had no locus standi; and he accordingly dismissed the action with costs.\nIt is not seriously disputed that had the patents respecting which the appellant had undertaken, in the circumstances already mentioned, to offer no evidence, been put in evidence, no question could have arisen as to the appellant\u2019s status. The appellant\u2019s undertaking not to give such evidence was proposed solely with the purpose of meeting the respondent company\u2019s complaint that in fairness to him the trial ought not to proceed without giving him an opportunity to meet the evidence afforded by these patents as bearing upon the issue of priority of invention; it was, as all parties must have understood, proffered solely with a view to meeting this objection by excluding the patents as evidence upon that issue. Had it been suggested that the appellant\u2019s locus standi was attacked, the undertaking would unquestionably have been qualified or restricted by permitting the admission of these patents as evidence establishing such status or, more probably, by an admission of the appellant\u2019s status by the respondent company. In these circumstances, it seems to be quite clear that effect ought not to have been given to the respondent company\u2019s objection without, at all events, first giving the appellant an opportunity of producing these patents as evidence to meet it. The appellant\u2019s undertaking, which was given alio intuitu, could not have been regarded as standing in the way.\nThere is another ground, however, upon which the appeal should succeed. At the time of the trial, it is unquestioned that the appellant had a status to impeach the respondent company\u2019s patent, in virtue of the patent granted after the commencement of the action. It may be assumed, without deciding either point, that status at the date of the trial only is not sufficient, and that, for the purpose of conferring status, the patent in evidence ought not to be considered as relating back to the application for it, which, as already mentioned, was presented before the commencement of the action. But, these assumptions made, the facts seem to be amply sufficient to establish the interest of the appellant at the critical date. The appellant, admittedly, is and was when the action was commenced,\nengaged in the design and manufacture of electric steam generators or water heaters,\nand a trader in articles similar to the alleged invention which is the subject of the patents attacked. It is not suggested, and could not be suggested, in face of the correspondence in evidence, that the application (which, as already mentioned, had been granted before the trial) was a merely frivolous one or that it was presented male fide for the purpose of acquiring a colourable standing to impugn the respondent company\u2019s patent. Indisputably, the existence of the patents attacked was calculated directly to affect the appellant prejudicially in his business as a manufacturer and trader, and both in the prosecution of his application and in respect of the protection to be afforded him by his patent if his application for a patent should be successful. In these circumstances, there seems little room for doubt that the appellant possessed a sufficient \u201cinterest,\u201d within the meaning of rule 16, to quality him to maintain the action, and the appeal should therefore be allowed. A new trial is a regrettable necessity. The respondent company must pay the costs of the appeal forthwith. The appellant\u2019s costs of the abortive trial will abide the event of the new trial, while the respondent company\u2019s costs of the abortive trial will be borne by the respondent company in any event.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fetherstonhaugh & Co.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R. V. Sinclair.\n[1] [1925] Ex. C.R. 160.\n"

Leduc (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nLa Banque D\u2019Hochelaga (Defendant) Respondent.\n1925: November 10; 1925: December 10.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nBank and banking\u2014Cheque\u2014Definition\u2014Bill of exchange\u2014Post-dated\u2014Acceptance by a branch manager\u2014Validity\nThe appellant sued upon an instrument bearing date the 2nd of July, 1919, which is in the form of a cheque for $4,000 drawn upon the respondent by P. payable to the order of the \u201cMinistre de la Voirie.\u201d This instrument bore stamped upon it what purported to be an acceptance by the respondent bank, authenticated by what are admitted to be initials of a local manager, dated the 2nd of July, 1921, but placed on the instrument on the day on which it was dated.\nHeld, Rinfret J. dissenting, that such an instrument is not \u201cpayable on demand\u201d and consequently is not a \u201ccheque\u201d within the terms of s. 165 of the Bills of Exchange Act.\u2014To anybody into whose hands it may come before the arrival of the date of acceptance, the proper interpretation of it would be that the instrument had been treated by the bank and the drawer, not as a cheque, but as an ordinary bill of exchange and accepted as such.\nHeld also, Rinfret J. dissenting, that, although the acceptance of a cheque by a local bank manager is binding upon the bank, although at the time the drawer has insufficient funds to meet it, the appellant cannot recover, as no evidence has been adduced indicating that the acceptance of a bill of exchange is within the duties included in the ordinary conduct of a branch bank by its manager.\nPer Rinfret J. (dissenting).\u2014The Minister of Roads was a holder in due course and for value. By \u201caccepting\u201d the instrument, which was a cheque within the terms of the Bills of Exchange Act, the bank was binding itself unconditionally to pay the holder of the cheque on the date named in the acceptance.\nPer Rinfret J. (dissenting).\u2014The internal regulations concerning the authority of the manager of a branch of the bank are a matter between the latter and its local manager. A holder in due course and the public at large are entitled to act upon the apparent authority of this manager and cannot be affected by regulations unknown to them.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\u2014Appeal dismissed with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Arthur Vall\u00e9e K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C and Duff, Mignault and Newcombe JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The appellant sues upon an instrument bearing date the 2nd of July, 1919, which is in the form of a cheque for $4,000, drawn upon the respondent batik by Achille Picard, payable to the order of \u201cMinistre de la Voirie.\u201d This instrument bears stamped upon it a legend purporting to be an acceptance by the respondent bank, dated the 2nd of July, 1921 (two years later than the date of the cheque), and authenticated by what are admitted to be the initials of the manager of the respondent\u2019s branch at Beauharnois on the day on which the cheque is dated. This cheque (so called), for reasons about to be mentioned, cannot take effect as a cheque and must, in point of law, if it have any validity at all as against the respondent bank, be treated as an ordinary bill of exchange.\nOn or about the day of its date (2nd July, 1919), the cheque was deposited with the Minister of Roads as security for the performance by Picard of a contract with the municipality of Beauharnois for constructing a certain public road. The acceptance which it bears was stamped upon it by or by the authority of the local manager of the respondent bank, and initialed by him on the day of its date, for the purpose of enabling Picard, who was a customer of the branch, to comply with the terms of the contract, which required the deposit of a marked cheque for the purpose above mentioned. In point of fact, Picard at the time had no funds available for the payment of the cheque.\nPicard\u2019s contract was transferred to his brothers, Picard & Fr\u00e8res, who failed to complete the work, and became insolvent. In May, 1922, an arrangement was made for the completion of the road by the appellant, and a contract was accordingly entered into between the appellant and the municipality, with the approval of the Minister of Roads, who was concerned as the head of the department having the administration and dispensation of moneys advanced by the province to municipalities for the construction of such works, under the authority of the \u201cgood roads\u201d legislation. It was, the appellant alleges, one of the terms of the arrangement that, on the completion of the work to the satisfaction of the \u201cMinistre de la Voirie,\u201d the cheque deposited by Picard should be delivered to the appellant as consideration, in part, for the performance of his contract with the municipality. On the completion of the contract, the cheque was transferred, and payment having been demanded from the respondent bank, the bank disputed liability on the ground, among others, that the acceptance of the cheque by the local manager was fraudulent, and without authority. The question of the authority of the local manager to bind the bank by such an acceptance is the only question which need be considered.\nA \u201ccheque\u201d is defined by the Bills of Exchange Act (s. 165) as \u201ca bill of exchange drawn on a bank, payable on demand.\u201d The order in question, as accepted, is obviously not payable on demand, and consequently is not a cheque within this definition.\nThe authority of the local bank manager to mark a customer\u2019s cheque as accepted when the customer has funds sufficient to meet it, is, of course, not disputed; and as the acceptance of cheques in such circumstances is within the ordinary course of the manager\u2019s duty it may be assumed that such an acceptance would be binding upon the bank, even though in fact there were no such funds and no credit upon which the customer was entitled to draw, and although consequently, the manager, as between himself and his principal, the bank, by accepting the cheque in such circumstances, was acting in excess of his authority. But there is a wide difference between the acceptance of a cheque implying the existence of such funds or credit at the time of the acceptance, and the acceptance with which we are concerned on this appeal. A post-dated acceptance obviously does not imply the existence of any such funds or credit at the date of the acceptance. To anybody in whose hands it may come before the arrival of the date, it says nothing whatever upon that subject, and the proper interpretation of it would appear to be that the instrument, in form a cheque when drawn, has by the bank and the drawer been treated not as a cheque but as an ordinary bill of exchange, and accepted as such.\nIt may be assumed that the manager of a branch of a chartered Canadian bank is placed in the position he holds to perform for the bank all acts appertaining in the ordinary course to the business of the branch. Acts performed within that sphere are, as between the bank and third persons, as a rule, the acts of the bank. Any special limitation of authority or special instructions do not affect third persons, unless they are aware of them. The ostensible authority of the manager extends to all such acts. Article 1730 of the Civil Code embodies the principle upon which the common law rule proceeds, and in this respect there can be no difference between: the principles of law prevailing in Quebec and those of the common law.\nIt may be assumed that the Department of Roads received the cheque and accepted it as security without meticulous inspection of the terms of the acceptance. But the action is based upon the bank\u2019s acceptance, and the appellant can only succeed, if at all, in virtue of the rights of the Minister, since the instrument had been long overdue when it was transferred to the appellant. The Minister could only recover against the bank in this action upon the instrument as it is; and his rights can be no higher than they would have been if the exact form of the bank\u2019s acceptance had been noted. It may be added that the instrument on its face bore unmistakable evidence that it was drawn and accepted for the purpose for which it was in fact being used. If the department had observed the real nature of the instrument and had given thought to the matter at all, it must have been apparent that what was being offered as security for the performance of Picard\u2019s contract was a bill of exchange drawn for that purpose and accepted with the same purpose by the manager of the Beauharnois branch of the respondent bank; and the question for decision therefore is whether the acceptance of bills of exchange generally, for accommodation and otherwise, is within the ordinary course of the business of a branch bank, and as such, within the ostensible authority of the local manager.\nIt seems impossible, from the record before us, to give an answer to this question in the affirmative. An authority to accept cheques in the ordinary way is not, although a cheque is a bill of exchange of a particular kind, an authority to accept bills of exchange. Forster v. MacKreth [1]. No evidence was offered indicating that the acceptance of bills of exchange is one of the duties included in the ordinary conduct of a branch bank by the manager of such a branch. In Re The Southport and West Lancashire Banking Company[2], the Court of Appeal had to consider the question whether it was within the ordinary scope of a branch bank manager\u2019s authority to guarantee the payment of a draft. The question was answered in the negative; and according to the report in the Times Law Reports, Lord Justice Bowen said:\u2014\nIf the giving of the guarantee was not authorized by the memorandum of association the whole thing was at an end. His Lordship would not express any opinion as to the effect of the memorandum, but would assume that the transaction came within the general words. Still it did not follow that this was a kind of business which the directors had authorized the manager to engage in. In order to find out what the authority of a bank manager was (which was often a difficult matter) regard must be had to his position. Did the ordinary authority of a bank manager include such a transaction as this? This was a question of fact. There was no evidence that such a transaction was within the ordinary authority of a bank manager, and there was no evidence of any special authority.\nThis reasoning seems applicable to the question before us.\nOn this ground the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRinfret J. (dissenting).\u2014Le ch\u00e8que pour lequel l\u2019appelant demande jugement contre la Banque d\u2019Hochelaga a \u00e9t\u00e9 souscrit \u00e0 Beauharnois le 2 juillet 1919, \u00e0 Tordre du ministre de la voirie, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 certifi\u00e9 par la banque au moyen d\u2019une griffe m\u00e9canique en encre grasse dont le libell\u00e9 est ainsi con\u00e7u:\nBanque d\u2019Hoohelaga\nAccept\u00e9\nJuil. 2, 1921\nBeauharnois, P.Q.\nCe ch\u00e8que avait ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au minist\u00e8re de la voirie par Achille Picard pour garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son contrat avec la paroisse de Saint-Cl\u00e9ment de Beauharnois\npour le pavage d\u2019une route appel\u00e9e chemin de la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Louis.\nLe contrat n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au dossier; mais nous savons qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une convention en vertu de la Loi des bons chemins, 1912. D\u2019apr\u00e8s cette loi, les municipalit\u00e9s rurales, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une entente au pr\u00e9alable avec le d\u00e9partement de la voirie, re\u00e7oivent du gouvernement de la province le montant n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la confection de leurs chemins, apr\u00e8s avoir adopt\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 cet effet. Les sommes requises pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux ordonn\u00e9s sont pay\u00e9es de temps en temps par le tr\u00e9sorier de la province, sur un certificat du ministre de la voirie, ou de son sous-ministre, et les travaux sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par la municipalit\u00e9 sous la surveillance et la direction d\u2019un officier du d\u00e9partement de la voirie \u00e0 ce autoris\u00e9 par le ministre.\nLa municipalit\u00e9 doit faire au ministre un rapport mensuel, attest\u00e9 sous serment, indiquant les travaux qui sont termin\u00e9s, le montant d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des deniers d\u00e9pens\u00e9s et le montant des deniers qui ne sont pas encore d\u00e9pens\u00e9s. Toute balance de deniers non employ\u00e9s provenant des sommes fournies par le gouvernement doit \u00eatre retourn\u00e9e\nau tr\u00e9sorier de la province pour \u00eatre vers\u00e9e au fonds consolid\u00e9 du revenu de la province.\nLe seul engagement financier de la part de la municipalit\u00e9 est de payer annuellement, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque fix\u00e9e par le tr\u00e9sorier de la province, trois pour cent d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur la somme indiqu\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9solution contenant la demande de fonds au gouvernement.\nOn constate donc que le d\u00e9partement de la voirie est le principal int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans le c\u00f4t\u00e9 financier des contrats ainsi faits pour l\u2019am\u00e9lioration des chemins; et, bien que ni le contrat entre Picard et la corporation de Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, ni le r\u00e8glement et la r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9s par cette derni\u00e8re, n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 produits, et bien que chacun de ces documents e\u00fbt sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 de nature \u00e0 verser de la lumi\u00e8re sur la question, il est facile de comprendre pourquoi le ch\u00e8que remis par Picard en m\u00eame temps que sa soumission pour les travaux du chemin a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du ministre de la voirie et transmis \u00e0 ce dernier par la municipalit\u00e9. Ce ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 prenait la place d\u2019un cautionnement en argent.\nComme tel, il avait une consid\u00e9ration suffisante pour lui donner validit\u00e9 (Loi des Lettres de Change, art. 53) entre les mains du ministre de la voirie qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il l\u2019a re\u00e7u, n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 notifi\u00e9 d\u2019aucun vice affectant le titre du c\u00e9dant (Loi des Lettres de Change, art. 56). Ayant re\u00e7u le ch\u00e8que de bonne foi et contre valeur, le ministre en devenait un d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier; et la lettre \u00e9crite plus tard, le 13 avril 1923, par le secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la banque ne pouvait affecter cette situation. Quelles qu\u2019aient pu \u00eatre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard les relations l\u00e9gales (que le dossier ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas) entre le ministre de la voirie et la municipalit\u00e9, quelle qu\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 la position du ministre vis-\u00e0-vis de Picard, ces relations ne concernaient pas la banque. En certifiant le ch\u00e8que de Picard, et en l\u2019acceptant (pour employer l\u2019expression du libell\u00e9), elle avait pris un engagement sans condition de payer le d\u00e9tenteur du ch\u00e8que \u00e0 la date fix\u00e9e dans son acceptation (Loi des Lettres de Change, articles 165 et 17).\nPar cons\u00e9quent, au moment o\u00f9 le d\u00e9tenteur du ch\u00e8que l\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque, l\u2019obligation de paiement par cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 aucune restriction. Il semble, en tout cas, certain qu\u2019il n\u2019appartenait pas \u00e0 la banque de soulever pour son propre compte la pr\u00e9tention que les conditions de la garantie ne s\u2019\u00e9taient pas accomplies, et que le ch\u00e8que n\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquis au ministre, lorsque ni Picard, ni la municipalit\u00e9 n\u2019intervenaient dans la cause pour soulever ce d\u00e9bat.\nIl ne nous para\u00eet pas, pour ces raisons, que les motifs donn\u00e9s par le majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi peuvent \u00eatre accueillis. La banque ne pouvait refuser le paiement du ch\u00e8que en invoquant des arguments qui ne regardaient que les parties au contrat pour travaux du chemin. Le d\u00e9partement de la voirie all\u00e9guait que le montant du ch\u00e8que avait d\u00fb \u00eatre employ\u00e9 pour terminer les travaux. Ni le souscripteur, ni la municipalit\u00e9 ne contestaient cela. La banque, qui s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 payer sans condition, pouvait encore moins offrir cette d\u00e9fense. D\u2019ailleurs les faits ne la justifiaient pas.\nPour en reprendre le r\u00e9cit:\nLe 7 janvier 1921, Achille Picard transporta \u00e0 L\u00e9andre Picard fils, F\u00e9lix Picard et Clodomir Picard, tous ses droits dans le contrat avec la paroisse de Saint-Cl\u00e9ment\net aussi le montant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par le dit Achille Picard an d\u00e9partement de la voirie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec pour garantir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux ordonn\u00e9s par les dits contrats.\nCet acte de transport d\u00e9clare:\nQue les dits L\u00e9andre Picard, fils, Clodomir et F\u00e9lix Picard) se sont port\u00e9s cautions pour le dit Achille Picard \u00e0 la Banque d\u2019Hochelaga, de la ville de Beauharnois, pour permettre \u00e0 ce dernier de donner les garanties exig\u00e9s par le d\u00e9partement de la voirie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et aussi pour lui aider \u00e0 obtenir les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour faire le chemin.\nIl d\u00e9clare \u00e9galement qu\u2019Achille Picard a c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque d\u2019Hochelaga tout montant qui pourrait lui \u00eatre d\u00fb par la paroisse de Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, pour garantir la banque des montants\nqu\u2019elle pourrait fournir au dit Achille Picard pour la confection du chemin.\nCe contrat fait partie des pi\u00e8ces produites \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate; mais l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 d\u2019en savoir davantage de la banque; et cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a fourni, par la suite, aucun \u00e9claircissement sur les d\u00e9clarations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent. On chercherait en vain dans le reste du dossier une allusion aux garanties que la banque aurait obtenues pour permettre \u00e0 Achille Picard de fournir son cautionnement au d\u00e9partement de la voirie.\nOn constate cependant que L\u00e9andre Picard fils et ses deux, associ\u00e9s \u00e9taient devenus les cessionnaires du montant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par Achille Picard entre les mains du ministre de la voirie et que, par contre, ils s\u2019\u00e9taient charg\u00e9s\nde payer \u00e0 la Banque d\u2019Hochelaga les montants avanc\u00e9s au dit Achille Picard et \u00e0 cette fin de respecter le transport qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 la banque par ce dernier.\nLa corporation de Saint-Cl\u00e9ment avait consenti \u00e0 la substitution de L\u00e9andre Picard fils et al. \u00e0 Achille Picard, sans lib\u00e9rer Achille Picard de ses obligations, ni perdre aucun de ses droits en garantie.\nPlus tard, L\u00e9andre Picard fils, F\u00e9lix Picard et Clodomir Picard firent faillite et renonc\u00e8rent au contrat. Achille Picard refusa de le reprendre, ce dont d\u2019ailleurs il paraissait incapable, et l\u2019entreprise fut confi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelant par la municipalit\u00e9 le 26 mai 1922.\nLa r\u00e9solution du conseil municipal de Saint-Cl\u00e9ment, octroyant \u00e0 l\u2019appelant la compl\u00e9tion du contrat, devait \u00eatre approuv\u00e9e par le ministre de la voirie. Ce dernier a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 comme suit:\nL\u2019une des consid\u00e9rations de la terminaison des travaux par Leduc \u00e9tait que s\u2019il terminait les travaux, aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019ils seraient accept\u00e9s par le d\u00e9partement, je lui remettrais ce ch\u00e8que en consid\u00e9ration de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux, comme partie du prix.\nAilleurs, il dit:\nC\u2019\u00e9tait la condition essentielle pour la compl\u00e9tion du chemin.\nCette convention n\u2019avait rien d\u2019incompatible avec le contrat donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant par la corporation municipale; et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9, comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9, que le montant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le ch\u00e8que a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter le chemin, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 dans ce but, et que le ch\u00e8que a \u00e9t\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence, remis \u00e0 Leduc par le d\u00e9partement de la voirie.\nL\u2019appelant a tous les droits du ministre de la voirie, et la question est de savoir si la banque e\u00fbt pu refuser le paiement du ch\u00e8que \u00e0 ce dernier. La raison qu\u2019elle invoque pour justifier son refus est qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 le timbre d\u2019acceptation a \u00e9t\u00e9 appos\u00e9 sur le ch\u00e8que, Picard n\u2019avait pas en d\u00e9p\u00f4t des fonds suffisants pour le rencontrer; que, en plus, le timbre d\u2019acceptation\npouvait au plus signifier une acceptation dans deux ans \u00e0 venir\net que cet engagement de la d\u00e9fenderesse\n\u00e9tait ultra vires, ill\u00e9gal et en dehors des op\u00e9rations ordinaires des banques.\nLe ch\u00e8que a \u00e9t\u00e9 certifi\u00e9 en 1919, et c\u2019est la Loi des Banques de 1913 qui s\u2019applique (3-4 Geo. V, c 9). Par l\u2019art. 76,\nLa banque peut,\u2014\n(a) ouvrir des succursales, agences et bureaux;\n(b) faire le commerce des esp\u00e8ces et lingots d\u2019or et d\u2019argent;\n(c) faire le commerce de l\u2019argent, en escompter et pr\u00eater, et faire des avances sur la garantie de lettres de change, billets \u00e0 ordre ou au porteur, et autres effets n\u00e9gociables, ou sur la garantie des actions, obligations et debentures de corporations municipales et autres, qu\u2019elles-soient garanties par hypoth\u00e8ques ou autrement, ou sur celle des effets publics et autres du Canada, des provinces, du Royaume Uni ou de l\u2019\u00e9tranger; et\n(d) faire telles autres op\u00e9rations qui se rattachent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au commerce de banque.\nUne banque est, entre autres choses, un pr\u00eateur d\u2019argent. Elle fait le commerce de l\u2019argent. Ce commerce comprend l\u2019acceptation ou l\u2019\u00e9mission, en \u00e9change d\u2019argent, d\u2019effets n\u00e9gociables en vertu desquels la banque reconna\u00eet son obligation de payer le d\u00e9tenteur.\nIl est d\u2019usage courant, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec; mais, au besoin, la preuve d\u00e9montre que les banques acceptent des ch\u00e8ques sans qu\u2019il y ait de fonds pour les payer et mettent ainsi le compte de leur client \u00e0 d\u00e9couvert.\nC\u2019est une forme d\u2019escompte * * * Au lieu de lui faire une avance ou un escompte sur billet, on le fait sous cette forme-l\u00e0, en le laissant soutirer son compte.\nCela se faisait \u00e0 la Banque d\u2019Hochelaga; et, en particulier, \u00e0 sa succursale de Beauharnois.\nIl est \u00e9galement de pratique universelle pour les banques sur le continent am\u00e9ricain de certifier des ch\u00e8ques, en y apposant\nune mention signifiant que le ch\u00e8que est bon pour la somme \u00e0 concurrence de laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9.\nCette pratique n\u2019est gu\u00e8re r\u00e9pandue en France et elle est diff\u00e9rente du proc\u00e9d\u00e9 connu en Angleterre sous le nom de \u201cmarking of cheques\u201d et qui\nconsiste, lorsqu\u2019un ch\u00e8que est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque charg\u00e9e de l\u2019encaissement trop tardivement pour parvenir utilement \u00e0 la chambre de compensation \u00e0 laquelle elle est affili\u00e9e, \u00e0 faire rev\u00eatir le titre par le banquier tir\u00e9 de la mention Bon \u00e0 payer destin\u00e9e \u00e0 attester que le ch\u00e8que sera pay\u00e9 le lendemain.\n(J. Bouteron, Le Ch\u00e8que, pp. 341-2; Grant, Law of Banking, 7e \u00e9d., pp. 42-43; Paget, The Law of Banking, 3e \u00e9d., p. 190 et suiv.).\nLa pratique de \u201cpost-dater\u201d un effet n\u00e9gociable ou de lui donner une acceptation \u201crestreinte quant au temps\u201d est sanctionn\u00e9e par la loi (Loi des lettres de change\u2014Arts. 27d et 38c) et il n\u2019y a donc, dans le ch\u00e8que accept\u00e9 sans fonds et pour une date ult\u00e9rieure, rien d\u2019anormal, d\u2019irr\u00e9gulier ou d\u2019ill\u00e9gal.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cette date recul\u00e9e de deux ans \u00e9tait m\u00eame assez logique et naturelle. On savait que le ch\u00e8que \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir un cautionnement pour des travaux d\u2019une certaine dur\u00e9e. Il \u00e9tait possible que le ch\u00e8que ne serait jamais encaiss\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait, au moins, vraisemblable que les fonds qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sentait ne seraient pas requis avant longtemps. En fait, on n\u2019en a demand\u00e9 le paiement \u00e0 la banque que le 26 novembre 1923. En le marquant payable le 2 juillet 1921, la banque s\u2019assurait qu\u2019elle ne serait pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9bourser les fonds avant deux ans. Tout ce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 faire \u00e9tait de prendre ses mesures pour honorer ce ch\u00e8que lorsqu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour paiement \u00e0 la date de son acceptation ou subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 cette date. La transaction qui nous occupe \u00e9tait donc strictement dans les limites des pouvoirs d\u2019une banque; et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019un tel engagement de sa part, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un officier d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9, serait ultra vires.\nIl ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 consid\u00e9rer si elle peut se soustraire \u00e0 cet engagement sous pr\u00e9texte que l\u2019acceptation du ch\u00e8que aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le g\u00e9rant d\u2019une succursale contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 restreinte qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par les r\u00e8glements internes de la banque.\nCes r\u00e8glements n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en preuve. La banque s\u2019est content\u00e9e d\u2019offrir le t\u00e9moignage du g\u00e9rant actuel de sa succursale \u00e0 Beauharnois, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une acceptation de ce genre ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 sa connaissance et qu\u2019un g\u00e9rant de succursale\u2014comme celui qui avait certifi\u00e9 le ch\u00e8que\u2014n\u2019avait pas le droit de faire de son chef une avance de cette importance sans en r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au bureau principal. Mais l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du t\u00e9moin offert par la banque est \u00e9videmment tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e et ne saurait faire preuve de l\u2019usage et de la coutume dans le commerce de banque au Canada ou m\u00eame dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nSon t\u00e9moignage fait voir cependant que, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8glements internes de la banque, un client d\u00e9sireux de faire la transaction dont il s\u2019agit devait s\u2019adresser au g\u00e9rant de la succursale de Beauharnois, qui en aurait r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au bureau principal de la banque, et que la r\u00e9ponse de ce bureau aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise au client par le g\u00e9rant de la succursale. Dans ce cas, si la r\u00e9ponse du bureau principal \u00e9tait affirmative, il n\u2019est pas douteux que la responsabilit\u00e9 de la banque e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 indiscutable.\nMais il semble \u00e9vident que si les formalit\u00e9s indiqu\u00e9es par le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont exigibles dans les rapports entre le bureau principal et le g\u00e9rant local d\u2019une succursale, il n\u2019en est pas ainsi vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers. Le client, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, et surtout le public, et en particulier le d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier d\u2019un effet n\u00e9gociable qui engage la banque, ont le droit de traiter avec le g\u00e9rant d\u2019une succursale suivant son autorisation apparente. (Cox v. Canadian Bank of Commerce[3]; Bryant v. La Banque du Peuple[4].\nUne succursale de banque n\u2019est pas une agence.\nLe bureau principal d\u2019une banque, avec ses succursales, ne forme qu\u2019une seule et m\u00eame personne juridique ayant dans chaque endroit la m\u00eame situation l\u00e9gale et occupant la m\u00eame position au point de vue juridique, soit dans ses rapports avec les tiers, soit dans les rapports des tiers avec elle. Lafontaine J. in re Brunette v. Ostiguy[5].\nLa banque, \u00e0 sa succursale, agit par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son g\u00e9rant local. C\u2019est \u00e0 lui que le client et le public ont affaire. La banque le repr\u00e9sente comme l\u2019officier charg\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ses pouvoirs et investi \u00e0 cet effet de toutes les autorisations requises. Art. 1730 C.C.; Merchant National Bank of Boston v. State National Bank of Boston[6]. Son mandat apparent semble donc \u00eatre d\u2019accomplir \u00e0 la succursale tous les actes qui sont du ressort d\u2019une banque. Les r\u00e8glements ne sauraient affecter les tiers qui ne les connaissent pas; et ces tiers ont, en plus, le droit d\u2019assumer que le g\u00e9rant de la succursale, dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions, a suivi les r\u00e8glements qui lui \u00e9taient impos\u00e9s par le bureau principal. Montreal & St. Lawrence Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Robert[7].\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019apposition du certificat d\u2019acceptation sur le ch\u00e8que de Picard, que la banque avait le droit de faire dans l\u2019exercice de ses pouvoirs, devait, dans le cours ordinaire des choses, \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e par le g\u00e9rant de la succursale de Beauharnois. Un tiers de bonne foi qui recevait cette acceptation \u00e9tait justifiable de supposer qu\u2019avant de l\u2019accorder ce g\u00e9rant s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 aux r\u00e8glements de sa banque.\nSi, pour d\u00e9finir les pouvoirs du g\u00e9rant d\u2019une succursale de banque, il fallait s\u2019en rapporter \u00e0 la preuve de l\u2019usage, cela devrait s\u2019entendre de l\u2019usage local. Ainsi s\u2019exprimait le baron Parke:\nIt may differ in different parte of the country. The nature of this power and duty in any instance is a question of fact and is to be determined by the usage and course of dealing in the particular place. Foster v. Pearson[8].\nUn usage qui, en Angleterre, avait besoin d\u2019\u00eatre prouv\u00e9 peut fort bien \u00eatre notoire aux Etats-Unis ou au Canada. Par exemple, on ne se croirait pas oblig\u00e9, dans notre pays, de prouver la coutume d\u2019accepter des ch\u00e8ques, ce qui s\u2019effectue ici par un employ\u00e9 subalterne dans la plus infime des succursales.\nMais, comme le dit lord Campbell, in re Bank of Australasia v. Breillat[9].\nThe nature of the business of bankers is a part of the law merchant and is to be judicially noticed by the court.\nLa transaction qui nous occupe est une affaire de banque et d\u00e9coule de la nature des fonctions d\u2019un g\u00e9rant de banque. La Banque Nationale v. The City Bank[10]. Il \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 virtute officii. L\u2019affaire rentrait suffisamment dans la cat\u00e9gorie de celles qu\u2019il transigeait habituellement, m\u00eame si la m\u00e9thode sp\u00e9ciale adopt\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait moins usit\u00e9e.\nCar il ne faut pas oublier que le ch\u00e8que entre les mains du ministre de la voirie portait le timbre d\u2019acceptation de la banque sans indication sp\u00e9ciale qu\u2019il y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appos\u00e9 par un agent, et que ce timbre \u00e9tait, dans l\u2019usage courant, la signature de la banque adopt\u00e9e pour tous les ch\u00e8ques qu\u2019elle certifiait. Cette signature \u00e9tait imprim\u00e9e sur le ch\u00e8que au moyen de la griffe m\u00e9canique qu\u2019elle avait elle-m\u00eame remise \u00e0 la succursale \u00e0 cette fin et dont cette derni\u00e8re se servait dans le cours ordinaire des affaires. Entre les mains d\u2019un d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier, cette acceptation voulait dire que la banque s\u2019engageait elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 payer le montant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le ch\u00e8que, \u00e0 la date indiqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019acceptation. La banque repr\u00e9sentait au d\u00e9tenteur qu\u2019elle avait mis \u00e0 part les fonds suffisants pour rencontrer le ch\u00e8que \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance et ajoutait son cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 celui du souscripteur. Gaden v. The Newfoundland Savings Bank[11]; The Exchange Bank of Canada v. La Banque du Peuple[12].\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, dans les deux causes de The Exchange Bank of Canada v. La Banque du Peuple[13] et Brunette v. Ostiguy[14], cite avec approbation les extraits suivants de Morse, On banks and banking, et Daniel, On negotiable instruments. Morse, 2\u00e8me \u00e9d., n\u00b0 309:\nThe practice of certifying checks has grown out of the business needs of the country. They enable the holder to keep or convey the amount specified with safety. They enable persons not well acquainted to deal promptly with each other, and they avoid the delay and risks of receiving, counting and passing from hand to hand large sums of money * * * If the bank only accepts or certifies generally, its obligation is to pay at any time when the holder may make demand. But if the acceptance is to pay at a future day certain, then the transaction, as between the bank and the drawer, is equivalent to a loan of the amount, made by the drawer, to the bank, for the period intervening between the acceptance and the date named for payment. Bank of England v. Anderson[15].\nDaniel, On negotiable instruments, vol. 2:\nNo. 1603.\u2014A bank by certifying a cheque becomes the principal debtor * * * Nor can it say that there were in fact no funds of the drawer to meet the cheque, for its certificate, is an assurance that there were such funds, and that it will apply them for that purpose. These doctrines are now universally settled, and the United States Supreme Court has declared that it could not inflict a severer blow upon the commerce and business of the country than by throwing a doubt upon them * * *\nNo. 1606b. Ordinarily the certification states no time of payments, and the check is then payable instantly on demand; but if the certificate specify a future day of payment, it is binding between the bank and\u2019 the holder receiving it.\nOn y cite aussi Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure, vol. 5, p. 541:\nThe certification of a cheque implies that the cheque is drawn on sufficient funds in the drawer\u2019s possession, that they have been set apart for its payment, and that they will be thus applied when the cheque is presented for that purpose. Dans chacune des causes de The Exchange Bank v. La Banque du Peuple[16] et de Brunette v. Ostiguy[17], il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi que la r\u00e9ception d\u2019un ch\u00e8que accept\u00e9 par une banque lib\u00e9rait le tireur et constituait un paiement par ce dernier au tir\u00e9.\nEn appliquant cette jurisprudence \u00e0 la cause actuelle, le ch\u00e8que de Picard devenait donc, entre les mains du ministre de la voirie, l\u2019engagement direct de la Banque d\u2019Hochelaga. C\u2019est par le moyen de ce ch\u00e8que que le cautionnement \u00e9tait fourni, et le ministre avait le droit de compter que la banque, qui avait remis le ch\u00e8que en circulation, l\u2019avait accept\u00e9 suivant toutes les formalit\u00e9s requises par ses r\u00e8glements internes et qu\u2019elle avait pris les garanties n\u00e9cessaires pour s\u2019assurer les fonds requis pour le rencontrer. Il n\u2019y avait rien dans tout cela de nature \u00e0 faire na\u00eetre raisonnablement dans l\u2019esprit d\u2019un d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier un soup\u00e7on contre la validit\u00e9 du ch\u00e8que.\nComme le dit le juge Cross, dans Exchange Bank v. Banque du Peuple[18]:\nIt was said to be supported by authority that a post dated cheque was a suspicious cheque. But the cheques in question here are not post dated cheques; the bank says in effect, \u201cthe cheque is good, but we will only pay it next week, or as the case may be.\u201d This does not indicate that the drawer has no funds; it rather indicates, to my mind, that the bank was not prepared to pay so large a sum at once.\nPour ces raisons, je conclurais \u00e0 l\u2019infirmation du jugement rendu par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi; et, d\u2019accord avec l\u2019honorable juge Dorion, je maintiendrais le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perron, Taschereau, Vall\u00e9e, Genest & Perron.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Geoffrion & Prud\u2019homme.\n[1] [1867] L.R. 2 Ex. 163.\n[2] [1885] 1 T.L.R., p. 204, at p. 205.\n[3] [1912] 46 Can.

Adams and Others (Mis-en-cause)\n1925: November 2, 3; 1925: December 10.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSale\u2014Litigious rights\u2014Retrait\u2014Absolute tender\u2014Conditional tender void\u2014Arts. 1576, 1582, 1583, 1584 C.C.\nThe debtor wishing to exercise the retrait of litigious rights must make an unconditional tender of the amount owed to the buyer in payment of \u201cthe price and incidental expenses of the sale, with interest, etc.\u201d (Art. 1582 C.C.).\nA tender of that amount by the debtor to the buyer so made that it would be paid to him upon his signing a deed of sale of the property acquired, is not valid within the terms of Art. 1582 C.C.\nThe sole effect of the retrait is that the debtor assumes the bargain (le march\u00e9) of the buyer of the litigious right, so that the debtor is merely substituted for and subrogated to the buyer; therefore, the buyer is not bound to sign a deled of sale, as, in doing so, he would subject himself to legal warranty of the rights sold (Art. 1576 C.C).\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondents\u2019 plea, by which they exercised the retrait of litigious rights in answer to appellant\u2019s action claiming ownership, and asking for the partition, of a certain property.\u2014Appeal allowed with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nSt. Laurent K.C. for the appellant.\nKelly K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench confirming, Mr. Justice Allard dissentiente and Mr. Justice Flynn dubitante, the judgment of the Superior Court, D\u2019Auteuil J., which gave effect to the respondents plea of litigious rights and dismissed the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe facts which gave rise to this litigation are as follows:\nDavid Kaine and his wife Sarah McDonald, it is alleged, were married in Ireland. They came to Canada and settled in Restigouche in the county of Bonaventure, Lower Canada, where their two children, David Kaine, whom I will call David Kaine, Jr., and Margaret Kaine, who subsequently married John McNaughton, were baptized, the former when aged nine months on the 13th of July, 1851, and the latter when aged eight months on the 7th of August, 1853. The filiation and legitimacy of these two children are proved by their acts of birth, inscribed in the registers of civil status (art, 228 C.C.), and of which copies are in the record. It is objected that there is no proof of the marriage of David Kaine, Sr., and Sarah McDonald, but they lived together as man and wife for some thirty years and had undoubtedly the status of married people. I do not think the respondents have any interest to deny the marriage of Kaine, Sr., and Sarah McDonald, for their title to the property comes through David Kaine, Jr., and any title of the latter must have been as heir-at-law of his father and mother, for, as I will show later, he had no title by prescription. David Kaine, Sr., and Sarah McDonald must also be presumed to have married under the matrimonial regime of community of property, nothing to the contrary having been shewn (art. 1260 C.C.). David Kaine, Sr., died on the 14th of November, 1880, and Sarah McDonald on the 13th of October, 1894.\nIt is alleged that David Kaine, Sr., acquired in 1868 the immovable property here in question, the east half of lot 17, first range, river Metapedia, township of Restigouche, which I will hereafter call the property, under a location ticket, but that this location ticket has been lost. However, on the 15th and 16th of March, 1893, two letters-patent granting the property were issued to David Kaine, Sr., and all the courts have held that this was a grant to David Kaine, the husband of Sarah McDonald (although he was then deceased), and not to his son David Kaine, Jr. Apparently the latter had not advised the Crown Lands department of his father\u2019s death, and the . letters patent would naturally issue to the father, if, as is alleged, he was the holder of the location ticket of 1868. I will, like the courts below, take it as sufficiently established that David Kaine, Sr., was the owner of the property, which fell into the community between his wife and himself, and on his death intestate he left an undivided half of it in his succession. The other undivided half belonged to Sarah McDonald as having been common as to property with her husband, and on her death intestate was also left in her succession. The two children, David, Jr., and Margaret, were the sole heirs of their father and mother, and took the immovable, first as to one half and subsequently as to the other half, in undivided ownership.\nOn the 26th of November, 1913, David Kaine, Jr., entered into a contract of sale with Sherman Moreland Adams, whereby he purported to sell this property to the latter for $200, declaring that it belonged to him\nin virtue of good titles and by thirty-four years of peaceable possession.\nHe also declared that the property was entirely free from all mortgages and incumbrances whatever. In my opinion, his only title was as heir to his father and mother and extended solely to an undivided half of the property although he purported to sell the whole.\nOn the 20th of August, 1920, Margaret Kaine, authorized by her husband, John McNaughton, by a writing under private seal, in consideration of the sum of one dollar, sold to the appellant, James McNaughton, all her\nright, title and interest in and to this, property.\nAt the time she entered into this contract, Margaret Kaine, as heir of her father and mother, was owner of one undivided half of the property.\nS. M. Adams, on the 2nd of September, 1920, sold this property, as if he owned the whole, to the present respondents for $1,000.\nThe appellant\u2019s action was begun on the 30th of April, 1923, by a writ of summons, which was served on the respondents on the 28th of May, 1923. David Kaine, Jr., and Adams were made parties to the case. David Kaine, Jr., contested the action, but his plea was dismissed by the trial court, and as he has not appealed, there is no necessity to consider the position he took.\nThe appellant\u2019s declaration, which is a very long one containing no less than 67 paragraphs, can be shortly summarized by saying that the appellant asks to be declared owner of an undivided half of the property, and prays that it be partitioned between him and the respondents, with the usual conclusions of an action in partition. He also claims from the respondents $3,000 for his share of the fruits derived from the property.\nThe respondents in their plea deny most of the averments of the declaration. They allege that the letters patent were issued in favour of David Kaine, Jr., and not David Kaine, Sr.; that Margaret Kaine could not sell the property because it belonged to Adams who subsequently sold it to the respondents, and moreover she sold not the property but only her rights therein which the appellant knew were litigious and had been repudiated by Adams; that the possession of the respondents and that of Adams and David Kaine, Jr., form a total of 44 years, all of which had the necessary requisites for the purpose of prescription; that, if what the appellant states is true (which they deny) then David Kaine, Sr., died intestate and before inheriting the property the appellant and his authors were obliged to cause to be registered a declaration under art. 2098 C.C., and not having done so the transfer set up by the appellant is without effect.\nThen follows what the respondents term a \u201cspecial plea,\u201d which is set up \u201cwithout prejudice in any way to the foregoing.\u201d It alleges that the rights acquired by the appellant from Margaret Kaine were to his knowledge litigious rights. The respondents declare that, without prejudice to their foregoing plea, they take advantage of art. 1582 C.C., and,\nin order to become wholly discharged towards the plaintiff, they are willing to pay him the price he paid for said litigious rights or property, and all incidental expenses of sale with interest\nfrom date of acquisition, which they calculated at $207.02, subject to completing it, if necessary, and they deposit this sum in court. They add that they annex to their plea\na deed of sale to be signed by plaintiff, and they call upon plaintiff to execute same on his being paid by the court the above amount.\nThe respondents\u2019 conclusions are as follows:\nWherefore defendants pray that act be granted of their declaration that they wish to avoid all litigation by paying the aforesaid sum for the aforesaid reasons to plaintiff; that they call upon plaintiff to sign the deed annexed to this plea; that if plaintiff fails so to do, that the deposit of said sum and said deed have the same effect as if the deed were signed by plaintiff, and that said action be therefore dismissed, and in the event of plaintiff further continuing the present action, that it be dismissed with all costs against the plaintiff.\nThe deed of sale annexed to the plea is an ordinary deed of sale by the appellant to the respondents, in consideration of $207.02 to him paid at or before the signing and delivery of the deed, of\nall rights, title and interest in that certain lot, piece or parcel of land and premises situate and lying in the township of Restigouche, known and distinguished as being the east half of lot No. 17 of the first Matapedia range, * * * the whole as conveyed to the said James McNaughton in virtue of a certain deed bearing date the 20th August, 1920, made between himself and Margaret Kaine.\nIn order properly to discuss the questions involved in this appeal, it has seemed preferable to refer in some detail to the position taken by the respondents in their plea. It is obvious that the respondents cannot, on the one hand, contest the claim of the appellant that he is owner of an undivided half of the property, and, on the other hand, at the same time force him to relinquish his bargain on the ground that the right acquired by him was a litigious one (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Saignat, Vente et Echange, no. 940). The appellant contends that this is precisely what the respondents have done by their plea; the latter say that what was alleged in the first part of the plea was merely to shew the litigious character of the right sued on, and they point to their conclusions to demonstrate that the special plea of litigious rights was not a subsidiary but a principal plea.\nBefore expressing an opinion on this point, it will be convenient to cite the three articles of the civil code which deal with the retrait de droits litigieux.\n1582. When a litigious right is sold, he against whom it is claimed is wholly discharged by paying to the buyer the price and incidental expenses of the sale, with interest on the price from the day that the buyer has paid it.\n1583. A right is held to be litigious when it is uncertain, and disputed or disputable by the debtor, whether an action for its recovery is actually pending or is likely to become necessary.\n1584. The provisions contained in article 1582 do not apply:\n(1) When the sale has (been made to a coheir or coproprietor of the right sold;\n(2) When it has been made to a creditor in payment of what is due to him;\n(3) When it has been made to the possessor of a property subject to the litigious right;\n(4) When the judgment of a court has been rendered affirming the right, or when it has been made clear by evidence and is ready for judgment. In order to be litigious, the right sued on must be \u201cuncertain and disputed or disputable by the debtor\u201d; in the French version of art. 1583, \u201cincertain, disput\u00e9 ou disputable.\u201d The feature that should be emphasized here is the uncertainty of the right; the fact merely that it may be disputed, however frivolously, by the debtor does not suffice to make it litigious. The French code (art. 1700) applies a different test and considers a right litigious\nd\u00e8s qu\u2019il y a proc\u00e8s et contestation sur le fond du droit.\nArticle 1584 C.C. differs from art. 1701 of the French code in that its fourth paragraph is not found in the latter. The intention of the codifiers, as stated by them in their report, was to extend art. 1701 by the addition of this paragraph.\nMr. Saint-Laurent, on behalf of the appellant, argued that inasmuch as the transfer in question was made by Mrs. McNaughton (Margaret Kaine) to her own son, the appellant, these articles do not apply. He cited some old French decisions which distinguish between a transfer to a relative and a sale to a stranger.\nIt is of course obvious that what is contemplated here is a right acquired under an onerous title and not by way of gift. In the cases referred to, the transfer was considered as an avancement d\u2019hoirie and, as such, not subject to the retrait. Apart from such a case, I would not think it permissible to introduce into the articles of the code a distinction which is not justified by their language, the more so as a relative as well as a stranger may purchase a litigious claim as a speculation. Where the claim is litigious within the meaning of article 1583 and is acquired under an onerous title, the law presumes that the purchaser, to use the expressions of Pothier, was an \u201cacheteur de process\u201d and that his motive was \u201cl\u2019amour des proc\u00e8s.\u201d It is as to such purchasers that, subject to \u2018art. 1584, the retrait is allowed quite irrespective of their relationship to the seller.\nComing now to the present case, the only way the respondents could exercise the retrait was\nby paying to the buyer (the appellant) the price and incidental expenses of the sale, with interest, etc.\n(art. 1582 C.C.). This called for a tender of the sum involved. Have the respondents fulfilled this condition?\nBy their special plea, as stated above, they made a tender of $207.02, to be paid to the appellant on execution by him of the deed of sale annexed to the plea. This was not an absolute but a conditional tender, and unless the appellant signed the deed of sale he could not obtain the amount tendered. The learned trial judge, in his judgment, held that the appellant was not obliged to sign this deed, and only after the judgment (and if the respondents acquiesced in the elimination of the condition under which their tender was made, which they were not bound to do) was the tender available to the appellant in payment of the amount due him under art. 1582.\nObjection to the respondents\u2019 tender as being conditional was; taken by the appellant in his factum before this court and also at the hearing. The respondents strongly contended that this objection comes too late. They also stated that the point was not taken in the courts below. I am inclined to think, however, that there must have been some question in the trial court as to the claim of the respondents that the appellant was bound to sign the deed of sale in their favour as a condition of obtaining the amount tendered, for in an express consid\u00e9rant of the judgment the trial judge decided that he was not \u201cen droit tenu de signer tel acte.\u201d The objection to the tender is apparent on the face of the record, the appellant\u2019s factum gave ample notice to the respondents that the point would be raised, and I think, we cannot disregard a question of law which is suggested by the mere reading of the respondents\u2019 special plea. There is nothing in the circumstances of this case or in the position taken by the appellant at the trial to show that he acquiesced in the tender as conditionally made by the respondents: Mile End Milling Co. v. Peterborough Cereal Co.[1].\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that the appellant was not bound to sign this deed of sale. Had he signed it, he would have subjected himself to legal warranty of the rights sold (art. 1576 C.C.). I cannot escape the conclusion that the respondents entirely misconceived what is incumbent on a debtor who seeks to defeat a claim of litigious rights by exercising the retrait de droits litigieux. The effect of the retrait is that the debtor assumes the bargain (le march\u00e9) of the buyer of the litigious right, so that the debtor is substituted for and subrogated to the buyer. The latter conveys nothing to the debtor, who merely takes his place and obtains a discharge from the claim by paying to the buyer a the price and incidental expenses of the sale, with interest on the price from the day the buyer paid it. Certainly the debtor cannot demand that the buyer sell him the litigious rights under a deed importing legal warranty.\nThere is no possible doubt on this point. Pothier, Vente, no. 597, says:\u2014\nLe d\u00e9biteur, en remboursant le cessionnaire, e\u2019st admis \u00e0 prendre son march\u00e9. L\u2019achat que le cessionnaire avait fait de la dette litigieuse est d\u00e9truit en la personne de ce cessionnaire, et passe en celle du d\u00e9biteur, qui est cens\u00e9 avoir lui-m\u00eame rachet\u00e9 sa dette du cr\u00e9ancier, et en avoir transig\u00e9 avec lui pour la somme port\u00e9e en la cession.\nTo the same effect, Aubry & Rau, 5th ed., vol. 5, p. 247, note 14 bis, say:\u2014\nL\u2019exercice du retrait n\u2019op\u00e8re pas une r\u00e9trocession au profit du retrayant, mais il a pour effet de substituer r\u00e9troactivement ce dernier au retray\u00e9. Le cessionnaire est cens\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9ancier, et par suite tous les droits qui avaient pu prendre naissance de son chef sur l\u2019objet c\u00e9d\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9vanouissent.\nI am further of opinion that the respondents really contested (au fond) the claim of the appellant that he had acquired the ownership of an undivided half of the property. They allege that the letters patent were granted to David Kaine, Jr., and not to David Kaine, Sr., with the consequence that Margaret Kaine, according to them, never acquired the ownership of an undivided half of the property as heir of her father and mother. They say that the property belonged to David Kaine, Jr., he having acquired it by virtue of his possession dating back over 34 years previous to November 5, 1913, which possession\nhad all the necessary requisites to prescribe the ownership thereof,\nand to that possession they add their own and that of S. M. Adams, making 44 years. They also set up that no declaration of inheritance having been made by the appellant and Margaret Kaine, as required by art. 2098 C.C., the transfer made by the latter to the former is without effect. Their special plea of litigious rights is made \u201cwithout prejudice in any way to the foregoing.\u201d\nThe respondents claim that in their conclusions they have merely asked to be allowed to exercise the retrait. But here again they insist on the appellant signing the deed of sale annexed to their plea as a condition of receiving the amount tendered, and they pray, in the event of the appellant continuing the action, that it be dismissed with costs.\nThere is the further circumstance that, at the trial, the respondents adduced evidence to shew that David Kaine had acquired the ownership of this property by prescription. That was indeed the purpose of the greater part of their testimony, so much so that the trial judge refused to tax in their favour five witnesses (over and above the five allowed them on a single point) called by them on this question of prescription. So to the end of the trial the respondents persisted in contesting the appellant\u2019s title to the rights acquired by him.\nThe result is that this case comes well within the fourth paragraph of art. 1584 C.C. The trial judge, on the evidence and on this claim of prescription set up by the respondents, found as follows:\nConsid\u00e9rant que David Kaine mis en cause a poss\u00e9d\u00e9 le dit immeuble depuis la mort de son p\u00e8re en 1880, en commun avec sa m\u00e8re jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de cette derni\u00e8re, le 13 octobre 1894; qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la mort de sa m\u00e8re il a paru le poss\u00e9der seul jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la vente \u00e0 Adams le 26 novembre 1913; et qu\u2019il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 le poss\u00e9der ainsi durant les deux ann\u00e9es suivantes.\nThe time during which David Kaine, Jr., possessed the property jointly with his mother cannot be counted for the purposes of prescription. This brings us down to 13th of October, 1894, date of the death of Mrs. David Kaine, Sr., for the beginning of any possession that can be claimed on behalf of David Kaine, Jr. The writ was served on the respondents on the 28th of May, 1923, so that, adding to the possession of David Kaine, Jr., that of Adams and of the respondents, less than thirty years elapsed from October 13, 1894, to the date of service. As a consequence, the plea of prescription is not made out. No prescription of ten years under art. 2251 C.C. was alleged, nor could it be in the absence of ten years possession by the respondents and Adams before the institution of this action.\nThe objection of the respondents to the appellant\u2019s title founded on art. 2098 C.C. would equally apply to the title they obtained from David Kaine, Jr., heir for one-half of his father and mother. Article 2098 C.C. does not say that the transfer by an heir who has not registered a declaration of transmission by succession is void, but states that its registration is without effect so long as the right of the acquirer has not been registered. The respondents derive their title from David Kaine, Jr., whose only right came by succession from his father and mother. The appellant gets his title from Margaret Kaine, who also inherited her share from her parents. As I have said, if art. 2098 C.C. is an obstacle for the appellant, it is equally so for the respondents. My opinion, however, is that neither as to the one nor the other is the failure to register the transmission a cause of nullity of the transfers on which they rely, and at any time the required declaration of transmission can be registered, which will give effect to the registration of their transfers.\nThe right of the appellant, to borrow the language of the fourth paragraph of Art. 1584 C.C., which refers to the particular demand in litigation, or the action wherein the retrait is sought to be exercised, Brady v. Stewart[2], has therefore been made clear by evidence and is ready for judgment. This is in no small degree due to the contestation of his claim by the respondents, and it is now established that David Kaine, Jr., and his successors in title never acquired the whole of this property by prescription. If the right transferred to the appellant was ever litigious within the meaning of art. 1583 C.C., it was not so when the case was ready for judgment after the trial, and up to that moment there had not been made a valid tender to the appellant in order to exercise the retrait. The trial court, in my opinion, should not have dismissed the appellant\u2019s action.\nIn his factum, the appellant practically admits that he is not entitled to demand a share of the fruits and revenues of the property on account of the possession in good faith of the respondents (Art. 411 C.C.), but contends that he can claim a half share of the amount received by the respondent for pulpwood cut and removed from the property, this not properly being fruits of the property. Edward Irvine says that he sold from the property about 72 cords of pulp-wood at $18 per cord, making in all $1,296. But Irvine also states that he did not make out of the fruits of the land, pulpwood, crops and everything, enough to pay for the work he put on it. I am not therefore disposed to allow this claim.\nI have deemed it unnecessary to refer to many questions discussed with great learning by the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. What I have said suffices to dispose of the case. Nor do I think it requisite to do more than mention a point discussed by Mr. Justice Howard, as to some uncertainty in the description given to the property by the letters patent. If there be a cloud on the title, it would affect the claim of the respondents as well as of the appellant, but it seems to me that there is no possible doubt with respect to the identity lof the property which the parties took under the grant from the Crown.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and grant the prayer of the appellant for a partition of the property. The plea of the respondents in the trial court should be dismissed with costs of their contestation of the action, including the costs of enqu\u00eate attributable to this contestation. The other costs of the, action, as well as the costs of the partition, should be borne by the appellant and the respondents in equal shares.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Kelly & L\u00e9vesque.\n[1] [1924] S.C.R. 120.\n[2] [1887] 15 Can.
