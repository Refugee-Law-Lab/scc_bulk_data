(Paper Machinery Ltd. v. J. O. Ross Engineering Corpn., [1934] Can. S.C.R. 186, referred to).\nAPPLICATION for settlement of the minutes of the judgment rendered by Rinfret J.[1] dismissing with costs applications by the Trustee in Bankruptcy for special leave to appeal to this Court. The questions had to do with costs of said applications and are sufficiently set out in the judgment now reported and are indicated in the above head-note. J. T: Wilson for T. H. Collings and K. Murphy.\nD. K MacTavish for the Trustee.\nRinfret J.\u2014Upon application for settlement of the minutes of the judgments rendered by me in these matters on the 31st day of October, 1936, I have come to the conclusion that:\n(1) Edward Wilkins was before me in these matters in his capacity of Trustee. In fact, it was objected at the argument that he had no locus standi precisely because he was making the applications in his capacity of Trustee. The argument in respect of the absence of locus standi would have been without any foundation whatever if he had appeared in his personal capacity.\nIt follows that, on the applications on which I gave decisions, on the 31st day of October, 1936, the dismissal with costs could affect him only as Trustee and could not affect him personally.\n(2) Although these are bankruptcy matters and the Supreme Court of Canada is given jurisdiction to hear appeals therein by the Bankruptcy Act (with the aid of the enabling section 44 of the Supreme Court Act), these appeals are nevertheless made to the same Supreme Court of Canada as is organized under the provisions of sections 3 et seq. of the Supreme Court Act and as is given an appellate jurisdiction within and throughout Canada under section 35 thereof.\nAccordingly, upon appeals in bankruptcy matters, the tariff which applies is that provided for in Rules 91 et seq. of the Court and contained in Form I set out in the schedule to these rules. A Judge of this Court is not empowered to adjudicate otherwise.\n(3) I may say, moreover, that the points now raised by counsel on behalf of the respondents Katherine Murphy and Thomas H. Collings (to the effect that the costs should be adjudicated against the Trustee personally and that they should be taxed according to the tariff prevailing in the bankruptcy courts) were not even mentioned in the course of the argument made before me on the applications for special leave to appeal. I consider that they cannot be raised at this stage, where the only question to be decided upon is the settlement of the minutes of the judgments I have delivered on the 31st of October, 1936. When delivering those judgments, I did not intend that the costs should be adjudicated against Mr. Edward Wilkins personally, nor that they should be taxed by the Registrar of the Bankruptcy Court under the tariff prevailing in that court.\nTo ask me now to settle the minutes so as to give such a meaning to my judgments is equivalent to a demand that I should amend my judgments; and I can see no reason for doing so (Paper Machinery Ltd. et al. v. J. O. Ross Engineering Corpn. et al.[2]).\nI, therefore, order that the judgments be settled so that the costs be payable by the Trustee out of the funds in his hands; and I shall fix the fees upon his applications, if and when counsel will come before me for that purpose.\nAs for the further request that certain taxable costs given the Trustee against the debtor Collings, which remain unpaid, should be embraced in the order, so as to entitle Collings to a set-off, it should not be entertained:\n(a) because the matter was not submitted to me in the course of the argument on the application and, therefore, the same reasons apply as given above to refuse to modify my judgment in other respects;\n(b) I do not think costs incurred upon other matters and other proceedings in the course of the bankruptcy should be set off against the costs on the present applications.\nSolicitor for T. H. Collings: Lewis Duncan.\nSolicitors for K. Murphy: Joy & Chitty.\nSolicitors for the Trustee: Ellis & Ellis.\n[1] Ante p. 609.\n[2] [1934] Can. S.C.R. 186.\n"}

C.C.P.\nThe respondent leased to the appellant a property situated in the city of Montreal; and the lease contained, inter alia, the following stipulation under the heading \u201cConditions\u201d: \u201c* * * the lessee binds itself * * * to pay all taxes, assessments and rates general and special which may be imposed on or in respect of the said property * * *\u201d. The parties submitted a stated case, under article 509 & seq. C.C.P., as to whether \u201cthe appellant (was) liable for the payment of * * * church assessment under the provisions of the lease.\u201d\nHeld, Davis J. dissenting, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court (Q.R. 60 K.B. 289), that the church assessment provided for in the Parish and Fabrique Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 195, of which the material provisions are outlined in the judgment of the court, is one of the \u201ctaxes, assessments or rates\u201d in respect to which the parties have stipulated in the above clause of the lease; and, further, that such assessment is a tax in respect of the property leased to the appellant by the respondent.\nPer Davis J. (dissenting): The church assessment, although a tax, assessment or rate imposed on or in respect of the property, is a statutory charge of a special and peculiar sort and is not something which may be fairly presumed to have been understood by the parties to the lease as covered and intended to be covered by the indemnity clause. As a matter of interpretation, the true sense and effect of the language of the clause, read as a whole, does not impose upon the lessee a burden of this sort.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Chase-Casgrain J.[2], condemning the appellant, a lessee, to pay to the Oeuvre et Fabrique de St. Francois d\u2019Assise, Longue Pointe, or to the respondent for the purpose of making payment to the latter, the sum of $2,700, being the first instalment of an assessment for the erection of a church.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. for the appellant.\nA. R. Holden K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014The respondent leased to the appellant a property situated in the city of Montreal, for a period of five years from the first day of October, 1931.\nThe lease contained the following stipulations, under the heading \u201cConditions\u201d:\nThe present lease is made upon the following charges and conditions to the fulfilment of which the lessee binds itself, namely:\u2014\n1\u00b0 From the first day of October nineteen hundred and thirty-one to pay all taxes, assessments and rates general and special which may be imposed on or in respect of the said property, during the said term of five years (excepting the instalments payable after the expiry of the said term, of special taxes payment whereof is permitted to be made over a term of years). The lessee has paid to the city of Montreal the proportion from the first day of October nineteen hundred and thirty-one of the taxes unpaid for the municipal year now current and a similar adjustment will be made at the end of the term in respect of the municipal year then current.\nThe property in question being situated in the parish of St. Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Assise, in Montreal, has become liable, since the execution of the lease, for a church assessment, the first instalment of which, amounting to $2,700, became due and payable by the respondent, as owner of the property, on the 1st of May, 1934.\nThe assessment was duly imposed under an order of the authorized commissioners and by force of the provisions of the Parish and Fabrique Act of the province of Quebec (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 195).\nThe respondent, having received an account for the first instalment of $2,700, requested the appellant to pay the same; but the latter denied that he was liable for it under the provisions of the lease.\nAccordingly the parties agreed to join in submitting the case for decision under art. 509 & seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, stating that the question of law upon which they are at variance is as follows:\nIs the appellant liable for the payment of said instalment of the said church assessment under the provisions of the said lease produced as exhibit number 1?\nThe respondent contended that the church assessment is a fixed \u201ctax, assessment or rate, general or special\u201d referred to in the lease; that this is confirmed by the provision of article 2011 of the Civil Code; that the assessment was imposed on the immovable leased or, in any event, it was imposed in respect of the said property\u2014which is confirmed by the provisions of the Parish and Fabrique Act, and particularly by sections 55, 61, 63, 69 and 87 of that Act. These sections, so it was claimed, make it clear that the assessment in question is an assessment imposed on, or in respect of, the leased property, within the meaning of the stipulation contained in the lease. The appellant, therefore, expressly bound itself to pay the assessment, and the respondent is entitled to a judgment condemning the appellant to pay it. The appellant contended that, under the true construction of the foregoing quoted clause of the lease, the parties intended to deal only with taxes, assessments and rates imposed by the city of Montreal; that the words:\nall taxes, assessments and rates, general and special which may be imposed on or in respect of the said property\nare restricted by the words \u201cgeneral and special\u201d and the words:\nThe lessee has paid to the city of Montreal the proportion from the first day of October nineteen hundred and thirty-one of the taxes unpaid for the municipal year then current\nto taxes, assessments and rates imposed by the city of Montreal; that, under the provisions of the Parish and Fabrique Act, the assessment in question is a tax imposed upon the person and is secured only, and not imposed upon the property; that consequently it is not a tax, assessment or rate imposed on, or in respect of, the property as provided in the lease; that the assessment in question was not imposed upon the respondent until after the execution of the lease and there was no assessment of a similar kind or nature then in existence in so far as the leased property is concerned; that it is unreasonable that the appellant should be compelled to pay the assessment in question, which is an extraordinary charge that could not have been foreseen at the date of the execution of the lease and which increases the annual rental of $12,000 by almost twenty-five per cent; therefore, the appellant prayed that the contention submitted by the respondent be dismissed and that by the judgment to intervene it be declared that the appellant was not liable for either the first instalment or any further instalments of the said church assessment.\nBoth the Superior Court[3] and the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side)[4] have unanimously decided in favour of the respondent\u2019s contention.\nThe question is one of construction both of the material sections of the Parish and Fabrique Act and of the lease, and more particularly of the stipulation contained in par. 1 of the \u201cConditions\u201d of that lease, already quoted above.\nUnder the Act, whenever an order or decree has been made by the ecclesiastical authorities for the location, erection, alteration, removal or repair of a parish church, the majority of the inhabitants, being freeholders interested in such erection or repair, may apply, by petition to the commissioners (appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor under other provisions of the Act), praying that a meeting of the inhabitants of the parish be called to elect three or more trustees to carry out the decree (s. 42).\nThe trustees, having been elected and before entering on the duties of their office, must present a petition to the commissioners, praying that their election be confirmed and that they be authorized to assess the owners of lands and other immovable property, situate within the parish for which they have been elected and to levy the amount of the sum assessed on each person for his portion of the contribution, both for the erection and repairs in question, and for meeting the expenses thereby occasioned and deemed necessary by the said commissioners (s. 46).\nIt is provided, however, that nothing in the Act shall render any class of Protestants or any person whomsoever, other than persons professing the Roman Catholic religion, liable to be assessed or taxed in any manner for the purposes of this Act (s. 58).\nAs soon as the commissioners have made an order approving the election of the trustees and authorizing them to make an assessment and to levy the sums assessed, the trustees draw up an act of assessment comprising a specification of the work to be done and a detailed estimate of the expenses which they deem necessary for the erection or repairs in question; and also an exact statement of all the lands or other immovable property situate in the parish, showing the extent and value of each lot, the name of the real or supposed owner and the proportionate sum of money (and the quantity of materials, if any) which they have assessed on each lot towards the necessary expenses of such erection or repairs.\nThe act of assessment, when completed, is deposited in the parsonage of the parish; public notice of the deposit is given; a day is appointed to consider the act of assessment, when the trustees present the act to the commissioners for homologation; and the commissioners hear, judge and determine between the trustees and the persons interested, by rejecting, modifying or confirming the act of assessment altogether or in part, as they think just and reasonable (s. 55). When the act of assessment has been homologated by the commissioners, the trustees may exact from those assessed the payment of their rates or assessments and may sue for and recover the same (s. 59).\nThe secretary-treasurer of the trustees, in the month of November of each year, prepares a statement showing, in as many columns:\n(a) The names, quality and residence of the persons indebted to the trustees for assessments as set forth in the act of assessment if they are entered therein;\n(b) The amount of arrears of assessment then due by each of such persons or by persons unknown;\n(c) The amount of costs of collection due by each of such persons;\n(d) The description of all immoveable property liable for the payment of the assessments mentioned in such statement;\n(e) The amount of assessments and costs affecting such immoveable property;\n(f) All other information required by the trustees.\nAnd the statement so prepared is submitted to the trustees and approved by them (s. 61).\nThe amount of any assessment on any land so to defray the expenses of the construction or repairs of a church is declared to be \u201cthe first charge on such land, and the first privileged debt affecting and binding the said land without its being necessary to register the act of assessment or the judgment of confirmation in any registry office\u201d (s. 69).\nThere is a further provision to the effect that, whenever any land or immoveable property has already been taxed in the hands of the same owner for an edifice for religious purposes in another parish of which such land or immoveable then formed part, the commissioners, upon petition of the owner, and having regard to all the circumstances, shall exempt such land or immoveable property from the whole or part of the taxes in the new parish, and order, if necessary, that the sum so deducted be apportioned upon the other immoveable property comprised in the act of assessment (s. 87).\nThe Superior Court[5] and the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side)[6] had no hesitation\u2014and we have none in this Court\u2014in deciding that the church assessment provided for in the Parish and Fabrique Act, of which the material provisions have just been outlined, is one of the \u201ctaxes, assessments or rates\u201d in respect to which the parties have stipulated in the clause of the lease under discussion.\nIt is a tax, an assessment or rate from every point of view.\nAs was stated by Strong, J., in Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de Saint-Sulpice de Montr\u00e9al v. The City of Montreal[7]:\nEvery contribution to a public purpose imposed by superior authority is a \u201ctax\u201d and nothing less.\nAnd see: Lawson & Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction v. Attorney-General of Canada[8].\nThis church levy is known as an assessment in the legal and statutory parlance of the province of Quebec. It is referred to in the Civil Code as \u201cassesments for the erection and repair of churches\u201d (art. 471), or:\nThe assessments and rates which are privileged upon immoveables are:\n(1) Assessments for building or repairing churches, etc. (art. 2011).\nAnd, as must have been noticed, it is also referred to as an \u201cassessment\u201d or \u201crate\u201d throughout the sections of the Parish and Fabrique Act which we have already analysed. This church assessment is, therefore, one of those which, in the province of Quebec, is understood as being comprised in the words of the lease: \u201ctaxes, assessments and rates.\u201d\nUnder the lease, the appellant bound itself\nto pay all taxes, assessments and rates * * * which may be imposed;\nand the particular assessment now in question is, therefore, included among the taxes, assessments and rates which the appellant undertook to pay, unless something in the language of the clause, or something to be inferred from the whole of the lease, may be construed as limiting or restricting the sweeping language in which is couched the undertaking to pay.\nWe agree with the courts below that\nthere are no clauses in the lease which come in conflict with the clause above cited;\nand that no restriction can be found in the context of the clause itself. The addition in the clause of the words \u201cgeneral and special,\u201d to the all-embracing words: \u201call taxes, assessments and rates,\u201d far from restricting the obligation to pay, as urged by the appellant, on the contrary, in our view, is there to emphasize the word \u201call.\u201d We need only refer to the holding in this court in Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de SaintSulpice v. The City of Montr\u00e9al, already adverted to[9], that the use of the word \u201ctaxes\u201d alone would extend \u201cto taxes imposed for special purposes.\u201d\nThe exception in the clause expressed thus\nexcepting the instalments payable after the expiry of the said term, of special taxes payment whereof is permitted to be made over a term of years\nare very apt words to cover the present church assessment, which, as provided for by s. 62 of the Parish and Fabrique Act, was made payable by instalments. This exception covers the exact case; and, in view of the fact that the assessment was made and imposed during the life of the lease, it removes any doubt as to whether the lessee might be called upon to pay the instalments coming due after the expiry of the term of the lease.\nReference in the clause under discussion is made to the fact that the lessee\nhas paid to the city of Montreal the proportion from the first day of October nineteen hundred and thirty-one of the taxes unpaid for the municipal year now current, (and that) a similar adjustment will be made at the end of the term in respect of the municipal year then current.\nIt was argued by the appellant that the reference so made to the taxes due to the city of Montreal showed that, when dealing with taxes in this clause, the parties had in view only and solely municipal taxes imposed by the city of Montreal.\nIt is impossible for us, as it was found impossible by the courts below, to agree with that interpretation. The particular mention of the city of Montreal taxes rather suggests that, at the date of the signature of the deed of lease, these taxes were the only ones then in force extending over the period of a whole year; and the parties agreed that, as the lease was to begin on the 1st of October\u2014a date which did not coincide with the \u201cmunicipal year\u201d\u2014an adjustment would have to be made of the taxes for the then current year and a similar adjustment would be made, under the same circumstances, at the expiry of the term of the lease. This is a very usual clause in all deeds in the province of Quebec, and so notorious that we would think the Court might almost take judicial notice of it. Be that as it may, it does not in any way limit the obligation imposed upon the lessee to pay \u201call taxes, assessments and rates general and special.\u201d In our view, it is nothing more than the application of article 1021 of the Civil Code:\n1021. When the parties in order to avoid a doubt whether a particular case comes within the scope of a contract, have made special provision for such case, the general terms of the contract are not on this account restricted to the single case specified.\nWe are also of opinion that, whatever be the true nature of the church assessment under discussion, whether in a sense it is a personal tax or a tax imposed on property (as to which there is a great deal to be said), the assessment undoubtedly is an assessment \u201cin respect of the said property.\u201d\nWe are reminded of the words of Lord Thankerton, in Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr[10]:\nGenerally speaking, taxation is imposed on persons, the nature and amount of the liability being determined either by individual units, as in the case of a poll tax, or in respect of the taxpayers\u2019 interest in property, or in respect of transactions or actings of the taxpayers. It is at least unusual to find a tax imposed on property and not on persons, etc.\nand it is interesting to note how far Lord Thankerton\u2019s statement is true when applied to the facts of the present case.\nIt is not correct to say that the assessment is on the person in respect of his religion, though measured by the extent of his property, since a Catholic resident in the parish is not assessed if he has no property in the parish, whilst, on the other hand, although he may reside in another part of the world, he will be assessed if he owns property in the parish. Such is inevitably the effect of the Parish and Fabrique Act; and, in our view, it shows that the taxation here, though the statute uses certain words referable to the person of the owner, is unquestionably taxation, if not properly speaking imposed on property, at least imposed \u201cin respect of the taxpayers\u2019 interest in property.\u201d It is a tax in respect of the property leased. The respondent could not otherwise be taxed. He could not be taxed unless he owned this property. The whole structure of the Act shows it is an assessment in respect of the immovable, with the added requirement that the immovable be owned by a Catholic.\nBy force of the statute, it is\nthe owners of lands and other immoveable property situate within the parish\nwho are assessed. Those are the words of the charging section (s. 46).\nIt is only in another section (s. 58) that the further provision is introduced excluding all\nProtestants or any person whomsoever, other than persons professing the Roman Catholic religion\nfrom liability to assessment. Then, in section 61, requiring the secretary-treasurer of the trustees to prepare in November the statement already alluded to, it is significant that the statement must include, under subsection (b), the amount of arrears of assessment due \u201cby persons unknown,\u201d a provision which can have no application unless the recovery is intended against the immovable property. Under subsection (d) of the same section, the immovable property is referred to as \u201cliable for the payment of the assessments\u201d; and in subsection (e) the amounts of assessment are mentioned as \u201caffecting such immovable property\u201d; and then, of course, there is the provision in section 69 whereby the amount of the assessment (referred to as being \u201con the land\u201d) is made\nthe first charge on such land, and the first privileged debt affecting and binding the said land.\nIt may be a question whether a Roman Catholic person, on whom the assessment has been imposed because he was owner of land in the parish on the date of the assessment, continues to be personally liable for the subsequent instalments of such assessment after he has sold the land in respect of which the assessment was made\u2014a point which it is unnecessary to decide in this case\u2014; while it is clear that once the assessment is imposed, the consequential charge on the land and the privilege which affects and binds the land under section 69 of the Act continues to affect it in the hands of a new owner, even if he be not a Roman Catholic and even if it be a joint stock company (La Compagnie des Terrains Dufresne Limit\u00e9e v. Paroisse de Saint-Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Assisse[11]. As pointed out by Barclay, J., in the Court of King\u2019s Bench,\nRoman Catholics as such are not taxed, but Roman Catholics who are proprietors of land or other immoveable property within the parish are taxed, and taxed because they are proprietors and not because they are Roman Catholics. It is true that the Act would not apply to them if they were not Roman Catholics, but being Roman Catholics, the Act does apply and taxes them in respect of their property in the parish and in proportion to its value.\nEven if the assessment should be styled an assessment imposed on the person, it would nevertheless be an assessment \u201cin respect of the property\u201d leased. That point of view is well expressed in the words used in Brett v. Rogers[12], which we make our own:\nThe words \u201cin respect of the premises\u201d are used in contradistinction to the words \u201con the premises,\u201d and an assessment of duty made or imposed not on the premises, but in respect of the premises, must be made or imposed upon some person in respect of the premises; and an assessment duly made or imposed upon any person in respect of the premises seems to us to come within the meaning of the covenant.\nand again by Lindley, J., in Hartley v. Hudson[13]:\nThere is a distinction to be drawn between a charge upon premises and a charge upon a person, as the former would be binding on the realty, whilst the latter would be a mere personal liability for expenses incurred in respect of the premises; but in this case it may be said that there was a charge upon the premises and a charge upon the person, namely, upon the plaintiff as owner of the premises * * * Now, these expenses paid by the plaintiff were incurred in respect of the demised premises, and by the terms of the above section were a charge upon the premises until payment. The fact of the plaintiff paying them because he was compellable by law to do so, does not make them any the less a charge on the premises within the meaning of the covenant in the lease; and hence I am of opinion that the plaintiff is on this ground entitled to recover.\nBut I think the plaintiff is also entitled to recover because these expenses were a charge upon \u201ca person in respect of the premises,\u201d i.e., they were a debt payable by the plaintiff in respect thereof. The plaintiff, by the Public. Health Act, 1848, had a duty cast upon him to pave, &c., and he neglected to perform that duty, and in consequence this expense was incurred by the corporation; this expense then became chargeable by the corporation to the plaintiff, and it was so chargeable in respect of these premises.\nNor can the appellant contend that the parties could not have contemplated the passing of such an imposition which, he says, at the time of the signature of the deed, must have been entirely unforeseen. The whole tenor of the lease points in a direction contrary to the appellant\u2019s contention in that regard. It is clear that the respondent intended to divest himself of all concern about the property. Incidentally, let it be mentioned that it is not in accordance with the terms of the lease to say that this church assessment would increase the annual rental by almost 25%. It is incorrect to say that the lease was for a sum of $12,000 per year. The rent was stipulated at $12,000 a year, plus all taxes, assessments and rates; and, in addition to that, the appellant\nagreed to do a great deal more than is ordinarily incumbent upon a lessee and they were almost (as pointed out by Barclay, J.) in the position of owners under the terms of the lease.\nAbove all, the Parish and Fabrique Act already formed part of the statutory law of the province where the lease was made. In the words of Walsh, J., in the Court of King\u2019s Bench:\nIts application was an eventuality which could have been foreseen by the parties.\nThis assessment could be no more unexpected than any other special assessment, such as that for the building of a school or for the construction of sewers. The terms of the lease are clear and unambiguous; and it cannot be said that the appellant could not have contemplated the occurrence as a result of which he is now called upon to pay this church assessment during the existence of the lease.\nFor all those reasons, we are of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Meredith, Holden, Heward\nDavis J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal turns solely upon the proper interpretation to be given to an indemnity clause in a lease of an immoveable property situate in the city of Montreal. The lessee undertook with the lessor,\nFrom October 1st, 1931, to pay all taxes, assessments and rates general and special which may be imposed on or in respect of the said property during the said term of five years (excepting the instalments payable after the expiry of the said term, of special taxes payments whereof is permitted to be made over a term of years). The lessee has paid to the city of Montreal the proportion from October 1st, 1931, of the taxes unpaid for the municipal year now current and a similar adjustment will be made at the end of the term in respect of the municipal year then current.\nWhile the lease was not executed by the parties until the 18th of March, 1932, the term of the lease was for a period of five years from the first of October, 1931, and in consequence an adjustment of taxes was necessarily involved at the time of the execution of the lease and a further adjustment of taxes would become necessary at the expiration of the lease. The facts are not in dispute. The property is within the municipality of the city of Montreal and is within the parochial limits of the Roman Catholic parish of St. Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Assisse in the said city of Montreal. It was admitted before us that school rates in the city of Montreal are collected by the city as part of the municipal taxation, and further that the taxation period of the city of Montreal is not the calendar year. Now the words \u201cgeneral and special\u201d with reference to municipal taxation are well understood in this country. By \u201cgeneral\u201d is meant those taxes which are imposed throughout the entire municipality for the purpose of raising money for the general expenses of the municipality. By \u201cspecial\u201d is meant those taxes which are imposed from time to time upon particular properties benefited by special services such as local improvements in the nature of streets, sidewalks, sewers, etc.\nThe problem raised in this appeal is whether a tax imposed by the Roman Catholic parish within which the property in question is situate, for the purpose of defraying the cost of a new parish church, is a tax intended to be covered by the clause of the lease above set out. The owner (lessor) is a Roman Catholic and I am satisfied that it is a tax, assessment or rate imposed on or in respect of his property. It is an impost under a statute that was in existence at the time of the making of the lease upon property owned by Roman Catholics within a defined area and is a tax within the true significance of the term. But did the parties, upon the fair construction of the language they used, intend that the lessee was to pay this sort of tax? Though the parties may not testify as to their intention, the clause in the lease should be read in its entirety for the purpose of assisting in the judicial determination of the real intention of the parties. Particular expressions or provisions which may be subordinate to the general object may throw light upon the general object and intention of the parties and supply the guidance required for dealing with disputes as to the application of the terms of an agreement to unforeseen questions which arise during the currency of the agreement.\nFor the purposes of this case it has been assumed that the Roman Catholic parish church properly made an allotment of a portion of the cost of its new edifice against the lessor because he was a Roman Catholic who owned property within the parochial limits and that the church had statutory authority to impose the amount thereof against his property. It is not a mere incident in the ownership of property but rather a personal matter arising out of the particular religious faith of the individual owner. It is a statutory charge of a special and peculiar sort and the question we have to determine is whether or not it was something which may be fairly presumed to have been understood by the parties to the lease as covered and intended to be covered by the indemnity clause. In my opinion, as a matter of interpretation, the true sense and effect of the language of the indemnity clause, read as a whole, does not impose upon the lessee a burden of this sort.\nHaving regard to what I have said as to the significance of the use of the words \u201cgeneral and special\u201d (which words follow immediately after the words \u201call taxes, assessments and rates\u201d) in relation to municipal taxation and having regard to the use of the words \u201cmunicipal year\u201d in the declaration that\nThe lessee has paid to the city of Montreal the proportion from the October 1st, 1931, of the taxes unpaid for the municipal year now current\nand in the undertaking that\nA similar adjustment will be made at the end of the term in respect of the municipal year then current\nall of which expressions occur in the one clause, I think it plain that the parties were contracting only within the sphere of municipal taxes. That construction excludes the church tax sought to be brought within the ambit of the clause because it is admitted that the church tax is not any part of the municipal taxation.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael\nSolicitors for the respondent: Meredith, Holden, Reward & Holden.\n[1] (1936) Q.R. 60 K.B. 289.\n[2] (1935) Q.R. 73 S.C. 251.\n[3] (1935) Q.R. 73 S.C. 251.\n[4] (1936) Q.R. 60 K.B. 289.\n[5] (1935) Q.R. 73 S.C. 251.\n[6] (1936) Q.R. 60 K.B. 289.\n[7] (1889) 16 Can S.C.R. 399, at 403.\n[8] [1931] S.C.R. 357, at 363.\n[9] (1889) 16 Can.

The stipulated premium was $375.90 payable half-yearly of which $34.35 was stated to be for the disability benefits. On the 31st of March, 1927, the insured assigned the policy to his wife, the respondent in this case. On the 17th of February, 1930, the insured met with an accident which so crippled his right hand that he was incapable of doing any manual work. The appellant company then admitted total disability within the meaning of the policy and paid the total disability benefit of $150 a month for a period of nineteen months, namely, until the 17th of October, 1931; it also waived the payment of all premiums falling due during that period under the terms of the policy. On November 12, 1931, the appellant company wrote the insured that, as he was no longer continuously totally disabled, it would\u2019 discontinue making further disability payments. In 1932, the company appellant demanded payment of the two-yearly premiums of $375.90 falling due respectively on March 3 and September 3, 1932, which were paid under protest with an additional sum of $75.18 as exchange for United States money. On April 3, 1933, the respondent brought the present action to recover from the appellant company seventeen monthly disability benefit payments of $150 each from November 17, 1931, to March 17, 1933, plus $382.40 for excess value in United States over Canadian currency and for the return of the two half-yearly premiums paid under protest, with exchange, in 1932, i.e.. $826.98. An incidental demand was made for seven additional monthly disability payments from March 17, 1933, to October 17, 1933, i.e., $1,050, plus $95 for excess value in United States over Canadian currency and also for the recovery of $834.38 being the amount of two additional premiums and exchange paid under protest in March and September, 1933: the total sum claimed being $5,738.76. The appellant company pleaded generally and, in particular, denied that from and after October 17, 1931, the respondent\u2019s husband was continuously and totally disabled within the conditions and terms of the policy. At the trial, the jury found that the insured had been totally disabled from February 17, 1930, up to the date of the verdict. The appellant\u2019s counsel, in support of a motion for the dismissal of the action, raised for the first time a point taken in the factum that, under subsections 2 and 3 of section 216 of the Quebec Insurance Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 243, the respondent\u2019s right of action was prescribed, because more than one year had elapsed since \u201cthe happening of the event insured against.\u201d The trial judge held that the action was so prescribed as far as the disability payments were concerned, but maintained it as to the claim for the return of premiums paid under protest in 1932 and 1933, i.e., the sum of $1,661.36. The appellate court added to the above judgment the sum of $2,066.38, arrears of disability payments which became due within the year of the institution of the action and, under the incidental demand, the sum of $1,145 arrears of disability payments which became due after the institution of the action, April 17 to October 17, 1933, the court holding that the five payments due from November 17, 1931, to March 17, 1932, were barred under the above-mentioned provision of the Quebec Insurance Act, thus increasing the amount awarded to the respondent from $1,661.36 to $4,872.74.\nHeld, that the prescriptions of subsections 2 and 3 of section 216 of the Quebec Insurance Act are not applicable to the state of facts as found in this case and cannot be held to bar any part of the respondent\u2019s action; and that the respondent is entitled to recover a further indemnity for the five months from November, 1931, to March, 1932, as well as for the nineteen months from April, 1932, to October, 1933, allowed by the Appellate Court. Therefore the respondent\u2019s action should be maintained for the full amount claimed therein, i.e., $5,738.76\u2014The appellant company could only invoke the prescription contained in the Quebec Insurance Act by disproving the claim which was the subject of the respondent\u2019s: action; this it has completely failed to do. On the contrary, the respondent has obtained from the trial court a verdict which has not been challenged in this Court, that the insured was totally disabled, within the meaning of the insurance policy sued on, at the time of the trial and had been continuously so totally disabled from February 17, 1930. This verdict was the outcome of the trial of the whole merits of the action. It must be taken as conclusively negativing the appellant\u2019s contention that the total disability, which the appellant company, the insurer, had recognized as continuing uninterruptedly and for which it had paid up to October 17, 1931, had ceased at any time thereafter, and, therefore, as negativing also its submission that the action was barred by the provisions of s. 216 (2) (3) of the Quebec Insurance Act on the assumption that the prescription there enacted might be treated as beginning to run against the plaintiff from the cessation of the total disability insured against. Upon the true construction of this insurance policy, in so far as it relates to the total disability benefits sued for, the risk insured against was the continuance of a condition of total and presumably permanent disability on the part of the insured, resulting from bodily injury or disease, and the statutory prescription relied on could have no application to the respondent\u2019s claim so long as the insured, once found to have been totally disabled (within the meaning of the policy, continued in that condition without interruption; the happening of the accident was not the event insured against, either within the meaning of this insurance contract or within the intendment of s. 216 (2) (3) of the Quebec Insurance Act\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014The effect of the prescription resulting from subsections 2 and 3 of section 216 of the Quebec Insurance Act in respect to similar insurance policies has been dealt with by the appellate court in Quebec in three other cases besides the present one: North American Life Insurance Co. v. Hudon (Q.R. 55 K.B. 273), Gagne v. New York Life Insurance Co. (Q.R. 57 K.B. 60), and Canada Life Insurance Co. v. Poulin (Q.R. 57 K.B. 78). In the Hudon and the Poulin cases, the facts were different, as there the insurance company had not acknowledged the existence of the conditions of invalidity which entitled the insured to the benefits accruing under the policy and had not made a single payment of the monthly income to the insured; (the decision on the points raised in those cases should be reserved for future consideration)\u2014In the Gagn\u00e9 case, the insurance company had admitted, as in this case, the \u201chappening of the event insured against\u201d and had acted upon the proof thereof submitted by the plaintiff and had made several monthly income payments, and the prescriptions of section 216 (2 and 3) of the Insurance Act are not, in that case as in the present one, applicable to such a state of facts. Moreover, the circumstances in the present case are more favourable to the claimant than in the Gagn\u00e9 case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, maintaining the judgment of the trial judge for $1,661.36 representing the return of premiums paid on an insurance policy during the period of the insured\u2019s disability and maintaining a cross-appeal by the respondent and ordering the appellant to pay the respondent a further sum of $3,211.38 for arrears of total and permanent disability payments. Cross-appeal by the respondent claiming a further sum of $866.02, as demanded by her action, for another period of total and permanent disability.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now reported.\nW. B. Scott K.C. and J. F. Chisholm for the appellant.\nBrooke Claxton and N. L. Rappaport for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014The appellant by its insurance policy under date of March 3, 1927, insured the life of the respondent Dame Jennie Handler\u2019s husband, a silk manufacturer, then resident in New Jersey, in the United States, in favour of his wife for $15,000 or for $30,000 in the event of his death by accident, and also agreed thereby upon receipt of due proof that the insured was \u201ctotally and presumably permanently disabled before age 60\u201d as defined under the Total and Permanent Disability clauses thereof to pay to the insured one hundred and fifty dollars each month and to waive payment of premiums as provided in the said Total and Permanent Disability clauses. The stipulated premium was $375.90, payable half-yearly, of which $34.35 was stated to be for the disability benefits.\nThe material portions of the Total and Permanent Disability clauses of the policy are as follows:\u2014\nDisability shall be considered total whenever the insured is so disabled by bodily injury or disease that he is wholly prevented from performing any work, from following any occupation, or from engaging in any business for remuneration or profit, provided such disability occurred after the insurance under this policy took effect and before the anniversary of the policy on which the insured\u2019s age at nearest birthday is sixty.\nUpon receipt at the company\u2019s home office, before default in payment of premium, of due proof that the insured is totally disabled as above defined, and will be continuously so totally disabled for life, or if the proof submitted is not conclusive as to the permanency of such disability, but establishes that the insured is, and for a period of not less than three consecutive months immediately preceding receipt of proof has been, totally disabled as above defined, the following benefits will be granted.\n(a) Waiver of premium.\u2014The company will waive the payment of any premium falling due during the period of continuous total disability.\n(b) Income payments.\u2014The company will pay to the insured the monthly income stated on the first page hereof for each completed month from the commencement of and during the period of continuous total disability.\nBefore making any income payment or waiving any premium, the company may demand due proof of the continuance of total disability, but such proof will not be required oftener than once a year after such disability has continued for two full years. Upon failure to furnish such proof, or if the insured performs any work, or follows any occupation, or engages in any business for remuneration or profit, no further income payments shall be made nor premiums waived.\nThe policy was duly assigned on March 31, 1927, to the insured\u2019s wife, the present respondent.\nOn February 17, 1930, the insured, who had removed to Canada, met with an injury to his right hand in the mill of the Canada Silks Limited at Actonville, Quebec. Proofs of the accident and the resulting disability were filed with the appellant in June after the lapse of three months from the occurrence of the accident. These were accepted as establishing total and presumably permanent disability under the terms of the policy, and the appellant paid the total disability benefit of $150 a month for a period of nineteen months from February 17, 1930, the date of the accident, until October 17, 1931. It also waived the payment of all premiums falling due during this period under the terms of the policy. On November 12, 1931, it wrote the insured that no further income payments would be made as the insured was no longer continuously totally disabled within the meaning of the Disability Benefit provision of the policy and that the premiums thereafter due would become payable as before in conformity with the terms of the policy. It thereupon discontinued making further disability payments. In 1932 the appellant demanded payment of the two half-yearly premiums of $375.90 falling due respectively on March 3 and September 3 of that year. These two premiums were therefore paid under protest with an additional $75.18 to account for the difference in the existing exchange rates between Canadian and United States money, in which last-mentioned currency the premiums were payable under the terms of the insurance policy.\nThe action was brought by the present respondent and her husband on April 3, 1933, to recover seventeen monthly disability benefit payments of $150 each, from November 17, 1931, to March 17, 1933, plus $382.40\u2014the aggregate excess value of these monthly benefit payments in United States over Canadian currency at the respective dates when such monthly income payments were alleged to have become due\u2014and for the return of the two half-yearly premiums paid under protest in 1932.\nAn incidental demand was subsequently served for seven additional monthly disability payments from March 17, 1933, to October 17, 1933, plus $95\u2014the aggregate excess value of these payments in United States over Canadian funds at the respective dates when it was claimed they should have been paid\u2014and for the recovery as well of $834.38\u2014the amount of two additional premiums and exchange thereon paid under protest in March and September, 1933. The total sum claimed in the principal action and the incidental demand was $5,738.76.\nThe action was tried before Chief Justice Greenshields and a jury on November 13, 1933. In answer to questions submitted by His Lordship the jury found that the insured is so disabled by a bodily injury or disease that he is wholly prevented from performing any work, from following any occupation or from engaging in any business for remuneration or profit;\nthat he was so totally disabled from February 17, 1930, and that he had been totally disabled continuously to the then present date.\nThe defendant\u2019s counsel having moved for the dismissal of the action the point was taken in the defendant\u2019s factum in support of this motion for the first time in the case that the action was barred by the provisions of s. 216, s. ss. 2 and 3 of the Quebec Insurance Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 243. These provisions are as follows:\u2014\n2. Any stipulation or agreement to the contrary notwithstanding any action or proceeding against the insurer for the recovery of any claim under or by virtue of a contract of insurance of the person may be commenced at any time within one year next after the happening of the event insured against, or within the further term of six months, by leave of a judge of the Superior Court, granted upon a petition, upon its being shown to his satisfaction that there was a reasonable excuse for not commencing the action or proceeding within the first-mentioned term.\n3. But no such action or proceeding shall be commenced after the expiration of the year and additional six months, except in cases where death is presumed from the insured not having been heard of during seven years, in which case any action or proceeding may be commenced within one year and six months from the expiration of such period.\nThe learned Chief Justice, feeling himself bound by the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in The North American Life Insurance Co. v. Hudon[1], decided that the action was prescribed by the above quoted provisions of the Quebec Insurance Act, so far as the disability payments claimed for were concerned, and accordingly dismissed the action for these payments. He maintained the action, however, as regards the claim for the return of the two premiums paid under protest in 1932, and the incidental demand for the two additional premiums paid in 1933, holding that the statutory prescription did not apply to any of these claims, and condemned the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of $1,661.36 therefor.\nA majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Rivard and Bond, JJ. dissenting) dismissed an appeal taken by the defendant from the Superior Court judgment, and maintained in part the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal thereon, adding to the judgment of the trial court a condemnation of the defendant to pay to the plaintiff under the principal action the sum of $2,066.39, arrears of disability payments which became due within the year of the institution of the action with interest from April 3, 1933, and under the incidental demand the sum of $1,145 arrears of disability payments which became due after the institution of the action, April 17 to October 17, 1933, with interest thereon from October 26, 1933.\nThe effect of the two appeals was to entitle the plaintiff to all the monthly disability payments claimed for in the principal action and incidental demand except those for the five months\u2019 period from November 17, 1931, to March 17, 1932, which were held to be barred under the provisions of s. 216, s. ss. 2 and 3 of the Quebec Insurance Act, and thus to increase the trial judgment in favour of the plaintiff from $1,661.36 to $4,872.74, with interest on the first twelve disability payments allowed from the date of the commencement of the action, and interest on the other seven payments claimed in the incidental demand from the date of that demand.\nThe only question involved in the present appeal is that of the construction of the above quoted provisions of the Quebec Insurance Act and its application to an action for the recovery of indemnity for such disability as that described in the insurance policy here sued on.\nWe are of the opinion that, upon the true construction of this insurance policy, in so far as it relates to the total disability benefits sued for, the risk insured against was the continuance of a condition of total and presumably permanent disability on the part of the insured, resulting from bodily injury or disease, and that the statutory prescription relied on could have no application to the plaintiff respondent\u2019s claim so long as the insured, once found to have been totally disabled within the meaning of the policy, continued in that condition without interruption. We cannot at all accede to the contention that the happening of the accident was the event insured against, either within the meaning of this insurance contract or within the intendment of s. 216 (2) of the Quebec Insurance Act.\nUnder no possible construction of the policy could any action or proceeding be taken against the insurer until the insured has continued to be totally disabled for a period of not less than three consecutive months. The accident or injury itself clearly affords no ground of action against the insurer. Nor do the results of any accident or injury or disease afford any ground for action unless those results totally disable the insured for at least three consecutive months, which continuous disability, though not conclusive as to the permanency thereof, the insurer expressly agrees to accept as prima facie proof of such permanency. Accordingly it agrees to\nwaive the payment of any premium falling due during the period of continuous total disability,\nand to pay the stipulated monthly income\nfor each completed month from the commencement of and during the period of continuous total disability.\nThis agreement is subject to the proviso that the insurer before making any income payment or waiving any premium may demand due proof of \u201cthe continuance of total disability,\u201d but that such proof will not be required more than once a year after such disability has continued for two full years. These provisions and the others above quoted, we think, conclusively show that the existence and uninterrupted continuance of total disability as defined by the insurance policy alone affords a ground of action for the recovery of any of the unpaid indemnity contracted for. How can either the commencement or the cessation of such a condition of continuous total disability be said to be \u201cthe happening of the event insured against\u201d by this policy? The legislature must be taken to have contemplated some specific event, which can be definitely fixed in point of time, when it prescribed a period\nof one year next after the happening of the event insured against\nas a limitation for the bringing of any action against an insurer for the recovery of any claim under or by virtue of a contract of insurance of the person\u2014such, for example, as the death of the insured, whether as the result of accident or disease\u2014not, we think, a continuous condition of total and presumably permanent disability such as is insured against by the provisions of the policy sued on in this action and for which no action or proceeding of any kind could be maintained for the recovery of the unpaid indemnity contracted for without proof that the insured was still totally disabled within the meaning of the definition of total disability set out in the policy and had continuously been so disabled from the initial development of such disability. If the legislature had so intended it can hardly be supposed that it would have sought to bar such an action as this by limiting the period within which it could be brought to \u201cone year from the happening of the event insured against.\u201d The only suggested possibility in the case of total and presumably permanent disability such as that which is the ground of this action is that the prescription might be held to begin to run from the cessation of the alleged disability. It is not, however, the cessation of the disability which is insured against but its continuance without interruption. If it were true that the prescription period began to run on the cessation of the total disability the appellant defendant could avail himself of the statutory prescription only by proving that the total and presumably permanent disability, for which it had paid for nineteen months, had ceased when it stopped its monthly payments in October, 1931, or at some time thereafter and more than one year before the commencement of the action. In other words, it could invoke the prescription only by disproving the claim which was the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s action. This it completely failed to do. On the contrary, the respondent plaintiff has obtained from the trial court a verdict, which has not been challenged in this Court, that the insured was totally disabled within the meaning of the insurance policy sued on at the time of the trial and had been continuously so totally disabled from February 17, 1930. This verdict was the outcome of the trial of the whole merits of the action. It must be taken as conclusively negativing the defendant\u2019s contention that the total disability, which the insurer had recognized as continuing uninterruptedly and for which it had paid up to October 17, 1931, had ceased at any time thereafter, and, therefore, as negativing also its submission that the action was barred by the provisions of s. 216 (2) of the Quebec Insurance Act on the insupportable assumption that the prescription there enacted might be treated as beginning to run against the plaintiff from the cessation of the total disability insured against. Whether or not therefore that enactment applies at all to actions for the recovery of indemnity for total disability under any other form of total disability insurance, we have no doubt for the reasons stated that it cannot rightly be held to bar this action, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover indemnity for the five months, November, 1931, to March, 1932, as well as for the nineteen months, April, 1932, to October, 1933, allowed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe appeal will therefore be dismissed and the respondent\u2019s cross-appeal allowed so as to vary the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, by allowing the plaintiff an additional sum of $866.02, in the principal action and thus to maintain both the principal action and incidental demand in full with interest, the respondent to have her costs on both the appeal and cross-appeal in this court and throughout.\nRinfret J.\u2014I fully concur with the judgment of my brother Crocket.\nWithin the last three years, the Court of King\u2019s Bench in Quebec has had occasion to examine, in no less than four cases and in respect to similar insurance policies, the effect of the prescription resulting from subsections 2 and 3 of section 216 of the Quebec Insurance Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 243). Those cases, in addition to the present one, were North American Life Insurance Co. v. Hudon[2], Gagn\u00e9 v. New York Life Insurance Co.[3], and Canada Life Insurance Co. v. Poulin[4]. In the Hudon and the Poulin cases the facts were different and gave a somewhat different aspect to the legal problem arising out of the application of the statutory prescription. I mean that in both those cases\u2014so far, at least, as appears from the reports\u2014the insurance company had not acknowledged the existence of the conditions of invalidity which entitled the insured to the benefits accruing under the policy. In neither of those two cases had the insurance company ever made a single payment of the monthly income to the insured, before the action was brought; so that it could be said, as to each of those cases, that \u201cle droit d\u00e9coulant du fait\u201d (to use the words of Mr. Justice L\u00e9tourneau in the Poulin case\u2014p. 186) and that is to say: the right to the monthly income resulting from the fact of the continuous total disability, had yet to be ascertained. I see the strength of the argument that the prescription applies in such a case. It may be contended that, by force of the statute, the question whether \u201cthe event insured against\u201d has happened must be established within one year (or \u201cthe further term of six months\u201d) by agreement or by judgment resulting from an action instituted and served within that delay.\nThat is not the point which we have to decide in the present case; and it should be understood that the decision of such a point is reserved for future consideration.\nHere as in the Gagn\u00e9 case, the company had admitted the \u201chappening of the event insured against.\u201d It had acted upon the proof thereof submitted by the plaintiff and it had made several monthly income payments. As expressed by Sir Mathias Tellier, C.J., in the Gagn\u00e9 case (p. 68): the company \u201c\u00e9tait li\u00e9e par sa convention.\u201d And I think it must be agreed that, in those circumstances, the conclusion reached by my brother Crocket is the correct one; the prescriptions of section 216 (2 and 3) are not applicable to that state of facts.\nThere was however a distinction between the Gagn\u00e9 case and the present one. In the former case, the company had ceased the monthly payments \u201cparce qu\u2019il (Gagn\u00e9) l\u2019avait inform\u00e9e que son invalidit\u00e9 avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre totale\u201d[5]. There was nothing of the kind here and the jury found that the condition of total disability had been continuous to the present date. I would share the view of Chief Justice Tellier[6] that, under those circumstances,\napr\u00e8s avoir reconnu cette invalidit\u00e9 comme totale et permanente * * * la compagnie n\u2019avait pas le droit, si ce n\u2019est apr\u00e8s l\u2019accomplissement des formalities indiqu\u00e9es dans la police N.B.\n(and which are referred to by my brother Crocket)\nd\u2019enlever au demandeur son revenu mensuel et l\u2019exon\u00e9ration des primes.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacDougall, Macfarlane, Scott & Hugessen.\nSolicitor for the respondent: N.

Fifteen days\u2019 notice of withdrawal to be given and this receipt to be surrendered before repayment of either principal or interest is made. No interest will be allowed unless the money remains in the bank one month. This receipt is negotiable.\u201d Probate of B.\u2019s will issued to his executors in Minnesota, where the deposit receipt was reduced into possession and held by them. None of the executors or beneficiaries under the will resided in Manitoba. The Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba claimed from B.\u2019s estate succession duty under the Succession Duty Act, Man., 1934, c. 42, in respect of the sum deposited and represented by the deposit receipt. The evidence was that the bank treated that form of deposit receipt as negotiable; that in general practice, if it was endorsed in accordance with the way it was made payable, it would be negotiated and paid; if the payee endorsed it, the bank considered it was properly transferred; it was the bank\u2019s practice to honour indorsement by the payee; and it could come through another bank with another party; the bank admitted its liability to pay the deposit receipt in question.\nHeld: The deposit was not subject to succession duty under said Act. (Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 44 Man. R. 63, affirmed).\nThe situs of the deposit receipt for the pertinent purposes was not the Province of Manitoba, It came within the well recognized exception to the rule that the situs of a simple contract debt is the jurisdiction, where \u201cthe debt is properly recoverable and can be enforced.\u201d It came within the exception notwithstanding that it might not properly be called a \u201cnegotiable instrument\u201d within the strict definition of that term as found in Bills of Exchange Acts or as that term has come to be regarded in English mercantile custom and usage. The exception is not restricted, in its application, to \u201cnegotiable instruments\u201d strictly as so defined. The deposit receipt in question was, after endorsation, capable of being transferred by delivery and of being sold in Minnesota, passing a valid title to the debt, by acts done entirely in Minnesota. It was in effect a saleable chattel, therefore situate where it was found, and it followed the nature of chattels as to the jurisdiction to grant probate. It was capable of being reduced into possession by the executors in Minnesota, by virtue of the probate and letters testamentary there issued, and, when that was done, the executors held a marketable security, saleable and, after endorsation, transferable by delivery, with no act outside of Minnesota being necessary to render the transfer valid. The executors or their transferee could maintain an action, if necessary, against the bank in the Manitoba courts without taking out ancillary letters of administration in Manitoba. The document, and the debt of which it was the title, was locally situated in Minnesota, and was not subject to the succession duty claimed.\nAttorney-General v. Bouwens, 4 M. & W. 171; Crosby v. Prescott, [1923] S.C.R. 446; The King v. National Trust Co., [1933] S.C.R. 670; Richer v. Voyer, L.R. 5 Priv. Cou. App. 461, and other cases and authorities cited. The King v. Lovitt, [1912] A.C. 212, distinguished.\nHeld, also: It was not open to the Provincial Treasurer to attack collaterally the validity of the deposit receipt as regards the authority of the bank officials who signed it.\nAPPEAL by the Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], which reversed the judgment of Montague J. given upon the reference of the matter in question to a judge of the Court of King\u2019s Bench by the Provincial Treasurer under s. 21 (1) of the Succession Duty Act, Man., 1934, c. 42.\nThe question was whether or not the Province of Manitoba was entitled to succession duty in respect of the sum of $50,000 and interest, which sum of $50,000 had been deposited by Russell M. Bennett, now deceased, with a branch in Winnipeg of the Royal Bank of Canada and was represented by a deposit receipt dated August 15, 1934, issued by the said bank, in the form set out in the judgment now reported. The said deceased died at the city of Minneapolis in the State of Minnesota on October 31, 1934, resident in said city of Minneapolis and domiciled in said State of Minnesota. The executors of his will were granted probate and letters testamentary in said State, and said deposit receipt was reduced by them into their possession there. The executors and beneficiaries under the deceased\u2019s will all lived outside Manitoba. The material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba held that the Government of Manitoba was not entitled to the succession duty claimed. The Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba appealed to this Court. By the judgment now reported the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nG. L. Cousley for the appellant.\nW. P. Fillmore K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This is a submission, in accordance with section 21 (1) of the Succession Duty Act, 1934, by the Provincial Treasurer of the Province of Manitoba for the decision of certain questions raised in connection with the estate of Russell Meridan Bennett, late of the city of Minneapolis, in the State of Minnesota, U.S.A.\nThe facts are agreed upon as set out in an affidavit of the executors of the estate:\nBennett died at Minneapolis on the 31st day of October, 1934, being domiciled and having his residence, at the time of his death, at Minneapolis.\nBy his last will he appointed the respondents his executors. The will was duly proved and recorded in the Probate Court of the County of Hennepin, in the State of Minnesota, and letters testamentary issued to the executors by the Probate Court on the 17th day of December, 1934.\nNone of the executors or of the beneficiaries under the will reside in the Province of Manitoba.\nAmong the property in the possession of the deceased in Minneapolis, at the time of his death, and which was vested in the executors under his last will, was found a deposit receipt in the following words and figures:\nTHE ROYAL BANK OF CANADA\nIncorporated 1869\n$50,000.00 No. 9209\n11\/8 Winnipeg, Man., August 15th, 1934.\nReceived from Russell M. Bennett the sum of Fifty Thousand 00\/100 Dollars which this Bank will repay to the said Russell M. Bennett or order with interest at the rate of 2\u00bd per cent. per annum until further notice. Fifteen days notice of withdrawal to be given and this Receipt to be surrendered before repayment of either Principal or Interest is made. No interest will be allowed unless the money remains in the Bank one month.\nThis Receipt is negotiable.\nFor the Royal Bank of Canada,\nF. S. Purse, J. H. Strafford,\nAccountant. Manager.\nThis deposit receipt has been reduced into possession by the executors at Minneapolis, where, at all material times, it has been held by them.\nThe branch of the Royal Bank of Canada wherein the money was deposited, and where the deposit receipt was issued, being in Manitoba, the Provincial Treasurer of that province claimed from the Bennett estate a total duty of $8,671.09 in respect of the moneys so deposited and represented by the deposit receipt; the executors denied any liability; and, as the parties could not agree, it was decided to refer to the courts, in the words of the submission, \u201cthe liability of the above estate for succession duty.\u201d\nMontague, J., in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, found and determined that the deposit was subject to succession duty and adjudged accordingly; but, in the Court of Appeal, this judgment was unanimously reversed, the appeal was allowed; and it was decided that the deposit was not subject to any duty under the Succession Duty Act.\nThe learned judge of the Court of King\u2019s Bench delivered no reasons for his decision.\nTrueman, J.A. (with whom the Chief Justice of Manitoba concurred) held that the deposit receipt was \u201cnegotiable by virtue of the estoppel resulting from its own representation\u201d; and that\nthis being the nature of the receipt, the executors have title to it by virtue of the Minnesota letters testamentary and are independent of ancillary probate or any other act in this Province [of Manitoba] to render legal their endorsement and delivery up of the receipt to the Bank against payment or their negotiation of it to a purchaser whether within the Province or elsewhere, proof being made to the Bank of their Minnesota authority.\nHe found accordingly that the money in question was not subject to the Crown\u2019s claim.\nRobson, J.A., came to the same conclusion, but on different grounds which it will not be necessary to discuss here, in view of the conclusion we have reached on the other point and which is sufficient to uphold the result arrived at by the Court of Appeal. Richards, J.A., gave no written reasons and, as we were told, merely declared that he was for allowing the appeal.\nIt must first be noted that the Manitoba enactment, in terms, affects only \u201call property situate within the province\u201d (subs. 1 of s. 8 of c. 42 of the Statutes of Manitoba, 1934). Under the statute, property having a situs in the province is alone declared \u201csubject to duty.\u201d Indeed, property within the province is the only property that the province has the constitutional power to tax (Lambe v. Manuel[2]; Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[3]; The King v. Lovitt[4]; Alleyn v. Barthe[5]). The deposit receipt which is the subject of the present litigation is primarily a document which constitutes evidence of a debt owing by the Royal Bank of Canada to the deceased, Russell M. Bennett. It is a simple contract debt and, as such, its situs, at least for the purposes of this case, would be the jurisdiction where the debtor is domiciled, and that is to say: where \u201cthe debt is properly recoverable or can be enforced\u201d (New York Life Insurance Company v. Public Trustee[6]; The King v. National Trust Company[7]).\nBut there is a well recognized exception to that rule, and that is that certain instruments capable of being transferred by delivery, and of being sold for money, in the jurisdiction where they are found and without it being necessary to do any act outside of that jurisdiction in order to render the transfer of them valid, are considered as instruments of a chattel nature or, in effect, saleable chattels which follow the nature of other chattels as to the jurisdiction to grant probate (Attorney-General v. Bouwens[8]; Dicey, Conflict of Laws, 5th ed., pp. 342 & 343).\nThe only point, therefore, for our decision is whether the deposit receipt now in question can be regarded as an instrument of such a nature that it was capable of being reduced into possession by the executors in Minneapolis, by virtue of the probate and letters testamentary there issued to them, in such a way that their title to the debt represented by the deposit receipt was as valid as a title to corporeal chattels reduced into possession in similar circumstances.\nIn the case of corporeal chattels, there can never be any dispute, for they have an actual local situation; but it was argued\u2014and with great ability\u2014by counsel for the provincial treasurer that the exception applies only to those instruments which, by statute or by custom of the English mercantile world, are recognized as \u201centitled to the name of a negotiable instrument,\u201d to use the words of Lord Blackburn, in Crouch v. Credit Foncier of England Ltd[9].\nWe do not think, however, that such a restriction follows from the pronouncements made upon that point in the decided cases.\nIt may be assumed in this discussion that the deposit receipt held by the respondents is not, in its nature, a \u201cnegotiable instrument\u201d within the limited meaning put forward by the appellant. It may be conceded that it lacks some of the characteristics of a promissory note, as, for example, it is not made for \u201ca sum certain,\u201d in view of the power reserved to the bank to modify the rate of interest. Moreover, there may be a question whether the instrument is such that the property in it may be acquired free of any defect of title in the transferror or free of the equities existing between the immediate parties to the instrument.\nBut we do not understand the doctrine to be that, in order to be taken out of the rule with regard to simple contract debts, the instruments which represent them and of which they are the titles must necessarily answer to the strict definition of \u201cnegotiable instruments\u201d as it is to be found in the Bills of Exchange Acts, or according as they have come to be regarded by the custom and usage of the English mercantile world.\nLet us refer to the language of Lord Abinger, C.B., in Attorney-General v. Bouwens[10]. The instruments in that case were Russian, Danish and Dutch bonds. The dividends due on the Russian and Danish government bonds respectively could be collected from agencies in England; but the dividends on the Dutch bonds were payable solely at Amsterdam. Lord Abinger stated first that The special verdict gives a description of these instruments, which are called, though incorrectly, bonds; and finds that all these were marketable securities within this kingdom, transferred by delivery only, and that it never has been necessary to do any act whatsoever out of the kingdom of England, in order to make the transfer of any of the said bonds valid.\nHe then points out that the rules for the determination of situs for the pertinent purposes were derived from those which define the jurisdiction of the ordinary to grant probate (p. 191); and, after having referred \u201cto the locality of many descriptions of effects,\u201d he goes on to say (p. 192):\nBut, on the other hand, it is clear that the ordinary could administer all chattels within his jurisdiction; and if an instrument is created of a chattel nature, capable of being transferred by acts done here, and sold for money here, there is no reason why the ordinary or his appointee should not administer that species of property. Such an instrument is in effect a saleable chattel, and follows the nature of other chattels as to the jurisdiction to grant probate.\nAs can be seen, no reference is there made to instruments recognized as negotiable instruments by the statutory law, or by the usage and custom of merchants. All that is said about the instruments, in order to hold them and the debts which they represent as having a local situs in England, is that they are \u201ccapable of being transferred by acts done [in England], and sold for money [there].\u201d\nThe principle so laid down was adopted by this Court in the case of Crosby v. Prescott[11]. Mrs. Crosby, domiciled in Massachusetts, died there, leaving, among the assets of her estate, promissory notes payable to her order, but not endorsed. The maker lived in Manitoba. The Probate Court of Massachusetts appointed one Prescott administrator of Mrs. Crosby\u2019s estate. No grant of letters of administration, ancillary or otherwise, was ever received by the administrator from Manitoba. It was held that the situs of the notes was in Massachusetts, they being transferable by acts done solely there, and the administrator, or his transferee, alone being able to sue on them. It was also held that the administrator could maintain an action against the maker of the notes in the Manitoba courts, without taking out ancillary administration in that province.\nIn the course of his reasons in support of that judgment, the present Chief Justice of this Court said (p. 448): It is, of course, a perfectly well settled doctrine of English law that simple contract obligations due to the deceased by a debtor residing in England are deemed for the purposes of administration and collection to have a situs within the jurisdiction where the debtor resides, and consequently no action can be maintained in England to enforce such obligations against a debtor residing there by a foreign administrator who is not clothed with authority to administer the assets of the deceased in England by an English grant. Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[12].\nBut the Chief Justice then added:\nThe Court of Appeal in Manitoba has held, rightly as I think, that there is an exception to this rule in the case of negotiable instruments; and that, as regards these, if they are reduced into possession by a foreign administrator within the territory from which he has received his grant and where they were at the time of the death of the creditor, it is competent to him to enforce them by action in the English courts, even in the absence of an English grant.\nAnd, at p. 449:\nIt is beyond question also that the debts due upon negotiable instruments held in England at the time of his death by a creditor dying abroad are English assets in respect of which probate duty is payable; Attorney-General v. Bouwens[13]; Winans v. Attorney-General[14]; and this on the ground that such instruments are of a chattel nature capable of being transferred in England and \u201csold for money\u201d in England.\nThe proposition thus expounded by the Chief Justice is supported on Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, par. 517, and Westlake, a passage of whose work on Private International Law, at page 126, is said to state the true rule and which reads thus:\n96. But to the rule in par. 95a the debts due on negotiable instruments are an exception, because they can be sufficiently reduced into possession by means of the paper which represents them. They are in fact in the nature of corporeal chattels. Hence the negotiable instruments of a deceased person, and his bonds or certificates payable to bearer, belong to the heir or administrator who first obtains possession of them within the territory from the law or jurisdiction of which he derives his title or his grant. He can indorse them if they were payable to the deceased\u2019s order, and he or his indorsee can sue on them in any other jurisdiction without any other grant.\nAnd the conclusion of the Chief Justice was (p. 451):\n* * * such instruments * * * are transferable by delivery, and such delivery has the effect of transferring not only the document, but the debt as well, and in that respect the resemblance to corporeal moveables is complete;\nThe reasons of Mr. Justice Mignault were to the same effect. The then Chief Justice of this Court, Sir Louis Davies, and Mr. Justice Anglin adopted the reasons of the Chief Justice of Manitoba and of the late Mr. Justice Cameron in the Appeal Court, which were also to the same effect.\nThe passage from Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, par. 517, referred to in his reasons by Chief Justice Duff (Story, 8th ed., p. 736) is in these terms:\nThe like principle will apply where an executor or administrator, in virtue of an administration abroad, becomes there possessed of negotiable notes belonging to the deceased, which are payable to bearer; for then he becomes the legal owner and bearer by virtue of his administration, and may sue thereon in his own name; and he need not take out letters of administration in the state where the debtor resides, in order to maintain a suit against him. And for a like reason it would seem that negotiable paper of the deceased, payable to order, actually held and indorsed by a foreign executor or administrator in the foreign country, who is capable there of passing the legal title by such indorsement, would confer a complete legal title on the indorsee, so that he ought to be treated in every other country as the legal indorsee, and allowed to sue thereon accordingly, in the same manner that he would be if it were a transfer\u2019 of any personal goods or merchandise of the deceased, situate in such foreign country.\nNow, the point about the doctrine in Story and in Westlake is that, for the pertinent purposes, these instruments are treated in the same manner as corporeal chattels, or moveables, not necessarily because they are, in their nature, what is known in the Law Merchant and under mercantile custom and usage as being \u201centitled to the name of a negotiable instrument,\u201d but because they are marketable securities within the jurisdiction where they are found, transferable by delivery only, saleable for money \u201cwithout it being necessary to do any act out of that jurisdiction in order to render the transfer valid.\u201d No-where is the rule predicated upon the necessity of these documents or securities being negotiable instruments in the restricted sense that the appellant contends for.\nThis was further emphasized by the Chief Justice of this Court in the judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court in the case of The King v. National Trust Company[15].\nAt pp. 676 and 677, after referring to Mr. Dicey\u2019s book at p. 342, he says:\nThe judgment in Attorney-General v. Bouwens[16], at the pages mentioned in the judgment delivered in this court (pp. 191-2)[17], distinguishes simple contract debts from debts by specialty, as well as from debts embodied in negotiable instruments, that is to say, instruments the delivery of which effects a transfer of the debt. Negotiable instruments are treated as instruments \u201cof a chattel nature capable of being transferred by acts done here, and sold for money here,\u201d as \u201cin fact a simple chattel\u201d; therefore, it is said, \u201csuch an instrument follows the nature of other chattels as to the jurisdiction to grant probate.\u201d The criterion expressed in Mr. Dicey\u2019s words may fairly be said to be that approved in the judgment in Attorney-General v. Bouwens[18] as respects negotiable instruments and other kinds of intangible property which are \u201cdealt with\u201d ordinarily and naturally by transferring them.\nThe Chief Justice says in this passage, it will be noticed, that the criterion applies not only to \u201cnegotiable instruments\u201d but also to \u201cother kinds of intangible property which are \u2018dealt with\u2019 ordinarily and naturally by transferring them.\u201d\nThe necessary consequence, and we may say the logical consequence, is that the rule applies, not only to negotiable instruments so-called, but also to instruments which are marketable securities, saleable and transferable by delivery only, without it being necessary to do any act outside of the jurisdiction where they are found, in order to render their transfer valid.\nIt remains only to consider whether the deposit receipt under discussion is such an instrument.\nAs long ago as Richer v. Voyer, decided in the Privy Council in the year 1874[19], Sir Montague Smith, delivering the judgment of the Board upon, a bank deposit receipt in most respects similar to the present one and payable to order as this one is, but not marked: \u201cThis receipt is negotiable,\u201d said (p. 475):\nIt appears that certificates of this kind are in common use among bankers in Canada and the United States, and considerable discussion has taken place in those countries as to their legal character.\nP. 476:\nThe word \u201cpayable\u201d in the certificate in question unquestionably imports a promise to pay the sum deposited, and interest at 4 per cent., and \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019ordre\u201d are the apt words to constitute a negotiable instrument transferable by indorsement (see Art. 2286). So far the essential attributes of a negotiable promissory note are obtained; but it was said that the provisions that the money should not carry interest unless it remained at least three months in the bank, and that the holder of the certificate should not withdraw the money until after fifteen days\u2019 notice, the interest ceasing from the day of notice, imported conditions and contingencies incompatible with the certainty required in such an instrument. The answer given to this objection was, that the provision as to interest only prescribed the time when it was to commence and cease; and that the stipulation for fifteen days\u2019 notice introduced no more uncertainty into the promise than occurs in a bill payable so many days after sight. Sir Montague Smith afterwards refers to, as he says,\nan American text writer of high authority, Mr. Parsons, who, in his Treatise on Promissory Notes and Bills of Exchange, after stating that certificates of this nature were in common use and had given occasion to much discussion, and after referring to numerous cases containing conflicting decisions, and among them Patterson v. Poindexter[20], says: \u201cWe think this instrument (of which he gives the form) possesses all the qualities of a negotiable promissory note, and that seems to be the prevailing opinion.\u201d (vol. 1, p. 26). It is to be observed, however, that the form given by Mr. Parsons omits the provisions as to interest and notice which appear in the present certificate.\nFrom the evidence given by bankers and others who were called in this case to prove a custom, it certainly appears that these certificates have been commonly treated as transferable by indorsement, but whether with recourse to the indorser does not appear.\nThe only essential difference between the deposit receipt under consideration in Richer v. Voyer[21] and the deposit receipt now in question is that in this case the bank reserved unto itself the right to change the rate of interest. Otherwise, the wording of the present receipt is really more favourable to the respondents\u2019 contention, in view of the provision therein that \u201cThis receipt is negotiable.\u201d\nHere, the evidence is that, so far as the bank is concerned, this form of deposit receipt is called negotiable; and it is regarded and treated by it as negotiable. It was stated by the officers of the bank who testified in the case that,\nin general practice, if it [i.e., the deposit receipt] is indorsed in accordance with the way it is made payable, it will be negotiated and paid. * * * if the payee indorses it, the bank considers it is properly transferred. * * * It is the practice for the bank to honour indorsement by the payee. * * * [and] it could come through another bank, with another party.\nAs a consequence, indorsation of the document in this case operates as a transfer both of the instrument and of the debt to which it is a title. After indorsation, the receipt is capable of being transferred by delivery only and sold in the foreign jurisdiction where it was found; and the stipulation is as between obligor and obligee that the obligor will pay to anyone who holds the document. Such a stipulation is perfectly good. Such payment would be good as against the obligee (Willis, Law of Negotiable Securities, p. 32). It may be that the stipulation falls short of negotiability within its restricted meaning; but undoubtedly the document is capable of being transferred by delivery. Its sale transfers a valid title to the debt itself. It is a saleable chattel within the meaning of the judgments above referred to; and, therefore, it is situated where it is found and it follows the nature of other chattels as to the jurisdiction to grant probate. Even if the receipt does not possess the incidents of a promissory note, of a bill of lading or of other negotiable instruments in the restricted sense, it was meant to be transferred by endorsement. It is so far negotiable as to pass a good and valid title to the debt; and it follows inevitably from the evidence that, in the words of Lord Abinger (Attorney-General v. Bouwens[22]), the \u201cinstrument has been clearly framed with a view to its becoming a subject of sale and easily transmissible from hand to hand.\u201d\nIt may be further added that, in the circumstances, the deposit receipt could be completely reduced into possession for all material purposes in Minneapolis, where it was and is transferable by acts done solely in the State of Minnesota; that when so reduced into possession by the executors, they held a marketable security saleable and, after indorsation, transferable by delivery only; that it was not necessary for them to do any act out of Minnesota in order to render the transfer of the instrument valid; and that the executors, or their transferee, could maintain an action, if necessary, against the Royal Bank of Canada, in the Manitoba courts, without taking out ancillary letters of administration in that province.\nIn those circumstances, our opinion is that the deposit receipt, and the debt of which it is the title, is locally situated in Minneapolis, in the State of Minnesota; that it is not, therefore, property situate within the province of Manitoba; and, accordingly, it is not subject to succession duty under the Succession Duty Act of Manitoba, as claimed by its Provincial Treasurer.\nA secondary point was raised by the appellant as regards the authority of the bank officials who signed the deposit receipt. But, on the evidence, it was made clear that the Bank admits its liability; and we do not think it is open to the appellant thus collaterally to attack the validity of the instrument in that respect.\nThis disposes of the appellant\u2019s contentions, except, perhaps, that a word should be added concerning the Lovitt case (1), strongly relied on by him at the argument. In our view, the decision in that case does not apply here. The deposit receipt there under discussion was marked \u201cnot transferable.\u201d It lacked, therefore, the essential element on which lies the whole foundation of our judgment in the premises.\nIt has been said of the Lovitt case (1) (see: Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr (2)) that it was one of a local probate duty charged by the Province, where the property was locally situate, for the collection or local administration of the particular property, and was not a case of pure taxation.\nIn fact, in that case, the point here put forward by the respondents and with which this Court agrees, was neither raised nor discussed; and, in view of the non-transferable character of the deposit receipt there in question, the point did not arise.\nThe appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John Allen.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Sweatman, Fillmore, Riley & Watson.\n[1] 44 Man.

V, c. 78, s. 24), extending the wording to include any authorized trustee in bankruptcy, be deemed ultra vires, the City\u2019s reliance on s. 112 (11) is not defeated. In its original form without the amendment it is not bankruptcy legislation and is competent provincial legislation, and (by force of s. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act) covers the present case. The amendment in 1922 may be disregarded or severed.\nPer Duff CJ.: At the date of the adjudication in bankruptcy the bankrupt\u2019s goods and chattels were liable to seizure and sale by the City under s. 112 (2) of the Ontario Assessment Act. S. 112 (11) of that Act (and disregarding said amendment in 1922) provided procedure by notice in the circumstances therein mentioned and required the amount due for taxes to be paid \u201cin preference and priority,\u201d etc., (see supra). The City\u2019s right under the law of Ontario to seize and sell and to pay the taxes out of the proceeds, and, in proceedings under provincial statutes for the distribution of the debtor\u2019s goods for the benefit of creditors, to be paid the amount due for taxes in preference and priority as aforesaid, is a right in the nature of a \u201clien or charge\u201d within the contemplation of the second branch of s. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act, a right which, by force of s. 125, it is the trustee\u2019s duty to recognize. In this view, the validity of said amendment in 1922 is immaterial.\n(3) The Toronto Electric Commissioners are merely the statutory agent and manager of one of the City\u2019s public utilities, and their charges for supply of electrical energy come within the words \u201ctaxes, rates or assessments\u201d in s. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act, and by the Public Utilities Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 249, s. 26(2), may be entered on the tax collector\u2019s roll; therefore they stand in the same position as the City.\n(4) The rights and priorities of the landlord, upon the bankruptcy of a lessee, are left by s. 126 of the Bankruptcy Act to be determined by the laws of the province regulating the rights and priorities of the landlord consequent upon an abandonment or voluntary assignment by a lessee for the benefit of creditors. The \u201cpreferential lien of the landlord for rent\u201d mentioned and restricted by s. 37 (1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 190, is, as created or given effect to therein, a statutory lien as a substitute for distress (Re Fashion Shop Co., 33 Ont. L.R. 253, Lazier v. Henderson, 29 Ont. R. 673, and other cases in the Ontario courts, referred to). This preferential lien is preserved by force of s. 126 of the Bankruptcy Act, and, as s. 121 of that Act is expressly made subject to the provisions of s. 126, the landlord\u2019s claim takes precedence over the claims of those creditors given certain priorities by virtue of s. 121, including the custodian and the trustee and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. But the landlord\u2019s claim is subject in priority to that of the City of Toronto (and to that of the Toronto Electric Commissioners), as the consequence that \u201cwould have ensued under the laws of the province\u201d (s. 126 of the Bankruptcy Act), on a voluntary assignment for benefit of creditors, would have been that the City took priority over the landlord by virtue of s. 112 (11) of the Ontario Assessment Act.\n(5) The custodian\u2019s costs and expenses and the trustee\u2019s fees and expenses (all, for the purpose of priority, treated as one claim) and the claim of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board rank next (in the order given), in accordance with the priorities specifically given by s. 121 of the Bankruptcy Act.\n(6) As to the claim of the Minister of National Revenue for sales tax: The Crown in right of the Dominion is, by s. 188 of the Bankruptcy Act, bound by the priorities set up by that Act; and, having no lien or charge to secure the payment of its sales taxes, cannot rank ahead of those creditors or of the trustee who are by that Act secured or given a special priority. It takes first among ordinary creditors by virtue of the prerogative.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1936] O.R. 510, varied.\nThe orders granting special leave to appeal to this Court expressly provided that the appellants should not be required to give any security for the costs of their appeals. No security was in fact given, and s. 174 (4) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that in such circumstances an appellant \u201cshall not be awarded costs in the event of his success upon such appeal.\u201d S. 174 (4) does not prevent costs being given against such an appellant when unsuccessful.\nAPPEALS (by special leave granted by a Judge of this Court) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming, with one variation as to priority of claims, the judgment of McEvoy J.[2] on an application by the trustee in bankruptcy to the Judge in bankruptcy for directions and to determine the priority in which the claims in question should be paid.\nGeneral Fireproofing Company of Canada Ltd., which carried on business in Toronto, Ontario, made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act on August 1, 1935. The assets of the estate (other than those pledged to a bank) consisted of cash on hand and machinery, equipment and shop supplies. These assets (other than cash) were sold, and, after payment of an amount owing under a conditional sale agreement and certain disbursements, the balance in the estate for distribution was $4,318.65. The claims now in question (claimed as preferred claims) in the aggregate exceeded the said amount, and therefore the trustee made the aforesaid application for directions to determine priority of payment.\nThe claimants and the nature of the claims in question are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, more particularly in the judgment of Davis J., and are indicated in the above headnote.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and J.P. Kent for the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners.\nL. Duncan K.C. for the Trustee.\nG.A. Urquhart K.C. and H.H. Ellis for the Attorney-General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue.\nL.A. Richard for the Treasurer of the Province of Ontario.\nR.M. Fowler for Gibson Bros. (landlord).\nW.F. Spence for the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Davis with which I fully agree. In the observations which follow I am putting my views on the points discussed in a slightly different form.\nIt will be convenient to consider first the claims of the Corporation of the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners. The amount due to the Corporation by the bankrupt for business tax for 1935 was $330.67, and the amount due to the Tax Collector of the same Corporation for Hydro-Electric rates by the bankrupt was $319.35. It is contended that, by force of section 125 of the Bankruptcy Act, it is the duty of the trustee to pay these claims in priority to all other claims (other than the claim of the Treasurer of the Province of Ontario) now in question out of the moneys in his hands for distribution. It was conceded in the Court below that the claim of the Treasurer for the Province takes priority over other claims; and effect must be given to that concession here.\nSection 125 is in these words:\nNothing in the four last preceding sections shall interfere with the collection of any taxes, rates or assessments payable by or levied or imposed upon the debtor or upon any property of the debtor under any law of the Dominion, or of the province wherein such property is situate, or in which the debtor resides, nor prejudice or affect any lien or charge in respect of such property created by any such laws.\nThe four preceding sections mentioned are, first of all, s. 123 which enacts that, subject to the provisions of the statute, all debts proved in the bankruptcy or under an assignment shall be paid pari passu.\nSection 121 (1) provides for certain priorities: in respect of the costs and expenses of the custodian and fees and expenses of the trustee; in respect of certain costs of garnishing, attaching, execution and judgment creditors; in respect of the indebtedness of the bankrupt under any Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and in respect of wages, salaries and compensation payable to employees.\nWith section 122, which deals with the application of the joint and separate assets of partners, and section 124, which provides for the payment of interest where there is a surplus, we are not concerned.\nIt will be observed that s. 125 enacts two things. First of all, that these provisions for distribution pari passu and for priorities shall not interfere in any way with the collection of taxes, rates or assessments chargeable against the bankrupt personally or against his property under any law of a province where such property is situate or where the bankrupt resides; and, further, that nothing in these provisions shall prejudice or affect any lien or charge in respect of such property created by any such laws.\nIt is not necessary for the purposes of this case, in my view of it, to consider the effect of the first branch of this section in cases to which the second branch has no application, that is to say, where no lien or charge upon the property of the debtor attaches to the obligation of the taxpayer in respect of the tax or assessment in question. My conclusion is that, by force of the enactments of the Assessment Act of Ontario, such a lien or charge is created and is attached to the right of the municipality to be paid the tax known as business tax. It is not disputed that, in this respect, no substantial distinction exists between moneys payable as business tax and moneys payable as hydro-electric rates.\nI turn then to the provisions of the Assessment Act. By section 9 (11):\nEvery person assessed for business assessment shall be liable for the payment of the tax thereon and the same shall not constitute a charge upon the land occupied or used.\nSubsection 2 of section 112 reads:\nSubject to the provisions of section 111, in case of taxes which are not a lien on land remaining unpaid for fourteen days after demand or notice made or given pursuant to sections 107, 109 or 111, the collector, or where there is no collector, the treasurer, may by himself or his agent (subject to the exemptions provided for in subsection 4) levy the same with costs by distress:\n1. Upon the goods and chattels of the person taxed wherever found within the county in which the municipality lies for judicial purposes;\n2. Upon the interest of the person taxed in any goods to the possession of which he is entitled under a contract for purchase, or a contract by which he may or is to become the owner thereof upon performance of any condition;\n3. Upon any goods and chattels in the possession of the person taxed where title to the same is claimed in any of the ways defined by sub-clauses a, b, c and d in subsection 1 of this section, and in applying the said sub-clauses they shall be read with the words \u201cor against the owner though his name does not appear on the roll,\u201d and the words \u201cor such owner,\u201d and the words \u201con the land\u201d omitted therefrom;\n(The sub-clauses here mentioned are in these words:\n(a) By virtue of an execution against the person taxed or against the owner, though his name does not appear on the roll; or\n(b) By purchase, gift, transfer or assignment from the person taxed, or from such owner, whether absolute or in trust, or by way of mortgage or otherwise; or\n(c) By the wife, husband, daughter, son, daughter-in-law or son-in-law of the person taxed, or of such owner, or by any relative of his, in case such relative lives on the land as a member of the family; or\n(d) By virtue of any assignment or transfer made for the purpose of defeating distress;)\n* * *\n4. Upon goods and chattels which at the time of making the assessment were the property and on the premises of the person taxed in respect of business assessment and at the time for collection of taxes are still on the same premises, notwithstanding that such goods and chattels are no longer the property of the person taxed.\nThe right created by these provisions, it will be observed, is a right (inter alia) to take possession of and sell by process of distress any goods of the taxpayer within the county in which the municipality for judicial purposes lies. The same right is given in respect of any interest under any contract of purchase or any contract under which the taxpayer is entitled to acquire ownership on the performance of any condition. The right is operative notwithstanding the fact that title to the goods and chattels is claimed by virtue of an execution against the person taxed or that such title is claimed by purchase, gift, transfer or assignment from the person taxed, or that such title is claimed by virtue of any assignment or transfer made for the purpose of defeating distress; and the right is operative also in certain cases where the title is claimed by relatives.\nWhere goods liable to seizure under these provisions have been attached or seized under an attachment or execution, the procedure is provided for by subsection 11; and in that case it is sufficient to give a notice to the sheriff or bailiff stating the amount due for taxes; and it is then the duty of the sheriff or bailiff to pay such amount \u201cin preference and priority to any other and all other fees, charges, liens or claims whatsoever.\u201d\nThe same procedure obtains and has the same legal consequences where the goods have come into the possession of a liquidator or an assignee for the benefit of creditors.\nI confine my attention for the present to the statute as it stood prior to the amendment of 1922 by which it was in express terms made applicable to trustees in bankruptcy. The result was that, as regards goods and chattels falling within the classes mentioned, the municipality had the right to take possession and sell for the purpose of obtaining payment and to pay itself out of the proceeds of the sale; and in those cases in which process by execution had intervened or there had been an assignment for the general benefit of creditors or winding-up proceedings were in progress, there was a right to be paid in priority to other creditors. The winding-up proceedings contemplated by the statute prior to the amendment of the section in 1922, no doubt, were winding-up proceedings under the authority of the provincial law.\nTurning again to s. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act. It would appear that this right given by the law of Ontario to seize and sell and to pay the taxes out of the proceeds of the sale and to require in the cases mentioned payment of the amount due for taxes in preference and priority over \u201call other claims, fees, charges and liens\u201d is a right in the nature of a \u201ccharge or lien\u201d within the contemplation of that section, a right which, by force of the section, it is the duty of the trustee to respect and to acknowledge. It follows that the claim of the municipality must take priority over the claim of the trustee and the claim under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and over the claims of ordinary creditors which are to be paid pari passu.\nAs regards the claim of the Minister of National Revenue, he has no lien or charge, and his privilege in virtue of the prerogative is only available as against ordinary creditors.\nAs to the landlord\u2019s claim, different considerations arise. His claim rests upon his right of distress and his cognate \u201cpreferential lien\u201d; but it becomes operative solely by force of s. 126. It is not necessary for us to consider for our present purpose the relative rights of the landlord and the taxing authority under the law of Ontario when both have distrained or attempted to do so, because s. 126 provides explicitly that the landlord\u2019s place in the distribution in bankruptcy\u2014his rights and priorities\u2014is to be determined by ascertaining what his rights and priorities would have been if the debtor had made a voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors under the law of the Province of Ontario. Now, in this respect, the enactments of subsection 11 seem to be unambiguous as well as explicit. In such a case the taxing authority is entitled to be paid in preference and priority over all other claims, liens and charges. This language is broad enough, and I have no doubt was intended, to embrace the claim of the landlord.\nIn this view it is unnecessary to discuss the question whether the amendment of section 112 (11) of the Assessment Act, which was effected in the year 1922, and which professed to extend the provisions of the section to \u201cany trustee or authorized trustee in bankruptcy,\u201d is ultra vires. I am unable to perceive any valid ground for attacking the section as it stood prior to that amendment as an incompetent exercise of the legislative authority of the Legislature of Ontario. Assuming the amendment to have been ultra vires, that cannot, in the view expressed above, affect the substance of the matter. The substance of the matter is that, at the date of the adjudication in bankruptcy the goods and chattels of the bankrupt affected by the statute were liable to seizure and sale by the municipality to enable the municipality to obtain payment of taxes and, generally, in proceedings under the provincial statutes for a the distribution of the goods of the debtor for the benefit of creditors, the municipality was entitled to be paid before anybody else.\nThis right being, in my view, in the nature of a lien or charge within the contemplation of section 125 of the Bankruptcy Act, it is the duty, as already observed, of the trustee under that section in the distribution of the bankrupt estate to recognize it.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This is a contest in bankruptcy among several creditors and the trustee, each seeking priority of payment against the others in the distribution of the property of the bankrupt company which is insufficient to pay all in full.\nSec. 123 of the Bankruptcy Act provides that, subject to the provisions of the Act, all debts proved in the bankruptcy shall be paid pari passu. Sec. 121 creates priorities in respect of four classes of creditors, only two of which, the custodian and the trustee treated as one, and the Ontario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board as the other, are involved in this dispute. If they were the only creditors claiming priority and sec. 121 were held entirely to govern the priority of payment of their claims, the costs and expenses of the custodian and the fees and expenses of the trustee would be paid first and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board would have to look for payment to what, if anything, was left of the estate.\nBut the difficulties arise in that there are several creditors who claim a position higher even than that of the trustee and who further contend for certain priorities among themselves.\nThe landlord asserts a special priority on the assets of the estate by virtue of section 126, because section 121 is expressly made \u201csubject to the provisions of section 126 as to rent.\u201d Section 126 reads as follows:\n126. When a receiving order or an assignment is made against or by any lessee under this Act, the same consequences shall ensue as to the rights and priorities of his landlord as would have ensued under the laws of the province in which the demised premises are situate if the lessee at the time of such receiving order or assignment had been a person entitled to make and had made an abandonment or a voluntary assignment of his] property for the benefit of his creditors pursuant to the laws of the province; and nothing in this Act shall be deemed to suspend, limit or affect the legislative authority of any province to enact any law providing for or regulating the rights and priorities of landlords consequent upon any such abandonment or voluntary assignment; nor shall anything in this Act be deemed to interfere or conflict with the operation of any such provincial law heretofore or hereafter enacted in so far as it provides for or regulates the rights and priorities of landlords in such an event.\nWhen the Bankruptcy Act was first enacted in 1919, 9-10 Geo. V, ch. 36, the Parliament of Canada made its own law with respect to the rights of landlords by section 52 thereof, but that section was repealed in 1923, 13-14 Geo. V, ch. 31, sec. 31, and the present section 126 was substituted. It is plain that Parliament decided to leave the rights and priorities of the landlord, upon the bankruptcy of any lessee, to be determined by the laws of the province, in which the land is situate, regulating the rights and priorities of landlords consequent upon an abandonment or voluntary assignment by a lessee for the benefit of creditors. The landlord in this case asserts by virtue of sec. 37 of the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 190, a preferential lien for the arrears of rent due during the period of three months next preceding and for three months following the date of bankruptcy. Sec. 37, subsec. (1), reads as follows:\n37. (1) In case of an assignment for the general benefit of creditors, or an order being made for the winding-up of an incorporated company, or where a receiving order in bankruptcy or authorized assignment has been made by or against a tenant, the preferential lien of the landlord for rent shall be restricted to the arrears of rent due during the period of three months next preceding, and for three months following the execution of the assignment, and from thence so long as the assignee retains possession of the premises, but any payment to be made to the landlord in respect of accelerated rent shall be credited against the amount payable by the assignee, liquidator or trustee for the period of his occupation.\nThe Treasurer of the Province of Ontario claims to rank ahead of all the other creditors and the trustee in respect of a small claim under the Corporations Tax Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 29. Sec. 20 of that Act reads as follows:\n20. Every tax and penalty imposed by this Act shall be a first lien and charge upon the property in Ontario of the company liable to pay the same.\nCounsel for the Provincial Treasurer not only claimed priority by prerogative of the Crown, in right of the Province, but claimed that the Province was by virtue of said sec. 20 a secured creditor and its rights as such preserved by secs. 24 and 25 of the Bankruptcy Act; and further that the Province\u2019s claim to taxes is in any case preserved by sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act, which reads as follows:\n125. Nothing in the four last preceding sections shall interfere with the collection of any taxes, rates or assessments payable by or levied or imposed upon the debtor or upon any property of the debtor under any law of the Dominion, or of the province wherein such property is situate, or in which the debtor resides, nor prejudice or affect any lien or charge in respect of such property created by any such laws.\nThe Attorney-General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue also claim to take first place in respect of sales taxes due by the debtor to the Crown in right of the Dominion. The claim for sales taxes arose under sec. 86 of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 179, and amending Acts, and more particularly subsec. 1 (a) thereof which, speaking generally, imposed a sales tax of six, per cent. on the sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the delivery of such goods to the purchaser thereof. Sec. 107 of this Act imposes certain duties on trustees in bankruptcy in the distribution of estates. Counsel for the Attorney-General and the Minister of National Revenue contended that by virtue of sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act and of the prerogative of the Crown, in right of the Dominion of Canada, the claim for sales taxes is a preferred claim payable by the trustee in priority not only to the claim of the Province of Ontario and the claim of the trustee but in priority to all other claims. It may be observed here that at one time the payment of sales taxes was specifically secured by a statutory lien or charge but such provision was repealed and is not now available to the Minister of National Revenue in the collection of sales taxes.\nThe Ontario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board claims priority by virtue of sec. 121 of the Bankruptcy Act and alternatively as an agency of the Crown in right of the Province.\nThe City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners assert the right to come first for their claims for business taxes and for the supply of electrical energy, respectively, by virtue of the combined effect of sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act and of subsec. (11) of sec. 112 of the Ontario Assessment Act, which latter provision reads, since its amendment in 1922 by 12\u201113 Geo. V, ch. 78, sec. 24, as follows:\n112 (11). Where personal property liable to seizure for taxes as hereinbefore provided is under seizure or attachment or has been seized by the sheriff or (by a bailiff of any court or is claimed by or in possession of any assignee for the benefit of creditors or liquidator or of any trustee or authorized trustee in bankruptcy or where such property has been converted into cash and is undistributed, it shall be sufficient for the tax collector to give to the sheriff, bailiff, assignee or liquidator or trustee or authorized trustee in bankruptcy notice of the amount due for taxes, and in such case the sheriff, bailiff, assignee or liquidator or trustee or authorized trustee in bankruptcy shall pay the amount of the same to the collector in preference and priority to any other and all other fees, charges, liens or claims whatsoever.\nThis provincial enactment is relied upon as available to the municipality in the collection of its taxes, rates or assessments by virtue of sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe trustee claims to rank first upon the estate as a fund in his hands impressed with a trust out of which he is entitled to be paid, as a first charge thereon, his compensation and disbursements.\nIt is convenient to dispose of the Dominion and the Province before proceeding to discuss the difficult question of the municipality\u2019s claim to priority over both the landlord and the trustee. So far as the Dominion is concerned, sec. 188 of the Bankruptcy Act expressly enacts that, save as provided in the Act, the provisions of the Act relating to remedies against the property of a debtor and the priorities of debts shall bind the Crown. The Crown in right of the Dominion is bound, therefore, by the priorities set up by the Bankruptcy Act, and, having no lien or charge to secure the payment of its sales taxes, cannot rank ahead of those creditors or of the trustee who are either secured or given a special priority by the Bankruptcy Act. The contention of the Province of Ontario might present considerable difficulty but for the fact that the Province was given by the courts below the first position and its claim is not open to attack on this appeal because the Province was virtually conceded in the courts below priority over all others, perhaps because its claim was only $116.76.\nNow as to the City of Toronto. The Toronto Electric Commissioners are merely the statutory agent and manager of one of the city\u2019s public utilities and will stand in the same position as the city unless the charges for the supply of electrical energy cannot be said to come within the words \u201ctaxes, rates or assessments\u201d in sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act. This question may be passed over for the moment. The real dispute is between the municipality and the landlord. The trustee did not appeal to this Court but is respondent in the appeals of the Attorney-General of Canada, the Ontario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and the City of Toronto and Toronto Electric Commissioners, and if any variation of the allocation of the claims of the several creditors and of the trustee to priority as fixed in the judgment appealed from is to be made in this Court upon the appeals of those creditors who did appeal, we should examine the whole matter, including the true position of those parties who would be affected adversely by any re-allocation.\nThe City\u2019s contention is based, as already noted, upon sec. 112 (11) of the Ontario Assessment Act, which, it is argued, is available to the city by virtue of sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act. The city\u2019s claim is for business taxes. There is no lien or charge upon the property of the taxpayer to secure the payment of business taxes as there is in the case of land taxes, nor is there any lien or charge to secure the payment of the charges of the Toronto Electric Commissioners. The city therefore has to rely upon the provisions of sec. 112 (11) of the Ontario Assessment Act. This remedy is really a substitute for distress where personal property liable to seizure for taxes, or the undistributed cash proceeds thereof, are taken or held in the course of execution or liquidation. It is contended against the city, and this view prevailed in the court below, that sec. 112 (11) is ultra vires the province in so far as by the amendment of 1922 the provisions of the then section were extended to include any trustee in bankruptcy. But Parliament plainly intended by sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act that the Act should not interfere with \u201cthe collection of any taxes, rates or assessments\u201d payable by or levied or imposed upon the debtor or upon any property of the debtor under any law of the province wherein such property is situate or wherein the debtor resides. The provincial law in that respect was preserved and there was to be no interference by the Parliament of Canada, dealing in bankruptcy matters, with the collection of taxes. Sec. 112 (11) of the Ontario Assessment Act was in full force and effect before the passing by the Parliament of Canada of the Bankruptcy Act, except as to the amendment made in 1922 by the Ontario Legislature adding throughout the subsection the words \u201cor of any trustee or authorized trustee in bankruptcy.\u201d Plainly sec. 112 (11) in its original form is not bankruptcy legislation and is competent provincial legislation. It covered every possible condition known to the Legislature at the time of its enactment that might occur whereby the goods of the debtor would pass into the possession of some third person owing to seizure, attachment, execution or liquidation. That was the remedy available for the collection of municipal taxes under the provincial law, and the effect of sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act was to leave the local law in respect of the collection of taxes undisturbed. There was no real necessity for the amendment of the Ontario Act; it was broad enough itself to cover a case such as this, provided the Dominion statute left the provincial law unaffected and this it did by sec. 125. If, however, it be thought that the amendment was beyond the power of the province in that it directs that the trustee in bankruptcy \u201cshall pay the amount of the [taxes] to the collector in preference and priority to any other and all other fees, charges, liens or claims whatsoever,\u201d the amendment may be disregarded or the subsection severed. The service of the notice would remain and be sufficient in itself because sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act provides that the collection of taxes imposed by provincial laws is not to be interfered with by the Bankruptcy Act.\nCounsel for the landlord argued that, even in this view of sec. 112 (11) of the Ontario Assessment Act, the City is not entitled to rank ahead of the landlord, because sec. 125 relating to the collection of taxes commences with the words \u201cNothing in the four last preceding sections shall interfere with\u201d and not with such words as \u201cNothing contained in this Act shall interfere with,\u201d and sec. 121, the first of the \u201cfour last preceding sections,\u201d expressly commences with the words \u201cSubject to the provisions of section 126 as to rent.\u201d By virtue of sec. 126 \u201cthe same consequences shall ensue as to the rights and priorities of his landlord,\u201d when a receiving order or an assignment is made against or by any lessee under the Act, \u201cas would have ensued under the laws of the province in which the demised premises are situate\u201d if the lessee had made an abandonment or voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors pursuant to the laws of the province. Counsel for the landlord further calls our attention to the concluding words in sec. 126, that\nnothing in this Act shall be deemed to suspend, limit or affect the legislative authority of any province to enact any law providing for or regulating the rights and priorities of landlords consequent upon any such abandonment or voluntary assignment; nor shall anything in this Act be deemed to interfere or conflict with the operation of any such provincial law heretofore or hereafter enacted in so far as it provides for or regulates the rights and priorities of landlords in such an event.\nThe entire section, 126, has already been set out and it is unnecessary to repeat it.\nIt becomes necessary now to examine the question raised against the landlord by counsel for the city that the \u201cpreferential lien,\u201d so-called, referred to in sec. 37 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, above set out, is not in reality a security in the nature of a charge or lien upon the property, but is merely a preference, and that, accordingly, the city, with its statutory right under sec. 112 (11) of the Assessment Act to payment \u201cin preference and priority to any other and all other fees, charges, liens or claims whatsoever,\u201d is entitled to rank ahead of the landlord whose claim, it is argued, is only that of a preferred creditor without security. The settled jurisprudence of the province of Ontario in relation to the words \u201cthe preferential lien of the landlord for rent\u201d was stated by the late Chancellor Boyd in Re Fashion Shop Co.[3]:\nThe phrase \u201cthe preferential lien of the landlord for rent\u201d means * * * that the landlord has a statutory lien upon goods available for distress, independent of actual distress or possession, for the amount of the rent as limited by the section.\nThis conclusion was based upon the decision and the reasoning of Street, J., in Lazier v. Henderson[4], especially at pp. 678-9, where it is observed that any other construction would make the words of the section meaningless. The decision in Tew v. Toronto Savings & Loan Co.[5] followed the Lazier decision (2), as did also the case of Re D.S. Paterson Co.[6] As early as 1879 the Ontario Court of Appeal in Re McCracken[7] discussed the same phrase \u201cthe preferential lien of the landlord for rent\u201d as it appeared in the then Insolvent Act of 1875. I know of no decision that has ever reduced the substance and effect of the language of the statute, \u201cthe preferential lien of the landlord for rent\u201d to a mere preferred claim in liquidation and I am quite satisfied, consistent with the decisions as I read them, that it is perfectly plain that the landlord was given a statutory lien as a substitute for distress. Underlying the right to the lien there must be a contractual obligation for the acceleration of rent in the events specified, but the statute, while creating or giving effect to the lien to secure the payment of rent, expressly limits and restricts the lien to the arrears of rent during the period of three months next preceding and for three months following the execution of the assignment. This preferential lien is preserved by force of sec. 126 of the Bankruptcy Act and as sec. 121 of the Bankruptcy Act dealing with priority of claims is expressly made subject to the provisions of sec. 126, the claim of the landlord plainly takes precedence over the claims of those creditors given certain priorities by virtue of sec. 121 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThat does not yet determine the question of priority as between the municipality and the landlord. Sec. 126 only gives to the landlord \u201cthe same consequences\u201d as would have ensued under provincial law if the lessee had made an abandonment or a voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors pursuant to the laws of the province. That section entitles us, in considering the conflict between the municipality and the landlord, to exclude bankruptcy legislation in arriving at the rights of the landlord and the municipality between themselves. If the debtor here had not in fact become bankrupt but had made in Ontario an abandonment or a voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors, the claim of the municipality would have taken priority over the claim of the landlord because under provincial law the landlord, while entitled to \u201cthe preferential lien\u201d to which we have referred, would have had to give way to the right of the municipality under sec. 112 (11) of the Ontario Assessment Act to collect the amount due for taxes \u201cin preference and priority to any other and all other fees, charges, liens or claims whatsoever.\u201d That undoubtedly would have been the consequence that \u201cwould have ensued under the laws of the province\u201d if the lessee had made an abandonment or a voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors pursuant to the laws of the province. Can it be said that under the Bankruptcy Act the landlord is entitled to a better position as between himself and the municipality than he would have had, if the lessee had made a voluntary assignment? Sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act says, \u201cnothing in the four last preceding sections shall interfere with\u201d the collection of taxes nor prejudice or affect any lien or charge in respect of the property of the debtor created by any law of the province wherein such property is situated. The consequence that would have ensued, as between landlord and the city, on a voluntary assignment under provincial laws would have been that the city would have taken priority over the landlord by virtue of sec. 112 (11).\nBut the landlord takes, by virtue of sec. 126 of the Bankruptcy Act, priority over the custodian, the trustee, and the Ontario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, who are specifically given certain priorities by virtue of sec. 121 and cannot claim a better position than that given to them by the express language of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe charges of the city\u2019s statutory agent, the Toronto Electric Commissioners, for the supply of electrical energy come within the words \u201ctaxes, rates or assessments\u201d in sec. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act, and by the Ontario Public Utilities Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 249, sec. 26 (2), may be entered on the tax collector\u2019s roll. Therefore the Toronto Electric Commissioners stand in the same position as the city.\nThe respective priorities of the parties involved in these proceedings should be settled as follows:\n(1) The Province of Ontario.\n(2) The City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners.\n(3) The landlord.\n(4) The custodian and trustee.\n(5) The Ontario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.\nThe Minister of National Revenue takes first among ordinary creditors by virtue of the prerogative. In the circumstances of this case it is impossible to fix equitable debits and credits as to costs. The City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners, appellants, have succeeded in the appeal in gaining second place, after the Province of Ontario (whose claim is only $116.76), whereas they were given no priority and treated as ordinary unsecured creditors in the judgments of both McEvoy J. and the Court of Appeal. The landlord, Gibson Bros. Limited, who were given the second place in both courts below for their claims totalling $2,812.50, are now put in the third position, immediately after the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners, whose claims total $650.02. In the ordinary course the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners, having succeeded in their appeal, would be entitled to their costs, but the order of my brother Kerwin in granting special leave to appeal to this Court expressly provided that these appellants should not be required to give any security for the costs of their appeals, and no security was in fact given. Sec. 174 (4) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that in such circumstances an appellant \u201cshall not be awarded costs in the event of his success upon such appeal.\u201d Therefore the appellants the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners, though successful, are not entitled to be awarded the costs of their appeal. A similar order dispensing with security for costs was made when special leave to appeal was granted to the Attorney-General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue for Canada, and again when leave was granted to the Ontario Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. The former appellants do not succeed. They were given sixth place by McEvoy J. and were raised to fifth place by the order of the Court of Appeal but are now put in the class of ordinary creditors subject only to the prerogative right of being paid first among the ordinary creditors. The City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners as well as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board have gained priority over them. The appellant, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, did not succeed in its main contention on its appeal and, though it remains in the sixth place, it finds the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners now ahead of it, but the priority of the Minister of National Revenue has disappeared. Sec. 174 (4) does not prevent costs being given against such appellants when they are unsuccessful. But the total claim of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board was only $82.51, while the claim of the Minister of National Revenue for sales taxes was $1,566.74. It is quite impossible to work out any equitable scheme for the apportionment or distribution of the costs, and, under all the circumstances, justice, I think, will be done in directing that there be no costs in the appeals for or against any of the parties, except that the trustee shall have his costs, as between solicitor and client, out of the estate.\nBut we must consider the disposition of costs in the courts below. The Court of Appeal ordered the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners to pay to the trustee and to the Treasurer of Ontario and to Gibson Bros. Limited, the landlord, one-half of their costs in the Court of Appeal, and the Attorney-General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue to pay to the trustee and to the Treasurer of Ontario and to Gibson Bros. Limited one-half of their costs in the Court of Appeal. As to the costs before McEvoy J., the Court of Appeal, with some hesitation, left the disposition of the costs of the application for directions as McEvoy J. had disposed of them, that is, to be paid out of the assets of the estate in priority to the payment of the claims of the several creditors.\nIn view of the re-allocation of priorities made by this Court, it would be unfair to the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners to leave undisturbed the order of the Court of Appeal whereby they were ordered to pay one-half of the costs of the trustee and of the Treasurer of Ontario and of the landlord. Obviously that provision, in view of our disposition of the appeals, should not stand. On the other hand, the Attorney-General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue, having failed in their appeals to this Court, are not entitled to have the order of the court appealed from disturbed.\nThe order of this Court as to costs will be, therefore, that there be no costs for or against any party either in this Court or in the Court of Appeal for Ontario except that the trustee shall have his costs, as between solicitor and client, of the appeals to this Court, and that the Attorney-General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue shall remain liable to pay to the trustee and to the Treasurer of Ontario and to Gibson Bros. Limited one- half of their costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and that so much of the costs of the trustee, as between solicitor and client, of the appeal to the Court of Appeal which may not be recovered from the Attorney-General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue shall be paid out of the assets of the estate. The trustee\u2019s costs shall take priority over payment of the claims of those creditors represented in these proceedings. The order of McEvoy J. as to the costs of the application before him shall remain as affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nJudgment appealed from varied as to the respective priorities of the parties.\nSolicitor for the City of Toronto and the Toronto Electric Commissioners: C.M.

(R.S.O., 1927, c. 150, as amended in 1931, c. 23, s. 7), ss. 56(2), 57(1).\nAt the time of his death (November 10, 1931) H. was indebted to the plaintiff bank, which held as collateral security hypothecations by H. of share certificates and bonds. The terms of the hypothecations gave the right to the bank upon default in payment to realize on the securities, without prejudice to its claims for any deficiency. Defendants were executors and trustees under H.\u2019s will and obtained probate thereof. The bank demanded payment and threatened to sell the securities and look to defendants for payment of any deficiency. The defendants, on December 23, 1933, notified the bank that they were of opinion that there might be a deficiency of assets to meet creditors\u2019 claims and required it, within 30 days, to prove its claims and give particulars of, and place a specified value on, each of its securities. This notice was given pursuant to s. 56(2) of the Trustee Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 150, as amended in 1931, c. 23, s. 7 (but which fixes no period of time for running of the notice). The bank, on January 4, 1934, wrote to defendants stating the amount due, a list of securities and its intention, failing some satisfactory arrangement, to proceed to realize thereon. On January 23, 1934, it filed its claim with particulars of securities. It did not place a value on the securities. The defendants did not apply under s. 57(1) of said Act (as amended as aforesaid) for an order requiring the bank to value its securities or be barred from sharing in the estate. The bank sold the securities, commencing on January 15, 1934, and, after notice by defendants of contestation, and pursuant to a court order obtained, sued defendants for the amount of the deficiency.\nHeld: The bank was entitled to recover. The notice of December 23, 1933, the bank\u2019s failure to value, and its sale of the securities, did not bar its right to judgment. (Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1936] O.R. 402, reversed).\nPer Duff C.J.: The effect of the amendment in 1931 enacting ss. 56 and 57 of the Trustee Act was not to abrogate the right theretofore existing of a creditor to rank upon the estate of a deceased person and substitute a new right\u2014but to modify the right,\u2014attaching certain incidents to it and giving certain rights to the legal personal representative. As to the right to call upon the creditor to value his security, the statute provides a sanction and nominates the procedure for enforcement, and, by well known principles, the legal personal representative must resort to this procedure in the enforcement of the right. The defendants could have proceeded under s. 57; they could have taken steps to prevent the sale of the securities; it might be that they had an action for damages; but the effect of the statute was not to put the bank, after the notice of December 23, to its election to value its securities or rely exclusively upon them without remedy for any deficiency, nor, merely by reason of said notice and the course taken by the bank, to cause the bank to lose its contractual right to claim for a deficiency.\nThe statutory provisions in question, postulating, as they do, a possible deficiency of assets, are intended for the protection of the creditors and, where creditors\u2019 rights are not in any way in jeopardy, those provisions cannot be resorted to for the sole benefit of the beneficiaries of the estate.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: Where it says in s. 56(2) that the personal representative \u201cmay require\u201d a creditor to place a specified value on his security, the word \u201crequire\u201d has not an imperative force, but is merely descriptive of one step in the proceedings that may be taken to secure a valuation by the creditor. As defendants had not followed the notice by securing an order under s. 57(1), the bank was never called upon to choose between relying only upon the securities and placing a value upon them, and had never lost its right under the terms of the hypothecations to sell the securities and claim for any deficiency.\nPer Davis J.: The defendants, not having obtained the relief provided by s. 57(1) for breach by the bank of its duty under s. 56(2) (which relief, being that expressly provided by the same statute which created the new duty, is the only one available), had no defence upon the ground of said breach to the bank\u2019s action to recover the amount of the contractual debt.\nOn an application under s. 57(1) the judge is not bound to make the order provided for therein; he may exercise his discretion, having regard to all the facts and circumstances brought to his attention.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of McFarland J.[2]) held that the plaintiff\u2019s action claiming against the estate of which respondents were the executors should foe dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue on this appeal are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported and are indicated in the above headnote. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court was allowed with costs.\nG.R. Munnoch K.C. for the appellant.\nS.L. Springsteen K.C. for the respondents.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be allowed.\nIf I may say so with the greatest respect, it appears to me that there is a fallacy in the judgments in the courts below in this sense: it is assumed, I think, that the right of a creditor to rank upon the estate of a deceased person which obtained at the time of the passing of the enactment now under consideration was by that enactment abrogated and that there was substituted for it a new right, the right given by the statute.\nI am unable myself to read the statute in that way. I think the effect is that the right of the creditor is modified, that certain incidents are attached to it and certain rights given to the legal personal representative. Broadly speaking, there is a right to call upon the creditor to value his security and a right to take over the security on the terms mentioned in the statute. As regards the first of these rights, the statute provides a sanction, nominates the procedure by which it is to be enforced, and, I think, by the well known principles, the legal personal representative must resort to this procedure in the enforcement of that right.\nI am not saying that, as regards the option to take over the security, the ordinary common law remedies are not available, or that, if the creditor is dealing with his securities in such a way as to prevent the legal personal representative exercising his option, the latter is without a remedy.\nIn the case before us, the creditors, in May, 1932, demanded payment of the liabilities of the deceased and, after having received a notice on the 23rd of December, 1933, from the legal personal representatives requiring the creditors to value their securities, the creditors notified them that unless some arrangement satisfactory to the creditors should be made they would proceed to realize the securities commencing on the 10th of January, 1934. There could be no doubt that the legal personal representatives were apprized of the position taken by the creditors and they chose to rest upon their position under the statute which they conceived to be, as they are contending on this appeal, that, after the notice of December, the creditors were put to their election to value their securities and prove their claims or to rely exclusively upon their securities without remedy in respect of any deficiency.\nI do not think that the effect of the statute is to put the creditors in this position. The legal personal representatives might have proceeded under section 57. They might have taken steps to prevent the sale of the securities, and it may be that they have or had an action for damages against the creditors; but there is no warrant in the statute, I think, for saying that the contractual rights of the creditors have been lost by reason of the course they took, in the absence, at all events, of any proceeding under section 57 by the legal personal representatives.\nThere is one further point which I think ought to be mentioned. These provisions, in my judgment, postulating, as they do, a possible deficiency of assets, are intended for the protection of the creditors of the estate and, where the rights of creditors are not prejudiced, they cannot, I think, be resorted to by the legal personal representatives for the sole benefit of the beneficiaries of the estate. There is no ground, I think, for imputing to the legislature an intention that, where the claims of creditors are not in any way in jeopardy, the contractual right of any particular creditor shall be impaired for the benefit of the beneficiaries.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff, the Canadian Bank of Commerce, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, reversing the judgment at the trial, dismissed the action against the respondents, the executors and trustees of the will of Dr. Charles Westlake Hoare.\nThe testator had incurred liabilities to the Bank and, from time to time, as collateral security therefor had hypothecated to the Bank a number of share certificates and bonds. This action was brought to recover the amount claimed to be due under the various obligations after crediting thereon the proceeds of the sale of the securities. The correctness of the sum for which judgment was entered after trial is not in question, but liability is disputed by reason of the sale by the Bank of the securities under circumstances now to be explained.\nThe form of hypothecation signed by Dr. Hoare on each occasion contained a list of the particular securities deposited therewith and continued:\nThe above mentioned securities and any renewals thereof and substitutions therefor and the proceeds thereof are hereby assigned to and are held by the Canadian Bank of Commerce (hereinafter called the Bank) as a general and continuing collateral security for the payment of the present and future indebtedness and liability of the customer to the Bank wheresoever and howsoever incurred and any ultimate unpaid balance thereof, and such securities, or any part thereof from time to time, may be realized, sold, transferred and delivered by the Bank in such manner as may seem to it advisable and without notice to the undersigned, in the event of any default in such payment, or prior to any such default in the event that the said securities, or any part thereof from time to time shall, in the opinion of the Bank, depreciate in value. The proceeds may be held in lieu of the securities realized and may, as and when the Bank thinks fit, be appropriated on account of such parts of the said indebtedness and liability as to the Bank seems best, without prejudice to its claims upon the customer for any deficiency.\nDr. Hoare died November 10th, 1931, and on April 10th, 1932, letters probate of his last will and testament were granted to the respondents. By a letter of May 14th, 1932, addressed to the respondents, the Bank demanded payment of all the deceased\u2019s liabilities to it, concluding its letter as follows:\nWithout prejudice to or limiting the effect of the above demand further notice is hereby given that if payment is not provided forthwith or adequate collateral security furnished, we will sell the securities we hold at our discretion and look to you for payment of any deficiency.\nDiscussions ensued as to the possibility of the Bank holding the pledged securities for a rise in the market, or placing a valuation on them with the understanding that the estate would bear any loss or reap any appreciation that might occur by reason of changing market conditions; but these proposals were deemed unsatisfactory by the superior officers of the Bank and of the Trusts and Guarantee Company Limited, one of the executors. On December 23rd, 1933, the executors gave the Bank a notice, which will require consideration later, but which is inserted at this point in order to complete the narrative:\nIn the Surrogate Court of the County of Essex.\nIn the matter of the Estate of Charles W. Hoare, late of the Town of Walkerville, County of Essex, Deceased.\nTo\u2014The Canadian Bank of Commerce.\nThe Executors of the Will of Charles W. Hoare, Deceased, being of the opinion that there may be a deficiency of assets to meet the claims of creditors against the said estate, hereby give you notice that you are hereby required pursuant to the provisions of The Trustee Act, R.S.O., 1927, Chapter 150, and amendments thereto, and more particularly the Statute Law Amendment Act, 1931, Section 7 thereof, to prove your claim, if any, against the estate of the said Deceased, within thirty (30) days from the date hereof.\nAnd further take notice that you are required, within thirty days from the date hereof, to state whether you hold any security for your claim or any part thereof, and to give full particulars of the same, and if such security is on the estate of the Deceased, or on the estate of the third person for whom the estate of the Deceased is only indirectly or secondarily liable to place a specified value on each and every such security.\nDated this 23rd day of December, A.D. 1933.\nThe Trusts and Guarantee Company Limited\nPer \u201cO. H. Birchard\u201d\nManager.\nand \u201cJ.H. Mothersill,\u201d\nExecutors of the Will of\nCharles W. Hoare, Deceased.\nBy letter dated January 4th, 1934, the Bank notified the executors of the amount of its claim and of its determina- tion to realize the securities, commencing January 10th, 1934, unless arrangements satisfactory to the Bank were made in the meantime, but did not \u201cplace a specified value\u201d on the securities. No such arrangements being made, the Bank commenced to realize the securities on January 15th, 1934, and continued from time to time until they were all sold. After crediting the proceeds of the sales a balance remained, for which the Bank is admittedly entitled to judgment in this action against the executors unless the latter are able to escape liability by virtue of the combined effect of the notice of December 23rd, 1933, and of the provisions of sections 56 and 57 of the Ontario Trustee Act as enacted by section 7 of chapter 23 of 21 Geo. V. These sections are as follows:\n56. (1) On the administration of the estate of a deceased person, in case of a deficiency of assets, every creditor holding security on the estate of the deceased debtor or on the estate of a third person for whom the estate of the deceased debtor is only indirectly or secondarily liable, shall place a value on such security and the creditor shall rank upon the distribution of assets only upon the unsecured portion of his claim after deducting the value of the security, unless the personal representative shall elect to take over the security as hereinafter provided.\n(2) Where the personal representative of a deceased person is of the opinion that there may be a deficiency of assets, he may require any creditor to prove his claim and to state whether he holds any security for his claim or any part thereof, and to give full particulars of the same and if such security is on the estate of the deceased debtor or on the estate of a third person for whom the estate of the deceased debtor is only indirectly or secondarily liable, to place a specified value on such security and the personal representative may either consent to the creditor ranking for the amount of his claim after deducting such valuation or may require from the creditor an assignment of the security at an advance of ten per centum upon the specified value to be paid out of the estate as soon as the personal representative has realized upon such security or is in a position to make payment out of the assets of the estate and in either case the difference between the value at which the security is retained or taken, as the case may be, and the amount of the claim of the creditor, shall be the amount for which he shall rank upon the estate of the deceased debtor.\n(3) Where inspectors have been appointed as hereinafter provided or where the estate is being administered under the direction or by a court, the personal representative in making his election shall act under the direction of the inspectors or of the court, as the case may be, and the remuneration of the inspectors shall be determined by the surrogate court judge on the passing of accounts.\n(4) If the claim of the creditor is based upon a negotiable instrument upon which the estate of the deceased debtor is only indirectly or secondarily liable and which is not mature or exigible, the creditor shall be considered to hold security within the meaning of this section and shall put a value on the liability of the person primarily liable thereon as his security for the payment thereof, but after the maturity of such liability and its non\u2011payment he shall be entitled to amend and revalue his claim. 57. (1) Where a creditor fails to value any security held by him which under the provisions of this Act he is called upon to value, the personal representative may apply to the judge of the surrogate court from which probate or letters of administration were issued in a summary way for an order that unless a specified value shall be placed on such security and notified in writing to the personal representative, within a time to be limited by the order, such claimant shall, in respect of the claim or the part thereof for which security is held, be wholly barred of any right to share in the proceeds of the estate unless the judge upon the application of the creditor extends the time for the valuation of the security.\n(2) Where an estate is being administered by or under the direction of a court, such court shall exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this section upon the judge of the surrogate court.\nIt will be observed that the executors\u2019 notice was given under subsection 2 of section 56, as it is stated therein that the executors are \u201cof the opinion that there may be a deficiency of assets to meet the claims of creditors.\u201d The heading \u201cIn the Surrogate Court of the County of Essex\u201d is in error, as the notice was not given in the course of any proceedings in that court. The only other remark that might be made with reference to the form of the notice is that there is no authority in sections 56 and 57 of the Trustee Act whereby the executors might limit the Bank to \u201cthirty days from the date hereof\u201d to give particulars of its claim and to value its securities. It was suggested that the Court should declare the period a reasonable one, but in my view of the matter the point need not be considered.\nIt is admitted that in fact the assets of the estate are about sufficient to liquidate all claims against it and certainly are more than ample to pay all claims except the one in suit. However, presuming good faith on the part of the executors in forming their opinion as to the possibility of a deficiency of assets, the question still remains as to whether the giving of the notice and the subsequent sale of the securities by the Bank debar the latter from recovering judgment.\nIt is undoubted that, at the date of the death of Dr. Hoare, under the power given by the various hypothecations, the Bank could have sold its securities and claimed for any deficiency; and that right continued down to the receipt by it of the notice of December 23rd, 1933. However, it is argued that subsection 2 of section 56 of the Act is imperative where it states that the personal representative \u201cmay require any creditor to prove his claim, etc.\u201d While it is admitted that if the creditor abstains from valuing his securities, the only remedy of the personal representative to compel valuation is to secure an order under subsection 1 of section 57, nevertheless it is contended that in this case, by selling the securities subsequent to the receipt of the notice, the Bank has elected to rely upon such securities. With great respect to the opinions of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, who so construed the statute, I am unable to agree.\nIn view of the opening phrases of subsection 1 of section 57, \u201cWhere a creditor fails to value any security held by him which under the provisions of this Act he is called upon to value,\u201d the executors could not, without a prior request, obtain the order mentioned in a later part of the subsection. That request is provided for by subsection 2 of section 56, as the Bank is not \u201ccalled upon to value\u201d except when the executors have required the Bank so to do. The words \u201cmay require\u201d are not imperative but merely descriptive of one step in the proceedings which the executors may take to secure a valuation by the creditor. This conclusion is fortified by the words \u201ccalled upon to value\u201d in subsection 1 of section 57.\nUnder the hypothecations, the Bank had the right to sell the securities \u201cwithout prejudice to its claims upon the customer for any deficiency.\u201d The Bank never gave up its right under these documents, and, in my view of the statute, it was never called upon to choose between relying only upon the securities and placing a value upon them. I fail to see that the respondents\u2019 argument is strengthened by stating that, by reason of the Bank\u2019s neglect to value its securities, the executors lost their right either to consent to the Bank ranking for the amount of its claim after deducting such valuation, or to require from the Bank an assignment of the securities at an advance of ten per centum upon the specified valuation (subsection 2 of section 56). That right is given only if the creditor, in pursuance of the notice or of an order obtained under subsection 1 of section 57, actually does value.\nThe members of the Court of Appeal considered they were bound by In Re Beaty[3], a decision under the Insolvent Act of 1875 (38 Vict., chapter 16), but I am unable to find any analogy between the provisions of any insolvency legislation, crystallising, as they generally do, the rights of creditors as of the date of insolvency, and the legislation here in question. Moreover, section 82 of the Act under consideration in the Beaty case3 provided that\nno dividend shall be allotted or paid to any creditor holding security from the estate of the insolvent for his claim, until the amount for which he shall rank as a creditor upon the estate as to dividends therefrom, shall be established as hereinafter provided.\nSection 84 then provided that a creditor holding security\nshall specify the nature and amount of such security * * * in his claim, and shall therein, on his oath, put a specified value thereon.\nIt is true that section 82 is not specifically mentioned in the judgments, but the decision was arrived at after a consideration of the scope of the whole Act and the intention of Parliament in dealing with secured creditors. Even in comparing various Insolvency Acts, the differences in the schemes adopted must be borne in mind. In the Beaty case3 the Court distinguished a previous decision, In Re Hurst[4], under the Insolvent Act of 1864, and the present Bankruptcy Act deals with secured creditors in a manner quite different from that in either the statutes of 1864 or 1875.\nThe sections of the Trustee Act replaced by 21 Geo. V, chapter 23, section 7, dealt only with the estates of deceased persons \u201cin case of a deficiency of assets\u201d and these provisions may be traced back to 59 Vict. (Ont.), chapter 22, An Act respecting the Estates of Insolvent Deceased Persons. It was in 1931 that the legislature for the first time undertook to deal with the situation where the personal representative was of the opinion that there might be a deficiency of assets. For the reasons already given, it is impossible to find in the legislation an intention that a holder of securities (which may include, as in this case, those having a fluctuating value) is compelled to decide, upon the receipt of a notice from the personal representative of a deceased debtor, whether to value his securities or to realize upon them; at the risk, in the latter event, of losing his right to rank upon the estate for any deficiency.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout. DAVIS J.\u2014The Ontario Legislature, in its Statute Law Amendment Act, 1931 (21 Geo. V, ch. 23, sec. 7), enacted new sections 56, 57 and 58 of the Trustee Act. New sec. 56(1) deals with the administration of the estate of a. deceased person in case of a deficiency of assets; new sec. 56(2) deals with the case where the personal representative of a deceased person \u201cis of the opinion that there may be a deficiency of assets.\u201d This subsection is as follows:\n56. (2) Where the personal representative of a deceased person is of the opinion that there may be a deficiency of assets, he may require any creditor to prove his claim and to state whether he holds any security for his claim or any part thereof, and to give full particulars of the same and if such security is on the estate of the deceased debtor or on the estate of a third person for whom the estate of the deceased debtor is only indirectly or secondarily liable, to place a specified value on such security and the personal representative may either consent to the creditor ranking for the amount of his claim after deducting such valuation or may require from the creditor an assignment of the security at an advance of ten per centum upon the specified value to be paid out of the estate as soon as the personal representative has realized upon such security or is in a position to make payment out of the assets of the estate and in either case the difference between the value at which the security is retained or taken, as the case may be, and the amount of the claim of the creditor, shall be the amount for which he shall rank upon the estate of the deceased debtor.\nThe respondents, the personal representatives of the late Charles Westlake Hoare, deceased, who died on or about the 10th day of November, 1931, gave a notice to the appellant, the Canadian Bank of Commerce, a secured creditor of the deceased, under date of December 23rd, 1933, wherein they expressed their opinion that there might be a deficiency of assets to meet the claims of creditors against Dr. Hoare\u2019s estate and, pursuant to the amendments of the Trustee Act made by the Statute Law Amendment Act, 1931, \u201crequired\u201d the appellant to prove its claim, if any, against the estate of the said deceased within thirty days from the date thereof. It is to be noticed in passing that new sec. 56(2) does not fix any period of time for the running of the notice contemplated by that subsection. The notice continued:\nAnd further take notice that you are required, within thirty days from the date hereof, to state whether you hold any security for your claim or any part thereof, and to give full particulars of the same, and if such security is on the estate of the deceased, or on the estate of the third person for whom the estate of the deceased is only indirectly or secondarily liable to place a specified value on each and every such security. In partial compliance with the said notice, the appellant filed its claim, dated the 23rd day of January, 1934, with particulars in detail of the numerous securities held by it, but did not value such securities. By a letter dated the 4th day of January, 1934, the appellant had advised the respondents of the then amount of the indebtedness, $67,249.85, and had given a list of all the securities, and, after referring to an earlier demand for payment dated May 14, 1932, which had not been met, had stated:\nUnless some arrangement satisfactory to the Bank is made in the meantime, the Bank has determined to proceed to realize these securities commencing on the 10th of January, 1034, and as to the proceeds realized the Bank will exercise its right to apply the same on such part or parts of the indebtedness of the late Dr. Hoare to the Bank as the Bank may see fit.\nNo arrangement was made by the respondents satisfactory to the appellant and the appellant commenced to realize on the securities on or about 15th January, 1934. The realization was substantially completed during the month of January, though the sale of some of the securities did not occur until February. On the 26th of February, 1934, the respondents served notice on the appellant, pursuant to sec. 62 of the Surrogate Courts Act, that they contested the appellant\u2019s claim. The notice, entitled \u201cIn the Surrogate Court of the County of Essex\u201d continued:\nYou may apply to the Judge of this Court for an Order allowing your claim and determining the amount of it; and if you do not make such application within thirty days after receiving this notice or within such further time as the judge may allow you shall be deemed to have abandoned your claim and the same shall be forever barred.\nOn the 17th day of April, 1934, the appellant, pursuant to an order made by the Judge of the Surrogate Court, dated the 19th day of March, 1934, which had ordered and directed the appellant to bring an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario within thirty days for the purpose of establishing or recovering its claim against the respondents, issued the writ of summons in this action to recover payment of the amount of the deficiency following upon the sale of the securities. There is no dispute between the parties as to the amounts involved, $26,828.45 in respect of a claim upon a guarantee bond and $882.55 upon a promissory note.\nThe learned trial judge gave judgment in favour of the appellant, but that judgment was set aside on appeal by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The appellant in this Court seeks to have the trial judgment restored.\nThe respondents have really only one defence to the action; that is, that the appellant failed to value the securities in accordance with the respondents\u2019 demand or notice dated the 23rd December, 1933, given pursuant to new sec. 56(2) of the Trustee Act, and, having sold and disposed of all or substantially all of the securities before the expiration of the time limited by the demand or notice for complying therewith, thereby lost its right to recover the amount of the deficiency resulting from the sale of the securities.\nNow sec. 57(1) of the Trustee Act as enacted by the Statute Law Amendment Act, 1931, provides as follows:\n57. (1) Where a creditor fails to value any security held by him which under the provisions of this Act he is called upon to value, the personal representative may apply to the judge of the surrogate court from which probate or letters of administration were issued in a summary way for an order that unless a specified value shall be placed on such security and notified in writing to the personal representative, within a time to be limited by the order, such claimant shall, in respect of the claim or the part thereof for which security is held, be wholly barred of any right to share in the proceeds of the estate unless the judge upon the application of the creditor extends the time for the valuation of the security.\nThe respondents never applied to the Judge of the Surrogate Court for an order barring the appellant of any right to share in the proceeds of the estate. No such order is set up as an answer to the action, and it is frankly admitted that no such order was ever sought by the respondents. It is suggested that because the securities, or at least some of them, had been actually sold before the expiration of the thirty days\u2019 notice, nothing was to be gained to the respondents in applying for the order. There was some suggestion during the argument that under section 57 the Surrogate Court is bound to make an order such as provided in that section when there has been a failure on the part of the secured creditor to value securities, but I do not read the section in that way. While the personal representative may apply \u201cin a summary way\u201d for the order, that does not mean that the order is to be granted ex parte as a matter of right. It merely means that the application is to be dealt with in an expeditious manner, the same as an application for summary judgment in an action. The Surrogate Judge undoubtedly may exercise his discretion, having regard to all the facts and circumstances which may be brought to his attention. But no such application was made and no such order obtained and yet the respondents set up the failure of the appellant to value the securities, pursuant to the written demand of the respondents, as a bar to the action to recover the debt.\nThere is no dispute that by written contract the deceased gave the appellant an express right not only to sell the securities but to look to him for any deficiency on the sale of the securities. The contractual rights and obligations are perfectly plain, and the appellant is entitled to recover the debt sued for unless there is some statutory bar arising out of the failure of the appellant to place a value on the securities in compliance with the respondents\u2019 demand of December 23, 1933. The only statutory bar is provided by sections 56(2) and 57(1) of the Trustee Act above set out. In my opinion, the respondents had no defence to the action upon the debt unless they could produce an order of the Surrogate Judge properly made under sec. 57(1) wholly barring the appellant of any right to share in the proceeds of the estate of the deceased. That there was a breach on the part of the appellant of the statutory duty, I think is plain. The statute gave the right to the respondents in the circumstances (the good faith of the respondents\u2019 opinion that there might be a deficiency of assets is not questioned) to require the appellant to place a specified value on the securities. But this was an entirely new statutory duty imposed by sec. 56(2) upon secured creditors of deceased persons in cases where the personal representative is of the opinion that there may be a deficiency of assets, and the statute which imposed the duty expressly provided by sec. 57(1) a remedy for a breach of the duty. In my opinion, that is the only available relief.\nLord Esher, M.R., in Robinson v. Workington Corporation[5], said:\nIt has been laid down for many years that, if a duty is imposed by statute which but for the statute would not exist, and a remedy for default or breach of that duty is provided by the statute that creates the duty, that is the only remedy.\nCraies on Statute Law (4th ed., 1936), at p. 220, states the general rule in these words:\nIf a statute creates a new duty or imposes a new liability, and prescribes a specific remedy in case of neglect to perform the duty or dis- charge the liability, the general rule is \u201cthat no remedy can be taken but the particular remedy prescribed by the statute.\u201d\nThe respondents, not having obtained the statutory relief that may be given in the event of a breach of the statutory duty, had no defence upon that ground to the appellant\u2019s action to recover the amount of the contractual debt. And no other ground of defence than the breach of the statutory duty was relied upon.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored, with costs to the appellant throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Blake, Lash, Anglin & Cassels.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McTague, Springsteen & McKeon.\n[1] [1936] O.R. 402; [1936] 3 D.L.R. 205.\n[2] [1936] 1 D.L.R. 394.\n[3] (1880) 6 A.R. 40.\n[4] (1871) 31 U.C.R. 116.\n[5] [1897] 1 Q.B. 619, at 621.\n"}

Authorities reviewed.\nPlaintiff sued K. and D. for damages for alleged breach of a contract to purchase goods, which contract was made under seal between plaintiff and K. Plaintiff alleged that subsequent to the contract K. introduced D. as the principal on whose behalf K. had entered into it, and that D. confirmed that representation. The trial judge dismissed the action (on ground of illegality of the contract) and an appeal from his judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. K. had not been represented at trial or on the hearing of the appeal, and plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal to this Court was directed only to the defendant D. and asked for judgment against him. At the hearing of the appeal before it this Court pointed out that the contract was under seal and D. was not a party to it, and referred to the principle first above stated.\nHeld: The action, being solely one at law to recover damages for alleged breach of contract under seal, was not maintainable against D., on the principle first above stated.\nThe Court could not disregard the said point of law, though D. had not raised it at any time in the proceedings. It appeared upon the very document sued upon and put in at the trial. Nor could the Court entertain the argument that K. was merely an agent for D. and exceeded his authority in attaching a seal to the contract and in making the contract to purchase himself for his own benefit\u2014that was not the basis of the action. Nor could plaintiff succeed upon an alternative contention that D. subsequently ratified the contract and might accordingly be sued upon it. Nor was there any foundation for the application of the doctrine of novation. Nor was this a case where D. had himself received the benefit under the contract and was bound in equity to pay for the same.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Rose, C.J.H.C., dismissing his action. The action was brought to recover damages for alleged breach of a contract to purchase whiskey. The material facts of the case for the purposes of the judgment of this Court are sufficiently stated in that judgment, now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed\u2014but without costs, as the ground for dismissal by this Court (namely, that the appellant\u2019s action, being solely one at law to recover damages for alleged breach of a contract under seal, was not maintainable against the respondent who was not one of the parties to the contract) had not been raised by the respondent at any stage of the proceedings. (The point was raised by this Court during the argument and opportunity was given to counsel to submit argument upon it).\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and J.R. Cartwright K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Racine K.C. and A.F. Gignac for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The appellant commenced this action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against the respondent Diesbourg and one Kellner, defendants, by writ of summons issued June 1st, 1934. The material portions of the Statement of Claim are as follows:\n2. On or about the 10th day of October, 1933, the defendant Edward H. Kellner, representing himself to the plaintiff as one of a syndicate who are in the market to buy liquor in bond in bonded warehouse for export to the United States, entered into a contract with the plaintiff herein, and the plaintiff alleges that he then told the said defendant that he had an arrangement with Consolidated Distilleries Limited whereby he could sell its brands of whiskey and he also disclosed to the defendant that he, the plaintiff, was making 17 cents per American gallon on said whiskey.\nThe plaintiff prays leave to refer to contract entered into between George Margolius and Edward H. Kellner which contract is dated the 10th day of October, 1933. 3. The plaintiff further alleges, and the fact is, the defendant Edward H. Kellner subsequently introduced the defendant Arthur Diesbourg to the plaintiff as the principal on whose behalf he had entered into the contract, which representation was confirmed by Arthur Diesbourg and the plaintiff also disclosed to the defendant Arthur Diesbourg the source of his supply and that he was making 17 cents on each and every gallon.\n4. According to the agreement the defendant Edward H. Kellner contracted to purchase 200,000 gallons of whiskey at the price of $4.55 per American gallon, wood included, in bonded warehouse which contract the defendants failed to carry out.\n5. The plaintiff alleges and the fact is that the defendant Edward H. Kellner and the defendant Arthur Diesbourg failed to fulfil the agreement with the plaintiff, in that they did not carry out the contract pursuant to the terms thereof, in which contract the defendant Arthur Diesbourg is the undisclosed principal and furthermore the said defendant refused to carry out the contract.\n6. As a result of the facts set forth in the foregoing paragraphs the plaintiff by reason of breach of contract suffered damages to the extent of 17 cents per American gallon on 200,000 gallons of whiskey which was to be purchased by the defendants.\n7. The plaintiff therefore claims from the defendants herein\n(a) $34,000 damages for breach of contract.\n(b) The costs of this action.\n(c) Such further and other relief as to this honourable Court may seem just.\nThe contract sued upon dated October 10, 1933, is as follows:\nTHIS AGREEMENT made in duplicate this 10th day of October, A.D. 1933.\nBETWEEN: GEORGE MARGOLIUS, of the City of Toronto, in the County of York, Gentleman,\nHereinafter called the Vendor,\nOf the FIRST PART;\nand\nE.H. KELLNER, of the City of Windsor, in the County of Essex, Gentleman,\nHereinafter called the Purchaser,\nOf the SECOND PART:\nWITNESSETH that in consideration of the sum of TWO DOLLARS ($2) now paid by the purchaser to the vendor (the receipt whereof is hereby by him acknowledged), and of these presents, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. The purchaser hereby agrees to buy from the vendor and the vendor hereby agrees to sell to the purchaser one hundred thousand gallons (100,000) of Consolidated Distilleries Limited American Type Rye Whiskey and One Hundred thousand gallons (100,000) of Consolidated Distilleries Limited Bourbon Whiskey (measurement to be in American Gallons\u2014128 ounces to the gallon) (Virgin Whiskey four years old or older to test 116 American Proof Gallons), at the price or sum of $4.55 per gallon, wood included, in bond in bonded warehouse in the Province of Ontario, in the Dominion of Canada.\n2. The purchaser agrees to pay a deposit of 25 per cent. of the total sale price not later than 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of Monday, October 16th, 1933; the said deposit to be paid to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Head Office, Toronto, Ontario, to the order of the vendor; to be paid to the said vendor on the said Bank\u2019s guarantee of delivery in accordance with the terms hereof.\n3. The purchaser hereby undertakes to take delivery of the said whiskey and pay the balance of the purchase price not later than March 31st, 1934; provided that the purchaser may from time to time, before March 31st, 1934, take delivery of any part of the said whiskey, but in not less than carload lots, upon payment in full of the sum of $4.55 per gallon therefor; the intention being that the 25 per cent. deposit to be paid as hereinbefore set forth shall remain as a deposit until the final completion of this contract.\n4. The vendor agrees to store the said whiskey in a bonded warehouse in the Province of Ontario, without charge, up to January 31st, 1934, after which date the purchaser shall pay the storage charges.\n5. Delivery shall be completed by transferring to the purchaser Government Certificates or other documentary evidence showing the whiskey to be in bond in Ontario.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and seals.\nSIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED\nin the presence of\n\u201cSamuel Ciglen.\u201d\n\u201cEdward H. Kellner.\u201d (seal)\n\u201cG. Margolius.\u201d (seal)\nThe action came to trial before the Chief Justice of the High Court without a jury. No one appeared for the defendant Kellner. At the conclusion of the trial, for reasons stated at some length, the learned trial judge dismissed the action with costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Diesbourg. The learned trial judge thought it ought to be found that Diesbourg was a principal and Kellner his agent and that Diesbourg was liable on the contract if anybody was liable. But the learned judge based his dismissal of the action upon the ground of the illegality of the contract. Secs. 72 and 77 of the Ontario Liquor Control Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 257, provide that, except as provided by the Act, no person shall within Ontario sell or offer to sell liquor and no person shall within Ontario attempt to purchase or purchase liquor. The trial judge could find no provision in the Act that takes the plaintiff out of the prohibition of sec. 72. Further, the trial judge refused to entertain the argument of counsel for the plaintiff that the plaintiff was not acting for himself but was a representative of distillers, and in any event was unable to find any section in the Act that gives a distiller the right within Ontario to sell to any person other than the Ontario Liquor Control Board. Even if a distiller had any right to sell, the trial judge did not see how the plaintiff, who is suing upon a contract which professes to evidence a sale by the plaintiff in Ontario, could suggest that the case ought to be treated as if the contracting party, the distiller, were the plaintiff and entitled to have judgment against the purchaser for the purchase price. The contention that the ultimate destination of the liquor was intended to be the United States was considered by the trial judge but he concluded that under the Dominion statute as it stood at the time (the Export Act, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 63, as amended 1930\u201420-21 Geo. V, c. 19) it was not possible for a distiller to sell even to a person in the United States. Under the amending section, notwithstanding the provisions of any other statute or law or regulation, no intoxicating liquor held in bond or otherwise under the control of officials of the Dominion Government under the provisions of the Excise Act, the Customs Act or any other statute of Canada could be released or removed from any bonding warehouse, distillery, brewery or other building or place in which such liquor was stored in any case in which the liquor proposed to be removed was destined for delivery in any country into which the importation of such liquor was prohibited by law, and the trial judge found that the importation of liquor into the United States at the time the contract was made was prohibited and the parties to the transaction knew it. The trial judge further found that the expectation of the parties that within a short time importation into the United States might become legal made no difference. The transaction at the time that it was entered into was a transaction respecting liquor that could not be released from the bonded warehouse. Further, the trial judge put the disposition of the case upon the ground that the seller, the buyer and the liquor were all in Ontario and the sale was made there, and that the use that the buyer intended to make of the liquor was unimportant, as was also the manner in which under the contract delivery was to be made.\nFrom that judgment the plaintiff served notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The appeal was heard by the Chief Justice in Appeal, Mr. Justice Riddell and Mr. Justice Fisher, and was dismissed with costs. No written reasons for judgment appear to have been given. The formal order of the Court of Appeal recites the presence of counsel for the defendant Diesbourg and that no one appeared for the defendant Kellner. The costs of the appeal were directed to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Diesbourg. From that judgment the plaintiff then gave notice of appeal to this Court, and the notice of appeal, which was directed only to the defendant Diesbourg, asked that the said judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario \u201cmay be reversed and that judgment be entered in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant Diesbourg for the relief claimed in the statement of claim.\u201d It is plain that no appeal to this Court was taken against the judgment in so far as the action as against the defendant Kellner had been dismissed.\nMr. Hellmuth in a very able argument presented the facts of the case as the purchase and sale of liquor in bond in Ontario to be exported into the United States when prohibition in that country had ceased. He pointed to clause 5 of the contract which provided that it was only the government certificates and not the liquor itself that were to be delivered to the purchaser, and contended that the transaction was plainly one necessarily involving the export of liquor under Dominion regulations and control and did not fall within the purview of the Ontario statute, if, indeed, anything in that statute could be read in the sense of attempting to interfere with the exportation of liquor, a subject-matter of Dominion legislation. Mr. Hellmuth contended further that, the necessary States of the Union having voted in favour of the repeal of prohibition, the parties were only awaiting the formalities of Congress to give effect to the repeal and that was the reason why March 31, 1934, was specifically mentioned in paragraph 3 of the contract. Mr. Hellmuth stressed the presumption against illegality and argued that if a contract could be performed legally it was not sufficient to show that it could be performed illegally, and that the evidence in this case did not show that it was the intention of the parties to do something with the liquor contrary to law.\nIt becomes unnecessary for us to determine the grounds of appeal advanced by Mr. Hellmuth and Mr. Cartwright so forcibly on behalf of the appellant. During the argument the Court called attention to the fact that the con- tract sued upon was a contract under seal made between the appellant and Kellner. The respondent Diesbourg was not a party to the contract. It has long been settled that no person can sue or be sued in an action at law upon a contract under seal, unless the person is a party to the contract. Pollock on Contracts, 10th ed. (1936), at pp. 97 and 98 states the rule thus:\nWhen a deed is executed by an agent as such but purports to be the deed of the agent and not of the principal, then the principal cannot sue or be sued upon it at law, by reason of the technical rule that those persons only can sue or be sued upon an indenture who are named or described in it as parties.\nThe cases cited in the foot-note in support of that statement are: Lord Southampton v. Brown[1]; Beckham v. Drake[2].\nThe rule was applied in this Court in Porter v. Pelton[3], where it was held that no action could lie on an agreement under seal that had not been signed by the defendant, even if it were an agreement for his benefit and a seal was not necessary.\nThe rule, of course, only applies to actions at law. In a proceeding in equity in respect of a contract involving a trust, different considerations prevail, as Pollock says at p. 98:\nBut where a trustee contracts in his own name alone, even under seal, and afterwards repudiates the trust, the beneficiary can enforce the contract, making him a defendant without a separate application to the Court for authority to sue in the trustee\u2019s name.\nThe action here is solely one at law to recover damages for alleged breach of contract under seal. Newcombe J. in the Vandepitte case[4], carefully reviewed and discussed the well-known cases of Tweddle v. Atkinson[5]; Gray v. Pearson[6]; Gandy v. Gandy[7]; and Dunlop Pneumatic Tire Co. v. Selfridge & Co.[8] The Vandepitte case went to the Privy Council[9], and Lord Wright delivering the judgment said in part at p. 79: No doubt at common law no one can sue on a contract except those who are contracting parties and (if the contract is not under seal) from and between whom consideration proceeds: the rule is stated by Lord Haldane in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge & Co.[10]: \u201cMy Lords, in the law of England certain principles are fundamental. One is that only a person who is a party to a contract can sue on it. Our law knows nothing of a jus quaesitum tertio arising by way of contract. Such a right may be conferred by way of property, as, for example, under a trust, but it cannot be conferred on a stranger to a contract as a right to enforce the contract in personam.\u201d In that case, as in Tweddle v. Atkinson5, only questions of direct contractual rights in law were in issue, but Lord Haldane states the equitable principle which qualifies the legal rule, and which has received effect in many cases, as, for instance, Robertson v. Wait[11]; Affr\u00e9teurs R\u00e9unis Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme v. Leopold Walford (London) Ld.[12]; Lloyd\u2019s v. Harper[13]\u2014namely, that a party to a contract can constitute himself a trustee for a third party of a right under the contract and thus confer such rights enforceable in equity on the third party. The trustee then can take steps to enforce performance to the beneficiary by the other contracting party as in the casse of other equitable rights. The action should be in the name of the trustee; if, however, he refuses to sue, the beneficiary can sue, joining the trustee as a defendant.\nIn the more recent case of Harmer v. Armstrong[14], Lord Maugham (then Maugham J.) fully considered what he called \u201ca curious exception\u201d to the general rule that an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued in his own name on any contract duly made on his behalf,\nin the case of a contract under seal entered into by an agent, even where the agent is described as acting on behalf of a named principal.\nIn such a case\nthe principal can neither sue nor be sued upon it, the rule being that the parties are determined exclusively by the form of the instrument. The reason for the rule is not to my mind a very satisfactory one, but the rule itself is perfectly well settled * * *\nUpon appeal the Court of Appeal, while affirming the decision that the agreement was entered into by the defendant Armstrong as agent and trustee for the plaintiffs and himself, reversed the decision that the fact that the agreement was under seal prevented the plaintiffs from enforcing it in the action. Both Lord Maugham (as he now is) and the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion on the facts that the defendant Armstrong had acted in a fiduciary capacity in relation to the agreement\u2014he was a trustee of the agreement for the plaintiffs and as trustee had committed a breach of trust in not enforcing the con- tract. In those circumstances the Court of Appeal held that the case was plainly one in which the court ought to act on the equitable rule and decree specific performance of the contract.\nIn the case before us the appellant\u2019s action is solely one at law to recover damages for alleged breach of contract under seal. It is not the case of a cestui que trust seeking to enforce a contract when the trustee has committed a breach of trust.\nThe point was not raised by the respondent Diesbourg at any time in the proceedings, and counsel for the appellant contends that the respondent should not now be allowed to set it up in answer to the appellant\u2019s claim. But the appellant sued upon the contract and in his statement of claim prayed leave to refer to it at the trial and the first exhibit put in at the trial on behalf of the appellant was the contract itself, plainly under the seals of both parties to it. The Court cannot disregard the point of law, even at this stage of the proceedings, when it plainly appears upon the very document upon which the action is brought. Nor can we entertain the ingenious argument of counsel for the appellant that Kellner was merely an agent for Diesbourg and exceeded his authority in attaching a seal to the contract and in making the contract to purchase himself for his own benefit. That might entitle Diesbourg to an action against Kellner for damages but it is not the basis of the appellant\u2019s action. Nor can the appellant succeed upon his alternative contention that Diesbourg subsequently ratified the contract and may accordingly be sued upon it. Nor is there any foundation for the application of the doctrine of novation urged upon us by counsel for the appellant. Nor is this a case where the respondent has himself received the benefit under the contract and is bound in equity to pay for the same.\nThe action is not maintainable against the respondent. On this ground alone the appeal must be dismissed, but without costs, as the respondent never raised the point at any stage of the proceedings.\nAppeal dismissed, without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae, Greer & Cartwright.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Racine, Gignac & Fleming.\n[1] (1827) 6 B. & C. 718, 30 R.R. 511.\n[2] (1841) 9 M. & W. at p. 95, affirmed sub nom.

Subsequently one of the named executors died. Later, by codicil, the testator appointed two additional executors. By a subsequent codicil he directed that his son J. be paid $500 a month \u201cin addition to any sum which the courts or other proper authorities may allow him in common with the other executors.\u201d The testator died on December 5, 1923. Nothing was paid to J. in connection with said direction for payment of $500 a month, until March 5, 1927, when a lump sum of $19,500 was paid him to cover the period from the testator\u2019s death to that date. From that date until his death in 1932, J. received the $500 a month. The Minister of National Revenue claimed, under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, for income tax in respect of the payments so received by J.\nHeld: (1) On interpretation of the will, the $500 a month directed to be paid to J. was not a legacy, but additional remuneration to him as executor, and, as such, was taxable income.\n(2) The said lump sum of $19,500 was assessable for income tax in respect of 1927, the taxation year in which it was actually received, notwithstanding that $18,000 of that sum represented arrears that had fallen due during preceding years (the result being that, under the Act, a higher percentage of taxation was imposed than if $6,000 had been allocated to each of the preceding three years).

Mackenzie, deceased, from the judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] affirming the assessment for income tax in respect of certain payments made to the said deceased as set out in the judgment now reported and in the above headnote. The appeal to this Court was, by the judgment now reported, dismissed with costs.\nD. J. Coffey K.C. for the appellants.\nW. S. Fisher for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014This is an income taxation case. The late Sir William Mackenzie of Toronto died on December 5, 1923. By his last will and testament, dated May 20, 1909, he gave and devised all his estate unto three named executors and trustees upon the trusts therein mentioned and provided that his estate should be divided ultimately among his wife and children, and children of any deceased child, as if he had died intestate, with authority to his executors and trustees to make divisions of the estate from time to time when and as in their discretion they should think suitable having regard to the general position of the estate and its future requirements.\nThis will remained unchanged from 1909 until November 14th, 1923, at which time, one of his sons named as an executor and trustee having died, Sir William appointed by codicil two additional executors and trustees, thereby increasing the number from two to four. The following day, November 15th, 1923, by a second codicil he bequeathed the sum of $5,000 to each of his grandchildren then living. On November 28th, 1923, he made a third codicil, upon which the questions in issue in this case have arisen. This codicil was as follows:\nThis is a codicil to the last will and testament of me, William Mackenzie, of Benvenuto, Toronto.\nWhereas by my said will I appointed my son Joseph Merry Mackenzie and Sir Edmund Byron Walker, President of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, to be two of the executors thereof, And whereas by codicil to my said will made on the fourteenth day of November, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, I appointed Robert John Fleming, formerly General Manager of the Toronto Railway Company, and my son-in-law Frank H. McCarthy to be additional executors of my said will Now I Direct that my son Joseph Merry Mackenzie shall be paid Five hundred dollars a month in addition to any sum which the courts or other proper authorities may allow him in common with the other executors. And in all other respects I confirm my said will, and the codicils thereto made.\nThen on December 4th, 1923, another codicil was made providing for the use of the testator\u2019s Toronto home by his daughters upon certain terms and conditions. The following day Sir William died.\nJoseph M. Mackenzie, a son of the testator and one of the executors named in the will, survived his father and died some time in 1932. It was apparently inconvenient for some years for the estate to pay to Joseph M. Mackenzie the $500 a month provided by the third codicil, and nothing appears to have been paid to him in this connection until the 5th of March, 1927, when a lump sum of $19,500 was paid to him to cover the period from the date of the testator\u2019s death to that date. During the balance of the year, 1927, the payments amounted to $4,916.67, making a total sum received by him in that year of $24,416.67. During the succeeding years 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1931, and up to the date of his death in 1932, he appears to have received his $500 a month. None of this money was reported by the late Joseph M. Mackenzie in his income tax returns upon the ground, it is said, that he treated these moneys as a legacy to him. Under section 3 (a) of the Dominion Income War Tax Act these moneys, if a legacy out of capital, would not be taxable, because income as defined by the Act excludes the value of property acquired by gift though not the income from such property.\nThe first question, then, that arises in this case is whether or not, as a matter of interpretation, the $500 a month directed to be paid to the son was a legacy or additional remuneration to him as an executor and trustee over and beyond whatever his portion might be of the compensation which would be allowed by the Surrogate Judge to the executors and trustees upon the passing of their accounts. If it be determined that these moneys were not a legacy but remuneration, then the further (question is raised in this appeal as to whether or not the Department of National Revenue was entitled to assess Mr. Mackenzie for the taxation period 1927 the whole of the sum of $19,500 received by him on March 5, 1927, notwithstanding that $18,000 of that amount represented arrears of monthly payments that had fallen due during the preceding three years. The obvious objection to treating the whole amount as income in the particular year in which it was actually received is that it results in a higher percentage of taxation upon the total amount than could have been imposed had the payments been made as they fell due month by month during the preceding years. The appellants, the executors of the will of the late Joseph M. Mackenzie, contend that if, contrary to their main contention, the payments are not to be treated as a legacy but as additional remuneration, then the assessments should be revised so as to allocate $6,000 to each of the years in respect of which the amounts were payable, and the tax levied accordingly.\nDealing now with the first question, as to whether or not the $500 a month was a legacy or additional remuneration qua executor. It is not unreasonable to assume that the testator realized, or that his attention was called to the fact, that increasing the number of executors from two to four would necessarily involve his son in a substantial decrease of compensation as one of the executors. The codicil does not in precise language say that the $500 a month is additional remuneration to the son as an executor but it is sufficiently definite to express that to be the intention of the testator. The words are,\nWhereas * * * by codicil * * * I appointed * * * additional executors * * * Now I direct that my son * * * shall be paid Five hundred dollars a month in addition to any sum which the courts or other proper authorities may allow him in common with the other executors.\nA fair test to apply is to ask oneself, what would have been the position if the son had renounced his executorship? Could he have enforced payment of this monthly sum while declining, as he would have been quite free to do, to act as an executor of his father\u2019s will? It must be held, I think, that he could not. If that is so, then it was not a legacy but additional remuneration and as such was taxable income.\nBut should the total payment of $19,500 have been assessed in respect of the taxation year in which it was actually received? If so, it is apparent that it works an injustice to the taxpayer, but it is almost inevitable that every general taxation statute will in its application to some particular case create an injustice while in its wide application to normal conditions it will work satisfactorily. The statute here by section 3 defines income as \u201cincome received\u201d and by section 9 imposes the tax upon \u201cthe income during the preceding year.\u201d Unfortunately in this case the taxpayer is bound to pay a larger amount than could have been levied and collected upon the same income had it been paid in instalments month by month as it became due and payable, but that cannot affect the liability plainly imposed by the statute.\nWe were pressed to apply the provisions of section 11 to this income as something that \u201caccrued to the credit\u201d of the taxpayer each month, but section 11 has no application to the facts of this case. It relates only to income of a beneficiary of any estate or trust.\nWe cannot escape from the conclusion, which seems a rather harsh one, that the appeal must be dismissed with costs if asked.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Coffey & McDermott.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. S. Fisher.\n[1] [1936] Ex. C.R. 163.\n"}

Where, as here, a testator has clearly settled a fund for the benefit of a particular charitable institution, from which fund the annual income is to be paid over by the trustees, whose perpetual succession is expressly provided for, that fund is a capital endowment, or in the nature of a capital endowment, created and settled for the benefit of the particular charity so long as it lasts, but no longer. It cannot be treated as an absolute and presently vested gift of the corpus of the fund which the beneficiary at any time may lawfully demand to be paid over to it and the trust in respect thereof arrested and extinguished without reference to the contrary intention of the testator. In the present case it is income that is given and not capital, and to make the order sought would be to vary the trust (In re Blake\u2019s Estate; Berry v. Geen, 53 T.L.R. 411, cited and discussed).\nPer Rinfret and Crocket JJ.: The rule that where there is an unlimited and unrestricted gift of income, the gift carries with it the corpus from which the income is derived, has no application where the will clearly shews, expressly or impliedly, that the testator intends that the gift should not absolutely vest the corpus in the beneficiary. It is not sufficient to carry the corpus that the annual payments of the income therefrom to the beneficiary are intended to continue in perpetuity (which they may be in the case of charitable gifts), if it clearly appears on a perusal of the entire will that, notwithstanding this fact, the testator intended that the beneficiary should not itself take possession of the corpus. (Coward v. Larkman, 56 L.T.R. 278; 57 L.T.R. 285; 60 L.T.R. 1, cited and discussed. In re Morgan, [1893] 3 Ch. 222, discussed). The rule laid down in Saunders v. Vautier, 4 Beav. 115, and the basis of its application in Harbin v. Masterman, [1894] 2 Ch. 184, and (on appeal therefrom) Wharton v. Masterman, [1895] A.C. 186, discussed. Construing, as a whole, the will now in question, it was the testator\u2019s intention to create a perpetual trust in the hands of his trustees, and not to have the trust extinguished and the capital funds taken out of their hands. Per Kerwin J.: If this were a case where the testator had made a gift of income indefinitely to an individual, the latter would be entitled absolutely to the corpus. Wharton v. Masterman, [1895] A.C. 186 (discussed) cannot be relied on as indicating that the same rule applies where the legatee is a charity; that case, on the questions there arising, does not cover the point now in question. The law is correctly stated in Tudor on Charities, 5th ed., at p. 76 as follows: \u201cA charitable trust may be made to endure for any period which the author of the trust may desire. It may therefore be created for the application of the income in perpetuity to the charitable purpose * * *\u201d (Reference also to the same work at p. 78 as to the true application of the rule in Saunders v. Vautier in the case of charities. Reference also to other authorities). The gift of the income in perpetuity to the charity in the present case was entirely valid and proper.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], which, on an equal division of the court, dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Mellish J.[2] holding against the plaintiff\u2019s claim (in proceedings begun by originating summons) for payment and transfer to it of the principal of a fund, and one half the principal of another fund, created and dealt with in the will of Thomas E. Kelley, deceased.\nThe plaintiff, appellant, The Halifax School for the Blind, is a charitable institution, incorporated by statute. The defendants, respondents, are the present trustees of the will of the said deceased, who died in 1904.\nBy his will the deceased appointed certain persons to be his executors and trustees of his will and declared that if and whenever any trustee for the time being should die or resign, etc., the surviving or continuing trustee or trustees should, with the approval of a Judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in writing appoint a new trustee or new trustees in the place of the trustee or trustees so dying, etc.\nThen, after providing for certain specific gifts, he gave, devised and bequeathed his residuary estate to his trustees in trust for conversion into money, and directed that his trustees should stand possessed of the moneys \u201cin trust for the uses and purposes hereinafter declared and expressed.\u201d\nThen followed a number of clauses, including the following:\n\u201cThird. In trust as to the sum of [$20,000] of the trust moneys to invest the same and pay the net annual interest and income thereof\u201d to the testator\u2019s sister for and during her life if she so long remained unmarried.\n\u201cFourth. In trust as to the sum of [$20,000] of the trust moneys to invest the same and to pay and apply the net annual interest and income thereof for the benefit of the Congregational Church at Cheboque\u201d in manner set out. This clause concluded as follows:\nShould said Church * * * cease to exist or change its adherence then and thereafter my Trustees shall annually pay over the whole of the net annual interest and income of said sum of [$20,000] to [appellant] to be used for the general purposes of that institution.\nThe next clause read in part:\nFifth. Upon Trust that my Trustees from and after the death or marriage of my sister * * * do keep invested the sum of [$20,000] mentioned in the section or paragraph hereof numbered \u201cThird\u201d and do pay and apply the net annual interest and income thereof in the manner following, that is to say, one half thereof to [appellant] to be used for the general purposes of that institution, and the other half thereof in and towards the maintenance and support of a Free Public Library or Free Public Library and Museum at Yarmouth * * *\nAmong further provisions was one for investment of the residue of the trust moneys and annual division of the income and interest equally among his trustees as a recompense for their extra care and careful management, and to be in addition to the remuneration or commission thereinafter named, provided that any loss or depreciation happening to any of the trust moneys was to be made good out of said residue. Another provision was that the trustees should receive and retain for themselves from the interest and income of the trust moneys as remuneration in addition to the aforesaid recompense and to all costs, etc., a commission (to be divided according to labour bestowed or responsibility incurred) of 6% per annum on the gross annual interest and income of the trust moneys, but that they were to receive no commission on any portion of the principal. The provisions for remuneration were to be in full satisfaction of all claim for remuneration or compensation by the trustees whether as executors or trustees.\nThe said Congregational Church at Cheboque entered and became a part of the United Church of Canada in 1925. Subsequently, in proceedings in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, an order was made that, upon that church having become part of the United Church of Canada, the whole of the net annual interest and income of the sum of $20,000 bequeathed under clause 4 of the will, upon the conditions therein set out for the benefit of said church, became and was thereafter payable to the present appellant to be used for the general purposes of that institution.\nThe said sister of the deceased, mentioned in the aforesaid clause \u201cThird\u201d in the will, died in 1930.\nThe appellant claimed that the defendants should pay and transfer to it the fund created and dealt with by said clause \u201cFourth\u201d in the will, and one-half of the fund created and dealt with by said clauses \u201cThird\u201d and \u201cFifth\u201d in the will; together with the income accrued thereon in each case.\nMellish J. held that the present appellant was not entitled to the payment and transfer to it of the principal of said funds, and an appeal from his judgment was dismissed as aforesaid. The present appeal to this Court was (by the judgment now reported) dismissed.\nT. W. Murphy K.C. for the appellant.\nT. R. Robertson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014In the happening of events which have occurred since the date of the death of the testator in 1904, two funds have become separated from the general estate and the net annual income from one of these funds and the net annual income from one half of the other of these funds is now payable by the provisions of the will of the testator\nto The Halifax School for the Blind, a corporation incorporated by Act of the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia, to be used for the general purposes of that institution.\nThe Halifax School for the Blind applied to the court for an order directing the trustees of the will to hand over to it the corpus upon which the income is payable, upon the ground that, being the sole beneficiary of the income, it has in law the right to terminate the trust without reference either to the intention of the testator or to the wishes of the trustees of the will in this regard.\nThe testator, in making a gift for the benefit of the Congregational Church at Cheboque, contemplated the possibility that that church might \u201ccease to exist or change its adherence\u201d and specifically provided that \u201cthen and thereafter\u201d the whole of the net annual income of the fund set aside for the benefit of that church should be paid to The Halifax School for the Blind. The non-continuance at some future time of The Halifax School for the Blind was not apparently in contemplation of the testator. The result is that the gift of the income from that fund, as well as the gift of the income from one half of a fund that fell in on the death of a sister of the testator, is unlimited as to time and unqualified as to conditions. There is no gift over and there is no discretion left in the trustees of the will as to the giving or withholding, in whole or in part, in any year of the total net annual income. The beneficiary being a charitable institution, the rule against perpetuities does not apply. The intention of the testator, however, is plainly that the corpus should not be handed over to the beneficiary and the will expressly provides for a perpetual succession of trustees in whom the execution of the trust is to be vested.\nOn the construction of the will, the gift to The Halifax School for the Blind is a particular and special charitable bequest to which effect must be given so long as the institution lasts. But should it come to an end nothing beyond that is declared. In that event, by operation of law, the particular trust must fall into and be dealt with as part of the residuary personal estate unless the court can collect from this and the other specific trusts an over-riding general charitable intention, in which case the trust property would be applied cy-pr\u00e8s to another charitable purpose ejusdem generis with that which has failed or approaching it in character. The specific gifts for the benefit of a particular church at a particular place and for the establishment of a free library in a particular place can scarcely be treated as indicating, with respect to the particular fund with which we are concerned, a general charitable intention. In view of the considerations about to be mentioned, it does not appear to be necessary to determine that question.\nThere is unquestionably a rule of law that where a legacy is directed to accumulate for a certain period, or where the payment is postponed, the legatee, if he has an absolute indefeasible interest in the legacy, is not bound to wait until the expiration of that period, but may require payment the moment he is competent to give a valid discharge. That rule is sometimes called the rule in Saunders v. Vautier[3], where Lord Langdale said that that principle had been repeatedly acted upon. In that case, the testator by his will had bequeathed to his executors and trustees certain East India stock standing in his name at the time of his death, upon trust to accumulate the interest and dividends which should accrue due thereon, until his grand-nephew Daniel Wright Vautier should attain the age of twenty-five years, and then to pay or transfer to him the principal of such stock together with such accumulated interest and dividends. Upon the grand-nephew attaining twenty-one years of age, he presented a petition to have a transfer of the fund made to him. The cause stood over, with liberty to apply to the Lord Chancellor, when the Lord Chancellor held the legacy vested, and ordered the transfer[4].\nThe application of The Halifax School for the Blind is really founded upon the decision in Wharton v. Masterman[5], where the House of Lords applied the principle of Saunders v. Vautier3 to charities. The testator had directed the surplus income of his residuary estate, after satisfying annuities which he had provided for, to be accumulated, and after the death of the surviving annuitant he bequeathed the capital and the accumulations upon trust for certain named public charities. Some of the annuitants were still living. The testator undoubtedly intended to postpone the enjoyment of his bounty by these charities until the death of the last annuitant. The courts below had, notwithstanding this intention, determined that the charities were entitled to the immediate enjoyment of all that was not made by the will subject to the payment of the annuities. Lord Herschell said that was to his mind the only point of any difficulty in the appeal. After setting out the language of Wood, V.C., in Gosling v. Gosling[6] (in expounding the doctrine acted upon in Saunders v. Vautier[7]), Lord Herschell concluded, at p. 193:\nWickens, V.C., when this case came before him in 1871, intimated an opinion that the rule in Saunders v. Vautier4 was inapplicable where the beneficiaries were charitable corporations or the trustees of charities. I have carefully considered the reasons which he adduced for this opinion with the respect due to any opinion of that learned Judge, and certainly with no indisposition to give effect to the intention of the testator if I could see my way to do so. But I am unable to find any sound basis upon which a distinction can be rested in this respect between bequests to charities and those made in favour of individual beneficiaries.\nLord Macnaghten was of the same opinion. He said in part at p. 194:\n* * * it is clear on the face of the will that the testator did not mean the residuary legatees to receive any part of what the will gives them until the death of the last annuitant.\nNow if the residuary legatees were individuals, there could not be the slightest doubt that they would be entitled to call upon the trustees to hand over to them at the end of each year the surplus income of the testator\u2019s residuary estate. Does the fact that the residuary legatees are charities make any difference? Notwithstanding the doubt expressed by Wickens V.C., when the case was before him in 1871, I do not think that it does. The charities alone are interested in the surplus income accruing from year to year. Their interest is vested and indefeasible. And they may legally apply what they take under the bequest either as capital or as income. That being so, I agree with the reasoning of Stirling J. and the Court of Appeal. In regard to the questions which have arisen on this will, I am unable to see any substantial distinction between the case of an incorporated charity and a charity not incorporated, or between the case of a charity and an individual.\nLord Davey was also of the same opinion. After setting forth the doubt of Wickens, V.C., as to the application of the principle of Saunders v. Vautier[8] in the case of charities, Lord Davey proceeded to say at p. 199:\nYour Lordships will, I am sure, regard any dictum, or even doubt, expressed by Wickens V.C. on a subject of this kind with the greatest respect and attention. But I must confess that I do not, on the fullest consideration, find sufficient grounds for the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s doubt.\nLord Davey specifically pointed out that there was no condition precedent to happen or to be performed in order to perfect the title of the legatees and that there was no other person who had any interest in the execution of the trust for accumulation or who could complain of its non-execution. He speaks of the gift as \u201can absolute vested interest.\u201d\nIt was plain in that case that the gift to the charities was an absolute vested gift made payable at a definite future event, the death of the last surviving annuitant, with a direction to accumulate the income in the meantime and pay it with the principal. Applying the principle of Saunders v. Vautier8, the House of Lords declined to enforce the trust for accumulation in which no person had any interest but the charities.\nBut Wharton v. Masterman[9] does not cover this case unless by some rule of law which yields to no contrary intention the unqualified gift here of the income of the fund must be treated as a present absolute gift of the corpus. Lord Davey may have had such a problem in mind when in his judgment he made this guarded reservation, at p. 200:\nWe have not to deal with a fund to be created by accumulations and settled as a capital endowment at a future time, as to which different considerations would arise.\nThe question we have to deal with here seems to me to have been left open. Now, there can be no doubt that a charitable trust may be made to last for any period, whether perpetual, indefinite or limited, and that the rule against perpetuities is not applicable to a charitable trust. But that relates to the question of remoteness and the validity of the trusts. In Ashburner\u2019s Principles of Equity, 2nd ed., (1933) it is said at p. 119:\nGifts to charitable uses are, in one sense, not subject to the rule against perpetuities. This expression must not be misunderstood; a gift to a charity upon a remote event is (except in one case hereafter to be mentioned) incapable of taking effect just as if it had been to an individual, and so is a gift over from a charity to an individual on a remote event. But a gift to a charity is good, although the result of the gift is to fetter the free circulation of property, while a gift for a non-charitable purpose is void if the gift cannot be carried out without keeping the corpus intact for an indefinite period. Moreover, it has been held in several cases, that where property is given to one charity, it may be validly given over to another charity upon a remote event, e.g., if the first charitable donee neglects to maintain the donor\u2019s tomb.\nWhere, as here, a testator has clearly settled a fund for the benefit of a particular charitable institution, from which fund the annual income is to be paid over by the trustees of the will, whose perpetual succession is expressly provided for, that fund is a capital endowment, or in the nature of a capital endowment, created and settled for the benefit of the particular charity so long as it lasts, but no longer. It cannot, I think, be treated as an absolute and presently vested gift of the corpus of the fund which the beneficiary at any time may lawfully demand to be paid over to it and the trust in respect thereof arrested and extinguished without reference to the contrary intention of the settlor.\nSince this appeal was argued, the English Court of Appeal has had to consider a somewhat similar case in which residuary legatees which were charities sought on an application to the court to put an end to certain trusts and to obtain the transfer of the property. Judgment in that case was delivered on February 5th last\u2014In re Blake\u2019s Estate\u2014Berry v. Geen and others[10]. The testator there, by his will, after disposing of certain specific property, devised the residue of his property, real and personal, to trustees on trust to pay out of income a large number of annuities, with surplus income to be accumulated during the lives of all the annuitants, and after the death of the last of the annuitants the testator gave the whole of his property, subject to the annuities, to the Congregational Union of England and Wales to be invested as capital and, as to one half of the net income thereof, on trust to pay the same to the Devon Congregational Union. Both charities were unincorporated bodies. The Secretary of the first of these charities, suing on behalf of the charity, had taken out an originating summons asking that the trust for accumulations under the will should be determined and that either the surplus income arising in each year from the estate, after the payment of the annuities directed by the will, should be paid to that body, or that proper provision should be made for payment of the legacies and annuities and that, subject thereto, the residuary estate should be transferred to that body. The matter came before Mr. Justice Bennett and it was by him declared10 that the gift in the will to the Congregational Union of England and Wales of the whole of the testator\u2019s property included the accumulations of income and the income resulting therefrom, but (2) that the Congregational Union was not entitled to determine any future accumulations, and that in the event of any of the annuities continuing beyond January 1, 1946 (i.e., 21 years from the testator\u2019s death, when the accumulations will cease by virtue of section 164 of the Law of Property Act, 1925) the surplus income of the residuary estate and of the accumulations from that date until the cesser of the last annuity would be undisposed of and would devolve as on an intestacy.\nThe plaintiff appealed from the order so far as it declared that the charity was not entitled to have the accumulations determined. The unanimous considered judgment of the Court of Appeal (Slesser and Scott, L.JJ., and Far-well J.) was read by Mr. Justice Farwell. It was held that in certain circumstances the heir-at-law and next-of-kin of the testator may become entitled to the enjoyment of the surplus income for a limited period. If any of the annuitants survive the period of 21 years from the testator\u2019s death, the accumulations will cease at that date by virtue of section 164 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, and the surplus income from that date down to the death of the last surviving annuitant will be undisposed of and pass as on an intestacy. In those circumstances the residuary legatees were held not entitled to the relief which they sought. The court, it was said, will never make such an order unless it is satisfied that the persons having any interest in the property consent, or, if they do not consent, that their interests are amply and fully protected. The persons seeking immediate enjoyment in such a case have no legal right to it and it is a matter for the court in each case to consider whether the order can properly be made. Apart from any question of the heir-at-law and next-of-kin, the annuitants who have a charge on the residue of the testator\u2019s estate were objecting, and, there being no legal right in the residuary legatees to possession, the court held it was not a case where it ought to make the order asked for. Farwell J. concluded[11]:\nThe effect of any such order would be to prejudice and possibly defeat altogether the possible interests of the persons taking under an intestacy. Those persons do not take directly under the will, but as a result of its provisions and the operation of law they may become entitled to the enjoyment of a part of the income of the estate, and there is no means of preventing the possibility of those interests being prejudiced except by refusing to make the order.\nThe court referred to In re Deliotte[12] as a case where all the persons presently interested desired to obtain immediate enjoyment of the property, but, although the possibility of any other person ever coming into existence who would be entitled to participate was extremely remote, the order had been refused. Mr. Justice Farwell proceeded to say:\nThe present case is in some respects a stronger one than that, because the possibility of the heir-at-law and next-of-kin becoming entitled to receive a part of the income of the estate is by no means very remote. Moreover, there is a further difficulty in the way of the appellant here which was not present in that case. Here the residue is given to the appellant on charitable trusts and there is no power to vary those trusts by treating as income that which by the trust is to be capital, or vice versa. The order sought would have that effect, and that alone is sufficient to disentitle the appellant to the order unless and until the necessary variation of the trust has been duly sanctioned.\nIn the case before us it is income that is given to the charity and not capital, and for us to make the order sought on this appeal would be to vary the trust.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. Each party will pay its own costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action which was brought in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia by originating summons to determine the right of the appellant, as beneficiary of the whole of the net annual interest and income of one fund of $20,000, and one half of the net annual interest and income of a second fund of $20,000, to receive from the trustees under a will the whole capital of the one fund and half that of the other.\nMr. Justice Mellish, before whom the case was heard, refused to make the order asked for, holding in effect that on the true construction of the will the testator did not intend to vest the funds themselves in the appellant. An appeal from the learned trial Judge\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc was dismissed on an equal division of the four Judges who heard it, Hall and Carroll, JJ., affirming the trial judgment, and Graham and Doull, JJ., dissenting.\nApart from the testator\u2019s directions to his trustees, in the events which happened, to annually pay to the appellant the whole of the net annual interest and income of the first fund of $20,000 and one half of the net annual interest and income of the second fund of $20,000, there was no indication in the will of any desire or intention that the appellant should at any time receive the capital moneys from which the income was derivable, and I think it may fairly be said that the appellant, in seeking to have these capital moneys paid and transferred to it, relied entirely upon these directions and the general principle that where there is an unlimited and unrestricted gift of rents and income of real or personal property, the gift carries the corpus as well as the rents and income of the property. There is no doubt that such a rule has long been recognized. The respondents do not question it, but contend that it is a rule of construction only and that it is predicated upon the assumption, in the case of a devise or bequest, that there is no indication in the will of a contrary intention on the part of the testator.\nWhatever else the rule may involve, it is plain, I think, from the leading cases in which it has been applied and considered, that it is one which has no application to a bequest of income which the will itself clearly shews, either expressly or impliedly, the testator intends should not absolutely vest the income-producing corpus or capital in the beneficiary to whom the income is directed to be paid. As I apprehend the rule as expounded in the various cases to which we have been referred, it is not sufficient to carry the corpus or capital that the annual payments of the income derivable therefrom, directed to be made to the beneficiary, are intended by the testator to continue in perpetuity, which they may be in the case of charitable gifts such as those now in question, if it clearly appears on a perusal of the entire will that, notwithstanding this fact, the testator intended that the beneficiary should not itself take possession of the corpus or capital. It will be noticed that the rule is seldom stated, either in text books or judicial dicta, without the addition of the proviso mentioned. See Coward v. Larkman[13], and the same case in the Court of Appeal[14], and the House of Lords[15]. Kay, J., in his trial judgment said:\nThe question is, what interest the widow takes in the testator\u2019s real and personal property. It is argued that she takes only a life interest, and that subject to this there is an intestacy. On the other hand, it is said that, in a will dealing as this does with all the testator\u2019s real and personal property, the court leans against an intestacy, and that a gift of the income of real or personal estate without any expressed limit is a gift of the absolute interest. This is no doubt so; but the rule as stated by the late Parker, V.C. in Blann v. Bell[16] is one which will yield to expressions in the will indicating a contrary intention. Such intention, however, should be very clearly shown to induce the court to decide that there is an intestacy.\nCotton, L.J., in the Court of Appeal, stated the rule as follows:\nWhere there is an unlimited and unrestricted gift of rents and income of realty or personalty, that carries the absolute interest [in the property] unless there is sufficient expression in the will to cut down and limit the effect of those words.\nBowen, L.J., said:\nThe first thing, as Cotton, L.J., says, is to clear one\u2019s mind about this rule of construction. There is, to my mind, a prima facie rule of construction that, when you have an unlimited gift of rents and income of real and personal property, in the absence of a contrary intention appearing, that is a gift of the absolute and entire interest in the real and personal property. It is a rule of construction\u2014that is, only a prima facie rule\u2014which disappears at once if a contrary intention appears.\nFry, L.J., said:\nHaving come to that conclusion with regard to his intention, the only point to be observed is this: Is the rule which has been so much discussed in this case one of construction, or is it, as Mr. Vaughan Hawkins insinuated rather than ventured to argue, a rule of law which operates in defiance of intention? In my opinion, it is a rule of construction; it is a rule, therefore, which may be overcome by evidence of an intention to the contrary. It is not like certain rules which operate, however clear the intention of the testator may be to the contrary. In my opinion, rules of construction and rules of law differ very broadly in this point of view; that one is a rule which points out what a court shall do in the absence of express or implied intention to the contrary; the other is one which takes effect when certain conditions are found, although the testator may have indicated an intention to the contrary. It is therefore in defiance of the intention of the testator. Mr. Vaughan Hawkins has argued that there is a rule that the words which repel the application of the presumption arising from an antecedent gift of the income must express the limitation to which the absolute estate is to be cut down and reduced. No authority can be cited for such a proposition, and I can find no reason for holding it. On the contrary, it appears to me to be one of those suggestions which from time to time are thrown out to the court, which only result in drawing the mind of the court away from the primary enquiry, what was the intention of the testator? If that intention is to be found, it is immaterial in what part of a will it is to be found, and I for one will be no party to introducing a fresh rule of construction which would fetter the simple enquiry in the case, what was the intention of the testator?\nIn Coward v. Larkman (supra) the question for decision was as to whether it was intended by the will that the testator\u2019s widow, his sole executrix, to whom the rents and income of all his freehold, copyhold and leasehold properties and all other the income of his estate and effects, real or personal, had been devised and bequeathed, was thereby entitled to an absolute interest in the whole estate or to a life interest only. Kay, J., while expounding the rule as to gifts of income as in the passage first above quoted, held that the widow took an absolute interest in all the property on the ground that the rule in question applied to all the property specified, as well as to the residuary estate, because there was no indication in the will sufficient to shew that the widow took only a life interest therein. He accepted the argument that the presumption that an unlimited and unrestricted gift of income carries with it an absolute interest in the corpus or capital can be met only by an indication in the will sufficiently clear to enable the court to determine what interest the testator intended that the donee should take, whether for years or during widowhood or for life, and held that it was not enough that the court should consider merely that the testator did not intend an absolute interest.\nAs will be seen from the passages already quoted from the judgments of Cotton, Bowen and Fry, L.J.J., the Court of Appeal distinctly disapproved that view of the rule. There being nothing in the will to indicate a contrary intention with respect to two of the properties and the household furniture, they held that the widow was absolutely entitled to these; but that there was sufficient to indicate a contrary intention with respect to the gift of the income of another specified property (Elmsleigh) and with respect to the residuary and personal property, and varied the trial judgment accordingly.\nIn the House of Lords, Halsbury, L.C., and Lords Watson and Fitzgerald affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Halsbury, L.C., dissenting only as to the property at Elmsleigh. There is, I think, no suggestion in any of the reasons given for the judgment of the House of Lords that the exposition of the rule in the Court of Appeal, or by Kay, J., in the trial judgment, was erroneous in any particular except as to that passage in the trial judgment, to which I have already alluded and which was overruled in the Court of Appeal. Indeed, Lord Fitzgerald explicitly states that,\nthere seems to be no disagreement about the rule referred to by Kay, J. or as stated in terms by Cotton, L.J.\nas reproduced above. He refers to Sir Edward Sugden\u2019s explanation of the rule for treating a gift of the produce of a particular fund, whether it be interest or dividends, as a gift of the principal in perpetuity, because the interest or dividends represent the capital from which the produce is to flow, and adds himself:\nIt is always, however, subject to this \u201cunless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.\u201d\nHe then quotes the concluding portion of that passage from the trial judgment which I have already set out and which he describes as an accurate statement of the law. In the course of his reasons Lord Halsbury said:\nNow, the testator in this case has undoubtedly given all the rents and income of his property in Herts, and in Gordon-Road, Peckham. There is no qualification or limit in point of time, and it is manifest, therefore, that the appellant is absolutely entitled to the properties in question.\nThe appellant relies upon this pronouncement as laying down the doctrine that, if the rents and income are given without any such qualification or limit as is spoken of, i.e., a qualification or limit in point of time, the gift of the rents and income without such a qualification entitles the donee of the income to the corpus of the property absolutely. The particular question which their Lordships were considering was as to whether there was anything in the will to indicate that the gift of the rents and income of the two properties mentioned was intended to be limited to the lifetime of the widow or to be in perpetuity, and naturally Lord Halsbury spoke of the qualification or limit contended for as a qualification or limit in point of time. I do not think he had any thought of laying down the principle that a gift of income without a qualification or limit in point of time entitles the donee to the corpus or capital, as well as to the income.\nThe appellant also stresses the following statement from Lord Watson\u2019s speech:\nIt is necessary to read them [the bequests] in connection with the whole context of the will, with the view of ascertaining whether it was the testator\u2019s intention to give his widow an interest in perpetuity or for life only. If the gifts were meant to be in perpetuity, the rule must be followed; if for life only, there is no room for its application.\nAs in the case of the Lord Chancellor\u2019s dictum just referred to, this pronouncement of Lord Watson must also, I think, be looked at in the light of the particular question which their Lordships were considering, viz, whether upon an examination of the entire provisions of the will the testator\u2019s intention was to give his widow an interest in perpetuity or for life only. If the gifts were not meant to be for life only, the effect in that particular case would necessarily be that they would be in perpetuity, and consequently the application of the rule in that event, as Lord Watson so plainly indicates, could not be doubted. I cannot think that he at all thought of enunciating a principle that the application of the rule in question always depends upon whether the intention of a testator is to make a gift of rents and profits of real or personal property for life only or in perpetuity, and that if the gift of the income be found to be intended to continue in perpetuity the rule must always apply, notwithstanding any intention on the part of the testator to the contrary.\nIf this argument in behalf of the appellant is accepted, it would mean the establishment of an entirely new principle, viz, that the gift of the income of a definite portion of any fund to a charitable institution for charitable purposes in perpetuity constitutes, as a matter of law, a gift of the capital from which the income accrues; and that a testator, who makes such a gift, cannot lawfully provide, even by the clearest and most express terms, that the trustees, to whom the capital moneys are directly bequeathed, shall retain the fund in their own hands, invest and reinvest its moneys and proceeds in a specified class of securities and pay only the income to the beneficiary. In other words, we should have a new rule which, in the case of a bequest of income in perpetuity to a charitable organization for charitable purposes, excludes all enquiry on the part of the courts into the basic question of what was the intention of the testator with regard to the corpus as indicated by the provisions of his will.\nIf such had been the view of either the Lord Chancellor or Lord Watson, so contrary to that expressed in all three judgments in the Court of Appeal, one would hardly expect that both these eminent law lords would have failed to express any disapproval whatever of the grounds upon which the Appeal Court judgment proceeded, viz, that the rule there in question was a rule of construction and not such a rule of law as always applies, no matter what the intention of the testator might be with respect to it.\nThe appellant also relies upon the case of In re Morgan[17], in which it is claimed that it was held that a gift of the income of the residue of an estate to certain charities in equal shares amounted to a gift of the corpus of the residue to the charities in the same proportions. Stress is laid particularly in this regard upon two isolated statements made in the course of the reasons of Lindley, L.J., and of Lopes, L.J. The first of these statements (that of Lindley, L.J.) is as follows: I think the indications are that he [the testator] did not intend anybody to have the corpus, not even the charitable institutions. I think his own notion was that they should have the income.\nIn that case, the testator gave all his real and personal property upon trust to pay out of the interest and rents arising from the same certain sums of money per year to different named persons or (in the case of three of them) to their descendants. With regard to the residue of the interest and rents after the stated payments had been made, he gave it in tenths and twentieths to certain charitable purposes in England and the United States. In a suit for the administration of the testator\u2019s estate, Stirling, J., held that, according to the true construction of the will, the yearly sums given to the various named persons were not perpetual but were payable to them for their respective lives only, and that the gifts in favour of the charities included the corpus of the residuary estate. Two of the annuitants appealed against the first part of the decision and claimed that they were entitled to a capital sum which, if invested, would produce \u00a3250 a year, which was the amount required to be paid to each of them, so that when the case came before the Court of Appeal the only question with which it was really concerned was as to whether the yearly sums given to these annuitants were payable to them in perpetuity or for their respective lives only.\nLindley, L.J., in discussing this question, said:\nNow, I confess that, applying our minds to the will, which is the first thing to look at, and without troubling ourselves at all with cases, I cannot find apparent in it any intention to give these persons anything more than an annuity. I cannot see any sign of an intention to give them a portion of the corpus of the testator\u2019s property. On the contrary, I think the indications are that he did not intend anybody to have the corpus, not even the charitable institutions. I think his own notion was that they should have the income. He never thought anything about the corpus, and was not dwelling upon the disposal of the corpus at all. He was giving these persons what he says is an annuity.\nThe words \u201cor their descendants,\u201d relied upon as giving a perpetual interest, were held not to have the same effect as if they had been \u201cand their descendants.\u201d \u201cThen it is said,\u201d he continued,\nthat, inasmuch as the testator only disposed of property by reference to the interest and rents, that expression was used by him as equivalent to or as another mode of dealing with the securities. I do not so read it. It may be speculative; but I cannot help thinking that the scheme of his will is to leave all he has got to charity, subject to such provisions as he has made for his nephews and niece. He gave them \u00a3250 a year or their descendants, if they died. Except to that extent, the testator intends everything to go to the charities.\nLopes, L.J., said:\nIt is to my mind very difficult indeed to determine what the intention of the testator was; but I agree with what has already been said, that he intended in all probability not to dispose of the corpus, but to create a perpetual trust. I think that is what he contemplated. I am inclined to think it is very probable indeed that he would be more likely to desire to benefit his relations, such as the Morgans are, than the charities which are mentioned in the latter part of his will. It is also perfectly true that if his intention is such as I have stated, namely, to create a perpetual trust, we are defeating his intention with respect to the different charities, though I think, having regard to the strength of the language, we cannot put any other interpretation than that we have placed on the earlier part of the will.\nLooking at these extracts from their judgments, I cannot see how it can be even so much as suggested that either Lindley, L.J., or Lopes, L.J., in determining the question as to whether the trust to pay the annual sums to the beneficiaries named amounted to gifts of any portions of the principal estate, disregarded the intention of the testator, as that intention was to be inferred from the provisions of the entire will, in respect of the disposition of the corpus or capital of the estate or any part thereof. The effect of the passages quoted, in my opinion, is quite the contrary, and certainly there is nothing in any part of either judgment, which in any manner extends or modifies the rule regarding testamentary gifts of income, as expounded in Coward v. Larkman (supra).\nThe basis of the judgment in the Morgan case[18] was that the trust was to pay the stated yearly sums \u201cout of the interest and rents\u201d of all the testator\u2019s property, and that this and other provisions of the will clearly indicated that they were not to be paid out of the corpus of the estate, which had been devised and bequeathed to the trustees, whereas with regard to the residuary estate, loosely described as consisting of \u201cthe residue of the interest and rents after the above payments have been made,\u201d that was expressly given to the charities in the proportion of one-tenth to each.\nThe question whether the rule regarding gifts of income carrying with it the estate or capital from which the income is derived is or is not applicable to any particular devise or bequest, whether to a charitable institution or to an individual, is, in my opinion, always subject to the intention of the testator as disclosed in the will.\nIt is true that in Saunders v. Vautier[19]; Gosling v. Gosling[20]; Wharton v. Masterman[21], and other cases, to which we were referred by the appellant\u2019s counsel, where there were absolute vested gifts of real estate and capital funds, entitling the donees to complete ownership and possession at a future event, the courts disregarded express directions of the testators to accumulate the rents and income in the meantime. This doctrine, which is generally spoken of as the rule laid down in Saunders v. Vautier19, has been so often recognized that, as Herschell, L.C., said in Wharton v. Masterman21, it would not be proper now to question it.\nVarious reasons have been ascribed for its establishment. Lindley, L.J., in Harbin v. Masterman[22], which went to the House of Lords on appeal under the name of Wharton v. Masterman21, above cited, described it as \u201ca remarkable exception\u201d to \u201cthe general principle that a donee or legatee can only take what is given him on the terms on which it is given.\u201d He explained it as follows:\nConditions which are repugnant to the estate to which they are annexed are absolutely void, and may consequently be disregarded. This doctrine, I apprehend, underlies the rule laid down in Saunders v. Vautier[23] and enunciated with great clearness by Vice-Chancellor Wood in Gosling v. Gosling[24].\nHerschell, L.C., said:\nThe point seems, in the first instance, to have been rather assumed than decided. It was apparently regarded as a necessary consequence of the conclusion that a gift had vested, that the enjoyment of it must be immediate on the beneficiary becoming sui juris, and could not be postponed until a later date unless the testator had made some other destination of the income during the intervening period.\nLord Davey said:\nThe reason for the rule has been variously stated. It may be observed, however, that the Court of Chancery always leant against the postponement of vesting or possession, or the imposition of restrictions on the enjoyment of an absolute vested interest.\nWhatever the origin or reason of this particular rule may be, it is clear, I think, that its application in Harbin v. Masterman[25] and Wharton v. Masterman[26] was based on the conclusion that the gifts of the residue of the personal property to the five charities named definitely included the surplus income remaining each year after the payment of certain specified annuities, and that neither the annuitants nor the next-of-kin had any interest whatever therein. So far as the conclusion itself, upon which the application of the rule proceeded, is concerned, viz, that the gift of the surplus income as it accrued was intended to vest and had actually vested in the charities, that conclusion was apparently reached upon a consideration of the provisions of the entire will, including the special direction for its accumulation. There is nothing, therefore, in the fact that the principle of Saunders v. Vautier[27] was applied in those cases, which necessarily conflicts with the view already expressed that the question of the applicability or non-applicability of the general rule regarding a gift of income carrying with it a gift of the capital from which the income is derived, depends always on the intention of the testator, as expounded in Coward v. Larkman[28] and other cases.\nWharton v. Masterman26 does decide that, where it is concluded that an absolute gift of the residue of personal property includes the surplus income of a definite portion thereof, it makes no difference, so far as the futility of a repugnant direction for the accumulation of that income is concerned, whether the donee of the surplus income is a charitable corporation or an individual; but, as I read the case, it by no means decides that a gift of surplus income to a charitable corporation itself constitutes, as a matter of law, a gift of the property or capital from which it is derived, notwithstanding that the will clearly shews the testator\u2019s intention to be otherwise. As a matter of fact, the charities did not claim that they were entitled to the capital out of which the surplus income arose, before the death of the last annuitants\u2014only that they were entitled to that income as it accrued each year and the accumulations thereon, for the reason that upon the true construction of the will the testator intended that it should vest absolutely in the charities as it was received, and that neither the annuitants nor the next-of-kin were given any charge on or interest in this income or its accumulations. Stirling, J., the trial Judge, thus construed the will as Wickens, J., had done in a previous administration suit, and this judgment was unanimously affirmed, both in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords.\nHere there is no question as to the appellant being entitled to receive each year the net annual income of the two funds mentioned. The question is as to whether it is entitled to have the trust extinguished and the capital funds paid into its own hands by the trustees under the will. This depends, as I take the established law to be, upon whether or not the testator has clearly indicated by the provisions of his will that he intended that the appellant should not have the right to extinguish the trust and take the capital funds out of the hands of his own trustees.\nAfter a careful consideration of the provisions of the entire will, I have concluded that they cannot be read consistently with any other hypothesis than that the testator intended that the appellant should not have that right, and that his real desire and intention was to create a perpetual trust in the hands of the three trustees he appointed to administer his estate, and their successors for whose appointment he provided. There are numerous provisions throughout the will indicating this intention. Among them I mention the following:\n1. The appointment of three trustees with his provision for the filling of any vacancy occurring so that the triple trusteeship may continue indefinitely.\nHis directions for the raising of the two $20,000 trust funds, and another for the benefit of the trustees themselves, of which they are \u201cto annually divide the income and interest equally \u201camong them as \u201ca recompense for their extra care and careful management\u201d of the estate, in addition to a remuneration or commission of 6% per annum, which they are to retain for themselves from the interest and income of all the trust moneys, including the two $20,000 funds.\n2. His direction that the trustees \u201cshall stand possessed\u201d of all \u201cthe trust moneys\u201d so raised, \u201cin trust for the uses and purposes hereinafter declared and expressed.\u201d 3. The language in which the particular gift of income to the appellant of the first $20,000 fund is couched, viz, that upon the cessation of the antecedent trust, the trustees then and thereafter \u201cshall annually pay over the whole of the net annual interest and income of said sum of twenty thousand dollars to said The Halifax School for the Blind to be used for the general purposes of that institution.\u201d\n4. His directions that the trustees \u201ckeep invested\u201d the whole of the second fund of $20,000, and to divide the net annual interest and income of the whole\u2014one half thereof to the appellant to be used for the general purposes of that institution, as in the case of the whole of the net annual interest and income of the first $20,000 fund\u2014and to pay and apply the other half \u201cin and towards the maintenance and support of a Free Public Library or Free Public Library and Museum\u201d to be otherwise established at Yarmouth to the satisfaction of the trustees.\n5. The provision that any loss or depreciation resulting from time to time to any of the trust moneys shall be made good out of the residue of the trust moneys, the income and interest of which are directed to be divided equally among the trustees.\n6. The empowering of the trustees to invest and re-invest the trust moneys in designated classes of securities and alter the investments without the consent and concurrence and without reference to the beneficiaries or any of them.\nIt seems to me, if there were nothing else in any of the other provisions to indicate that the trust funds themselves claimed by the appellant were not intended to vest in it, that, having regard to the annual charge of 6% imposed on the entire income of all the trust moneys, the language of the two gifts of income itself cannot properly be held to import an intention to vest the whole of the first $20,000 fund or the entire half of the second $20,000 absolutely in the appellant. The gifts are not of the whole income but of \u201cthe whole of the net annual income\u201d and are expressly directed to be paid annually. In the light of the 6% annual charge upon the whole income of all the trust moneys, in favour of the trustees, and the gift to the trustees as well of the annual interest and income of the residuary trust, how can it possibly be said that no one else than the appellant has any interest in either of the two funds claimed, and that the principle of Saunders v. Vautier[29], as confirmed by Wharton v. Masterman[30], is applicable to this case?\nI think the appeal should be dismissed. Each party will pay its own costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014If this were a case where the testator had made a gift of income indefinitely to an individual, the latter would be entitled absolutely to the corpus. Reliance was placed upon Wharton v. Masterman30, as indicating that the same rule applies where the legatee is a charity, but in that case there was an absolute vested gift made payable at a future event with a direction to accumulate the income in the meantime and pay it with the principal, and it was decided that the court would not enforce the trust for accumulation in which no person had any interest but the legatee. In other words, it was held that the legatee might put an end to an accumulation which is exclusively for its benefit. It will be noticed, however, that the direction was \u201cin trust to pay and divide,\u201d and part of the discussion arose because the testator had directed that this paying and dividing be according to certain amounts set after the respective names of the charities, and it was argued that the charities were to receive only such amounts. It was held that it was impossible to suppose that the testator intended to limit the rights of the charities to the specific sums mentioned, and that their claim to be residuary legatees was valid.\nA further application was made in the same administration action, the report of which appears under the name of Harbin v. Masterman[31]. This application was for payment out to the charities, in equal shares, of the fund, other than certain sums set apart to answer the annuities. The motion was granted by Stirling J., and his decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nIn view of the provision in the will in question \u201cto pay and divide,\u201d these decisions do not touch the point.\nIn my opinion a correct statement of the law is set forth in Tudor on Charities, 5th ed., p. 76:\u2014\nA charitable trust may be made to endure for any period which the author of the trust may desire. It may therefore be created for the application of the income in perpetuity to the charitable purpose, or it may be so framed as to require the immediate distribution of the capital, or the exhaustion of capital and income, during a limited or indefinite period.\nAnd at page 78, the author points out the true application of the rule in Saunders v. Vautier (1) where charities are concerned, as follows:\nThere is no exception from the statutory provisions restricting accumulations in the case of charities. And if a charitable fund is directed to be accumulated beyond the limit allowed, a scheme may be settled by the Court for the proper application of the fund.\nMoreover, the rule in Saunders v. Vautier (1) applies in the case of charities, so that if an accumulation is directed, and the capital and accumulations are given absolutely to a particular charitable institution, whether corporate or unincorporate, the institution has the same right as an individual, would have under similar circumstances to stop the accumulations and call for the immediate payment of the gift.\nJarman on Wills, 7th ed., p. 250, thus states the rule:\nCharitable gifts are an exception to the rule which forbids the creation of perpetuities in the primary sense of the word.\nand Theobald on Wills, 8th ed., p. 406:\nA charitable gift does not necessarily involve a perpetuity. It may be a gift of a capital sum divisible at once. But more commonly it involves the investment of a fund and the application of the income in perpetuity to a charitable purpose. Such gifts, being for the public good, are not subject to the rule against perpetuity.\nOf the various cases in which the rule is referred to, it is perhaps sufficient to refer to Goodman v. Saltash (2), where Lord Chancellor Selbourne, at p. 642, states that \u201cno charitable trust can be void on the ground of perpetuity.\u201d\nThe gift of the income in perpetuity to the charity in the present case is, therefore, entirely valid and proper, and the appeal should be dismissed, but without costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

V, c. 23, s. 14, ss. 1; 25-26 Geo. V, c. 32, s. 35, ss. 2.\nThe appellant company is manufacturing a collar of the same material as used in a soft shirt, made semi-stiff and yet comfortable for personal wear and sufficiently porous to absorb perspiration and to be easily washed and ironed. The appellant\u2019s process for making that collar is as follows: Two plies of the particular shirt material, forming outside and inside layers of the collar, are taken and there is placed between them a ply of other woven material in which all the weft threads and two out of three of the warp threads are cotton, the remaining one in three of the warp threads being of cellulose acetate. These cellulose threads are partly dissolved by a volatile (acetone-alcohol) solvent applied through one of the outer fabrics after the collar is partly finished. The result of the rapid driving off of the volatile solvent is that the dissolved cellulose acetate does not spread; the knuckles only of the cellulose acetate yarn melt and form an adhesive which united all three plies at a series of spaced spots, staggered on opposite sides of the lining material, the result being a semi-stiff composite fabric. This process was put into use in Canada by the appellant about June, 1935. The respondent then alleged that the process infringed the Dreyfus Canadian patent no. 265,960, granted November 16, 1926, on an application filed December 18, 1925, and owned by the respondent, and the present action was brought before the Exchequer Court of Canada, the patent not appearing to have been put into commercial use prior to the adoption by the appellant of its process. The patent is recited to be an invention of \u201ccertain new and useful improvements relating to fabrics and sheet materials and the manufacture thereof.\u201d The invention is stated to concern the manufacture of new fabrics or sheet materials having waterproof to gas-proof properties or capable of other applications. According to the invention, a fabric or sheet material is made by uniting under appropriate conditions of temperature and pressure, woven, knitted or other fabrics, composed of or containing filaments or fibres of thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives with woven, knitted or other fabric composed of or containing filaments or fibres of non-thermoplastic or relatively non-thermoplastic material. In this way the fabrics are united and a composite sheet material is obtained in which the pores or interstices are reduced to extremely minute dimensions, or closed completely, by the melting or softening effect produced by the heat and pressure upon the filaments and fibres of the thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives and by the uniting of the fabrics under the heat and pressure. Further specifications are fully described in the judgment reported. The invention of Dreyfus was, in effect, to make an ordinary fabric or sheet material waterproof or gas-proof without detracting from the appearance of the original material. Although there were some twenty-five claims set up the appellant\u2019s arguments were confined to claims 1 and 4 which were as follows: \u201c1. A process for the manufacture of composite sheet material which comprises subjecting a plurality of associated fabrics, at least one of which contains a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose, to heat and pressure, thereby softening said derivative and uniting said fabrics. * * *. 4. A process for the manufacture of composite sheet material which comprises treating a fabric containing a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose with a softening agent, associating it with another fabric, and uniting the fabrics by subjecting them to heat and pressure.\u201d The inventor, Dreyfus, in defining his claims in his British application, expressly mentioned \u201cwoven, knitted or other fabric composed of or containing filaments or fibres of a thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives,\u201d and in defining his claims in the United States application also expressly mentioned \u201ca fabric containing yarns comprising a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose\u201d; but he entirely omitted such words in his subsequent application in Canada. Amongst many British and United States patents referred to by the parties, the Van Heusen, which was granted in the United States January 1, 1924, was the most relevant one to this case. It disclosed the manufacture of a three-ply collar consisting of a lining and two outer plies which caused to combine into a single composite sheet by the application to the lining of a cellulose derivative in solution to act as a \u201ccementing agent,\u201d whereupon the outer plies and the lining were treated * * * by heat and pressure to cause the cementing material to be converted into its final form and thereby secure the separate layers of fabric together.\u201d One of the grounds upon which the validity of the Dreyfus patent was challenged by the appellant company was that the Claims were not confined and limited to the use of the cellulose in yams, filaments or fibres, woven, knitted or worked into the intermediate material, but extended to the use of a cellulose derivative in any form. The Exchequer Court of Canada upheld the validity of the patent.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1936] Ex. C.R. 139), that the patent was invalid.\nUnless the claims in the Canadian Dreyfus patent can properly be narrowed by the introduction of a limitation to the use of the cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres, they have been clearly anticipated by the United States patent of Van Heusen and two other British patents referred to in the judgment. Van Heusen clearly disclosed the process of taking the separate pieces of fabric and securing them together \u201cinto what is in effect an integral composite fabric\u201d by the use of an intermediate binding layer containing solutions of cellulose derivatives. It constitutes a complete anticipation of the claims of the respondent unless those claims can be modified by incorporating the limitation that the thermoplastic derivative of cellulose be in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres woven into the intermediate fabric.\nAs a general rule, the ambit of the invention must be circumscribed by definite claims. It is a question of law, then, whether or not the claims in this case read in the light of the specification may be limited. If they cannot, the claims remain so broad as to be invalid because of the prior art. If limited, they have not been anticipated. Throughout the specification of the Dreyfus patent, there is a continuous reference to the use of the thermoplastic derivative of cellulose in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres and it is plainly the very essence of the disclosure in the specification; but the inventor did not state in his Claims the essential characteristic of his actual invention. The Court is invited to read through the specification and import into the wide and general language of the claims that which is said to be the real inventive step disclosed. The claims are unequivocal and complete upon their face; it is not necessary to resort to the context and as a matter of construction the claims do not import the context. In no proper sense can it be said that though the essential feature of the invention is not mentioned in the claims the process defined in the claims necessarily possesses that essential feature. The Court cannot limit the claims by simply saying that the inventor must have meant that which he has described. The claims in fact go far beyond the invention and upon that ground the patent is invalid. The Patent Act specifically requires that the specification shall end with a claim or claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege. The Patent Act, 1923 (13-14 Geo. V, c. 23, s. 14, ss. 1); The Patent Act, 1935 (25-26 Geo. V, c. 32, s. 35, ss. 2).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing its action for a declaration either that a patent no. 265,960, granted to one Dreyfus and owned by the defendant was invalid and void or that it was not infringed by the plaintiff\u2019s manufacture of certain shirt collars.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above headnote and in the judgment now reported.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the appellant.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and H. Gerin-Lajoie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014A difficult question is raised in this patent case as to whether or not the process used by the appellant in the manufacture of collars for men\u2019s shirts infringes the Dreyfus Canadian patent no. 265,960 granted November 16, 1926, on an application filed December 18, 1925, and owned by the respondent. The validity of the patent is directly put in issue. The appellant\u2019s process for making a collar of the same material as used in a soft shirt is stated as follows. Two plies of the particular shirt material, forming outside and inside layers of the collar, are taken and there is placed between them a ply of other woven material in which all the weft threads and two out of three of the warp threads are cotton, the remaining one in three of the warp threads being of cellulose acetate. These cellulose threads are partly dissolved by a volatile (acetone-alcohol) solvent applied through one of the outer fabrics after the collar is partly finished. The solvent is immediately driven off by pressing the collar (at about 10-20 pounds pressure per square inch) between heated platens one of which is covered with a textile material. The platens are kept at a temperature of about 125\u00b0 C. The result of the rapid driving off of the volatile solvent is that the dissolved cellulose acetate does not spread; the knuckles only of the cellulose acetate yarn melt and form an adhesive which unites all three piles at a series of spaced spots, staggered on opposite sides of the lining material. The result is a semi-stiff composite fabric. The appellant claims that the softening of the cellulose acetate is not brought about by heat but by the application of the volatile solvent by which the cellulose acetate is partly dissolved and that the volatile solvent is quickly driven off the partly dissolved cellulose acetate yarns by submitting the collar to the pressure and at the temperature above mentioned. If all the cellulose were retained it would tend to fill up the pores in the material to such an extent that the collar might become waterproof. The obvious need in a collar is that it should remain porous so as to absorb perspiration and lend itself to being easily laundered. The appellant\u2019s process proved a great commercial success; the manufacture of shirt collars according to the process extended, in the United States and Canada, to as many as twenty-eight millions in one year.\nThis process was put into use in Canada by the appellant about June, 1935. The respondent then alleged that the process infringed the Dreyfus Canadian patent held by it and this action was commenced in the Exchequer Court of Canada. The patent does not appear to have been put into commercial use prior to the adoption by the appellant of its process. We turn now to an examination of the patent. It is recited to be an invention of\ncertain new and useful improvements relating to fabrics and sheet materials and the manufacture thereof.\nThe invention is stated to concern the manufacture of new fabrics or sheet materials having waterproof to gas-proof properties or capable of other applications. According to the invention, a fabric or sheet material is made by uniting under appropriate conditions of temperature and pressure, woven, knitted or other fabrics, composed of or containing filaments or fibres of thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives with woven, knitted or other fabric composed of or containing filaments or fibres of non-thermoplastic or relatively non-thermoplastic material. Further, according to the invention woven, knitted or other fabric made of yarns composed of filaments or fibres of a thermoplastic cellulose derivative is associated with woven, knitted, or other fabric made wholly or partly of yarns composed of filaments or fibres of a non-thermoplastic or relatively non-thermoplastic material, and the associated fabrics are subjected to heat and pressure, with or without employment, assistance or application of plasticising or softening agents or solvents of the thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives. In this way the fabrics are united and a composite sheet material is obtained in which the pores or interstices are reduced to extremely minute dimensions, or closed completely, by the melting or softening effect produced by the heat and pressure upon the filaments and fibres of the thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives and by the uniting of the fabrics under the heat and pressure.\nThe specification further states that\nThe extent of the melting or softening effect, degree of closing the pores or interstices, and intimacy of union of the fabrics, and therefore the degree of impermeability of the compound fabric or material produced, can vary with the degrees and duration of heat and pressure employed, and with whether plasticisers, or softeners or solvents are employed, and with the number of fabrics united together, or other circumstances.\nThe manner in which the invention may be carried into effect is illustrated in the specification by the following more detailed description,\nit being understood that this can be varied widely without departing from the invention. A woven or warp knitted fabric made of cellulose acetate yarn is associated with woven or knitted fabric of silk, cotton, linen or other fibre, preferably after being coated or treated with a plasticising or softening agent or solvent on the face that is to contact with the latter fabric, and the associated fabrics are subjected to heat and pressure to unite the component fabrics together and give a material possessing a desired degree of resistance to penetration by water or gases, according to the degree and duration of temperatures and pressure, the conditions of heat, pressure and time being interdependent. The less the heat, the greater or the longer is the pressure required to produce a given effect, or the same conditions of heat and pressure may be applied for more or less time to produce the effect in a greater or less degree.\nThe application of plasticising or softening agents or solvents of the cellulose acetate or other thermoplastic cellulose derivatives to assist the melting effect and the union of the component fabrics, as referred to in the specification, is stated to be\nespecially of advantage where a high degree of impermeability to water is desired or for obtaining gas-proof properties in the compound material.\nThe process is said to produce\na compound material having waterproof to gas-proof properties according to the degree of dissolving or melting effect, etc., produced on the cellulose acetate by the condition of heat, pressure and time employed.\nThe concluding words of the specification are:\nThe compound materials made according to the invention may be employed more particularly for applications where resistance to penetration by water or gases is desired, for instance, as waterproof materials for garments, coverings, etc., etc., or as materials for airships or other gas container, but materials made according to the invention may be employed for any other technical or industrial applications.\nAlthough there are some 25 claims set up, counsel for the appellant mainly confined their arguments to claims 1 and 4. Claim 1 is as follows:\n1. A process for the manufacture of composite sheet material which comprises subjecting a plurality of associated fabrics, at least one of which contains a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose, to heat and pressure, thereby softening said derivative and uniting said fabrics.\nClaim 4 is as follows:\u2014\n4. A process for the manufacture of composite sheet material which comprises treating a fabric containing a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose with a softening agent, associating it with another fabric, and uniting the fabrics by subjecting them to heat and pressure.\nThe first impression one gathers from a reading of the patent is that what the inventor was really aiming at was the making of new fabrics or sheet materials having waterproof or even gras-proof properties\u2014the extent of the impermeability depending upon the amount of the cellulose acetate used and the appropriate application of heat and pressure. To obtain different degrees of impermeability according to the different requirements\u2014a very slight waterproof condition or a complete waterproof condition or even such a condition of impermeability that gas could not penetrate\u2014appears at first glance to be the purpose and object sought to be attained by the inventor. He described the intermediate material as \u201ccomposed of or containing\u201d filaments or fibres of thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives. That, I take it, involves that the material, depending upon the degree of impermeability sought to be obtained, will be almost entirely or only partially of cellulose. And the thermoplastic cellulose derivative, whether almost the entire or only a small part of the intermediate layer, is to be in yarns, filaments or fibres in the woven, knitted or other fabric used. It is not a coating or embedding process. The cellulose is not spread upon or embedded in the cloth. Those were old and well-known processes but they left a rigid material difficult to shape or cut. The invention of Dreyfus made an ordinary fabric or sheet material waterproof or gas-proof without detracting from the appearance of the original material.\nBut the appellant did not desire a waterproof, much less a gas-proof, material for its shirt collars. That was a condition that the appellant says in fact had to be avoided if the collar were to be comfortable for personal wear and capable of being laundered in the ordinary course. What was desired by the appellant was a collar, of the same material as the shirt itself, made semi-stiff and yet sufficiently porous to absorb perspiration and to be easily washed and ironed. The appellant attained that result in the process it adopted and the process naturally became of great commercial value.\nWhat is said against the appellant is this. You made a composite fabric by the use of an intermediate material containing threads of cellulose acetate and the application thereto of heat and pressure, and that is exactly the invention covered by the Dreyfus patent. Impermeability is not an absolute but a relative term and it is contended by the respondent that a condition of more or less impermeability is only an incidental result obtained under the patented process. The principal aim and the very substance of Dreyfus\u2019 invention was, it is argued, to make a composite textile material by taking a plurality of fabrics and uniting them by the use of a fabric composed of or containing yarns, filaments or fibres of a thermoplastic cellulose derivative and the application thereto of heat and pressure. That, it is submitted, was the real invention of Dreyfus and the invention that the appellant substantially adopted. In that view, impermeability to water or even to gas becomes unimportant and attention is focussed on the contention that the very basis and substance of the invention of Dreyfus was the making of a composite textile material by the method set out in the patent. There is really no denial of the statement that before Dreyfus this method of uniting two or more materials into one composite fabric was unknown. Prior user is not even set up against the patent but prior art is relied upon. When the prior art is examined, it consists entirely in different methods of coating or embedding cellulose or other adhesives. In every case the cellulose is spread over, or squirted upon, or embedded in the material leaving a glassy and stiff surface. There is nothing in the prior art of a process for the manufacture of a composite sheet material made by subjecting a plurality of associated fabrics, at least one of which contains a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres, to heat and pressure, thereby softening the derivative and uniting the fabrics in a composite material. If that process was the real invention of Dreyfus, then there was nothing in the prior art that undermined it.\nA formidable objection to the validity of the patent is advanced by counsel for the appellant upon the ground that the claims are not limited to the use of woven cellulose yarns but extend to the use of a cellulose derivative in any form. Claims 1 and 4 above set out are taken for discussion on this point. It is to be observed that while claim 1 asserts a monopoly of the use of a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose not combined with any softening agent, claim 4 requires that the cellulose derivative should be combined with a softening agent, thus carrying into the claims the alternatives emphasized in the disclosure.\nThe objection, then, to the validity of the claims is that they omit any reference to what counsel for the respondent at the trial described in the opening statement as \u201cthe new * * * and all-important feature of the invention,\u201d namely, the form in which the thermoplastic derivative of cellulose to be acted upon is to be present in the layers of fabric to be united.\nDr. Dreyfus taught the use of thermoplastic yarns of a cellulose derivative woven into the fabric. That was new and that is the all-important feature of the invention. We are not concerned with the uniting of fabrics otherwise than by the presence of a cellulose derivative in the form of yarn woven into the fabric.\nAnd in the carefully prepared factum of the respondent the following statement is made as to the main feature of the patentee\u2019s invention:\nThe novelty of the invention rests mainly in the use of a cellulose derivative in the form of yarns woven into a fabric, as a means of uniting fabrics under the action of heat and pressure, due to the thermoplastic nature of such cellulose derivative and either with or without the assistance or application of a plasticizer, softening agent, or solvent. No adhesive substance is added for the purpose of uniting, but use is made of the properties of thermoplastic yarns of a cellulose derivative woven into one of the associated fabrics.\nAnd again in the argument in the respondent\u2019s factum as to the nature of the invention, the following statement appears:\nThe reference to \u201cfilaments\u201d and \u201cfibres\u201d in the patent therefore necessarily implies a cellulose derivative in the form of yarns or threads woven into the fabric. A mere coating or application of a cellulose derivative in some form other than yarns would not contain \u201cfilaments or fibres\u201d of such derivative.\nAgain, after discussing the Segall (United States) patent, the following statement is made:\nThe problem under that patent is quite different from that under respondent\u2019s patent which deals with a composite material made of plies of fabric in one of which are yarns of a cellulose derivative used for uniting the fabrics.\nAnd in referring to the Van Heusen (United States) patent the factum continues:\nThis patent covers primarily the use of a cement or binding agent to unit the plies of fabrics in the making of collars. Such cement or binding agent is used in the form of a coating and not in the form of yarns forming part of the intermediate layer.\n* * *\nVan Heusen, therefore, resorts to a coating of nitro-cellulose for the purpose of uniting and does not resort to a cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres.\nAnd again in discussing the Green patent (British) the factum continues:\nThis patent has no analogy with respondent\u2019s patent, as it relates to the application of octo-nitro-cellulose in the form of a coating, or in the form of a stream in thin form on the fabric. There is no yarn used for the purpose of uniting. And in discussing the patent of Henry Dreyfus (British) the factum states:\nThe relevancy to the patent in issue is extremely remote. It does not show the use of cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, but rather in the form of sheets or coatings.\nThe learned trial judge obviously regarded the use of the cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres as of the very essence of the invention, for in discussing the Van Heusen patent in his reasons for judgment he said:\nNow there is no reference in Van Heusen to the use of a thermoplastic cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, woven into one of the two or more fabrics to be united and which may be cut and sewn and handled like any other fabric, and this, I think on grounds of utility, would be much more desirable and convenient than dealing with pieces of fabrics that were coated with a cementing material. Van Heusen, in my opinion, is not an anticipation of Dreyfus.\nThe specification refers to the thermoplastic derivative of cellulose being present only in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres woven, knitted or worked into one or more of the layers constituting the final composite product but no mention of this essential characteristic being included in the patentee\u2019s claims counsel for the appellant submit that the claims cannot be narrowed by the introduction into them by the Court of a limitation which they do not contain.\nThe claims in the British patent, no. 248,147, contain the limitation in the words:\nwoven, knitted or other fabric composed of or containing filaments or fibres of a thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives,\nand a similar limitation also appears in the claims of the corresponding United States patent no. 1,903,960 in the words:\na fabric containing yarns comprising a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose.\nBoth the British and the United States applications were made prior in date to the application in Canada.\nUnless the claims in the Canadian patent can properly be narrowed by the introduction of a limitation to the use of the cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres, they are, we think, clearly anticipated by the United States patent of Van Heusen and the British patents of Green and Henry Dreyfus.\nVan Heusen (U.S. no. 1,479,565, application filed November 16, 1921, patent granted January 1, 1924) discloses the manufacture of a three-ply collar consisting of a lining and two outer plies. These are caused to combine into a single composite sheet by the application to the lining of a cellulose derivative in solution to act as a \u201ccementing agent,\u201d whereupon the outer plies and the lining are treated\n* * * by heat and pressure to cause the cementing material to be converted into its final form and thereby secure the separate layers of fabric together.\nThe specification recites that according to the invention two or more pieces of fabric are taken and secured together by means of an intermediate cementing or binding medium that is waterproof or water insoluble and which does not affect in any objectionable way the outside appearance of the fabric but which nevertheless\ncombines the different layers of fabric together into a composite integral whole.\nThe cementing agent for securing the different layers or plies of fabric together is described as capable of variation. Agents such as cellulosic binding materials can be used. For example, solutions of cellulose derivatives such as cellulose nitrate in suitable solvents, or solutions of cellulose in cellulose solvents can be used. The binding material can be applied in different ways. The separate pieces of fabric may thus, for example, be folded in folding machines and the separate pieces of the fabric, with their edges turned in, can then be coated with the adhesive material and treated to convert the layer of adhesive into a permanent bond. The fabric can similarly be coated before the edge is turned so that the turned-in edge will similarly be secured in place. After the fabric has been coated, and either before or after the collar has been built up therefrom, the coating can be modified to convert it into a form better adapted for securing the layers of fabric together. The specification continued:\nIn the case of a solution of a cellulose derivative in an organic solvent, the solvent may be partly evaporated before the layers of the fabric are secured together. In other cases, the pieces of fabric may be put together and pressed in a heated press to modify or change the binding material and convert it into its final form.\nThe Van Heusen patent presents a real difficulty to the respondent. Counsel for the appellant argue that the respondent is on the horns of a dilemma\u2014if it asserts that its process is different from Van Heusen because Van Heusen did not adopt yarns, filaments or fibres of the cellulose derivative in the intermediate layer then the respondent\u2019s claims are too broad in that the claims are not confined and limited to the use of the cellulose in yarns, filaments or fibres woven, knitted or worked into the intermediate material; whereas on the other hand if the respondent relies on the claims as they stand without reference to the use of the cellulose in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres, the process was anticipated by Van Heusen.\nGreen (British no. 9,879 of 1889) refers to the use of cellulose and particularly octo-nitro-cellulose as forming \u201ca good substitute for silk\u201d and suggests as one alternative its being used as a coating for ordinary yarns and, as another, either its direct extrusion on to an ordinary fabric through capillary tubes in the form of threads or ribbons, or, its being wound in the form of threads on bobbins, these threads being subsequently affixed to an ordinary fabric\nby pressure with or without heat * * * in order to insure the more perfect union of the filament or ribbon to the fabric.\nThe resulting products are described as \u201ccompound fabrics\u201d capable of use for\narticles of dress * * * and numerous other articles * * * to which silk and mixtures of silk * * * are now applied, (including) collars, cuffs, hats or bonnets.\nGreen\u2019s patent has for its object to impart to fabric threads and other articles a silk-like lustre. Octo-nitro-cellulose is used for this purpose in the form of a coating applied to the article. The solution of this octo-nitro-cellulose is forced through jets, i.e., squirted, on the surface of the fabric. There is no yarn used for the purpose of uniting.\nHenry Dreyfus (British no. 173,021, 1921) refers to previous proposals for the use in the production of glass substitutes of cellulose esters in the form, among others, of a \u201cweb\u201d combined with a \u201cmetallic or textile fabric\u201d and proposed the analogous use of cellulose ethers, suggesting as one alternative that an ordinary fabric\nmay be embedded by heat and pressure into a solidified film, sheet or web of the ether or ether composition or between two such films, sheets or webs.\nThis patent does not show the use of cellulose derivatives in the form of yarns, but in the form of sheets or coatings.\nThere is no necessity for us to examine closely other British and United States patents referred to during the argument. Van Heusen clearly disclosed the process of taking the separate pieces of fabric and securing them together \u201cinto what is in effect an integral composite fabric\u201d by the use of an intermediate binding layer containing solutions of cellulose derivatives. It constitutes a complete anticipation of the claims of the respondent unless those claims can be modified by incorporating the limitation (which modification the appellant\u2019s counsel contend cannot be made) that the thermoplastic derivative of cellulose be in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres woven into the intermediate fabric.\nIt may be stated as a general rule that the ambit of the invention must be circumscribed by definite claims. It is a question of law, then, whether or not the claims in this case read in the light of the specification may be limited. If they cannot, the claims remain so broad as to be invalid because of the prior art. If limited, they have not been anticipated. It is difficult to understand why the inventor in defining his claims in his British application should have expressly mentioned\nwoven, knitted or other fabric composed of or containing filaments or fibres of a thermoplastic cellulose derivative or derivatives,\nand in defining his claims in the United States application should have expressly mentioned\na fabric containing yarns comprising a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose\nand should have entirely omitted such words in his subsequent application in Canada. Why do the claims omit what counsel for the respondent contended at the trial was the \u201cnew * * * and all-important feature of the invention,\u201d namely, the use of thermoplastic yarns of cellulose derivative woven into the fabric? We cannot say. Throughout the somewhat long specification there is a continuous reference to the use of the thermoplastic derivative of cellulose in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres and it is plainly the very essence of the disclosure in the specification. Why, then, was it left out of the claims? It may have been a slip of the draftsman or it may have been a deliberate omission in an effort to secure a wider field of protection than the disclosure warranted.\nThe Patent Act, 1923 (13-14 Geo. V, c. 23) in force at the time of the application and grant of the patent expressly required by subsection (1) of section 14 thereof that the specification\nshall end with a claim or claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege. Subsection (2) of section 35 of The Patent Act, 1935 (25-26 Geo. V, c. 32) is substantially in the same language.\nLord Cottenham, L.C., in Kay v. Marshall[2] said:\nThe claim is not intended to aid the description, but to ascertain the extent of what is claimed as new.\nand Lord Chelmsford in Harrison v. The Anderston Foundry Co.[3] said:\nThe office of a claim is to define and limit with precision what it is which is claimed to have been invented and therefore patented.\nAs Lord Cairns put it in the Anderston case3, \u201cEverything which is not claimed is disclaimed.\u201d\nTerrell on Patents (8th ed., 1934) at p. 134 states the rule that\nif the words of the claim are plain and unambiguous, it will not be possible to expand or limit their scope by reference to the body of the specification.\nIn Ingersoll Sergeant Drill Company v. Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Company[4], in the House of Lords the Lord Chancellor, Lord Loreburn, said:\nObviously, the rest of the specification may be considered in order to assist in comprehending and construing a claim, but the claim must state, either by express words or by plain reference, what is the invention for which protection is demanded. The idea of allowing a patentee to use perfectly general language in the claim, and subsequently to restrict, or expand, or qualify what is therein expressed by borrowing this or that gloss from other parts of the specification, is wholy inadmissible. I should have thought it was also a wholly original pretension.\nLater, in Natural Colour Kinematograph Co. Ld. v. Bioschemes, Ld.3, Lord Loreburn practically repeated what he had said in the Ingersoll case[5]:\nSome of those who draft specifications and claims are apt to treat this industry as a trial of skill, in which the object is to make the claim very wide upon one interpretation of it in order to prevent as many people as possible from competing with the patentee\u2019s business, and then to rely upon carefully prepared sentences in the specification which, it is hoped, will be just enough to limit the claim within safe dimensions if it is attacked in court. This leads to litigation as to the construction of specifications, which could generally be avoided if at the outset a sincere attempt were made to state exactly what was meant in plain language. The fear of a costly law suit is apt to deter any but wealthy competitors from contesting a patent. This is all wrong. It is an abuse which a court can prevent, whether a charge of ambiguity is or is not raised on the pleadings, because it affects the public by practically enlarging the monopoly, and does so by a kind of pressure which is very objectionable. It is the duty of a patentee to state clearly and distinctly, either in direct words or by clear and distinct reference, the nature and limits of what he claims. If he uses language which, when fairly read, is avoidably obscure or ambiguous, the patent is invalid, whether the defect be due to design, or to carelessness, or to want of skill.\nIn Erickson\u2019s Patent case[6], it was held that the patentee had failed so to limit his first claim as to confine it to that which was the novelty (if any) of the invention, and that accordingly the claim was so wide as to render the patent invalid. Pollock, M.R., said at p. 486:\nWe cannot construe the specification as necessarily leading to the conclusion that the feature of novelty is claimed. Claim 1 certainly, fairly construed, appears to admit of any claim in relation to a perforated cylinder being included in it, and on the ground, therefore, that the matter of novelty, which is the sole matter and pith of the invention, is not indicated, and also on the ground that the claim is so wide that it would include any claim in relation to a perforated cylinder, it appears to me that the claim is bad.\nIn British Hartford-Fairmont Syndicate, Ld. v. Jackson Bros. (Knottingley) Ltd.[7], Lord Justice Romer said:\nWhat justification there can be for altering the language of the claim in this or in some similar manner I am at a loss to conceive. One may, and one ought to, refer to the body of the specification for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of words and phrases used in the claims or for the purpose of resolving difficulties of construction occasioned by the claims when read by themselves. But where the construction of a claim when read by itself is plain, it is not in my opinion legitimate to diminish the ambit of the monopoly claimed merely because in the body of the specification the patentee has described his invention in more restricted terms than in the claim itself. The difference may well have been intentional, and created with the object\u2014to use the words of Lord Loreburn in the Natural Kinematograph case\u2014of holding in reserve a variety of constructions for use if the patent should be called in question, and in the meantime to frighten off those who might be disposed to challenge the patent.\nIn the judgment of P. O. Lawrence, L.J., there occur (at pp. 550 and 551) passages of almost similar effect. That case went to the House of Lords and the appeal was dismissed[8]. Lord Tomlin, whose judgment was concurred in by Lord Buckmaster and Lord Warrington, said in part, at p. 260:\nThe object of letters patent is to secure to the patentee during the continuance of the grant the absolute monopoly of the manner of manufacture which the patent is designed to protect. It removes the invention from the open field of competition. It follows that it is essential that the protected matter should be accurately defined in order that those familiar with the industry to which the invention relates should have clear warning of what is forbidden to them.\nIn R.C.A. Photophone, Ld. v. Gaumont-British Picture Corporation Ld. and British Acoustic Films, Ld.[9], Lord Justice Romer at p. 195 said: In the days before it was obligatory on a patentee to set out his claims in his specification, it was often possible to find in it the statement of some principle that the patentee claimed to have discovered and a description of some method of putting the principle into practice. In such cases the invention might well be regarded as being an invention of all such methods; but now that claims are obligatory it is, in my judgment, essential that the patentee should claim all such methods in unambiguous terms, making it quite clear what the principle is. As was said by Lord Shaw in Ridd Milking Machine Company v. Simplex Milking Machine Company[10]: \u201cIf any claim for a principle is made it must undoubtedly appear in the claim as that claim is stated, and must not be left to an inference resting on a general review of the specification or a general search among the language employed therein for the meritorious element of principle or idea.\u201d It is the duty of a patentee by his claim to make quite clear what is the ambit of his monopoly in order that workers in the art may be left in no doubt as to the territory that is forbidden them during the life of the patent. If he fails to do this, his patent becomes a public nuisance. It is equally incumbent upon him to describe at least one way, and the best way known to him, of carrying his invention into effect, in order that, when his monopoly comes to an end, the workers in the art may turn the invention to account. This is the consideration he pays for his monopoly.\nAnd in the Mullard Radio Valve Co. Ld. v. Philco Radio and Television Corporation of Great Britain, Ld. and Others[11], in the House of Lords, Lord MacMillan said at p. 345:\nA patentee may make a most meritorious discovery and may give an entirely adequate description of his inventive idea and of the manner of putting it into practice, but when he comes to formulate the claim to his invention he may claim a monopoly wider in extent than is warranted by what he has invented. The patentee has told us quite definitely that his invention deals with the case of a final amplifier which comprises a screening grid between the control grid and the anode and that he has invented means by which, in such a case, the screening grid current is prevented entirely or partially from increasing at the expense of the anode current when the anode potential falls. The problem which he set out to solve and the disadvantages which he professes to overcome relate solely to discharge tubes with a screening grid between the control grid and the anode. His discovery was that, if in a discharge tube with a screening grid between the control grid and the anode he inserted between the screening grid and the anode an additional \u201csuppressor\u201d grid, he achieved the advantageous results which he describes. That is the ambit of his invention and for that he is entitled to protection. But claim 2 makes no reference to screening grids or control grids at all. It simply speaks of three or more electrodes irrespective of their function as screening grids or control grids or suppressor grids or of their arrangement relatively to each other.\nAnd at p. 346:\nA patentee is granted his monopoly in order to protect the invention which in his specification he has communicated to the public. He is not entitled to claim a monopoly more extensive than is necessary to protect that which he has himself said is his invention. In the present case I think that in claim 2 the patentee has claimed more than his inventive idea entitles him to protect.\nAnd at p. 347:\nIf an inventor claims an article as his invention but the article will only achieve his avowed object in a particular juxtaposition and his inventive idea consists in the discovery that in that particular juxtaposition it will give new and useful results, I do not think that he is entitled to claim the article at large apart from the juxtaposition which is essential to the achievement of those results.\nAnd further, on p. 347:\nIt is undoubtedly the case that a claim may be too wide, in the sense that it claims protection for that for which the patentee is not entitled to protection, or that it gives him a wider protection than his discovery entitles him to receive. In the present instance the patentee has claimed a monopoly of all valves with a certain feature of construction although the merit of his invention does not lie in that feature but in the utilisation in a particular and limited way of a valve containing that feature of construction. In so doing he has in my opinion over-reached himself and his claim is wider than the law will support.\nAnd Lord Roche, at p. 351:\nIt is true that an inventor need not state in a claim the reasons that have led him to his invention or the stage or stages by which he has arrived at it. But the essential characteristics of his actual invention he must state.\nIn the Canadian patent involved in this appeal before us the inventor did not state in his claims the essential characteristic of his actual invention though it does appear in the claims in his British and United States patents. No explanation is offered. We are invited to read through the lengthy specification and import into the wide and general language of the claims that which is said to be the real inventive step disclosed. But the claims are unequivocal and complete upon their face. It is not necessary to resort to the context and as a matter of construction the claims do not import the context. In no proper sense can it be said that though the essential feature of the invention is not mentioned in the claims the process defined in the claims necessarily possesses that essential feature. The Court cannot limit the claims by simply saying that the inventor must have meant that which he has described. The claims in fact go far beyond the invention. Upon that ground the patent is invalid.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment appealed from should be varied by declaring the respondent\u2019s patent no. 265,960 to be invalid and by directing the respondent to pay to the appellant its costs of the action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Lajoie, Lajoie, Gelinas & MacNaughton.\n[1] [1936] Ex.

Smith Incubator Co. Et al., [1937] S.C.R. 238\nDate: 1937-03-19\nHis Majesty The King, on the information of the Attorney-General of Canada (plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Smith Incubator Company and The Buckeye Incubator Company (Defendants) Respondents.\n1936: November 16, 17; 1937: March 19.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Validity\u2014Prior public knowledge and prior use\u2014Subject-matter\u2014Breadth of claims.\nIt was held that the letters patent in question, for alleged new and useful improvements in incubators, were invalid and void, and they were declared cancelled and set aside (reversing judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1936] Ex. C.R. 105), on grounds as follows:\nThe subject-matter of the alleged invention and the validity in that respect of the patent must be envisaged within the ambit of the claims accompanying the specification. As to the \u201cmethod\u201d claims (those relating to the \u201cmethod of hatching\u201d): Bearing in mind that, in order to have the character of an invention in the patentable sense, it would not be sufficient for the patentee\u2019s conception to consist in the adoption of the principle of air circulation in a room for the purpose of maintaining in it uniformity of temperature (which principle was not new), that a further step was required, viz., a novel method of utilizing air circulation (involving \u201ca degree of ingenuity * * * which must have been the result of thought and experiment\u201d\u2014Thomson v. American Braided Wire Co., 6 R.P.C. 518), it was to be noticed that nowhere in the claims was there claimed precisely as material any particular method of utilizing the air circulation, except, perhaps, the statement that the current of heated air is \u201ccreated by means other than variations of temperature\u201d; also that there was nothing in the claims to restrict the patent to any particular order of arrangement of the eggs or any particular direction or means of control of the current of air, other than its velocity, and nothing to estop the patentee from asserting that the claims were not restricted by such features; and it followed that, in view of the operations of one Hastings and prior public use (as established in evidence) at Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1912 (the date of the alleged invention now in question carried back to 1915), the patentee\u2019s claims in question were too wide; also the greater part of them, if not all, were already anticipated and precluded by Hastings\u2019 public use.\nThe Supreme Court of the United States in Smith v. Snow (294 U.S. R. 1), dealing with the first of the method claims, held it to be valid, but the record before that Court lacked evidence of Hastings and evidence of what his prior use had been, and the record before this Court in the present case was so widely different that a different conclusion must be reached.\nAs to the claims relating to the apparatus: Upon the evidence, it was impossible to regard the advance, if any, over the prior knowledge and prior user as good and sufficient subject-matter of a patent. Any difference that might exist between the structure now in question and that of Hastings consisted only in mechanical details. The apparatus claims were defeated by Hastings\u2019 prior public use; they must be regarded as invalid and void, as embracing more than the patentee could claim as new; and, indeed, as claiming something which, having regard to Hastings\u2019 prior public use, did not amount to an invention in the pertinent sense.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the action, which was brought by information filed on behalf of the Crown by the Attorney-General of Canada to impeach the letters patent in question, which were issued on April 18, 1922, for alleged new and useful improvements in incubators, of which letters patent the defendant (respondent) The Smith Incubator Company was owner and the defendant (respondent) The Buckeye Incubator Company was a licensee. Angers J. held that the patent was valid and dismissed the action. By the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was allowed, with costs both in this Court and in the Exchequer Court, and judgment was given for a declaration that the letters patent in question are invalid and void, and that the same be cancelled and set aside.\nE. G. Gowling and R. A. Olmstead for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The Canadian letters patent no. 217,777, issued to Samuel B. Smith on the 18th day of April, 1922, for alleged new and useful improvements in incubators, are impeached by the Attorney-General of Canada who alleges that the respondents, respectively owner and licensee thereunder, in attempting to enforce their alleged rights granted by the said letters patent, are seriously and detrimentally affecting the welfare of the Canadian poultry industry. The Attorney-General is acting under s. 60 of the Patent Act, 1935 (25-26 Geo. V, chap. 32).\nThe information prays that the letters patent be declared invalid and void and that the same be cancelled and set aside.\nIn the Exchequer Court, the patent was held valid[2]; and the Attorney-General appeals from that judgment.\nSeveral grounds of impeachment set out in the particulars of objection filed with the information were abandoned at the trial. In this Court, the grounds upon which the patent was sought to be impeached were:\n(a) That there was no invention, having regard to the prior art and to the prior knowledge and use of a similar device in the year 1912 by one Milo Hastings, at Muskogee, Oklahoma, U.S.A.;\n(b) That the claims of the patent embraced more than the applicant invented, if he invented anything.\nThe apparatus and method disclosed in the specification is there stated to be\nparticularly designed for extensive operations wherein a chamber of large dimensions is adapted to contain thousands of eggs in separate trays arranged in tiers and the method of heating is such that the heated air is adapted to the eggs in various stages of incubation. There is a forced circulation of hot air through the chamber which is adapted preferably to maintain all eggs at temperatures between 100\u00b0 and 105\u00b0 Fahrenheit approximately and this improved system contemplates that fresh eggs will be placed in a horizontal plane, preferably by means of trays supported in horizontal planes, and after the eggs have been subject to the circulation of hot air for a predetermined time (the air circulating largely around the eggs) they will be placed in a tilted or inclined position in a different location but still subject to the same column of air and at this period of incubation they will be tilted in different planes at regular intervals during the time they remain in this latter position, and after they have remained for a predetermined time they will be again moved to a different position with reference to the forced circulation of hot air and so placed therein that the air will tend to keep the eggs below 105\u00b0 temperature, and in this last named position the air will be forced to pass between the different eggs and will in effect act as a cooling medium for the eggs. The temperature of circulating air should be such as will prevent the eggs in the early stage of incubation from falling below 100\u00b0 and the speed of velocity of the circulating air should be such as to carry the heat away from the eggs in the later stage of incubation and thereby hold the temperature of those eggs at 105\u00b0 or slightly below that. It is manifest that the temperature will remain practically the same throughout the column of the eggs, but the air is impelled with sufficient velocity to carry the heat away from the eggs which happen to be in the advanced stage of incubation.\nA detailed description of the apparatus and of its method of work is then given by reference to the figures and numbers on the accompanying drawings.\nThe \u201cforced circulation of hot air through the chamber\u201d is provided by means of fans, or series of fans, of which it is said that they\ncan be so arranged and can be operated at such speed as to cause the hot air to circulate fast enough to keep the temperature throughout the chamber between the limits of 100\u00b0 and 105\u00b0.\nThe specification then goes on:\nIt, therefore, appears that the improved apparatus and method contemplates the application of hot air circulating in a column with such speed as to keep the temperature substantially uniform and so arranging the eggs that the fresh eggs are placed at one point in the column of air and held in a horizontal plane until they reach a predetermined stage of incubation and then put at a different point in the same column of air and kept in planes inclined to the horizontal and thereafter placed at such a point in the column of air that the forced draft of air acts to hold the eggs at a uniform temperature and to prevent them from becoming overheated and thereafter placing the eggs into final position for the hatching operation.\nThe specification further provides that\nAny suitable thermostatic means may be employed for regulating the temperature such for instance as a thermostat commonly employed in incubators of a well known construction, [etc.].\nThere are five claims. Claims 1, 2 and 3 relate to \u201cthe method of hatching.\u201d Claims 4 and 5 relate to the apparatus. Claim 1 is typical of the three claims relating to the method; and, for our purposes, it will be sufficient to set it out in full:\nThe method of hatching a plurality of eggs by arranging them at different levels in a closed chamber having restricted openings of sufficient capacity for the escape of foul air without undue loss of moisture and applying a current of heated air, said current being created by means other than variations of temperature and of sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature whereby the air will be vitalized, the moisture conserved and the units of heat will be carried from the eggs in the more advanced stage of incubation to those in a less advanced stage for the purpose specified.\nWhatever difference may exist between this claim and claims 2 and 3 is not material and may be pointed out as we proceed.\nThe claims relating to the apparatus read as follows:\n4. In an incubator, a closed chamber having a central corridor provided with an air-distributing space in its upper portion and a power- driven fan in said space, curtains at each side of said corridor, arranged to permit the air to circulate from the bottom of the chamber into the part of the chamber behind the curtains, passageways connecting the air distributing space with the corridor and the parts of said chamber behind the curtains, separate stationary and tilting racks behind said curtains, egg trays having open-mesh bottoms removably mounted upon said racks, and means to heat the air circulated through said chamber.\n5. In an incubator, a closed chamber with a vertically disposed partition to provide a corridor having upper and lower passageways to said chamber, egg trays arranged at different levels in said chamber, a power driven fan creating a current in said corridor to circulate through said passageways and egg trays, said chamber having restricted openings of sufficient capacity for the discharge of foul air without undue loss of moisture and means to heat the air circulated through said chamber.\nEvidence, including several prior patents and publications, was adduced for the purpose of establishing prior knowledge and the advance of the art up to the date of Smith\u2019s alleged invention which, by mutual consent, was agreed as carrying back to the year 1915.\nNow, it was in the fall of 1911 and the winter of 1912 that Milo Hastings installed and organized a large hatchery at Muskogee, Oklahoma.\nMr. Hastings was heard as a witness in the present case. He said he had become \u201cinterested in incubation\u201d as early as the year 1896. After graduating from college, he was employed as a poultry man by the United States Department of Agriculture. He was called upon to investigate the cold storage industry of eggs and chickens; and thus he became acquainted with the fact that for the successful storage of eggs and chickens it was necessary to have the control of humidity, as well as of temperature, in cold storage chambers. When working upon the cold storage industry, he noticed the use of fan circulation of air in a chamber to equalize heat and also to control humidity. It occurred to his mind that the essential problem of incubation upon a large scale involved the same series of natural conditions and natural laws, the circulation of air, the equal distribution of heat and humidity; and that if, by means of a fan, he could equalize the temperature of eggs when holding them cold, the same thing could be done for an incubator with the same large room structure and superimposed trays. He developed that conception while working for the Department of Agriculture as a poultry expert during the year 1908. He described in a rough and general way what he considered his invention in a book entitled \u201cThe Dollar Hen,\u201d which was copyrighted in the year 1909. In the early winter months of 1911, he built an incubator along the lines of his conception for Mr. Walter D. Davis, of Brooklyn, and he operated it during the hatching season, in the spring of 1911. The total capacity of this incubator was 6,000 eggs. In this incubator, he used a fan for the circulation of air.\nThis first attempt of Mr. Hastings to reduce his conception to practice need not, however, be developed, as it is not relied on by the Attorney-General. We may pass at once to the Muskogee plant, in respect to which alone prior user is alleged as defeating the validity of the respondents\u2019 patent.\nThe room-sized incubator at Muskogee was erected, as already mentioned, in the late fall of 1911 and the early winter of 1912. It was operated by Hastings during the hatching season of 1912. The construction of that hatchery was explained in detail by Hastings. He filed three diagrammatic drawings of the incubator which he built and operated. They show a series of seven incubating chambers all contained in a single room. At one side of the chambers is a corridor into which they open and from which the eggs enter, the chickens are taken out, etc. A panel door is set up, not hinged but buttoned, in front of each hatching chamber when the operator is not working it. An entry way leads into the corridor from which the chambers are worked. A fan or blower is provided for air circulation through a passageway over the incubating chambers leading to the chamber where the heater is located. The air rising through this chamber, impelled by the pressure from the fan or blower, goes into another large opening at the top of the seven incubating chambers, the air is driven by the impulsion of the blower or fan down through the incubating chambers into a passageway which is merely an opening along the floor. The air is then drawn by suction to the fan or blower from which the circuit is repeated indefinitely. The hatching or incubating chambers are made to contain screen bottom trays with special millwork slides. In each chamber there is room for twenty trays; each tray has a capacity of 250 eggs; which gives 5,000 egg capacity for the chamber, or 35,000 capacity for the whole plant of seven chambers. Although seven incubating chambers are shown, it was one hatching operation all carried on in the same room.\nHastings testified that the diagrams produced by him correctly showed the hatchery actually in use and operated by him at Muskogee. Ventilation, he stated,\nwas definitely assured by the fact that the heater was a gas flame burning in the bottom of a vertical pipe and to support its combustion must draw in and consume a steady stream of air.\nHe made provision for controlling the moisture; and\nthe eggs were turned as the art required; in this case they were turned\nby hand.\nHastings admits he did not distribute the eggs in any particular way; but, being skilled in the art of incubation and being aware of the fact that the eggs, in the early stages of incubation, absorb heat (or they are endothermic), while, in the later stages, they generate heat (or they are exothermic), he knew that the heat or the temperature of the eggs was \u201ca factor of conductivity from the circulating air.\u201d He declares positively that \u201cobserving that, he would naturally place his eggs as they were in the various stages so that he did not have too many eggs in the latter stages of incubation in one general mass.\u201d In his own words: his \u201cfundamental invention had been to equalize the air in a large hatchery by the forced draft or fan system of circulating the air.\u201d He explains the conception of his invention was \u201cto equalize the temperature in a large room\u201d through the means adopted and used by him.\nHastings\u2019 hatchery was open to the public. It was extensively advertised; and there was no attempt to keep secret any detail of construction or operation.\nOf course, it must be admitted that Hastings\u2019 enterprise did not meet with financial success. He attributed that to two particular factors: the low cost at which the hatching was done; and the incidental expense of anew and untried venture.\nBe that as it may, commercial success may be due to many factors. The reasons given by Hastings for the failure in the present case seem plausible; and the evidence here \u201ccannot afford a basis for refusing to give effect to the conclusion necessitated by the facts.\u201d (Guettler v. Canadian International Paper Company[3]). As observed by Parker, J., in Robertson v. Purdey[4]: If I am satisfied that the evidence of prior user is trustworthy evidence, I am not at liberty to disregard it merely because the prior user was not attended with any commercial success, more especially if the want of such success can be otherwise explained.\nIn this case, we have no reason to decide that Hastings\u2019 evidence was not trustworthy. We are not unaware of the principle that evidence of prior user should be subjected to the closest scrutiny and that it should not be accepted without the greatest caution. But Hastings\u2019 description of his apparatus and his story of his method of operation is corroborated by the witness Norman Hickox, who visited the Muskogee hatchery at the time it was in use, took photographs of it, and wrote an article about it early in 1912. The photographs and a photostatic copy of the article are filed in the case. It is reasonably evident from the description contained in that article that Hastings\u2019 conception, in the form testified to by him at the trial, was reduced to practice, as he outlined it, in the fall of 1911; and that his operations at Muskogee carried out the idea of forced circulation of air and of staged incubation.\nTo our mind, this is definitely supported by the language used in the brief on the appeal to the Examiners in Chief, when Hastings\u2019 application for a patent was filed on May 3, 1911, in the United States Patent Office. The conception claimed by Hastings in the course of his evidence was implicitly disclosed in the specification written by himself to accompany his original application (dated April 20, 1911). It is expressly stated in the brief to the Board of Examiners in Chief on appeal (December 20, 1912), where Hastings developed his ideas; and, among other, used the following language:\nThe problem has been to enable the incubating operations to be carried on continuously, if so desired, with eggs at all stages of development, and with all of a vast number of eggs subjected to the same temperature and atmospheric conditions best adapted for the development of the embryo. An incubator such as is contemplated is in sharp contrast to the ordinary incubator in that it is designed to handle simultaneously hundreds of thousands of eggs and, therefore, requires a relatively large chamber for accommodating them.\nThe documentary evidence in the record\u2014evidence of writings and publications contemporaneous with Hastings\u2019 user\u2014constitutes the most satisfactory corroboration of Hastings\u2019 testimony in this respect. In fact, it was believed by the trial judge and it was accepted by him. His judgment proceeds on the assumption that Hastings\u2019 evidence is true; and he found the Smith patent valid only because, in the view he took of the situation, there was some slight difference between Smith\u2019s conception and Hastings\u2019 conception. This difference the learned judge described as consisting \u201cin the manner in which the air is driven and circulated through the egg chambers in the Smith incubator\u201d and \u201cto a lesser degree, in the arrangement of the tilting racks whereby the eggs may be turned conveniently and with a considerable saving of time and labour.\u201d\nBut, of course, the subject-matter of Smith\u2019s alleged invention and the validity in that respect of the patent in suit must of necessity be envisaged within the ambit of the claims accompanying the specification.\nThere are, as we have pointed out, what may be called the method claims and the apparatus claims. Of the former, claim no. 1 has already been set out. There is no material difference between it and the other two method claims. The only change consists in substituting a slightly differently worded definition of the \u201ccurrent of heated air.\u201d In claim no. 1, the phraseology runs thus:\napplying a current of heated air, said current being created by means other than variations of temperature.\nIn no. 2:\napplying a power driven current of heated air in an adjacent chamber through openings into the egg chamber.\nIn no. 3:\napplying a vertically directed current of heated air in an adjacent chamber to circulate in said egg chamber through upper and lower openings between said chambers.\nOtherwise, the three claims are verbatim the same.\nNow, as observed in the judgment appealed from, \u201cthe principle of air circulation in a room to maintain uniformity of temperature is not new.\u201d The invention, if any, cannot consist in the adoption of this principle. In order to reveal the exercise of the inventive faculties and thereby to bear the character of an invention in the patentable sense (Crosley Radio Corporation v. Canadian General Electric Company[5]), it would not be sufficient for Smith\u2019s conception to consist in the adoption of the principle of air circulation in a room for the purpose of maintaining in it uniformity of temperature. It would require a further step, to wit, a novel method of utilizing air circulation involving \u201ca degree of ingenuity * * * which must have been the result of thought and experiment.\u201d (Lord Watson in Thomson v. The American Braided Wire Co:[6]).\nNow, if the claims in the patent in suit be examined, the first characteristic therein to be noticed is that nowhere is there claimed precisely as material any particular method of utilizing the air circulation, except, perhaps, the statement that the current of heated air is \u201ccreated by means other than variations of temperature.\u201d\nThis was pointed out, and, indeed, insisted upon, by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Smith v. Snow[7], where \u201conly so much of the patent as relates to a method for incubation\u201d was involved; and the only question presented was \u201cWhat scope may rightly be given to claim 1 of the patent?\u201d The opinion of the Court was delivered by Mr. Justice Stone; and, in the course of his judgment, the following statements occur:\nMoreover, while the specifications and drawings show a particular arrangement of the eggs and a particular direction of the current, nowhere, in specifications or claim, is it stated either that the direction of the current is material or, what is the equivalent, that the order in which it reaches the eggs is material.\n* * * The specifications and claim both contemplate a continuous circulation of the current of heated air through the chamber, which, regardless of its direction, would continuously operate, by repeated contacts with the eggs in all stages, to equalize the temperature throughout the chamber by carrying heat units from the warmer to the cooler eggs, [p. 12.]\n* * * Such continuous circulation of the air at constant temperature, lower than that of the more advanced eggs and higher than that of the less advanced, tends to produce the equalization of the temperature of the eggs by flow of heat units from the warmer eggs to the cooler, regardless of the direction of the current in the circuit, and regardless of the particular stage of the eggs which it reaches first. * * *\n* * *\nIt is evident that claim 1 does not prescribe that the current of air shall be propelled by any particular means, except that it shall be by means other than variation of temperature, nor does it prescribe that the means of propulsion shall be given any particular location, or that the current of air shall be guided by any particular means or given any particular direction. [p. 13.]\nIn the judgment, these statements in regard to claim 1 are subsequently qualified by pointing out that the other claims of the patent (N.B. Meaning, no doubt, no. 4 of the apparatus claims) speak, in particular, of a power driven fan and of curtains \u201carranged to permit the air to circulate from the bottom of the chamber into the part of the chamber behind the curtains \u201c; but that refers only to the structure of the apparatus. The arrangement, so it is claimed, is only \u201cto permit the air to circulate from the bottom.\u201d Nowhere is it prescribed as an essential integer of the claimed invention that the eggs should be placed in any particular order in the incubator, \u201cor that the propelled current should reach them in any particular order\u201d (P. 14).\nThe conclusion of the United States Supreme Court on that feature of the case was that there was nothing in claim 1\nto restrict the patent to any particular order of arrangement of the eggs or any particular direction or means of control of the current of air, other than its velocity, and nothing to stop the patentee from asserting that the claim is not restricted by such features. [p. 16]\nThis conclusion, with which we agree, is, in our view, decisive in respect to the main ground upon which the learned trial judge based the validity of the respondents\u2019 patent; for what was said of claim 1 by the United States Supreme Court is also true of the other claims; and it follows that, having regard to Milo Hastings\u2019 operations and prior public use in Muskogee, as established in the present case, Smith\u2019s claims in the patent in suit are obviously too wide.\nIn Smith v. Snow[8], claim no. 1 was held valid by the Supreme Court of the United States; but it was distinctly stated that it was upheld on the ground that Smith \u201cwas the first to apply mechanically circulated currents of air to eggs * * * arranged * * * in staged incubation.\u201d It was said that he had \u201cthus solved the major problem of artificial incubation\u201d by replacing \u201cthe old type of incubator, with eggs arranged at a single level, all in a single stage of incubation.\u201d But it was also stated that the question whether \u201cit was invention [was] not seriously disputed here\u201d and \u201cthat the method employed in the Smith type of incubator was novel and revolutionary in the industry [was] not challenged.\u201d\nThis was as between Samuel B. Smith and E. H. Snow in the particular case presented to the Supreme Court of the United States. In that case, Hastings was not a witness, nor was there any evidence of what his prior use had been. The judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States carry the greatest weight and are entitled to the greatest respect. But because the record now before us is so widely different from the record in Smith v. Snow[9], we feel that the conclusion reached by us must also be different. Indeed, and more particularly in view of the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Stone on behalf of the Court, we are led to believe that had the prior public use of the patented method and knowledge thereof by Milo Hastings been adduced in evidence in the Snow case, the result would have been different.\nWe may add that our view in that respect is shared by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Smith v. Hall[10], which is the most recent judgment on the questions at issue and where it is stated:\nThis is the first time the prior uses at the Davis Place and at Muskogee have been so fully presented and substantiated.\nOn the record now before the court, it is impossible to agree that Smith\u2019s discovery was \u201cnot known or used by others in this country before his invention or discovery thereof.\u201d\nWhat was said of the situation in the United States in the latter judgment equally applies to Canada as the law stood at the time when the disputed patent was issued.\nWhat are, after all, the essential features of the invention contended for by Smith as he has himself expressed them in his claims:\n(1) A method of hatching a plurality of eggs,\n(2) By arranging them at different levels,\n(3) In a closed chamber;\n(4) The chamber having restricted openings of sufficient capacity for the escape of foul air without undue loss of moisture; and\n(5) Applying a current of heated air;\n(6) Said current being created by means other than variations of temperature (or\u2014claim 2\u2014\u201cpower driven in an adjacent chamber through openings into the egg chamber\u201d; or\u2014claim 3\u2014\u201cbeing vertically directed in an adjacent chamber to circulate in the egg chamber through upper and lower openings between said chambers\u201d);\n(7) The current of air being of sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse and maintain the air throughout the chamber with substantially the same temperature; (8) Whereby the air will be vitalized (i.e., a process of ventilation),\n(9) The moisture conserved,\n(10) And the units of heat will be carried from the eggs in the more advanced stages of incubation to those in a less advanced stage for the purpose specified.\nWe have the large capacity, the eggs at different levels in a closed chamber, the circulation of air created by means other than variation of temperature (the fan or the blower), the ventilation, the moisture and the staged incubation\u2014 all present in Hastings\u2019 prior use and venture and all reading into the claims as they were expressed and made by Smith. We are not asking ourselves for the present whether there were divergences between Hastings\u2019 public use and practice and Smith\u2019s actual method. We are taking Smith\u2019s method as he has claimed it and we are forced to the conclusion that undoubtedly, as expressed, the claims are too wide and the greater part of them, if not all, was already anticipated and precluded by Hastings\u2019 public use.\nSo far as the apparatus claims are concerned, it is doubtful if, standing alone and independently of the prior knowledge and prior user, they would have been regarded as sufficient in themselves to support a grant of letters patent. But we would say that upon the evidence in this case we do not find it possible to declare that the advance, if any, can be regarded as good and sufficient subject-matter of a patent. The closed chamber, the corridor provided with air distributing space in its upper portion, the power driven fan, the partition between the air distributing spaces and the egg chambers, the passageways, the egg trays with mesh bottoms removably mounted upon racks and means to heat the air circulating through the adjacent chamber, were all present in Hastings\u2019 user and method. No particular claim is made by Smith for \u201cthe arrangement of the tilting racks\u201d which the learned trial judge found subject-matter to a lesser degree than the main point concerning the method of utilizing \u201cthe air driven and circulated through the egg chambers in the Smith incubator.\u201d\nAny difference that might exist between the Smith structure and the Hastings structure consists only in mechanical details. So far so that it would seem to us that had Hastings been successful in securing a patent for his structure as described in the evidence in this case, claims 4 and 5 of Smith\u2019s patent would be regarded as infringements. And, of course, the reverse conclusion follows that Smith\u2019s claims 4 and 5, coming, as they do, several years after it, are defeated by Hastings\u2019 prior public use.\nA fortiori, claims nos. 4 and 5 ought to be regarded as invalid and void as embracing more than Smith could claim as new; and, indeed, as claiming something which, having regard to the prior public use of Hastings, did not amount to an invention in the pertinent sense.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed, with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court of Canada. The information of the Attorney-General of Canada shall be maintained and there will be a declaration that the letters patent no. 217,777 issued to Samuel B. Smith, on the 18th day of April, 1922, are invalid and void and that the same are cancelled and set aside.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. G.

Smith Incubator Co. et al., ante, p., and, so far as it applied, the evidence in that case was made part of the evidence in the present case.\nHeld: The issue as to the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s patent must follow the decision, against the validity of the patent, in The King v. Smith Incubator Co. et al., supra, and on this ground the plaintiff\u2019s appeal (from the judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing the action on the ground of no infringement) must be dismissed. The claims at the end of the specification in a patent must be regarded as definitely determining the scope of the patent monopoly, having regard to the due and proper construction of the expressions they contain. They must be construed in the light of the rest of the specification; that is to say, the specification must be considered in order to assist in comprehending and construing the meaning\u2014and possibly the special meaning\u2014in which the words or the expressions contained in the claims are used; but, on the issue either of validity or of infringement, the criterion must be determined according to the scope of the monopoly as expressed in the claims (though it is not necessary, to justify a holding of infringement, that the infringing article be found identically, or in every respect, the same as the patented article; it is sufficient if the infringer has borrowed the substance or spirit of the invention as it can be ascertained from the claims, except in details which could be varied without detriment to the successful working of it).\nDiscussion by Duff C.J. with regard to pertinent principles as to the requisites of a specification, the construction of claims, what constitutes the essence of infringement, and grounds on which a plaintiff in an action for alleged infringement may fail, having regard to the claims or to the specification as a whole. References to authorities. It was pointed out that, in construing and applying judgments on such subjects, it is important that the judgment be read as a whole, and, still more, that it be read in light of the issues of fact and questions of law to which the judge is addressing himself.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing its action. The action was for a declaration, injunction, etc., and damages for alleged infringement of plaintiff\u2019s rights under certain letters patent for alleged new and useful improvements in incubators. Angers J. dismissed the action on the ground that there was no infringement. By the judgment now reported, this Court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal on the ground of invalidity of the patent, in accordance with its decision in The King v. The Smith Incubator Co. et al.[2] dealing with the same patent.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the appellant.\nE. G. Gowling for the respondent.\nDuff C.J.\u2014I am in complete agreement with Mr. Justice Rinfret in his reasons for judgment in The King v. Smith Incubator Co.2 and in the present appeal in which I have formally concurred, as well as with those of Mr. Justice Davis in B.V.D. Co. Ltd. v. Canadian Celanese, Ltd.[3], with which I have also formally concurred; but, having regard to the judgment of the learned trial judge now under review, as well as to some of the observations in the facturas of the appellants and the respondent in the same case, I think it advisable to say something touching upon the pertinent principles in respect of the construction of the claims as well as upon what constitutes the essence of infringement; although what I have to say on the former topic more fully appears in the judgments delivered by Mr. Justice Rinfret and Mr. Justice Davis in behalf of the Court in the above-mentioned appeals.\nFirst of all, it is convenient to cite some passages from Hindmarch on Patents (Edition 1846), (p. *157):\nThe patentee is required to enrol a specification of his invention, because the public is entitled to know what the patent has been granted for, what they are prohibited from doing during the existence of the patent privilege, and what they are to become entitled to when it expires, as the consideration for the grant which has been made by the Crown on their behalf.\nHe then proceeds to enlarge on this general statement thus:\nThe vague description of an invention in the title of it contained in a patent, gives little if any notice to the public of the real nature of the manufacture they are prohibited from using, and unless some specific information were to be given to persons respecting what they are commanded by the patent to refrain from doing, they could not be punished for any violation of the patent right committed in ignorance of its nature and extent.\nWhenever therefore an action is brought against a party for infringing a patent, in order to ascertain whether he is guilty of an infringement or not, it is necessary to ascertain whether the thing which is complained of as a contravention of the patent, is really or substantially described in the patentee\u2019s specification, as the whole or part of the invention for which the patent was granted. And if the specification does not sufficiently describe some art of manufacturing which is substantially the same as that used by the party charged with the infringement, no action can be maintained against him for such an alleged violation of the patent privilege.\nIn the case of Morgan v. Seaward, Mr. Baron Alderson[4] held that the patentee ought to state in his specification the precise way of doing every thing which is part of his invention; and that if any thing cannot be completely done by following the specification, then a person will not infringe the patent by doing it.\nAgain the author proceeds at page *161:\n2. The patentee must in his specification make a full and complete disclosure of the nature of his invention, and of the manner in which it is to be performed.\n* * *\nIn considering the requisites of a specification, it is necessary to have regard not only to the words of the proviso in the patent, but also to the object with which a specification is required, and which has already been mentioned, viz: the furnishing of sufficient and certain information to the public respecting what they are prohibited from doing whilst the privilege continues, and what they will he enabled to do after it is expired. [p. *159]\n* * *\n6. When an inventor applies for his patent, he describes the nature of his invention in general terms, and it is to be presumed, in the absence of any thing to show the contrary, that he has contracted to give the public the whole of his discovery, and all his knowledge on the subject, as the consideration for the privilege granted to him by the Crown. It is indeed absolutely essential for the protection of the public, that this rule should be adopted and acted upon, for patentees would otherwise be enabled to commit great frauds, by concealing the most important parts of their inventions.\nThe specification must therefore describe the invention according to the best of the patentee\u2019s knowledge, [pp. *165-6.]\nSubject to one observation, I think, these passages are entirely in accord with the law under the modern statutes. The observation (which has no relevancy to the present appeal) is this: the words of the author at page *157 do not, in terms at all events, make allowance for cases in which precisely detailed instructions in relation to the manner in which the invention is to be put into effect, touching, for example, proportions and dimensions, might unduly limit the scope of the protection to which the patentee is entitled and where the information that would be given by such precise instructions would, through his own skill and knowledge be at the command of a competent practitioner in the art with which the invention is concerned, without the necessity of exercising invention (British Thomson-Houston Co. Ld. v. Corona Lamp Works Ld.[5]).\nWhile the duties set forth in these passages of Hind-march on Patents still rest upon patentees, a further duty is imposed upon them by the modern statutes. Section 14 (1) of the Canadian Act is in these terms:\n14. (1) The specification shall\n(a) correctly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor;\n(b) set forth clearly the various steps in a process, or the method of constructing, making or compounding, a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter;\n(c) end with a claim or claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege.\nI think the general effect of this subsection is stated by Lord Halsbury, who himself was the author of the treatise on \u201cPatents\u201d in the first edition of Halbury\u2019s Laws of England, in paragraph 338 of that treatise in these words:\n338. In order that the public may have sufficient and certain information respecting what they are prohibited from doing whilst the privilege continues, the patentee must particularly describe and ascertain the nature of his invention. In order that, after the privilege is expired, the public may be enabled to do what the patentee has invented, he must particularly describe and ascertain the manner in which the same is to be performed; and the ambit of his invention must be circumscribed by definite claims.\nBut there is something more to be said about the effect of clause (c) in the subsection of the Patent Act quoted above. To use Lord Halsbury\u2019s language, that clause requires that the ambit of the invention must be circumscribed by a claim or claims at the end of the specification. It is to these claims that the public are entitled to look in order to ascertain the limits of the monopoly granted to the patentee, and unless these limits are prescribed distinctly in the claims themselves, without unnecessary ambiguity, vagueness or obscurity, having regard to the nature of the subject-matter, the patentee can found no title to relief upon his patent in respect of any alleged infringement; nor can he, assuming that the claims are not objectionable on the ground of ambiguity, vagueness or obscurity, obtain any title to relief in respect of any act which does not infringe the monopoly marked out by the claims when properly read. Where, moreover, as in the two cases mentioned at the outset, a claim so read embraces matter which is old in the sense of the patent law, the claim is invalid.\nIt is now settled law that, for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the claims, the language in which they are expressed must be read in light of the specification as a whole, but it is by the effect of the language employed in the claims themselves, interpreted with such aid as may properly be derived from the other parts of the specification, that the scope of the monopoly is to be determined. This, I think, is best put in a passage at the end of Lord Lore-burn\u2019s judgment in Ingersoll Sergeant Drill Co. v. Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Co. Ld.[6]. There is a passage at the beginning of the judgment which is well known and which I do not quote, but the following passage, which is quoted in the complete statement of authorities on this point by Mr. Justice Davis, indicates very clearly the manner in which the principle was applied:\nAccording to Mr. Bousfield, the piston means the piston with the circumferential groove and projecting stem described on page 3 of the specification, or as altered in accordance therewith. The piston chamber also, it seems, means one complying with the description on page 2 of the specification. So as regards the passages, because the specification at page 4 describes the two passages as opening into the piston chamber at about the same point in its length, the claim must also, we are told, be read as conveying that they are to be at about the same point. Again, because, at page 6, the specification informs us that the rearward movement of the piston closes both the passages, we are to read that also into the claim. And the reason urged for so qualifying the language of the claim is that these things are essential to the success of the plaintiffs\u2019 hammer as a working hammer. That would have been a very good reason for inserting them expressly or by plain reference in the claim had it been thought safe or wise to do so, but is no reason at all for reading them into the claim when they are not there. One or two more glosses are sought to be added by Mr. Bousfield, but they are all on the same footing and need not further be discussed.\nMr. Walter put it a little differently. He attributed a very special meaning to the words \u201cindependently of the piston.\u201d and said they were put in to show that no part of the live air passage is to be in the piston, meaning by the live air passage the whole distance from the source of supply to the valve. All I can say of this is that I can extract nothing of the kind out of the words used, even when illuminated by the rest of the specification.\nAccordingly it comes to this. We are asked to construe the claim with reference to the specification, not in order to understand what the former says, but to make it say things which in fact it does not say at all.\nIf such a process were admitted all certainty would vanish. No one in construing a claim would know how far he could rely on the words used or how to pick from the specification the qualifying phrases. Patents are not unconditional grants of a monopoly. The patentee must, in return for his privilege, say plainly what is the invention for which he asks protection, so that others may learn that and its limits. And if he chooses separately to claim a subordinate invention he must make plain the metes and bounds of that also. I think the patentee has made it plain in claim 13, if it be fairly construed, and there is no novelty if the interpretation be as I think it is.\nLord Haldane\u2019s judgment in British Thomson-Houston Co. Ld. v. Corona Lamp Works Ld. (supra)[7] at page 67, affords an illustration of the manner in which expressions used in the claim may be interpreted by reference to the body of the specification. Western Electric Co. Inc. v. Baldwin International Radio of Canada[8] is another case in which the description in the body of the specification of the invention provided a lexicon interpreting the phrases in the claim. But, while the plaintiff in an action for infringement must fail unless he can prove an invasion of the monopoly delimited by the claim so construed, it is equally true that he may fail on the broad ground that the defendant has not taken any part of any invention in respect of which the specification \u201cfully describes the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor,\u201d or any \u201cprocess\u201d of which the specification \u201csets forth clearly the various steps,\u201d or any \u201cmachine, manufacture, or composition of matter\u201d of which the specification \u201csets forth clearly * * * the method of constructing, making or compounding.\u201d That such things shall be \u201ccorrectly and fully\u201d described or \u201cset forth clearly,\u201d as the case may be, is just as essential, by force of clauses (a) and (b), to enable the patentee to protect himself against alleged infringements as is compliance with clause (c) which relates to claims only.\nThe court, called upon to deal with the issues in an action for infringement, may find it quite unnecessary to apply itself to the construction of the claims for the purpose of ascertaining the limits of the monopoly defined by the claims, because it is plain on the face of the specification as a whole that, on any construction of the claims, the defendant has not taken any part of any invention properly described and set forth pursuant to the requirements of section 14.\nThen, the defendant may attack the specification on the ground that the monopoly delimited in the claims relates to an invention which, on the specification as a whole, is not the thing invented by the patentee. He may say that though the patentee has described in the body of his specification an invention and the manner of its working, yet his claim or claims relate to a different invention which is not fully described and set forth in the specification as a whole or in any part of it within the meaning of section 14. Obviously, the plaintiff may fail on the ground, either that the patent is invalid because of non-observance of the conditions of section 14, or that the alleged infringement does not invade the monopoly defined, or because the defendant has not taken any part of the only invention fully set forth and described in the specification, in compliance with section 14. The action may be defeated on (inter alia) any one of these grounds, and the tribunal, which is not under any obligation to write a treatise upon, or an exposition of, patent law or of any branch of patent law, will, in the ordinary course, confine itself to a discussion of the particular ground upon which it is proceeding. Hence, the importance, in construing and applying judgments on such subjects, of reading the judgment as a whole, and, still more, of reading the judgment in light of the issues of fact and questions of law to which the judge is addressing himself.\nIt may be that the statutory provision requiring the definition of the ambit of the monopoly claimed to be given in claims at the end of the specification has, in greater or less degree, affected in practice the application of some doctrines of patent law, such as the doctrine of mechanical equivalents and, indeed, the application of the general principle that infringement consists in taking the substance of the plaintiff\u2019s invention; but there is no good ground for a conclusion that these doctrines have been abrogated. Electrolier Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Dominion Manufacturers Ltd.[9] is a recent illustration of the proper application of the rule that, where the essence of the invention is taken, an action for infringement is not defeated by reason of the fact that the infringing structure discloses some \u201csmall variation in unimportant features or in nonessential elements.\u201d\nRinfret J. (All other members of the Court concurring)\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Angers, in the Exchequer Court of Canada, dated the 29th day of January, 1936, dismissing the appellant\u2019s action for an injunction and damages for the infringement of its patent no. 217,777. The patent involved is the same as was considered in the judgment of this Court in the case of His Majesty the King v. Smith Incubator Company[10] delivered at the same time as the present judgment.\nSo far as it applied, the whole of the evidence in the former case was made part of the evidence in the present case. The issue in respect of the validity of the appellant\u2019s patent must, therefore, follow the decision in The King v. Smith Incubator Company[11].\nIn his judgment, the learned trial judge in this case did not pass upon the validity of the patent already upheld by him in the judgment in the other case. But, having formally held that\nthe only element of novelty in the Smith patent, as set forth in the [former] case, is the method of circulating the hot air in the incubator and the method of turning the eggs periodically during the incubation process,\nhe found that the method in this respect used by the defendant was quite different; and, accordingly, he failed to see any infringement by the respondent.\nThe Smith patent having been held invalid by our judgment11, delivered upon the information of the Attorney-General of Canada, it becomes unnecessary for us to pass upon the issue of infringement. It should only be stated that the respondent Sailing himself holds a patent covering his incubator (Canadian Patent no. 310,061); and, had there been occasion for it, we would not have been prepared to decide that his patent infringes that of the appellant.\nHowever, for the reasons already stated in The King v. Smith Incubator Company11, patent no. 217,777 must be declared invalid and void and must be set aside. As the patent is the only ground upon which the appellant can claim infringement, the foundation for his action is thereby removed; and we must decide, therefore, that the action was rightly dismissed by the learned trial judge.\nIn view of this result, there remains no longer any necessity of discussing at length the appellant\u2019s contention that:\nThere are two separate lines of authority suggesting what are * * * mutually inconsistent attitudes towards * * * the definition of the scope of a patent monopoly in the patent claims.\nThe appellant proceeds:\nAccording to one of these it is proper to consider what is \u201cthe pith and substance\u201d or the \u201cspirit\u201d of the invention and to give effect to the patent accordingly. The other is to regard the claims as definitely determining the scope of the monopoly which the patent purports to grant and to give or refuse them effect according to the expressions they contain when these expressions are properly construed and their meaning determined.\nIn our view, the rule is that the claims must be regarded as definitely determining the scope of the monopoly, having regard to the due and proper construction of the expressions they contain. Such was the direction given and the rule followed by this Court in Mailman v. Gillette[12]; Gillette v. Pal[13]; Burt v. Autographic[14]; and Schweyer v. New York Central[15]. And, notwithstanding the suggestion to the contrary, such was also the rule applied in Electrolier v. Dominion Manufacturers[16],\nAs often observed, of course, the claims must be construed in the light of the rest of the specification; and that is to say, that the specification must be considered in order to assist in comprehending and construing the meaning\u2014and possibly the special meaning\u2014in which the words or the expressions contained in the claims are used (Ingersoil v. Consolidated[17]). But, as was said in the Electrolier case[18],\ninfringement is a matter depending on the construction of the claims, for there it is that the inventor is required to state \u201cthe things or combinations * * * in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege.\u201d\nGenerally speaking, actions for infringement are met with two distinct defences: one being that the plaintiff\u2019s patent is invalid; the other being that, whether the plaintiff\u2019s patent is invalid or not, the defendant does not infringe. And it may be that, to borrow the words of Frost (Patent Law and Practice, 4th Ed., Vol. 1, p. 349), \u201cthe criterion of novelty and infringement in this respect are not the same.\u201d But, in each case, the criterion must be determined according to the scope of the monopoly as expressed in the claims; although it is not necessary, to justify a holding of infringement, that the infringing article should be found identically, or in every respect, the same as the plaintiff\u2019s patented article. It is sufficient if the infringer has borrowed the substance or spirit of the invention as it can be ascertained from the claims, except in details which could be varied without detriment to the successful working of it.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Riddell & Murray.\n[1] A note thereof is in [1936] Ex.

Bayliss, [1937] S.C.R. 261\nDate: 1937-02-02\nCanadian National Steamships (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nWilliam Bayliss (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1936: November 4; 1937: February 2.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nShipping\u2014Damage to goods\u2014Peril of the sea\u2014Negligence\u2014Fault of carrier or of his agent or servant\u2014Burden of proof\u2014Barbados Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1926\u2014Clause q, rule 2, article 3 of the schedule of the Act.\nUpon an action against a carrier for damages to goods shipped under bills of lading which specifically stated that the vessel should not be liable for damage caused by perils of the sea, the grounds of defence were, first that, the carrier having established at the trial a prima facie case of loss by a peril of the sea, the burden of proving negligence consequently rested on the respondent, and secondly, that the carrier had discharged the burden of proof resting on him under clause q, rule 2, article 3 of the schedule of the Barbados Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1926, which was made applicable to the contract.\nHeld that, the issue raised by the first ground being an issue of fact, it was incumbent upon the carrier to acquit himself of the onus of showing that the weather encountered during the voyage was the cause of the damage and that it was of such a nature that the danger of damage to the cargo arising from it could not have been foreseen or guarded against as one of the probable incidents of the voyage\u2014In this case, the concurrent findings of fact, on that issue, by the trial and appellate courts in favour of the respondent must stand.\nHeld, also, that under clause q, rule 2, article 3 the burden rests upon the carrier to show that neither the actual fault nor the privity of the carrier, nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, contributed to the loss or the damage; and the carrier does not acquit himself of this onus by showing that he has employed competent stevedores to stow the damaged cargo, or that proper directions as to the stowage of the cargo have been given.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, E. M. McDougall J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages for $4,549.03.\nOn the 25th February, 1931, the ss. Lady Drake, a vessel belonging to the appellant company, received at Barbados, in the British West Indies, a shipment of molasses in puncheons, barrels and half-barrels for delivery at the port of Saint John, New Brunswick. The vessel called at several intermediate points, among others, Hamilton, Bermuda, where she arrived on the 4th of March, after having passed through some heavy weather. The master caused the shipment of molasses which had been placed in no. 2 hold, to be inspected, when everything was found to be in satisfactory condition. Leaving Hamilton on the afternoon of the same day, with the weather much as it had been upon arrival, the vessel ran into somewhat heavier weather during the night, and in the early morning of the 5th March. At 7.30 on that morning, it was discovered that the barrels and puncheons of molasses had been completely broken up, and the hold was awash with a mass of bulk molasses, the barrel staves floating on the surface. The respondent, on the failure of the appellant company to deliver the molasses in accordance with the contract of carriage, instituted the present action, claiming the sum of $4,549.03, which the parties agreed represent the extent of the damage.\nI. C. Rand K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Languedoc K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The appeal is concerned with the judgment recovered by the respondent against the appellants in the Superior Court of the district of Montreal for damages to molasses shipped on February 26, 1931, in the steamship Lady Drake from Barbados for delivery at Saint John, New Brunswick, and the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench affirming it. The molasses damaged was part of five separate consignments shipped by Messrs. Jones & Swan of Barbados and stowed in no. 2 hold of the vessel as part of an aggregate quantity of 268 puncheons, 238 barrels and 80 half-barrels.\nThe vessel left Hamilton, Bermuda, at 1.30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 4th of March, 1931, and met with heavy weather. On the morning of March 5th, about 7.30, it was discovered that no. 2 hold was virtually awash with molasses and floating barrel staves.\nThe goods were shipped under bills of lading which specifically stated that the vessel should not be liable for damage caused by perils of the sea. The bills of lading contained a term importing the provisions of the Barbados Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1926. The appellants in this court contended that they were entitled to judgment on the grounds, first, that the damage was attributable to a peril of the sea, and, second, that the appellants had discharged the burden of proof resting on them under clause q, rule 2, article 3 of the schedule of the Act. It will be convenient to deal with these contentions in the order in which I have stated them.\nCounsel for the appellant accepted the definition of \u201cperils of the sea\u201d given in the last edition of Scrutton on Charter Parties (p. 261) as follows:\nAny damage to the goods carried, by sea-water, storms, collision, stranding, or other perils peculiar to the sea or to a ship at sea, which could not be foreseen and guarded against by the shipowner or his servants as necessary or probable incidents of the adventure.\nHis main contention was that the appellants having established at the trial a prima facie case of loss by a peril of the sea within this definition, the burden of proving negligence consequently rested on the respondent on the authority of The Glendarroch[1]. At the trial the defence raised under this head was that the heavy seas that were encountered after leaving Hamilton and before the discovery of the loss and damage on the following morning were of such a character as to bring the damage within the words quoted above, that is to say,\ndamage caused by * * * storms * * * or other perils peculiar to the sea or to a ship at sea which could not be foreseen and guarded against by the ship owner or his servants as necessary or probable incidents of the adventure.\nThe issue raised by this defence was, of course, an issue of fact and it was incumbent upon the appellants to acquit themselves of the onus of showing that the weather encountered was the cause of the damage and that it was of such a nature that the danger of damage to the cargo arising from it could not have been foreseen or guarded against as one of the probable incidents of the voyage. The trial judge and the Court of King\u2019s Bench have unanimously held that this issue must be decided against the appellants on the ground that, upon the evidence, the proper conclusion is that the dangers arising from such weather as the ship encountered could be guarded against and that they ought to have been foreseen. There is no satisfactory reason for impeaching these concurrent findings of fact and they must, therefore, stand. They constitute a complete answer to the contention that the appellants have brought themselves within the exception \u201cperils of the sea.\u201d\nThe contention founded upon clause q, rule 2, article 3, remains to be dealt with. That clause is in the following words:\nAny other cause arising without the actual fault or privity of the carrier, or without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier, nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.\nThe judges below have unanimously held that the burden of proof under this clause has not been discharged. It was very vigourously urged by counsel on behalf of the appellants that he had established a prima facie case of absence of negligence by proving proper stowage. But it will be observed that the burden resting upon the carrier under this clause is a very heavy one. He has to show that neither the actual fault nor the privity of the carrier, nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or the damage. The carrier does not acquit himself of this onus by showing that he has employed competent stevedores to stow the damaged cargo, or that proper directions as to the stowage of the cargo have been given; and, if the fact is, as in this case it has been found, that no peril was encountered that could not have been provided against by proper care, the fact that the puncheons and barrels containing this cargo of molasses in no. 2 hold were broken is a fact concerning which the courts below, as judges of fact, necessarily asked themselves the question: How is this to be accounted for? I agree with the courts below in thinking that the more reasonable hypothesis, in all the circumstances, is that in this particular hold there was some inattention to precautions which would, it is not unreasonable to consider, have, probably, had the effect of preventing the loss.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beauregard, Phillimore & St. Germain.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Erroil Languedoc.\n[1] [1894] Prob. 226.\n"}

The defendant pleaded inter alia that the plaintiffs combined and conspired together to prevent defendant from obtaining copies of the plans in question. Plaintiffs applied to have struck out those paragraphs of the statement of defence relating to the alleged combine and conspiracy; and the Exchequer Court of Canada granted such application. The defendant also alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s right of action, as to most of the works upon which the action was brought, had been barred by section 24 of the Copyright Act and the Exchequer Court of Canada held that such section was applicable to claims made under section 21 of the Act for the recovery of possession or in respect of conversion.\nHeld, reversing the first part of the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1937] Ex. C.R. 15), that this Court should not be called upon, on the pleadings as they stand, to say whether or not the allegations in the above-mentioned paragraphs would be sufficient to justify the court in withholding an injunction and that the matter in dispute should be referred back to trial. The question whether a court will grant an injunction or not is a question of discretion, but limited; every threatened violation of a proprietary right which, if it were committed, would entitle the party injured to an action at law, entitles him, prima facie, to an injunction, and the onus is upon the defendant of rebutting such presumption by showing that damages will be adequate compensation to the plaintiff for the wrong done him or that on some other ground he is not entitled to equitable relief. In considering whether such grounds exist for refusing such relief in this case, the trial court ought to have regard to the conduct of the plaintiffs and especially to the fact, if such fact were established, that the application for the injunction was merely one step in the prosecution of a scheme in which the plaintiffs had combined to further some illegal object injurious to the defendant.\nHeld, also, affirming the second part of the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that, without expressing any opinion on the question whether section 24 of the Copyright Act would in all cases affect a claim under section 21, inasmuch as the language of section 24 cannot be said to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive meaning precluding its application to claims under section 21 of the character hereinafter mentioned, there is reasonable ground for deciding that such application was within the probable intention of Parliament. The words \u201cin respect of infringement of copyright\u201d in section 21 are capable of a construction by which the phrase would extend to a claim under such section, as in the present case, where the infringing copy with which the claim is concerned is a copy the making and importing of which constituted infringement in the pertinent sense.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], on questions of law stated for determination in advance of the trial of the action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and H. Cassels K.C. for the defendant, appellant and respondent.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. and W. D. Herridge K.C. for the plaintiffs, respondents and appellants.\nW. B. Scott K.C. for the intervenants.\nDuff C.J.\u2014In addition to the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Hudson on behalf of the Court, it is, perhaps, advisable that I should add a word on the question of jurisdiction.\nNo objection was taken to the jurisdiction by the respondents in either appeal and, during the course of the argument, it was stated from the bench that, notwithstanding the unfortunate wording of section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act, the judgments appealed from might be considered as judgments in the nature of a judgment on demurrer and the appeals proceeded accordingly. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014This action was brought by the plaintiffs in the Exchequer Court of Canada, alleging among other things an infringement of copyright by the defendant and claiming an injunction, damages and delivery up of infringing reproductions. The defendant admitted that it had obtained and used reproductions of certain of the documents of the kind referred to in the statement of claim but denied that the plaintiffs had any copyright in them. It also alleged that the plaintiffs\u2019 right of action, if any, had been lost by laches and acquiescence and that it was in any event barred as to most of the works upon which the action was brought by section 24 of the Copyright Act or alternatively by certain provincial statutes of limitation. It also pleaded that the plaintiffs were disentitled to succeed on the ground that they had combined and conspired together to prevent the defendant from competing with the plaintiffs in the business of fire insurance and that the course they had pursued for some twenty-five years, particularly in relation to certain agreements with the original holders of the copyright in question, and certain legal proceedings including the present action, had been adopted in order to attain the object of such conspiracy and combination. The defendant invokes section 498, of the Criminal Code and the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act, both of which specifically refer to conspiracies and combines in respect of insurance[2]. The plaintiffs moved to strike out the allegation with respect to conspiracy and on the return of this motion this question and also a question as to the application of the statutes of limitation pleaded by defendant with respect to infringing documents were directed to be heard as preliminary questions of law.\nThe first of these questions was answered by the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada in favour of the plaintiffs and the second in favour of the defendant. Both parties appeal to this court.\nThe first question submitted was\u2014\nWhether the plaintiffs would be disentitled to succeed in this action if the defendant established the allegations contained in paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22 and 23 of the statement of defence which relate to acts done by the plaintiffs or some of them in combination. The plaintiffs seek the aid of the court to protect a property right, but the remedy sought is in part an equitable one, i.e. an injunction.\nThe law governing the court in granting or refusing an injunction is correctly stated in Ashburner\u2019s Principles of Equity (2nd Ed. 1933), page 343:\nWhere the court has jurisdiction to grant an injunction, the question whether it will grant it or not is a question of discretion. It is not bound to grant an injunction merely because A threatens and intends to violate a legal right of B. But the tendency of the decisions in recent years is to limit the discretion of the court, and it may be laid down that every threatened violation of a proprietary right which, if it were committed, would entitle the party injured to an action at law, entitles him, prima facie, to an injunction, and the onus is upon the defendant of rebutting the presumption in favour of an injunction, by showing that damages will be an adequate compensation to the plaintiff for the wrong done him, or that on some other ground he is not entitled to equitable relief.\nIn considering whether such grounds exist for refusing this relief, the court would, unquestionably, have regard to the conduct of the plaintiffs and, especially to the fact, if such fact were established, that the application for the injunction was merely one step in the prosecution of a scheme in which the plaintiffs had combined to further some illegal object injurious to the defendant. Taking this view, I do not think that this court should be called upon at the present time to say whether or not the allegations in the above-mentioned paragraphs of the statement of defence would be sufficient to justify the court in withholding an injunction. The matter should be referred back to trial without expressing at present any opinion one way or the other as to the sufficiency of the allegations in the statement of defence.\nThis course was adopted by the Privy Council in dismissing an appeal from the decision of this court in the case of McLean v. The King[3]. The decision of the Privy Council is not reported but was given on the 10th July, 1908. The judgment delivered by Lord Loreburn, L.C., was as follows:\nThe question in this appeal arises on a demurrer. If, on any reasonable construction of the respondent\u2019s petition of right, a cause of action could be proved, then the respondent (the suppliant) would be entitled to succeed. It will be for the learned judge who hears the case, when the facts have been proved, to decide whether a cause of action has or has not arisen, but it is not for their Lordships to express an opinion beforehand, on the pleadings as they stand. Accordingly their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty to dismiss this appeal. In accordance with the undertaking given on behalf of the Attorney-General for Canada when special leave to appeal was granted, the appellant will pay the respondent\u2019s costs of the appeal as between solicitor and client.\nThe appeal in respect of the first question should, therefore, be allowed and the order of the learned President should be set aside\u2014with costs in the cause.\nThe second question submitted was\u2014\nWhether any of the statutory provisions set up in paragraph 20 of the statement of defence constitute a bar to the plaintiffs\u2019 action in respect of any of the documents referred to in the schedules to the statement of defence and if any of them constitute such a bar, which of them do so, and to which of the remedies prayed by the plaintiffs do they respectively apply.\nThe learned President gave only a partial answer to this question, holding that section 24 of the Copyright Act was applicable to claims made under section 21 for the recovery of possession or in respect of conversion. From this decision the plaintiffs appealed. Section 21 reads as follows:\n21. All infringing copies of any work in which copyright subsists, or of any substantial part thereof, and all plates used or intended to be used for the production of such infringing copies, shall be deemed to be the property of the owner of the copyright, who accordingly may take proceedings for the recovery of the possession thereof or in respect of the conversion thereof.\nand section 24 as follows:\n24. An action in respect of infringement of copyright shall not be commenced after the expiration of three years next after the infringement.\nThese sections are part of a group of sections in the Act under the heading of \u201cCivil Remedies,\u201d section 24 being at the end of this group. There is in the Act no other limitation or prescription in respect to actions arising thereunder.\nIt would appear to be unnecessary to express any opinion on the question whether section 24 of the Copyright Act, which is a reproduction of section 10 of the English Act, would, apart from the considerations about to be mentioned, affect a claim under section 21 of the Canadian Act, which is section 7 of the English Act.\nThe words \u201cin respect of infringement of copyright,\u201d although by no means an apt description of a claim made under section 21, are capable of a construction by which the phrase would extend to a claim under such section if the infringing copy with which the claim is concerned is a copy the making and importing of which constituted infringement in the pertinent sense.\nThe Canadian statute must be assumed to contemplate proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada for the purpose of enforcing the rights created by section 21 as well as proceedings in provincial courts. This circumstance suggests various considerations which would appear to be of no inconsiderable weight. First of all, it would seem to be improbable that Parliament contemplated a uniform period of limitation throughout Canada in respect of actions admittedly falling within section 24 and differing periods of limitation as regards claims asserted in the provincial courts under section 21. Then, there is a great practical difficulty if section 24 has no application to claims under section 21. It is at least plausibly debatable whether such proceedings under the statute would be within the field of operation of provincial statutes of limitation; and as regards one of the provinces, especially having regard to the terms of the French version, it is at least arguable whether the period of prescription would not be thirty years.\nWe think we are entitled to assume that the Parliament was not entirely oblivious to these considerations and, as the language of section 24 cannot be said to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive meaning precluding its application to claims under section 21 of the character mentioned, there would appear to be reasonable ground for holding that such application was within the probable intention of Parliament.\nThe appeal in respect of the second question should be dismissed with costs. There will be no costs to or against the intervenants.\nDefendant\u2019s appeal allowed, costs in the cause.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant: Cassels, Brock & Kelly.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs: Mann, Lafleur & Brown.\nSolicitors for the intervenants: MacDougall, Macfarlane, Scott & Hugessen.\n[1] [1937] Ex.

The Board found that the appellants had failed to establish that the competitive tariffs complained of had resulted in the destruction of, or to the prejudice of, the advantages given by the Maritime Freight Rates Act to shippers in the \u201cselect territory\u201d in favour of persons or industries located elsewhere and dismissed the application.\nHeld that the judgment of the Board should be affirmed.\nCompetitive tariffs established outside of the \u201cselect territory\u201d are within the contemplation of section 8 of the Act, and when such tariffs prejudicially affect \u201cthe statutory advantages,\u201d then \u201cthe Board shall not approve nor allow\u201d such tariffs; and these words necessarily imply authority to cancel any rates having such effect; but whether any particular competitive rate has that effect must in each case be a question of fact to be determined by the Board itself.\nThe onus of establishing prejudice does not rest always upon the shipper or the complainants. The Board itself is a body invested with administrative as well as judicial powers and duties; and when a complaint is presented to the Board that any particular tariff constitutes an infraction of section 8, it is the duty of the Board to determine the question of prejudice or non-prejudice, keeping in mind that it is the intention of the Act to maintain the statutory advantages in rates given thereby to persons and industries located in the \u201cselect territory.\u201d\nThe authority of the Board under section 8 is limited to that which is given by or implied in the words \u201cshall not approve nor allow any tariffs which may destroy or prejudicially affect such advantages and the Board, having decided the issue of fact adversely to the appellants, as regards the particular tariffs in question in this appeal, was right in concluding that those tariffs ought not to be disallowed\nAPPEAL by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, from a decision of that Board dismissing the appellants\u2019 application for an order under the Maritime Freight Rates Act directing a specific or a percentage reduction in rates on potatoes from the \u201cselect territory\u201d as defined by that Act to points in an area of the province of Ontario within which reduced rates had been made effective in the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways for the express purpose of meeting motor-truck competition.\nThe materials facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nC.

Bowyer K.C. for the Ontario Potato Growers\u2019 Association.\nA. G. Blair K.C. for the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014This is an appeal by leave from a judgment and order of the Board of Railway Commissioners delivered on the 3rd of January on an application by the appellants, upon the following questions of law and jurisdiction:\n1. Whether, upon the facts as found by the Board, the Board was right\u2014\n(a) In holding that the Maritime Freight Rates Act does apply to competitive tariffs established by railway companies between points outside the \u201cselect territory\u201d as defined in the Act, and that Maritime shippers, in respect of \u201cpreferred movements\u201d over the \u201ceastern lines\u201d of the Canadian National Railways as defined in the Act, or in respect of movements similar to \u201cpreferred movements\u201d over the railways of other companies which have filed with the Board tariffs of tolls meeting the statutory rates referred to in section 7 of the Act, are entitled to a reduction in the freight rates on such preferred movements proportionate to the reductions effected by such competitive tariffs in order to maintain the ratio of advantage accorded to them under the terms of the Act: provided, however, that it can be established that any such competitive tariff issued by a railway company outside the \u201cselect territory\u201d \u201cmay destroy or prejudicially affect\u201d the advantages given by the Act to Maritime shippers in favour of persons or industries located elsewhere than in, the \u201cselect territory\u201d as provided by section 8 of the Act; (b) In adding the foregoing proviso to the decision giving rise to question (a), namely:\u2014\n\u201cProvided, however, that it can be established that any competitive tariff issued by a railway company may destroy or prejudicially affect\u2019 the advantages given by the Act to Maritime shippers in favour of persons or industries located elsewhere than in the \u2018select territory\u2019 as provided by section 8 of the Act.\u201d\n(c) In holding that the mere production of such competitive tariffs showing reductions in rates outside the select territory was insufficient, without more, to establish the contention of Maritime shippers, but that it is necessary to prove some actual or probable destruction of Maritime trade or some prejudicial effect thereupon, either heretofore sustained or likely to ensue as a result of such competitive tariffs;\n(d) In holding that, if rates under such a competitive tariff outside the \u201cselect territory\u201d are found to be such as the Board should not approve or allow, under section 8 of the Act, the Board has authority under the Act only to cancel such rates, and has not the authority to adjust or vary rates on the railway lines in the \u201cselect territory\u201d by allowing a reduction therein proportionate to the reduction effected by the competitive tariff in the outside territory.\nThe railway companies established competitive tariffs reducing freight rates upon shipments of potatoes within certain areas in Ontario and Quebec but outside of the \u201cselect territory\u201d as defined in the Maritime Freight Rates Act. While the immediate question before the Board was confined to this particular commodity and particular territory, it was admitted that the principle involved affected over 300 competitive freight rate tariffs having effect in various points of Canada outside of such \u201cselect territory.\u201d\nThe appellants contended that the shippers from points on the \u201ceastern lines\u201d in the Maritime Provinces were entitled to a proportionate rate reduction in respect of all competitive tariffs which have been filed by the railway companies pertaining to freight traffic outside of the Maritime provinces. On the other hand, it was contended on behalf of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company that the above-mentioned Act was not applicable to competitive tariffs between points outside of the \u201cselect territory.\u201d\nThe Canadian National Railways agree that the authority of the Board under section 8, which is reproduced below, is sufficiently comprehensive to bring such tariffs within its scope, and this view the Chief Commissioner accepted.\nThe purpose and the general provisions of the Maritime Freight Rates Act were fully discussed in the judgment of this Court delivered by the Chief Justice on the reference reported under that name[1].\nThe question immediately before this Court turns on the interpretation of section 8 of the Act as follows:\n8. The purpose of this Act is to give certain statutory advantages in rates to persons and industries in the three provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and in addition upon the lines in the province of Quebec mentioned in section two, together hereinafter called \u201cselect territory,\u201d accordingly the Board shall not approve nor allow any tariffs which may destroy or prejudicially affect such advantages in favour of persons or industries located elsewhere than in such select territory.\nIt is conceivable that competitive tariffs as well as other tariffs outside of the select territory \u201cmight destroy or prejudicially affect,\u201d in favour of persons or industries located outside of such select territory, \u201cthe statutory advantages\u201d which are given by the Act and which the rule prescribed by section 8 is intended to protect.\nWe agree that competitive tariffs established outside of the \u201cselect territory\u201d are within the contemplation of this section, and when such tariffs prejudicially affect \u201cthe statutory advantages,\u201d then \u201cthe Board shall not,\u201d the statute directs, \u201capprove nor allow\u201d such tariffs, and we agree with the Chief Commissioner that these words necessarily imply authority to cancel any rates having such effect; but whether any particular competitive rate has that effect must in each case be a question of fact to be determined by the Board itself.\nOne of the main contentions of the appellants assumes that the onus of establishing prejudice rests always upon the shipper or the complainants. We do not think that this is so. The Board itself is an administrative body with very wide experience and assisted by a skilled technical staff and is invested with administrative as well as judicial powers and duties; and, when a complaint is presented to the Board that any particular tariff constitutes an infraction of section 8, it is the duty of the Board to determine the question of prejudice or non-prejudice, always keeping in mind that it is the intention of the Act to maintain the statutory advantages in rates given thereby to persons and industries located in the select territory.\nWe agree with the Chief Commissioner that the authority of the Board under section 8 is limited to that which is given by, or implied in, the words \u201cshall not approve nor allow any tariffs which may destroy or prejudicially affect such advantages.\u201d\nThe Board having decided the issue of fact adversely to the appellants, as regards the particular tariffs now in question, rightly concluded that those tariffs ought not to be disallowed. The issues of law substantially involved in the questions submitted are determined conformably to the views expressed in this judgment. There will be no costs.\nAppeal dismissed, no costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C. J. Burchell.\nSolicitor for the Canadian National Railways: I. C.

Channell, [1937] S.C.R. 275\nDate: 1937-03-30\nStanley Johnston and Others (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nDame Vera Channell (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1937: March 8, 30.\nPresent: Rinfret, Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nHusband and wife\u2014Brokers\u2014Stock exchange transactions\u2014Marital authorization\u2014Nullity\u2014Action by married woman for accounting\u2014Plea alleging enrichissement sans cause and direct loss\u2014Articles 177, 188, 406, 988, 1011 and 1057 c.c.\nIn an action brought against a broker by a married woman for the annulment of stock transactions on the ground that the plaintiff had entered into such transactions without the authorization of her husband, and also for an order for accounting and further for the payment of the balance shown to be due as a result of such accounting, the defendant cannot set up in his plea allegations that the moneys and securities received did not enrich him in any way and that if he is ordered to pay them over to the plaintiff, such moneys or securities will represent a direct loss to him.\nThe case of a person suffering from a fundamental incapacity to do a juridical act and attempting to create obligations beyond its powers must be distinguished from the case of a person capable bona fide of creating obligations which become inoperative by reason of causes recognized by the law. In the latter case, the law merely seeks the most equitable solution to the situation, while in the first case, so that the incapable person may receive the full protection which the law seeks to give it, it is inevitable and imperative that the law shoud order full restitution when decreeing nullity.\nAccordingly, when once it has been found that a married woman acted without the participation or the consent of her husband, as required by law (arts. 177, 183, C.C), the consequence is that her deed or her act is the equivalent of non-existent. And, applying this principle to the present case, the supposed contract or agreement with the appellants being absolutely null on account of the legal incapacity of the respondent to act as she alleged she did, it is not susceptible of any effect; the appellants derived thereby no legal right to deal as they have done with the monies and securities. They acquired no title to these moneys and securities; they never had any legal right to hold them; and, therefore, the monies and securities still belong to the respondent. And if, on account of the fact that the monies and securities are no longer in the appellants\u2019 possession, it has become impossible to return them to the respondent, then she is entitled to get the equivalent from the appellants.\nMoreover, without deciding whether the doctrine of unjustified enrichment (enrichissement sans cause) forms part of the law of the province of Quebec, even if the attempt to place the demurrer on such a ground could have been entertained in the present case, it could not have supported the allegations of the appellants\u2019 plea, as that doctrine could not be invoked to defeat either the principle or the effect of the precept of public order embodied in article 183 C.C.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 61 K.B. 42) aff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Curran J. and maintaining in part respondent\u2019s inscription in law against certain paragraphs of appellants\u2019 plea.\nThe respondent instituted proceedings against the appellants, a firm of stock brokers, to have declared null and void certain transactions in stocks and bonds and also transfers or delivery by the respondent of money and securities in connection therewith. The respondent prayed for a declaration of nullity and for an order for accounting by the appellants, and further that the latter be condemned to pay to the respondent the balance shown to be due as a result of such accounting. By her declaration the respondent set forth that she was a married woman, separate as to property from her husband, and that she had entered into the transactions in question without the authorization of her husband, as required by law, and that consequently such transactions were absolutely null and void. The appellants\u2019 plea was, in effect, a denial of the allegations of the declaration, coupled with an averment that the accounts in question, now repudiated, were opened by the respondent with the knowledge, consent and approval of her husband, and in so far as his authorization was necessary the same was given. The plea, moreover, contained two paragraphs, the text of which are recited in the judgment now reported. The respondent inscribed in law against these paragraphs, and by the judgment now appealed from they were rejected from the plea as being irrelevant.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. and G. F. Osier for the appellants.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. and J. E. Mitchell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was rendered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The respondent instituted proceedings against the appellants, a firm of stock brokers, to have declared null and void certain transactions in stocks and bonds and also transfers or delivery by the respondent of money and securities in connection therewith, on the ground that the respondent, being a married woman, engaged in the transactions in question without the knowledge or authorization of her husband. She prayed for a declaration of nullity and for an order for accounting by the appellants:\n(a) of all sums of money paid to them;\n(b) of all securities delivered by her or on her behalf; and, in default, that the appellants be condemned to pay the sum of $162,000.\nThe plea filed by the appellants was, in effect, a denial of the allegations of the declaration; but, moreover, it contained the two following paragraphs, among others:\n22B. Receipt by the defendants of the securities and moneys referred to in plaintiff\u2019s declaration did not and has not enriched or benefited defendants in any way, all such securities and moneys having been set apart by defendants as a fund at the disposal of the female plaintiff, and subject to her instructions, and credited to one or the other of the four accounts, exhibits D-1, D-2, D-3 and D-4.\n22C. That if defendants are ordered by the judgment to be rendered herein, to pay to female plaintiff any money or securities, such money and\/or securities will represent a direct loss to defendants, and will not and cannot have the effect of replacing the parties in the respective positions occupied by them before the opening of the four said accounts, exhibits D-1, D-2, D-3 and D-4.\nUpon inscription in law by the respondent, these two paragraphs were ordered by the Superior Court to be struck from the appellants\u2019 plea; and this judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench[2].\nThe appellants did not for a moment suggest that either paragraph was in any way relevant to or that it affected the respondent\u2019s allegations of nullity. They conceded at bar that all transactions in respect of which no sufficient authorization was given by the respondent\u2019s husband are null and void and must be so declared by the courts.\nIt must also be admitted that, if the transactions be declared null, neither paragraph, even if proven, would relieve the appellants of the obligation to account to the respondent. The appellants\u2019 contention may, we think, be condensed as follows:\nThe action is based upon a supposed rule of the civil law which says that where a contract is annulled by the courts, or declared to have been null, the parties to that contract must be put back as nearly as may be in the respective positions in which they were before the contract and that whatever has been paid by either party in execution of that contract must be restored. The appellants do not deny that such a rule exists, * * * but they submit that the facts alleged in the paragraphs of their plea which have been struck out on respondent\u2019s inscription-in-law, if they should be proven, are of a nature to exclude the operation of the rule.\n* * * *\nIn whatever form the rule may be stated, however, and whatever its limitations, it is submitted that the source of the obligation to restore which is imposed in virtue of the rule must be found within one of the categories enumerated in art. 983 of the Civil Code. The obligation must, arise either from a contract, a quasi-contract, an offence, a quasi-offence, or from the operation of the law solely. The enumeration is limitative (Desruisseaux v. Desruisseaux2), and therefore, if there is any obligation to restore in the present case, and regardless of whether or not the rule applies, that obligation must have arisen in one of the manners enumerated. * * * Obviously the obligation does not arise either from contract, delict or quasi delict, and therefore, if we can succeed in eliminating \u201cthe operation of the law solely\u201d as a source of the alleged obligation, it follows that, if there is an obligation, it must be the result of a quasi-contract.\nThe appellants then refer to art. 1057 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the obligations resulting from the operation of the law solely; and they say that the\nexamination of the various authorities confirms the view that that class of obligations * * * is not broad enough to include an obligation such as is alleged in the present case. It is the appellants\u2019 submission\nthat the Court of King\u2019s Bench was in error in holding that the obligation forming the basis of the present action arises from the sole operation of the law.\nThis is followed by a lengthy reference to the Roman law, to a few English cases and to the opinion of English and French commentators, on the strength of which the appellants submit\nthat the rule as to restoration of what has been paid by reason of a contract subsequently declared to be null is restricted to those cases where there has been both an enrichment of the defendant and an impoverishment of the plaintiff, and that the enrichment of the defendant is the measure of the amount which must be repaid.\nThe appellants go on to say:\nWe admit that in so far as the respondent asks for the nullity of certain transactions, it is an \u201caction in nullity\u201d and is founded on articles 177 and 183 C.C., but we submit that neither of these articles deal in any way with the question of what shall be done once the nullity is declared, and that the solution of that problem must be looked for elsewhere. * * *\nThe judgment under appeal proceeds on the basis that where there is a declaration of nullity, something else follows as a matter of course. But what that something else is, is not clear. Whether it is that the plaintiff shall be indemnified against loss, or that both parties shall be replaced in the respective positions occupied by them before the deliveries (which is impossible), or that everything delivered shall be returned (which is equally impossible), or that some other action should be taken, is not stated. We submit that what in fact should be done is that the defendant should be prevented from making an unjustified enrichment and be ordered to repay whatever amount is necessary to effect that end. We further submit that the date as of which the enrichment must be tested is the date of the taking of the action.\n* * * *\nIt is respectfully submitted that the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench did not deal with the real point in issue in this case, namely, what is the result of a declaration of nullity, but merely applied the rule as to restitution without any consideration of its source or limits.\nWe trust we have correctly and completely stated the problem as presented by the appellants. For the most part, we have endeavoured to do it in the words they have used in their written argument. And we thought we would transcribe it as fully as possible because of the evident attempt to introduce in the case allegations based on the doctrine of unjustified enrichment so much discussed in later years in France.\nThere are many points, however, in the argument submitted which are clearly irrelevant to the issue in this case and which need not retain our attention. As a whole, the appellants\u2019 contention arises from a confusion of the case of a person suffering from a fundamental incapacity to do a juridical act and attempting to create obligations beyond her powers with the case of a person fully capable bona fide of creating obligations which become inoperative by reason of causes recognized by the law. As rightly observed by counsel for the respondent, in the case of a person fully capable whose obligation becomes inoperative, the law merely seeks the most equitable solution to the situation; but in the case of the incapable person, so that it may receive the full protection which the law seeks to give it, it is inevitable and imperative that the law should order full restitution when decreeing nullity.\nWhether the doctrine of \u201cenrichissement sans cause\u201d forms part of the law of the province of Quebec and whether it should be recognized as part of the legal rules under which a Quebec case ought to be solved, is unnecessary to decide here and the respondent has no need to support her case on any such ground. The allegation of the respondent was that she acted without the authorization or the consent of her husband (art. 177 C.C.). By force of art. 183 of the Code,\nThe want of authorization by the husband, where it is necessary, constitutes a cause of nullity which nothing can cover, and which may be taken advantage of by all those who have an existing and actual interest in doing so.\nIn no part of the Code can a pronouncement of nullity be found in stronger terms. Both in the doctrine and the jurisprudence, it is universally regarded as a matter of public order.\nLimiting the discussion to the case of the incapable married woman claiming under the prohibition of art. 177 C.C. and the resulting nullity declared by art. 183 C.C., it is clear that, when once it has been found that she acted without the participation or the consent of her husband, as required by law, the consequence is that her deed or her act is the equivalent of non-existent. And if, for example, one should apply the principle in a case such as that which is brought by the respondent, the necessary result is the following:\nThe respondent deposited monies or securities with the appellants under a supposed contract or agreement with them. Exclusively as a consequence of that contract, the appellants became entitled to hold or to deal with these monies and securities. But the contract being absolutely null on account of the legal incapacity of the respondent to act as she did, it is not susceptible of any effect; the appellants derived thereby no legal right to deal as they have done with the monies and securities; they acquired no title to these monies and securities; they never had any legal right to hold them; and, therefore, the monies and securities still belong to the respondent.\nUnder the circumstances, it is a complete fallacy to say that the obligation incumbent upon the appellants to restore or to return the monies and securities results from some quasi-contract unknown to the Quebec Civil Code and which must be looked for in the Roman law or in the old French law. It is clear that the obligation to restore or to return results from the simple fact that the respondent is the owner of these monies and securities, and that she has always been the owner. These monies and securities were physically transferred to the appellants by the respondent under a supposed agreement which proves to be non-existing in law. Her right to repossess herself of these monies and securities is strictly based on her title of ownership. It is the undisputed right of every proprietor to hold and to possess his property in the most absolute way (art. 406 C.C.). If, on account of the fact that the monies and securities are no longer in the appellants\u2019 possession, it has become impossible to return them to the respondent, then she is entitled to get the equivalent from the appellants; and that is the nature of the prayer in the conclusion of the respondent\u2019s declaration. The purpose of the accounting is to ascertain whether the monies and securities are still in the appellants\u2019 possession, in which case the respondent would be authorized to take possession of them, as her property, in the hands of the appellants. And the alternative purpose of the accounting, if the monies and securities have ceased to be in the possession of the appellants, is to establish what is the equivalent that they should pay to the respondent in lieu of her property.\nThat is what Messrs. Colin and Capitant observe in their treatise (1931, 7th ed., vol. 1, at p. 80):\nLa recevabilit\u00e9 de cette action en revendication ou en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition est subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019inefficacit\u00e9 du titre en vertu duquel le possesseur a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en possession. The situation was explained in a most satisfactory way by the Court of Review, in the case of Martin v. National Real Estate and Investment Company of Canada[3].\nQuant aux sommes pay\u00e9es par la demanderesse ou pour elle, cette partie de la demande n\u2019est que l\u2019accessoire de la demande en nullit\u00e9 qui est la demande principale; et le remboursement des dites sommes n\u2019est que la cons\u00e9quence de la nullit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e et prononc\u00e9e. Il s\u2019agit moins, quant \u00e0 cette restitution, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019une; action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l\u2019ind\u00fb pour d\u00e9faut de cause, que du r\u00e8glement de la situation faite aux parties par cette d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9.\nIt may be stated that the object of this subsidiary conclusion in the declaration of the respondent\u2019s action is to reduce the state of fact into conformity with the legal position of the parties resulting from the nullity of their agreement.\nSuch, in our view, is the real situation and, under the circumstances, it follows that the judgments appealed from ought to be confirmed.\nBut we would not like to part with this case without pointing out that, even if the attempt to place the demurrer on the ground of \u201cenrichissement sans cause\u201d could have been entertained in this case, it could not have supported the two paragraphs of the appellants\u2019 plea which are the subject of this appeal.\nEven amongst its most ardent supporters, it is well recognized that the doctrine of\nenrichissement sans cause, as in the case of all other legal doctrines, must not be employed for the purpose of defeating the principles of positive law.\n(Cambridge Law Journal, 1934, vol. 5, p. 220; Rouast, Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil, 1922, vol. 21, p. 35, at page 86.)\nWe have already observed that nowhere in the Civil Code could stronger language be found than that in which is couched article 183. The doctrine of unjustified enrichment cannot be invoked to defeat the purpose of that article. It cannot be permitted to defeat either the principle or the effect of the precept of public order embodied in that article. As counsel for the respondent well said: As a result, if the person dealing with the incapable suffers impoverishment or cannot be put in the same position as he was, he is suffering the sanction of the infringement of the prohibition in favour of the incapable. To admit otherwise would be to remove the very protection the law gives to the incapable and to his property.\nAn instance of this may be derived from art. 1011 of the Civil Code by force of which\nWhen minors, interdicted persons or married women are admitted in these qualities to be relieved from their contracts, the reimbursement of that which has been paid in consequence of these contracts, during the minority, interdiction or marriage, cannot be exacted, unless it is proved that what has been so paid has turned to their profit.\nFor be it noticed that what this article contemplates is the possibility of obtaining from the incapable person \u201cthe reimbursement of that which has been paid,\u201d to that person. It may not be exacted from the incapable person and it will be legally lost \u201cunless it is proved that what has been so paid has turned to (the) profit\u201d of the incapable person. The reverse, however, is not true; and the very existence of that article negatives any such principle as is advanced by the appellants. It is clear that if the reverse were true the principle would apply in every case to a capable as well as to an incapable person; and article 1011 C.C. would have been quite unnecessary; it would serve no purpose. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett & Harmer.\n[1] (1936) Q.R. 61 K.B. 42.\n[2] (1936) Q.R. 61 K.B. 42.\n2 (1936) Q.R. 61 K.B. 42.\n[3] (1921) Q.R. 60 S.C. 148, at 153.\n"}

C.C.\nThe terms \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera alors\u201d contained in a clause of a marriage contract reading as follows: \u201cAdvenant la mort du \u201cfutur \u00e9poux avant la future \u00e9pouse sans laisser d\u2019enfants du dit \u201cfutur mariage, tous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera alors appartiendront \u00e0 \u201cses enfants du premier lit, mais ils seront oblig\u00e9s de payer \u00e0 la \u201cdite future \u00e9pouse une somme de deux mille piastres qu\u2019elle gardera \u201cen pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 toujours, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne convole en secondes \u201cnoces; car dans ce cas, elle ne garderait en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que cinq \u201ccents piastres et le reste retournerait aux dits enfants du premier lit\u201d\u2014means \u201ctous les biens dont il sera propri\u00e9taire alors\u201d; and in that sentence the word \u201calors\u201d relates to the date of \u201cla mort du futur \u00e9poux.\u201d In the language customarily used in the province of Quebec, the terms \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera alors\u201d are not intended to apply to possession in the legal sense of the word, but they refer to ownership. Consequently, when a marriage contract stipulates a universal community of property between the husband-to-be and the wife-to-be, those terms (\u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera alors\u201d) will not lump together all the goods which formed the universal community provided in the marriage covenant: they include only the share of the husband in the community.\nMoreover, in the present case, that stipulation which constitutes a donation made in contemplation of death is not authorized by law although included in a marriage contract, because it was not made in favour of the children to be born of the future marriage as required by the law, but was a stipulation in favour of children born from a first marriage and therefore illegal.\nOn the other hand, the nullity of such a stipulation does not involve the nullity of the whole contract. The material agreement of the marriage contract was the stipulation that a universal community of property would exist between the parties. The stipulation as to the property of which the husband would be the owner at his death relates solely to the succession of the deceased husband. Therefore there is not, between the whole of the marriage contract and the special clause above quoted, such dependency that the nullity of that last clause should involve the nullity of the marriage contract itself. The intentions of the contracting parties would be violated if, because the stipulation as to the succession of the husband is illegal, the agreement as to a universal community of property would consequently cease to exist. These are two distinct covenants, and the existence of one is not dependent upon the existence of the other. The marriage contract remains valid as to the remainder.\nBut the same cannot be said as to the obligation imposed upon the children born from the first marriage to pay to the surviving wife \u201cune somme de deux mille piastres qu\u2019elle gardera en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 toujours * * *.\u201d This obligation is included in a clause of which the main object is to give over to the children born from the first marriage the property of which the husband would be the owner at his death. It constitutes, properly speaking, a charge in connection with the disposition made in favour of the children born from the first marriage; and it follows that the illegality of the stipulation in favour of these children involves as a consequence the nullity of the obligation imposed upon them by reason of such stipulation.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, Fortier J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action and ordering a partition between the appellants and the respondent of the universal community of property alleged to have existed between the respondent and her deceased husband.\nThe question at issue is the proper construction and application of the ante-nuptial marriage agreement entered into between the respondent and her late husband Anthime Comeau. The respondent had an inventory made of her late husband\u2019s property where she contended that all the property formed part of the community which she alleged existed between herself and her late husband. The appellants concurred in this inventory but expressly stated in signing it that in so doing they were not in any way admitting that the said community had ever existed. The respondent then renounced her share in her late husband\u2019s intestate succession. By virtue of this renunciation the deceased\u2019s four children became his sole heirs at law and, two of them having renounced their share, the present appellants became Anthime Comeau\u2019s sole heirs at law. None of these children were born of Anthime Comeau\u2019s marriage with respondent; they were all born from a previous marriage. In her action the respondent alleged that the marriage contract created a conventional universal community of property between herself and her late husband, or, in other words, that by virtue of this contract, all her late husband\u2019s property, moveable and immoveable, acquired before or after the marriage, became common to the two consorts. She contended that by reason of the death of her husband she became entitled to half of that community of property and prayed that the appellants as sole heirs at law of her husband, be obliged to divide with her all the property, moveable and immoveable, of Anthime Comeau. The appellants contested the action contending that under the marriage contract they were entitled to all the estate of their late father and that the respondent was only entitled to receive a sum of $2,000, her personal effects and \u201cpr\u00e9ciput\u201d together with the right to reside in the family\u2019s home. They alleged that this is what the marriage contract provided in the event of the husband dying first without issue from his marriage with the respondent.\nLs. St. Laurent K.C. for the appellants.\nGustave Poisson and Hamilton Heaton for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014L\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui est la veuve de Anthime Comeau, autrefois de la paroisse de B\u00e9cancour, a poursuivi les appelants en compte et partage de la communaut\u00e9 de biens qui a exist\u00e9 entre elle et son d\u00e9funt mari.\nLes appelants sont les fils de Anthime Comeau par un premier mariage, et ils sont ses seuls h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux.\nL\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019appuie sur un contrat de mariage \u00e9tablissant entre elle et son mari une communaut\u00e9 universelle de tous les biens qu\u2019ils poss\u00e9daient lors de leur mariage, ou qui devaient leur \u00e9cheoir \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit pendant le mariage.\nA ce contrat, il \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 que\nAdvenant la dissolution de la communaut\u00e9, soit par la mort ou autrement, il sera permis \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse et aux enfants qui na\u00eetront du pr\u00e9sent mariage de l\u2019accepter ou d\u2019y renoncer.\nEn cas de renonciation, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait droit de \u201cremporter\u201d tout ce qu\u2019elle justifierait avoir apport\u00e9 \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9, ainsi que ses douaire et pr\u00e9ciput. Puis viennent les clauses du contrat sur lesquelles porte le litige et qu\u2019il vaut mieux citer textuellement:\nIl est convenu que si le futur \u00e9poux meurt le premier, sa succession sera partag\u00e9e entre tous ses enfants tant du premier mariage que du dernier mariage.\nAdvenant la mort du futur \u00e9poux, avant la future \u00e9pouse, sans laisser d\u2019enfants du dit futur mariage, tous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera alors appartiendront \u00e0 ses enfants du premier lit, mais ils seront oblig\u00e9s de payer \u00e0 la dite \u00e9pouse une somme de deux mille piastres qu\u2019elle gardera en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 toujours \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne convole en secondes noces, car dans ce cas elle ne garderait en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que cinq cents piastres et le reste retournerait aux dits enfants du premier lit.\nEn ce cas du pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s du dit futur \u00e9poux, la future \u00e9pouse aura droit de reprendre en outre tout ce qu\u2019elle aura emport\u00e9 en mariage et tout ce qui lui sera \u00e9chu par succession, donation, legs ou autrement et de continuer \u00e0 habiter dans la maison de la famille tant qu\u2019elle voudra.\nEt si c\u2019est la future \u00e9pouse qui d\u00e9c\u00e8de la premi\u00e8re sans qu\u2019elle laisse d\u2019enfant de ce mariage ses parents de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 estoc & ligne pourront r\u00e9clamer ses hardes & linge de corps, et tout le reste des biens de la dite communaut\u00e9 sera la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des dits enfants du dit futur \u00e9poux.\nLa future \u00e9pouse s\u2019engage \u00e0 prendre le soin de la maison du futur \u00e9poux et de ses biens et d\u2019\u00e9lever leurs enfants tant du premier mariage que du second mariage.\nVoici maintenant quelles sont les pr\u00e9tentions des appelants:\nLe contrat de mariage stipule une communaut\u00e9 de biens universelle entre les \u00e9poux. Le mari est mort le premier. Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019enfants de son mariage avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il en r\u00e9sulte que la femme a le droit de reprendre tout ce qu\u2019elle a \u201cemport\u00e9 en mariage\u201d et tout ce qui lui est \u00e9chu pendant le mariage, par succession, donation, legs ou autrement. Elle a, en outre, le droit de continuer \u00e0 habiter dans la maison de la famille tant qu\u2019elle voudra. Les \u201cenfants du premier lit\u201d de son mari d\u00e9funt seront oblig\u00e9s de payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u201cune \u201csomme de deux mille piastres qu\u2019elle gardera en pleine \u201cpropri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 toujours\u201d (sauf le cas de son convoi en secondes noces, pour lequel une stipulation sp\u00e9ciale est faite). Mais c\u2019est tout ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a droit d\u2019avoir. Tous les autres biens de la communaut\u00e9 appartiennent aux enfants du premier mariage. Ces mots: \u201cenfants du premier mariage,\u201d sont employ\u00e9s dans le contrat de mariage dans le sens \u201cd\u2019h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux\u201d du mari; et, par suite, il n\u2019y a pas lieu au partage entre les appelants et l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont toutes deux donn\u00e9 tort aux appelants; et, apr\u00e8s avoir accord\u00e9 l\u2019attention la plus minutieuse \u00e0 l\u2019argumentation du savant et habile avocat des appelants, nous sommes d\u2019avis que les jugements de ces deux cours doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9s.\nIl convient premi\u00e8rement de bien \u00e9tablir le sens des clauses du contrat de mariage qui sont en discussion.\nIl est clair, tout d\u2019abord, que les \u00e9poux ont stipul\u00e9 une communaut\u00e9 de biens universelle. C\u2019est l\u00e0 la base de leur contrat. Les clauses relatives au douaire et au pr\u00e9ciput ne sont que subsidiaires et sans importance, au moins pour les questions que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider.\nDans la clause qui pourvoit \u00e0 la distribution des biens au cas o\u00f9 le mari d\u00e9c\u00e9derait avant l\u2019intim\u00e9e et sans laisser d\u2019enfants du futur mariage, la phrase dont il est essentiel de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer le sens est: \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dera alors appartiendront \u00e0 ses enfants du premier lit.\u201d\nLes appelants, qui sont les personnes vis\u00e9es par cette disposition, pr\u00e9tendent que, par l\u00e0, les \u00e9poux ont entendu d\u00e9clarer que tous les biens faisant l\u2019objet de la communaut\u00e9 universelle appartiendraient aux enfants du premier lit. Pour appuyer cette pr\u00e9tention, ils font remarquer que, dans la communaut\u00e9 de biens, le mari administre seul et il peut disposer des biens sans le concours de sa femme. Les actions relatives au patrimoine de la communaut\u00e9 sont exerc\u00e9es en son nom; et il en est de m\u00eame des actions mobili\u00e8res et possessoires qui appartiennent \u00e0 sa femme (art. 1292 et suiv. C.C.). Il est donc bien le seul et v\u00e9ritable possesseur des biens de la communaut\u00e9; et lorsque le contrat de mariage emploie l\u2019expression: \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dera\u201d, il entend englober absolument tous les biens de la communaut\u00e9 universelle, sauf ceux qui, dans cette clause, sont sp\u00e9cialement attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse intim\u00e9e.\nTous les juges appel\u00e9s jusqu\u2019ici \u00e0 d\u00e9cider cette question ont repouss\u00e9 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation soumise par les appelants; et nous n\u2019avons aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 concourir dans leur opinion.\nPour rechercher l\u2019intention des parties dans un contrat, la r\u00e8gle primordiale est de s\u2019attacher d\u2019abord au \u201csens litt\u00e9ral des termes du contrat\u201d (art. 1013 C.C.); et c\u2019est ce que fait observer le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Lampson v. City of Quebec[1]:\nThe intention by which the deed is to be construed is that of the parties as revealed by the language they have chosen to use in the deed itself.\nQuand une convention est exprim\u00e9e en termes clairs et pr\u00e9cis, il n\u2019est pas permis au juge de la modifier en supposant aux parties une intention contraire au sens litt\u00e9ral de la clause.\nOr, l\u2019expression dont il s\u2019agit ici ne nous para\u00eet pas entach\u00e9e d\u2019ambiguit\u00e9. Dans le langage usuel et courant de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, l\u2019expression: \u201cTous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera\u201d, n\u2019entend pas s\u2019adresser \u00e0 la possession dans le sens l\u00e9gal du mot. Cette expression se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle veut dire: Tous les biens dont il sera propri\u00e9taire alors; et ici le mot \u201calors\u201d a trait \u00e0 la date de \u201cla mort du futur \u00e9poux\u201d.\nCette expression ne prend pas un autre sens lorsqu\u2019elle concerne une communaut\u00e9 de biens. En vertu de ce r\u00e9gime, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, il y a vraiment trois patrimoines: le patrimoine personnel du mari; le patrimoine personnel de la femme; et le patrimoine de la communaut\u00e9. On n\u2019a jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9signer le patrimoine de la communaut\u00e9 par l\u2019expression: \u201cLes biens que le mari poss\u00e8dera \u00e0 sa mort\u201d; et personne, suivant le sens usuel des mots, ne comprendrait que, par l\u00e0, on a voulu entendre les biens de la communaut\u00e9. Suivant leur sens usuel, les termes de cette clause signifient donc que, advenant la mort du mari avant celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et sans qu\u2019il y ait d\u2019enfants de leur mariage, les biens du mari d\u00e9funt appartiendront \u201c\u00e0 ses enfants du premier lit\u201d. Par cette stipulation, les \u00e9poux n\u2019ont pas voulu d\u00e9roger au partage des biens de la communaut\u00e9 en la fa\u00e7on dont la loi y pourvoit. Ils paraissent, au contraire, avoir voulu se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019article 1293 C.C., en vertu duquel\nL\u2019un des \u00e9poux ne peut, au pr\u00e9judice de l\u2019autre, l\u00e9guer plus que sa part dans la communaut\u00e9.\nCette interpr\u00e9tation qui ressort du sens usuel des mots et des expressions employ\u00e9es par les parties est d\u2019ailleurs corrobor\u00e9e par les autres clauses du contrat (art. 1018 C.C.).\nIl convient de remarquer que la clause qui contient l\u2019expression: \u201cTous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera\u201d, vient imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la suite de celle o\u00f9 il est convenu que si le futur \u00e9poux meurt le premier\nsa succession sera partag\u00e9e entre tous ses enfants tant du premier mariage que du dernier mariage.\nSi l\u2019on rapproche de cette clause celle qui fait l\u2019objet de la discussion en ce moment, l\u2019on voit que la premi\u00e8re dispose des biens du mari en pourvoyant au cas o\u00f9 il aurait des enfants tant du premier que du second mariage; tandis que la seconde clause dispose de ses biens en pourvoyant au cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019y aurait pas d\u2019enfants du second mariage. On y voit que l\u2019intention a \u00e9t\u00e9 de pourvoir \u00e0 tous les enfants du mari. S\u2019il y a des enfants des deux mariages, ils doivent recevoir, en termes bien pr\u00e9cis, seulement les biens de \u201csa succession\u201d. Il est logique que, dans la seconde clause, lorsqu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit plus que des enfants du premier mariage, l\u2019intention soit de leur laisser les m\u00eames biens et que l\u2019expression: \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera\u201d, soit employ\u00e9e dans le m\u00eame sens que les mots: \u201csa succession\u201d.\nAu contraire, lorsque, dans une clause suivante, l\u2019intention a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019englober tous les biens de la communaut\u00e9, les parties n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en peine pour l\u2019exprimer; et ils l\u2019ont indiqu\u00e9e par les mots: \u201ctout le reste des biens de la dite communaut\u00e9\u201d\u2014stipulation qui pr\u00e9voit le cas o\u00f9 la future \u00e9pouse d\u00e9c\u00e8derait avant le mari.\nMais il reste une consid\u00e9ration qui nous para\u00eet plus d\u00e9cisive encore que cette comparaison entre les expressions contenues dans les clauses relatives \u00e0 la distribution des biens apr\u00e8s la mort de l\u2019un des \u00e9poux. Si l\u2019on devait donner \u00e0 l\u2019expression: \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera alors\u201d, le sens que soumettent les appelants, la cons\u00e9quence serait que la communaut\u00e9 universelle de biens n\u2019aurait subsist\u00e9 que pendant la vie commune des \u00e9poux, ou la dur\u00e9e du mariage lui-m\u00eame. Elle cesserait d\u00e8s la dissolution du mariage par la mort de l\u2019un des \u00e9poux. En effet, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les appelants, d\u00e8s la mort du mari, tous les biens de la communaut\u00e9 seraient all\u00e9s aux enfants; et la femme n\u2019aurait re\u00e7u que les dons sp\u00e9cialement mentionn\u00e9s en sa faveur, annulant ainsi et par anticipation tous les r\u00e9sultats du partage de la communaut\u00e9. Or, cette cons\u00e9quence ne para\u00eet ni logique, ni vraisemblable; car il est difficile de voir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que peuvent avoir des \u00e9poux \u00e0 se mettre sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 de biens pour la dur\u00e9e du mariage seulement et \u00e0 faire cesser ce r\u00e9gime juste au moment o\u00f9, le mariage \u00e9tant dissous, le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 apporte ses v\u00e9ritables avantages sous forme de l\u2019attribution \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux survivant et aux ayants-droit de l\u2019\u00e9poux d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 de la moiti\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens qui composent ce patrimoine commun.\nOn peut tirer, par ailleurs, d\u2019une autre clause du contrat de mariage, et \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des pr\u00e9tentions des appelants, un argument auquel ces derniers n\u2019ont pu trouver de r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante. Le contrat stipule que\nAdvenant la dissolution de la communaut\u00e9, soit par la mort ou autrement, il sera permis \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse et aux enfants qui na\u00eetront du, pr\u00e9sent mariage de l\u2019accepter ou d\u2019y renoncer, * * *\nOn ne voit pas tr\u00e8s bien la raison de cette clause s\u2019il \u00e9tait: vrai que, par suite de la mort du mari, tous les biens de la communaut\u00e9 devraient appartenir aux enfants du premier mariage. La clause serait parfaitement inutile, puisque l\u2019\u00e9pouse survivante n\u2019aurait rien \u00e0 accepter de la communaut\u00e9 ou rien \u00e0 y renoncer.\nNous sommes donc d\u2019accord avec les jugements dont appel pour consid\u00e9rer l\u2019expression: \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera alors\u201d comme signifiant: les biens faisant partie de la succession du mari, et pas autre chose.\nCette conclusion adopt\u00e9e, il en r\u00e9sulterait que la clause o\u00f9 se trouve l\u2019expression que nous avons discut\u00e9e aurait pour effet d\u2019attribuer aux appelants la moiti\u00e9 des biens de la communaut\u00e9 universelle qui a exist\u00e9 entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et son d\u00e9funt mari, puisque \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera, alors\u201d comprennent cette moiti\u00e9; et, en plus, les appelants seraient oblig\u00e9s de payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e une somme de deux mille piastres qu\u2019elle garderait en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 toujours, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne convole en secondes noces (ce dont nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous occuper pour le moment). L\u2019intim\u00e9e reprendrait, en outre, ce qu\u2019elle a apport\u00e9 au mariage, tout ce qui lui est \u00e9chu par succession, donation, legs ou autrement; et elle continuerait \u00e0 habiter dans la maison de la famille tant qu\u2019elle voudra.\nMais les appelants soul\u00e8vent alors une autre question. Ils disent que la disposition en vertu de laquelle \u201ctous les biens (que le mari) poss\u00e8dera alors appartiendront \u00e0 ses enfants du premier lit\u201d constitue une donation \u00e0 cause de mort qui, \u00e0 vraiment parler, bien qu\u2019elle se trouve dans un contrat de mariage, n\u2019est pas autoris\u00e9e par la loi, parce que la stipulation n\u2019est pas en faveur des enfants \u00e0 na\u00eetre du futur mariage, ainsi que la loi l\u2019exige (arts. 818 et 819 C.C.), mais qu\u2019elle est une stipulation en faveur des enfants du premier lit; et que le futur \u00e9poux n\u2019avait pas le droit d\u2019ainsi disposer \u00e0 cause de mort. Seuls, en vertu de l\u2019article 820 C.C., les ascendants d\u2019un futur \u00e9poux peuvent faire, dans un contrat de mariage, des donations \u00e0 cause de mort aux fr\u00e8res et soeurs de ce futur \u00e9poux qui est aussi avantag\u00e9 par la disposition. Les autres donations \u00e0 cause de mort faites en faveur des tiers sont nulles. Tel a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019avis du savant juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et \u00e9galement celui de tous les juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi; et nous partageons cet avis. (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des donations entre vifs et des testaments, 3e \u00e9d. t. 2, nos. 3879 et 3892).\nDu point de vue pratique, l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette disposition entra\u00eene des cons\u00e9quences qu\u2019il s\u2019agit maintenant d\u2019envisager.\nLes appelants sont \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent les seules personnes en faveur de qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite la stipulation; et ils sont \u00e9galement les seuls h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux du mari d\u00e9funt de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nComme, ainsi que nous le d\u00e9cidons, \u201ctous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8dera alors\u201d veulent dire: la succession du mari d\u00e9funt, il s\u2019ensuit que, soit en vertu de la clause (si elle est l\u00e9gale), soit par l\u2019op\u00e9ration de la loi en mati\u00e8re de successions (si la clause est ill\u00e9gale), ce sont toujours les appelants qui sont devenus propri\u00e9taires des biens de leur p\u00e8re, \u00e0 la mort de ce dernier. Mais, d\u2019autre part, il existe une diff\u00e9rence si la clause est ill\u00e9gale, parce que, dans ce cas, il peut en r\u00e9sulter que le don de $2,000 en faveur de la future \u00e9pouse dispara\u00eet avec la clause; et les appelants pr\u00e9tendent m\u00eame que la cons\u00e9quence est encore plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et que l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la clause entra\u00eene la nullit\u00e9 de tout le contrat de mariage.\nA ce sujet, nous voudrions citer Baudry-Lacantinerie 3e \u00e9d. Du contrat de mariage, t. 1, no. 205, pp. 215 et 216:\nOn peut pr\u00e9tendre, il est vrai, et Pon a soutenu, que les conventions matrimoniales forment un ensemble toujours indivisible. Mais on a beaucoup abus\u00e9 de l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019indivisibilit\u00e9 en ces mati\u00e8res. Assur\u00e9ment il n\u2019est pas rare que le contrat de mariage forme un tout, dont aucune partie ne puisse \u00eatre supprim\u00e9e, sans qu\u2019on coure le risque, en voulant maintenir le surplus, de violer les intentions des parties contractantes. D\u00e8s lors, toutes les fois qu\u2019il para\u00eetra en \u00eatre ainsi, le contrat viol\u00e9 dans une de ses parties doit p\u00e9rir en entier. Mais d\u2019autres fois, le juge peut tr\u00e8s bien constater l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance de certaines stipulations, par exemple de certaines lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s. Pourquoi donc leur annulation entra\u00eenerait-elle la chute totale du contrat de mariage? On ne le voit pas. Les meilleurs auteurs et la jurisprudence semblent se fixer en ce sens.\nEt l\u2019auteur cite \u00e0 l\u2019appui Aubry et Rau, Guillouard et diff\u00e9rents arr\u00eats.\nDans le cas actuel, nous ne croyons pas que la nullit\u00e9 de la clause que nous avons examin\u00e9e entra\u00eene la nullit\u00e9 du contrat tout entier. Comme nous l\u2019avons dit, la base de la convention des \u00e9poux a \u00e9t\u00e9 la stipulation d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de communaut\u00e9 de biens universelle. Et les parties ont clairement indiqu\u00e9 leur intention dans ce sens.\nD\u2019autre part, la clause qui pourvoit au cas de survie de la future \u00e9pouse, sans qu\u2019il y ait d\u2019enfants du futur mariage, envisag\u00e9e comme nous l\u2019avons interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e, n\u2019est plus une stipulation relative aux biens de la communaut\u00e9; elle est uniquement une stipulation concernant la succession du mari d\u00e9funt. Il ne nous para\u00eet donc pas y avoir entre l\u2019ensemble du contrat de mariage et la clause particuli\u00e8re en question la d\u00e9pendance dont parle Baudry-Lacantinerie, ainsi que les autres auteurs et les arr\u00eats sur lesquels il s\u2019appuie, pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le tout forme un ensemble indivisible. Ce ne serait pas \u201cvioler les intentions des parties contractantes\u201d que de d\u00e9clarer que la communaut\u00e9 de biens universelle est maintenue entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les ayants-droit de son d\u00e9funt mari, bien que la clause en vertu de laquelle ce dernier d\u00e9clarait c\u00e9der \u00e0 ses enfants du premier lit tous les biens qu\u2019il poss\u00e8derait lors de sa mort soit retranch\u00e9e du contrat de mariage comme ill\u00e9gale et nulle. Nous croyons, au contraire, que nous violerions les intentions des parties contractantes si, sous pr\u00e9texte que la stipulation relative \u00e0 la succession du mari est nulle, nous d\u00e9clarions que cette nullit\u00e9 entra\u00eene \u00e9galement la disparition de la convention de communaut\u00e9 universelle.\nLa communaut\u00e9 universelle et la disposition de la succession du mari sont deux conventions distinctes; et l\u2019annulation de la derni\u00e8re n\u2019affecte pas l\u2019existence de la premi\u00e8re. Le contrat de mariage reste valable pour le surplus (Mignault, Droit Civil Canadien, vol. VI, p. 141). C\u2019est, d\u2019ailleurs, la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en sont venus le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et quatre des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nQuant \u00e0 la question de savoir si, malgr\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 de la donation \u00e0 cause de mort en faveur des enfants du premier mariage, qui sont maintenant les appelants, l\u2019obligation demeure pour eux de payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e une somme de $2,000 qu\u2019elle gardera en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9, nous sommes d\u2019avis, comme la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, que cette obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e aux enfants en consid\u00e9ration de la donation \u00e0 cause de mort qui leur \u00e9tait faite par la clause elle-m\u00eame, et que, la donation \u00e9tant nulle, la nullit\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de payer $2,000 en r\u00e9sulte n\u00e9cessairement.\nLes appelants ont demand\u00e9 que, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, les frais du pr\u00e9sent appel soient charg\u00e9s contre la masse de la communaut\u00e9, sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation du contrat dont toutes les parties sont appel\u00e9es \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier. Les appelants, lorsqu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de porter la pr\u00e9sente cause devant cette Cour, avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de leurs pr\u00e9tentions, les jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi; et, dans les circonstances, nous n\u2019aurions pas de justification pour adjuger les frais ainsi que les appelants le demandent.\nL\u2019appel sera donc rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: St-Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bourgeois, Poisson & Heaton.\n[1] [1921] 1 A.C. 294, at 301.\n"}

Hutson; and Others (Five Fire Insurance Companies) (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1936: November 18, 19; 1937: February 2.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLandlord and tenant\u2014Negligence\u2014Evidence\u2014Fire occurring in building occupied by lessee\u2014Claim by lessor against lessee for amount of loss\u2014Fire starting during cleaning operations in which gasolene used\u2014Cause of fire uncertain\u2014Res ipsa loquitur.\nDefendant was in possession of a building under a lease from the plaintiffs H. (hereinafter called the plaintiffs), who had erected it for defendant\u2019s use as an automobile service garage and in sale of automobile parts. While defendant\u2019s employees (on a hot day, when the windows and doors were open) were cleaning a cement floor on the ground floor of the building, using gasolene, and scraping and scrubbing, and washing with oakite, heated in a tank on the ground floor by means of two gas jets under the tank, and washing off with water from a hose, a \u201cwhoof\u201d (so described) occurred and flames appeared over said cement floor and a fire occurred which damaged the building. Plaintiffs sued to recover from defendants for the loss.\nIn the lease plaintiffs covenanted to pay taxes and insurance premiums; defendant covenanted to \u201crepair, according to notice in writing, reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire, lightning and tempest * * * only excepted\u201d (but was not required to make repairs to the roof, nor exterior or structural repairs) and that it would \u201cleave the premises in good repair, reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire, lightning and tempest only excepted.\u201d The lease provided that if the building should be \u201cso damaged by fire or other casualty or happening as to be substantially destroyed,\u201d then the lease should cease and any unearned rent paid in advance should be apportioned and refunded to defendant; but in case the building was not substantially destroyed, the premises should be restored by plaintiffs and a just proportion of the rent should abate until such restoration.\nThe exact cause of the ignition was not shown. Expert witnesses for plaintiffs testified that gasolene when vaporized was dangerous and that, given the proper proportions of air and gasolene vapour, ignition might be caused by a naked flame or an electric spark or a hot body such as a red-hot iron. Witnesses for defendant testified that, in such cleaning, it was customary to use gasolene and scraper and brushes followed by an application of some cleansing substance, the whole washed off with water; but, as found in this Court, the evidence fell short of proving that it was the usual practice to clean such an area as that in question in the elapsed time under the conditions that existed that day. Held (affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1936] O.R. 225) that defendant should be held liable.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis J.: The circumstances established in evidence afforded reasonable evidence of negligence in the sense that, in the absence of explanation, the proper inference was that the damage caused was the result of defendant\u2019s negligence; and the explanations advanced were not of sufficient weight either to overturn or to neutralize the force of the inference arising from the facts proved.\nThe application and effect, in certain classes of cases, of the principle called res ipsa loquitur discussed and explained.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: A tenant is liable in damages to his landlord for waste, voluntary or permissive (Yellowly v. Gower, 11 Ex. 274; The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 137, ss. 28, 31). By virtue of The Accidental Fires Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 146, in the absence of any relevant stipulation between a landlord and tenant, the latter would not be liable for any damage occasioned by a fire which should \u201caccidentally begin\u201d on the premises. The words \u201caccidentally begin,\u201d as used in the Act, do not include a fire caused by negligence (Filliter v. Phippard, 11 Q.B. 347; Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Phelps, 14 Can. S.C.R. 132; Port Coquitlam v. Wilson, [1923] S.C.R. 235). The effect of the above-mentioned clauses of the lease (discussed) was to leave defendant liable for damage by a fire caused through its negligence. The evidence established negligence on its part: the operations being under its control and the accident being such \u201cas in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care\u201d, the maxim res ipsa loquitur served to make the circumstances \u201creasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant that the accident arose from want of care\u201d (Scott v. London & St. Katherine Docks Co., 3 H. & C. 596); defendant did not show that at the time of the explosion the gas jets were not lighted, and it failed to suggest any explanation or warrantable inference as to the cause of the fire, and plaintiffs were entitled to rely on said maxim.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Rose, C.J.H.C, dismissing the action.\nThe action was brought to recover for damage to a building by a fire which occurred while the building was in the defendant\u2019s possession under a lease to it from the plaintiffs Hutson. The action was brought in the names of the said plaintiffs Hutson and of certain fire insurance companies who alleged that they had paid the plaintiffs Hutson the sum of $19,493 for and in respect of the loss and damage caused to the plaintiffs Hutson by the fire in certain proportionate amounts and that the insurance companies respectively had demanded and accepted subrogation of all rights of recovery against the defendant to the extent of the payments made by said insurance companies respectively to the plaintiffs Hutson. The plaintiffs claimed judgment for said sum of $19,493 in such proportionate amounts to the insurance companies and alternatively damages in the sum of $19,493.\nRose C.J.H.C. dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and directed judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $11,000 (which amount had been suggested, upon reasons given, though not definitely fixed, by the trial judge, for assistance in settlement in case of a reversal of his finding upon the general question of liability. This amount was not in dispute in the appeals).\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Kerwin J. now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and W. J. Beaton K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and F. Erichsen-Brown K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the argument of the appeal before us the respondents\u2019 case was put upon the ground of negligence and the sole question argued was whether or not the evidence justified the judgment of the Court of Appeal upon that basis. I am satisfied that the circumstances established in evidence afford reasonable evidence of negligence in the sense that, in the absence of explanation, the proper inference is that the damage caused was the result of the negligence of the appellants; and that the explanations advanced are not of sufficient weight either to overturn or to neutralize the force of the inference arising from the facts proved.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, but it is desirable, perhaps, to add a word upon the principle which is often called res ipsa loquitur.\nIn truth, that phrase is comprehensively applied to cases widely differing in their essential characteristics. Most frequently it is applied where the principle stated in Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Co.[2] comes into play. It is there expounded in these words: There must be reasonable evidence of negligence. But where the thing is shewn to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.\nBroadly speaking, in such cases, where the defendant produces an explanation equally consistent with negligence and with no negligence, the burden of establishing negligence still remains with the plaintiff. That is necessarily involved in the following passages from the judgment of Lord Halsbury in Wakelin\u2019s case[3]:\nMy Lords, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff in this case to establish by proof that her husband\u2019s death has been caused by some negligence of the defendants, some negligent act, or some negligent omission, to which the injury complained of in this case, the death of the husband, is attributable. That is the fact to be proved. If that fact is not proved the plaintiff fails, and if in the absence of direct proof the circumstances which are established are equally consistent with the allegation of the plaintiff as with the denial of the defendants, the plaintiff fails, for the very simple reason that the plaintiff is bound to establish the affirmative of the proposition; \u201cEi qui affirmat non ei qui negat incumbit probation.\u201d * * *\nIf the simple proposition with which I started is accurate, it is manifest that the plaintiff, who gives evidence of a state of facts which is equally consistent with the wrong of which she complains having been caused by\u2014in this sense that it could not have occurred without\u2014her husband\u2019s own negligence as by the negligence of the defendants, does not prove that it was caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence. She may indeed establish that the event has occurred through the joint negligence of both, but if that is the state of the evidence the plaintiff fails, because \u201cin pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis.\u201d It is true that the onus of proof may shift from time to time as matter of evidence, but still the question must ultimately arise whether the person who is bound to prove the affirmative of the issue, i.e., in this case the negligent act done, has discharged herself of that burden.\nThe phrase res ipsa loquitur is, however, used in connection with another class of cases where, by force of a specific rule of law, if certain facts are established then the defendant is liable unless he proves that the occurrence out of which the damage has arisen falls within the category of inevitable accident. One of these cases is that in which a ship in motion has run into a ship at anchor. The rule of law in such a case is set forth by Fry, L.J., in The Merchant Prince[4]:\nIt is a case in which a ship in motion has run into a ship at anchor. The law appertaining to that class of case appears to be clear. In the case of The Annot Lyle[5] it was laid down by Lord Herschell that in such a case the cause of the collision might be an inevitable accident, but unless the defendants proved this they are liable in damages. The burden rests on the defendants to shew inevitable accident.\nThat appears to be the kind of case contemplated by the passage in the judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Wright in Winnipeg Electric Co. v. Geel[6]. There appears to be no satisfactory ground for thinking that their Lordships in that passage intended to say that where the circumstances, in the absence of explanation, afford reasonable ground for negligence, the onus is in the strict sense always shifted and that, in point of law, the burden always rests upon the defendant to establish affirmatively that he is not guilty of negligence. The fair construction of that passage seems to be that their Lordships there are dealing with cases in which there is a presumption of law established by the law itself that, certain facts being established, the defendant is liable. When that is so, to recur to the passage quoted above from Fry, L.J., the onus is upon the defendant to establish affirmatively inevitable accident or, in other words, absence of negligence on his part.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The appellant company (defendant) is the lessee of certain premises in Toronto owned by Hutson Brothers (two of the respondents), by virtue of a lease under seal. Only the following provisions of the lease need be mentioned:\nAnd the said Lessee covenants with the said Lessor to pay rent and to pay water and gas rates, electric lighting charges and accounts for power used for any purpose by the Lessee.\nAnd the said Lessor covenants to pay all taxes in connection with the demised premises and all premiums of insurance upon the buildings erected thereon.\nAnd the said Lessor may enter and view state of repair. And that the said Lessee will repair, according to notice in writing, reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire, lightning and tempest, riot or public disorder or act on the part of any governmental authority only excepted; provided nevertheless that the Lessee shall not be required to make repairs to the roof, nor exterior or structural repairs.\n* * *\nAnd that it will leave the premises in good repair, reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire, lightning and tempest only excepted.\n* * *\nIf the building or buildings hereby let shall be so damaged by fire or other casualty or happening as to be substantially destroyed, then this lease shall cease and come to an end and any unearned rent paid in advance by the Lessee shall be apportioned and refunded to it, but in case the building or buildings are not substantially destroyed, then the demised premises shall be restored to their condition immediately prior to such damage or destruction with due diligence by the Lessor and a just proportion of the rent hereinbefore reserved, according to the extent of the injury or damage sustained by the demised premises, shall abate until the demised premises shall have been so restored and put in proper condition for use and occupancy. * * *\nOn June 16th, 1934, while the appellant was in possession under the lease, the building on the land was damaged. This building had been erected by Hutsons for the appellant company, to be used by the latter in its business of servicing automobiles and the sale of automobile parts. The building is on the south side of St. Albans street, and the westerly part of the ground floor has a cement floor. About eleven o\u2019clock in the morning of the day the damage occurred, certain employees of the appellant company commenced to clean this floor. While counsel for the appellant strenuously argued that the sketch prepared by the present respondents and placed before the Court of Appeal for Ontario was misleading, and incorrectly indicated the layout of this portion of the building and the positions at the relevant time of three witnesses (employees of the appellant), and while he indicated before us, by reference to a plan filed at the trial, where in his opinion the various sections on the ground floor numbered from one to ten in the sketch used before the Court of Appeal should be, I have come to the conclusion that that sketch correctly shows the situation. It appears as part of the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Masten, and may be found on page 233 of the Ontario Reports for 1936.\nIt should be explained that the squares are not separated by partitions, but apparently correspond to the division lines in the cement floor as it was originally constructed. The cleaning operation consisted of applying approximately one gallon of gasolene to each square, and scraping the surface where necessary with a metal scraper and scrubbing with a stiff brush; after which the surface would be washed with a preparation known as oakite. This oakite was heated in a tank at the south end of the ground floor by means of two gas jets under the tank. After the application of the hot oakite, water from a hose would be turned on each square and the loose material washed into the sewer. Work had commenced at the southwest corner and had proceeded square by square to the north on the west side, and the workmen had then dealt similarly with the other squares on the east side, but proceeding from north to south. As workmen were available, and considering that some, if not all, would be away for lunch, work continued in this way until about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. The weather on the day in question was hot, and the windows and doors were open. The evidence discloses that the witness, Legassicke, was at the point indicated on the sketch; at his request another witness, Bailey, poured gasolene in front of Legassicke, so that the latter might brush the floor with the gasolene. Either he had commenced to brush or was about to do so, when what is described as a \u201c whoof\u201d occurred, and the entire westerly ground floor appeared to be in flames. From the time of the pouring of the gasolene, Bailey had time to walk but a few steps to the east. Best, another workman, also called as a witness, was a little further to the north and considerably east of the other two workmen, and he was burned and was forced to run through the battery room and thence through a window. Bailey and Legassicke ran through the door on the west side of the building, adjoining a lane. It is true that Jones, the appellant\u2019s service manager, gives a different version as to the positions of these men and as to where the fire first occurred. However, Jones was at the front or north end of the building, and, without referring further in detail to the evidence, I am satisfied that Jones is mistaken.\nProfessor Rogers and Professor Bain, called as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs (respondents), testified that gasolene when vaporized was dangerous, and that, given the proper proportions of air and gasolene vapour, ignition might be caused by a naked flame or an electric spark or a hot body such as a red-hot iron. The exact cause of the ignition of the fumes is not shown, but the learned trial Judge concluded that it appeared sufficiently from the evidence that it might have been caused by a spark originated by the scraping or brushing of the floor; and he considered that the testimony of various witnesses called by the defendant showed that the method used by the defendant on the day in question was an ordinary and proper means of cleaning cement floors in garages. It is true that these witnesses testified that, where it was required to clean oil and grease from such floors, it was customary to use gasolene and scrapers and brushes followed by an application of some cleansing substance, the whole washed off with water. But the evidence falls short of proving that it was the usual practice to clean such an area in the elapsed time under the conditions that existed that day. This being so, I am left with the situation that, under the circumstances described, a fire occurred, and no definite explanation is forthcoming as to the cause.\nVarious grounds of liability were suggested by the respondents but a consideration of the relationship between the lessor and lessee and of the rights and duties flowing from that relationship and under the lease will, I believe, resolve the question.\nBy the common law lessees for years were not answerable to their landlords for the accidental or negligent burning of buildings upon the demised premises; but this was altered by the Statutes of Marlebridge and Gloucester, making such tenants liable in damages for waste. This included permissive as well as voluntary waste\u2014Yellowly v. Gower[7]; and see also the provisions of The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 137, ss. 28 and 31:\n28. A tenant by the curtesy, a dowress, a tenant for life, or for years, and the guardian of the estate of an infant, shall be impeachable for waste, and liable in damages to the person injured.\n31. Lessees making or suffering waste on the demised premises without licence of the lessors shall be liable for the full damage so occasioned.\nIf there had been any doubt as to the decision in Yellowly v. Gower7, the word \u201csuffering\u201d in s. 31 of the Ontario statute would seem to have removed it.\nThe Statutes of Marlebridge and Gloucester were followed by those of 6 Anne, ch. 31, and 14 Geo. III, ch. 78, which formed the basis of the Ontario statute now found as The Accidental Fires Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 146:\nNo action shall be brought against any person in whose house or building or on whose land any fire shall accidentally begin, nor shall any recompense be made by him for any damage suffered thereby; but no contract or agreement made between landlord and tenant shall be hereby defeated or made void.\nIn the absence of any relevant stipulation between a landlord and tenant, the latter, by virtue of the provisions of this Act, would not be liable for any damage occasioned by a fire which should \u201caccidentally begin.\u201d Many years ago it was decided that this expression did not include a fire caused by negligence\u2014Filliter v. Phippard[8] and this decision has been followed ever since. For two examples in this Court see Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Phelps[9], and Port Coquitlam v. Wilson[10].\nThe concluding portion of the Act, \u201cbut no contract or agreement made between landlord and tenant shall be hereby defeated or made void,\u201d renders it necessary to consider the terms of the lease.\nThat document contains the lessee\u2019s covenant to repair according to notice in writing. No question, however, was raised as to the absence of notice; in fact, the pleadings and the argument before this Court contain no reference as to the effect of the covenants, the respondents alleging liability on the ground of waste and on other grounds unconnected with the provisions of the lease. But the question of negligence was fought out at the trial and argued in the successive courts.\nCertain exceptions to the obligation to repair are contained in the covenant, viz.:\nreasonable wear and tear and damage by fire, lightning and tempest, riot or public disorder or act on the part of any governmental authority only excepted;\nand by the last of the clauses extracted from the lease it is provided that if the building is\nso damaged by fire or other casualty or happening as to be substantially destroyed\nthen the lease should cease,\nbut in case the building or buildings are not substantially destroyed, then the demised premises shall be restored * * * by the Lessor.\nand a provision is added for the proportionate abatement of the rent until such restoration. The effect of these various clauses is to leave the appellant liable for damage by a fire caused through its negligence. Even without the, clause last referred to, the appellant could not be relieved from such liability under the exception in the covenant to repair. It would require much stronger language to permit the appellant to escape payment for damages caused by its negligence; and while the terms \u201ccasualty or happening\u201d in the last clause may be susceptible of an innocuous meaning in this connection, so far as the appellant is concerned, they may certainly not be treated as assisting it in any contrary interpretation.\nSo far as the courts of Ontario are concerned, the view here expressed was set forth in a judgment of the Divisional Court as long ago as 1907 in Morris v. Cairncross[11], as appears from the judgment of that court delivered by Sir William Meredith at page 570,\u2014in this respect agreeing with the opinion of Chancellor Boyd, as expressed at p. 549.\nIn Port Coquitlam v. Wilson[12], which was not a dispute between landlord and tenant, it was stated at page 243 that,\nOn principle, since the statute creates an exception to the general rule, the onus ought to be upon the defendant alleging that the statute applies to shew that the fire did accidentally begin; but the point is no doubt an arguable one with the weight of dicta probably in favour of an answer in the opposite sense.\nIt was found unnecessary to pass upon the point in that case and it is also unnecessary in the case at bar, since the evidence clearly establishes negligence on the part of the appellant.\nPresuming the onus to rest upon the respondents, the record discloses that the appellant used gasolene in the manner and under the circumstances already specified and that a mixture of gasolene fumes and air is dangerous and will ignite in the ways described by Professors Rogers and Bain; an explosion did occur; gasolene had been used in the past in other garages to clean cement floors without an explosion; at the time of the fire the appellant\u2019s servants were working near the gas jets. The operations being under the control of the appellant and the accident being such \u201cas in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care,\u201d the doctrine res ipsa loquitur serves to make these circumstances \u201creasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.\u201d Scott v. London & St. Katherine Docks Co.[13].\nThe appellant did not show that at the time of the explosion the gas jets were not lighted, and, as already indicated, I agree with the Court of Appeal that there is nothing to warrant the inference that the fire occurred in the manner suggested by the appellant and mentioned by the trial Judge. The appellant therefore failed to suggest any explanation of the cause of the fire and the respondents are entitled to rely on the maxim.\nIt was argued that, because, subsequent to the fire, the Hutsons and the appellant had entered into an agreement whereby the latter would, during the course of repairing the building or the demised premises, use another building in which the Hutsons were interested, and that the rent paid for the latter should be deducted from the rent agreed upon by the lease in question, the Hutsons must be held to have agreed that the fire had occurred without negligence. It suffices to say that there is nothing in the document warranting any such conclusion, and it is therefore unnecessary to consider what would be the position if it were otherwise, in view of the fact that several insurance companies are plaintiffs (respondents) as well as the Hutsons. These companies had insured the building in question against loss or damage by fire, and, after notice to the appellant, had paid the Hutsons a sum which had been agreed upon to indemnify the latter against the loss.\nThe fact that the owners as well as the insurance companies are plaintiffs renders it unnecessary to consider the two cases cited by Mr. Justice Masten of Mason v. Sainsbury[14], and Darrell v. Tibbitts[15], and also the doctrine that a right of action for damages in the nature of waste, being in respect of a tort, is on grounds of public policy not capable of assignment (see Defries v. Milne[16]). The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beaton, Bell & Ross.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Erichsen-Brown & Strachan.\n[1] [1936] O.R. 225; [1936] 2 D.L.R. 390.\n[2] (1865) 3 H. & C. 596, at 601.\n[3] Wakelin v.

As regards acts within the scope of the company\u2019s objects and, therefore, intra vires of the company and belonging to a class of acts within the powers of the directors, the latter, by reason of their fiduciary obligations in the exercise of such powers, are bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the company.\u2014Acts of the directors within the scope of the powers of the company, although impeachable by the company as a breach of trust, are binding on the company if done with strangers acting in good faith and without knowledge or notice of the breach of trust.\u2014Where the transaction is one between a company represented by the directors and a shareholder, then somewhat different considerations may apply. Where the validity of a forfeiture of shares is called in question in a winding-up on the ground that the act of the directors in professing to forfeit the shares is not binding upon the company, there is an important distinction which ought not to be overlooked. If the proceeding against the shareholder, i.e., a proceeding which in form is one of the kind contemplated by the authority to declare a forfeiture, is in reality in that respect fictitious, aliud simulatum aliud actum, if there has been no call the payment of which could have been enforced, and if in truth the real transaction was a collusive transaction between the directors and a shareholder or group of shareholders to enable a shareholder to surrender his shares and withdraw from the company, then, as between the company and the shareholder who is implicated in the breach of trust, the transaction cannot stand and the shareholder in a winding-up proceeding will properly be treated as a contributory.\u2014The present case is not in any way analogous to such cases and there was in it nothing fictitious about the forfeiture of the shares by the resolution of the directors.\nHeld, also, that the rule, laid down in Spackman v. Evans (L.R. 3 H.L. 171) and approved by this Court in McArthur v. Common (29 Can. S.C.R. 239), that a forfeiture can be declared only when it is in the interests of the company and not when it is for the benefit of the shareholders whose shares are declared to be forfeited, is binding and, where the circumstances warrant it, should be followed; but the circumstances of this case take it out of the operation of that rule.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition with costs.\u2014A winding-up order having been delivered against the Cr\u00e9dit Canadien Incorpor\u00e9 and the appellant having been appointed liquidator, the object of the petition was to have certain resolutions of the directors of the company in liquidation conducive to forfeiture of shares for non-payment of a call made by them declared null and void and the beneficiaries therefrom reinstated as shareholders.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the judgment of Kerwin J.\nJos. Blain K.C. for the appellant.\nL. Forest K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgments of Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson JJ. were delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014I fully agree with the conclusions at which my brother Kerwin has arrived, and also with what, as I understand it, is the basis of that conclusion, viz.: that the evidence discloses no adequate ground for holding the call was not a valid call of which payment could have been enforced; and, further, that the charge is not established by evidence that, in exercising the power of forfeiture in relation to the shares in question in respect of which the call was not paid, the directors were availing themselves of that power for some purpose for which it could not be legitimately employed.\nThere were, it seems, something like one hundred shareholders who failed to pay the call and these were domiciled in different parts of the province. There is no evidence as to the circumstances of these shareholders; and it is impossible to say on the evidence that the directors in the exercise of their responsibility may not have thought that a notice that shares would be forfeited on non-payment would on the whole (especially in view of the fact that the forfeiture would still leave the shareholders liable to the then creditors for the full amount unpaid on their shares) be more productive of results financially than the recovery of judgment against the defaulters with the attendant expense, and with, possibly, barren results.\nNothing more is strictly necessary for the disposition of the appeal; but, in view of some observations in the judgments in the courts below, it is, perhaps, desirable to consider briefly some of the legal principles involved.\nIt is, perhaps, needless to say that, in putting into effect the discretionary authority to declare the forfeiture of shares, the directors are under the obligations which govern persons acting in a fiduciary capacity. Directors have been said to be the \u201cagents of the company\u201d and, again, they have been said to be \u201cin the position of a managing partner,\u201d and, still again, it has been often said that they are \u201ctrustees of their powers.\u201d\nOf course, an act which is ultra vires of the company when done by the directors of the company is void ipso facto. As regards acts within the scope of the company\u2019s objects and, therefore, intra vires of the company and belonging to a class of acts within the powers of the directors, the directors, by reason of their fiduciary obligations in the exercise of such powers, are bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the company.\nThe position of directors is, perhaps, in respect of the execution of their powers, most satisfactorily put in a passage in Lord Lindley\u2019s book on Companies (6th edition) at pp. 509, 510: Directors are not only agents, but to a certain extent trustees for the company and its shareholders * * *, they are not the masters but the servants of the shareholders; and the power of the directors is limited, and accompanied by a trust, and is to be exercised bona fide for the purposes for which it was given, and in the manner contemplated by those who gave it * * * So the powers which the directors have, e.g., \u00f3f calling meetings, electing members of their own board, allotting, transferring and forfeiting shares, making calls, &c., &c., are reposed in them in order that such powers may be bona fide exercised for the benefit of the company as a whole; and any exercise of such powers for other purposes is regarded as breach of trust, and is treated accordingly.\nGenerally speaking, acts of the directors within the scope of the powers of the company, although impeachable by the company as a breach of trust, are binding on the company if done with strangers acting in good faith and without knowledge or notice of the breach of trust. If directors, for example, enter into a contract with a stranger which is within the scope of the objects and powers of the company and, therefore, intra vires of the company, but inconsistent with their fiduciary obligations to the company and the shareholders, as, for example, to procure a profit for themselves, the contract is nevertheless binding upon the company if the other party to the contract is acting in good faith.\nWhere the transaction is one between a company represented by the directors and a shareholder, then somewhat different considerations may apply. Where the validity of a forfeiture of shares is called in question in a winding-up on the ground that the act of the directors in professing to forfeit the shares is not binding upon the company, there is an important distinction which ought not to be overlooked.\nIf the proceeding against the shareholder, that is to say, a proceeding which in form is one of the kind contemplated by the authority to declare a forfeiture, is in reality in that respect fictitious, aliud simulation, aliud actum, to employ Lord Westbury\u2019s phrase, if there has been no call the payment of which could have been enforced, and if in truth the real transaction was a collusive transaction between the directors and a shareholder or group of shareholders to enable a shareholder to surrender his shares and withdraw from the company, then, as between the company and the shareholder who is implicated in the breach of trust, the transaction cannot stand and the shareholder in a winding-up proceeding will properly be treated as a contributory. The transactions in the liquidation of the Agriculturist Cattle Insurance Company, in which the forfeiture was held to be invalid, were of this character. In Spackman\u2019s case[1], Lord Westbury said:\nIf a declaration of forfeiture proceeds upon and is the result of a collusive agreement, but is entered by the directors in the books of the company as if it were a bona fide adverse proceeding, the entry is a false statement involving a fraudulent concealment of the trust, for the suppression of the truth is a form of falsehood, and falsehood is fraud, and it is impossible under such circumstances of imposition on the other shareholders that the shareholder who sets up the forfeiture can make a case of acquiescence or derive any benefit from lapse of time whilst the truth remains unknown.\nIt should be observed here that the ground upon which such transactions are held invalid is not because of mala fides in the sense that the directors are not acting as they conceive in good faith for the good of the company as a whole. The ground is that there has been, in the words of that great judge, Turner L.J., in Bennett\u2019s case[2] \u201can illegal exercise of a legal power and, such being the case, the act of the directors will effectuate nothing notwithstanding that they honestly believed they were acting in the best interests of everybody.\nThe case before us is not in any way analogous to such cases. There was nothing fictitious about the forfeiture here, as I have already pointed out.\nThe forfeiture proceedings may be affected by a breach of trust in other ways. A proceeding may be taken by the directors in violation of the good faith they owe to the company and to the shareholders because the purpose of the proceeding is to benefit themselves personally or some individual shareholder or some group of shareholders at the expense or to the detriment of the shareholders as a whole. A board of directors resorting, for example, to forfeiture with the intention of disposing of the forfeited shares by selling them to themselves or their nominees with the object of obtaining or maintaining control of the company would be committing a breach of trust in respect of which the company would be entitled to relief against the directors as well as against the collusive purchasers. It does not necessarily follow (as between the company, or the liquidator in a winding-up proceeding, and the forfeited shareholder, against whom the proceeding was an adverse proceeding founded upon a valid call and who was entirely innocent and ignorant of the wrongful design of the directors,) that the validity of the forfeiture could be impeached and the forfeited shareholder held liable as a contributory. On principle it would appear that the shareholder, being at arm\u2019s length with the directors, could not be prejudicially affected by the breach of trust in respect of which he was completely ignorant and innocent.\nIn virtually all of the numerous judgments in the liquidation to which reference has been made the collusiveness of the transaction is insisted upon. Here, there is not the slightest evidence of collusion. Having regard, however, to the conclusions of fact above stated, I do not base my decision upon this ground.\nThe argument of the appellant mainly rests upon Spackman v. Evans[3] and Common v. McArthur[4], but, before entering upon a discussion of these cases, it is convenient, I think, to reproduce textually sections 59 and 60 of the Quebec Companies Act, R.S.Q. 1925, c. 223. I make use of the English version because in that version sections 59 and 60 correspond (with one immaterial discrepancy) word for word with sections 75 and 76 of the Dominion Companies Act.\n59. If, after such demand or notice as is prescribed by the letters patent, or by resolution of the directors, or by the by-laws of the company, any call made upon any share is not paid within such time as, by such letters patent or by resolution of the directors or by the by-laws, is limited in that behalf, the directors, in their discretion, by vote to that effect duly recorded in their minutes, may summarily declare forfeited any shares whereon such payment has not been made; and the same shall thereupon become the property of the company and may be disposed of as, by the by-laws of the company or otherwise, they prescribe; but notwithstanding such forfeiture, the holder of such shares at the time of forfeiture shall continue liable to the then creditors of the company for the full amount unpaid on such shares at the time of forfeiture, less any sums which are subsequently received by the company in respect thereof.\n60. The directors may, if they see fit, instead of declaring forfeited any share or shares, enforce payment of all calls, and interest thereon, by action in any court of competent jurisdiction; and in such action it shall not be necessary to set forth the special matter, but it shall be sufficient to declare that the defendant is a holder of one share or more, stating the number of shares, and is indebted in the sum of money to which the calls in arrears amount, in respect of one call or more, upon one share or more, stating the number of calls and the amount of each call whereby an action has accrued to the company under this Part. A certificate under the seal of the company, and purporting to be signed by any of its officers, to the effect that the defendant is a shareholder, that such calls have been made, and that so much is due by him thereon, shall be received in all courts as evidence to that effect.\nCounsel for the appellants relied upon certain passages in the judgment of Lord Cranworth in Spackman v. Evans[5]. In that case the House of Lords had to pass upon the question whether the appellant was properly placed upon the list of contributories in the winding up of a joint stock company which had been incorporated by deed of settlement under the statute of 7 & 8 Vict. By the deed of settlement the directors were invested with power to declare the forfeiture of shares for the non-payment of calls. Dealing with the articles of the deed under which the power of forfeiture arose, Lord Cranworth (at p. 186) used these words:\nThe deed, it is true, gives to the directors the power of declaring a forfeiture of shares the holders of which refuse or neglect to pay their calls. But it is plain that this is a power intended to be exercised only when the circumstances of the shareholder may make its exercise expedient for the interests of the company, not a power to be exercised for the interest, or supposed interest, of the shareholder. This is plain from the very nature of the power, and it is made even more obvious from various provisions and stipulations contained in some other clauses in the deed. In the 125th clause, which confers the power of declaring a forfeiture, it is expressly stipulated that the directors, instead of declaring a forfeiture, may, if they think fit, enforce payment of the instalment, meaning obviously by means of legal proceedings. In the next clause (the 126th) they are empowered to restore the forfeited share to the holder on payment of a fine; and by the 182nd clause, the directors are empowered to sell forfeited shares, but only so many of them as shall be sufficient to raise the sum for non-payment whereof the forfeitrue was incurred and the expenses, and all shares not so sold are to revert and be restored to the person who held them at the time of the forfeiture.\nThese provisions are strong to shew that the power to declare shares forfeited was intended only to give to the directors additional means of compelling payment of calls, or other money due from the shareholder to the company by virtue of the deed. The shares are, in substance, made a security to the company for the money from time to time becoming due from the shareholder. The duty of the directors, when a call is made, is to compel every shareholder to pay to the company the amount due from him in respect of that call; and they are guilty of a breach of their duty to the company if they do not take all reasonable means for enforcing that payment. In the present case it has never been even suggested that the appellant was insolvent, that he was not perfectly able to pay the full 30s. per share, which was the amount of his call; and it was a plain breach of trust in the directors to take, in discharge of money due from the appellant, shares over which they had power as a security only for the money due, but which shares they knew to be valueless. They were bound, as trustees for the body of shareholders, to enforce payment of the whole 30s. per share, and for that purpose to take all proper legal proceedings, unless they bona fide believed that he was not in circumstances which would enable him to pay the sum for which he was sued, and there has never been even a suggestion that this was the case.\nI have quoted this passage in full for reasons which will appear as I proceed.\nIn Common v. McArthur[6], this Court appears to have thought that these observations of Lord Cranworth govern the application of the provisions of the Dominion Companies Act (now sections 75 and 76 of that statute). If the question were entirely res nova, I should have said without hesitation that these observations of Lord Cranworth could not be properly resorted to as affording in all cases a rule governing proceedings under the statute now before us or under the corresponding provisions of the Dominion Companies Act; but it is necessary to consider Common v. McArthur6.\nAs Lord Cranworth himself points out, by the provisions of the deed of settlement which dictated the decision in that case, the directors might enforce payment of the call by means of legal proceedings; but they were empowered to restore the forfeited share to the holder on the payment of a fine; and although the directors were empowered to sell the forfeited shares, the sale of such shares was restricted so that the proceeds should, as far as practicable, not exceed the sum for the non-payment of which the forfeiture had been incurred, and all forfeited shares not so sold had to be restored to the person who held them at the time of the forfeiture. In view of these provisions, the conclusion was inevitable that the power of forfeiture was intended only to give an additional means of compelling the payment of calls and that the shares were, in substance, merely a security to the company for the payments from time to time becoming due from the shareholder; and, further, that it was a plain breach of trust in the directors to take, in discharge of money due from the appellant (a solvent person), shares over which they had power as security only for the money due, but which shares they knew to be valueless.\nThe provisions of the statute before us contain no enactments corresponding to these stipulations of the deed of settlement mentioned. The power given by the statute is to forfeit summarily on the proper notice any share in respect of which the call has not been paid. The directors are invested with discretion as to the exercise of the power. Upon the declaration of forfeiture, all shares becoming the property of the company may be disposed of \u201cas by the by-laws of the company or otherwise they prescribe.\u201d There is nothing in this section authorizing a remission of the forfeiture by the directors; nor is there anything limiting the power of the company in prescribing the manner in which forfeited shares shall be disposed of. There is nothing requiring the company to return the surplus of the proceeds of any sale over and above the amount due in respect of the call and expenses to the shareholder, nor to return unsold shares after the company has, by sale of some of the forfeited shares, realized sufficient to pay the call and such expenses. It may be that it would be competent for the company by by-law so to direct, but in the absence of such direction, there would appear to be no justification for holding that the shares must in this connection be considered merely as security for moneys due to the company in respect of calls.\nI think, subject to Common v. McArthur[7], that under the statute with which we are dealing, it may be said that the object of the power of forfeiture with which the directors are invested is that the directors, as representing the company, shall be enabled for the benefit of the company and adversely to the shareholder to forfeit his shares if he fails to pay his calls. The enactment does not contemplate . a cancellation such as those in question in the cases arising out of the liquidation of Agriculturist Cattle Insurance Company where cancellation was made in each case at the request of the subscriber and not by adverse forfeiture.\nIn Common v. McArthur7, Mr. Justice Sedgwick, delivering the judgment of this Court, applied the passages already quoted from Lord Cranworth\u2019s judgment to a case governed by the provisions of the Dominion Companies Act. The observations of Mr. Justice Sedgwick on this point, however, do not appear to have formed part of the ratio decidendi because the decision really proceeded upon the point that there was no forfeiture, or that the forfeiture was fictitious because the resolution declaring the forfeiture, reciting that McArthur had failed to pay calls \u201cmade on said stock,\u201d was in this respect stating something which was contrary to the fact. The transaction in question in McArthur\u2019s case[8] was one entered into at McArthur\u2019s request and the manifest purpose of it was to relieve him from responsibility as a shareholder. The company was hopelessly insolvent and there appears to have been no doubt about the solvency of McArthur. I cannot regard Common v. McArthur8 as an authority requiring us to hold that, in exercising the power of forfeiture under the Dominion Companies Act, or in the statute now before us, a board of directors is in all cases bound to follow in detail the course indicated by Lord Cranworth\u2019s remarks in the passage quoted above from his judgment in Spackman v. Evans[9]. These remarks, it is proper to observe, concerned a case in which it was presumed that the shareholders were solvent and admitted that the shares were worthless.\nI must not be understood to say that the failure to pursue the personal remedy, coupled with the forfeiture of the shares, may not, where the shareholder is a solvent person and the shares are valueless, be evidence in support of an allegation that the directors have been aiming at ulterior and improper ends inconsistent with their fiduciary character in declaring the forfeiture or, if the shareholder is implicated, establish a valid ground for treating the forfeiture as ineffectual.\nOn the other hand, doubts have unquestionably arisen upon the question whether or not, under the statutes we are now considering, the respective remedies of forfeiture and recovery by action of the amount of the call from the shareholders are not mutually exclusive. Where a share has been forfeited, of course, the shareholder is no longer a shareholder as respects that share and cannot be required by the company to pay a call in respect of it.\nThe language of section 60 is, perhaps, susceptible of the construction suggested, viz., that if the company sues a shareholder for payment of a call and pursues its suit to judgment, the company loses the alternative remedy of forfeiture; and that is a circumstance which may have influenced the directors in the case before us.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgments of Crocket and Kerwin JJ. were delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The appellant is the liquidator of the Cr\u00e9dit Canadien Incorpor\u00e9. Pursuant to an order of the Superior Court permitting it so to do, the liquidator instituted proceedings by petition in which it sought a decree that a certain forfeiture of shares of the company, declared by resolution of the directors on December 10th, 1929, had not been \u201cl\u00e9galement, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et justement prononc\u00e9e.\u201d It also asked a declaration that in passing that resolution and two others, dated respectively February 14th, 1928, and March 27th, 1928, the directors had acted ultra vires and against the interests of the company. Apparently it was deemed advisable to have the questions in dispute determined before a list of contributories should be settled but, as will be pointed out, it was by the resolution of February 14th, 1928, that a call of ten dollars per share had been made and the real attack is not upon that call but against the declaration of forfeiture. Accordingly and notwithstanding the form of the petition, the only point argued before us was whether the forfeiture was ultra vires the company.\nThe company was incorporated August 5th, 1912, by letters patent of the province of Quebec, granted under the provisions of the Quebec Companies Act. By these letters patent the company was authorized to issue ten thousand shares of the par value of one hundred dollars each. The capital had been fully subscribed by 1919, but prior to 1928 it had been found necessary to make but one call, and that of ten dollars per share. However, from time to time bonuses totalling seven dollars per share had been declared, which had been credited to the shareholders\u2019 stock accounts, and some of the shareholders had paid in advance on account of their shares the sum of $76,171. At the end of December, 1927, the paid up capital was $266,171.\nWhile at first the business of the company had been profitable, losses were subsequently suffered and it was found necessary to provide further working capital. Early in 1928 it was decided to endeavour to reorganize the capital structure and correspondence with the Attorney-General\u2019s Department ensued. All of this correspondence is not produced but sufficient appears from a letter from the department to indicate that the directors had been considering reducing the capital. No further steps were taken in connection with this proposal, but on February 14th, 1928, at a meeting of the directors, a call was made of ten dollars per share, payable March 20th, 1928. On March 27th, 1928, the directors passed the following resolutions:\u2014\nR\u00e9solu:\u2014Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9, d\u00fbment second\u00e9, et unanimement r\u00e9solu:\u2014\nAttendu que le 14 f\u00e9vrier 1928, une r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par les directeurs de cette compagnie d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant qu\u2019un appel de 10% serait fait aux actionnaires de la compagnie, cet appel devant \u00eatre payable le 20 mars 1928;\nAttendu que certains actionnaires ont fait d\u00e9faut de payer cet appel de 10%, et\nAttendu que la dite r\u00e9solution du 14 f\u00e9vrier 1928 a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 la connaissance des dits actionnaires avec avis d\u2019avoir \u00e0 s\u2019y conformer dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit.\nQu\u2019il soit en cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9solu que les actions de ceux qui n\u2019auront pas pay\u00e9 le dit versement avant le 21 avril 1928 soient sommairement confisqu\u00e9es, et qu\u2019\u00e0 compter de ce moment, elles appartiennent \u00e0 la compagnie qui pourra en disposer selon que les directeurs l\u2019ordonneront, et qu\u2019avis de la pr\u00e9sente r\u00e9solution soit donn\u00e9 sans d\u00e9lai par le secr\u00e9taire de la compagnie.\nThe owners of 7,163 shares had paid the call so that any forfeiture would affect the holders of only 2,837 shares. It is true that some time previously there had been negotiations for the sale of the assets of the company, or, at any rate, endeavours by some of the directors to sell their holdings with a view of securing further capital. It was contended that the result of the evidence was to indicate that these directors, if not all, were really using the power of forfeiture in order to reduce the capital of the company and endeavour to sell their own holdings but such a finding is not warranted. There is no suggestion of fraud on the part of the directors or any of them. There could not very well be as not one of the directors was the holder of any of the forfeited shares, and on December 9th, 1930, a further call of ten per cent was made on the holders of the remaining 7,163 shares.\nIn order to complete the narrative attention must be called to the resolution of December 10th, 1929, by which, after referring to the call made on February 14th, 1928, it was specifically declared that the shares, the holders of which had not paid the call, should be forfeited. It was explained that the delay between March, 1928, and December, 1929, was because the directors, until they were advised by the company\u2019s solicitors that a formal declaration of forfeiture was necessary, had overlooked the matter.\nA forfeiture of shares is invalid if it is not made for the company\u2019s benefit, and in every instance where, as here, there is no suggestion as to the absence of any formality, the inquiry must be limited to a consideration of this problem.\nIn view of all the circumstances, it is impossible to conclude that the forfeiture was not in the interests of the company. Section 59 of the Quebec Companies Act, R.S.Q., 1925, chapter 223, imposes an obligation upon those who held forfeited shares to pay the debts of the company which existed at the time of the forfeiture but this obligation is not in question in these proceedings. While the effect of the forfeiture is that, subject to this provision, the holders of the forfeited shares are relieved from their liability for the amount unpaid on the shares and thus a heavier burden is cast upon those who have paid the calls and are still the holders of shares not fully paid for, the court has no power to declare the forfeiture ultra vires unless it is able to determine that the action of the directors was a fraud upon the power to forfeit. It is true that the directors made no effort to ascertain whether the holders of the shares they were about to forfeit were solvent but the position must be the same as if the company had prospered and the holders of such shares had then sought to set aside the forfeiture. To state the problem in this way is on the evidence to indicate but one answer.\nIn view of some observations in the reasons for judgment in the courts below, it is advisable to refer to two cases mentioned therein, Spackman v. Evans[10], and Common v. McArthur[11]. The majority judgment in the case first mentioned has always been considered as authoritatively determining that a power to forfeit may not be exercised for the benefit of a shareholder, and it was so treated in this Court in the Common case11. These decisions are binding and, where the circumstances warrant it, should be followed. Sections 58 and 59 of the Quebec Companies Act, R.S.Q., 1925, chapter 223, dealing with the power of the directors to forfeit and enforce payment of calls by action, are, except for a few immaterial changes, the same as sections 41 and 42 of the Dominion Companies Act, R.S.C., 1886, chapter 119, which were in force when the Common case (1) was decided. The mere fact that by the first of these sections a discretion is given to the directors to forfeit and that by the later section\nthe directors may, if they see fit, instead of declaring forfeited any share or shares, enforce payment of all calls\ndoes not absolve the directors from obeying the established rule that a forfeiture can be declared only when it is in the interests of the company and not when it is for the benefit of the shareholders whose shares are declared to be forfeited.\nAs already indicated, however, the circumstances of this case take it out of the operation of the rule. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mercier, Blain & Fauteux.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Lionel Forest.\n[1] (1864) 34 L.J.

Sec, 5 of The Seduction Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 102, enacts that \"notwithstanding anything in this Act an action for seduction may be maintained by any unmarried female who has been seduced, in her own name, in the same manner as an action for any other tort and in any such action she shall be entitled to such damages as may be awarded.\" At the trial the jury found that the present appellant, an unmarried female, and a plaintiff in the action, was seduced by defendant, and that she suffered damage in an amount of $10,000. The trial judge (Ives J.) dismissed her action, on the ground that damage is the gist of the action, that the damage necessary to found a right of action in the woman must be of the same character as gave the master his right of action, i.e., loss of service, or at least an interference with the woman's ability to serve, and that there was no evidence of such damage ([1934] 2 W.W.R. 511). The dismissal of the action was (by a majority) affirmed by the Appellate Division, Alta. ([1935] 1 W.W.R. 199). On appeal to this Court:\nHeld (Davis J. dissenting), that the appeal be allowed, and appellant have judgment for the amount of the jury's verdict.\nPer Duff C.J., Rinfret and Kerwin JJ.: In view of the decisions of the Appellate Division, Alta., in Gibson v. Rabey, (1916) 9 Alta. L.R. 409, and Tetz v. Tetz, (1922) 18 Alta. L.R. 364, concerning the construction of said s. 5 as it stood prior to its reproduction without material alteration in R.S.A. 1922, c. 102, that reproduction must be taken to have given legislative sanction to the construction put upon the section by those decisions (Barras v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling & Fishing Co., [1933] A.C. 402), and, having regard to the effect of those decisions (discussed), any construction is precluded by force of which the determining factors in the trial of an action of seduction under s. 5 are to be deemed essentially or substantially the same as those in the trial of an action of seduction under the other (preceding) sections of the Act or at common law. Starting from this point, it follows that s. 5 should be construed according to the ordinary meaning of the words and that damage of the special character which is the gist of the action under the other sections of the Act\u2014damage actually or presumptively entailing some loss of service or some disability for service\u2014is not of the gist of the action under s. 5. (Per Kerwin J.: A consideration of the language of s. 5 leads to the same conclusion. The language analyzed and discussed).\nThere was sufficient evidence of damage to support the action. Further, the jury's verdict must stand unless, examining the evidence as a whole, the Court was clearly of opinion that it was one which no jury, acting judicially, could give; and this had not been established by argument. So also as regards damages. It was for the jury to determine whether appellant's evidence, or how much thereof, should be accepted as correct; and on her evidence it could not be said that, if it was accepted, the sum awarded was such as no tribunal of fact acting reasonably could have awarded.\nPer Davis J. (dissenting): Even accepting the appellant's story, she could not, on the facts of the case and upon the broadest possible interpretation most favourable to her of s. 5, succeed unless s. 5 be reduced to giving a cause of action for fornication per se. If the cause of action in s. 5 (excluding necessarily the relation of master and servant) is the same as in the other sections of the Act, the birth of a child or pregnancy or at least some physical disability as a direct result of the conduct complained of is an essential element of that cause of action, and the illness that was proved in this case was too remote and insufficient to sustain the action. If, on the other hand, the cause of action in s. 5 is to be regarded as a new and independent tort, separate and distinct from the action for seduction referred to in the other sections, then, whatever be the essential elements of this new cause of action, there must be at least something in the nature of negation of choice. Taking either interpretation of s. 5, the action failed upon the evidence.\nIn interpreting s. 5, the statute should be read as a whole and s. 5 interpreted, not as an isolated piece of legislation to be given a new meaning and significance, but as part of an entire statute dealing with the same subject-matter. The other (preceding) sections (discussed) necessarily import as an essential ingredient of the cause of action an illegitimate child born or conceived as a result of the relations complained of; and that has always been the common understanding in Canada of the cause of action for seduction. The language of s. 5 analyzed and discussed, and with reference to the language in the other sections. Sec. 5 should not be interpreted so as to import into the words used therein a different quality or meaning from that which the same words have in the other sections. In the cause of action under s. 5 there is necessarily excluded the relation of master and servant as an essential, and with it the necessity for proof of loss of service; but the substance of the cause of action, the birth of a child or at least the condition of pregnancy, remains. The re-enactment of the statute in the revision of 1922 does not touch the point as to the substance of the cause of action, because the fact of birth of a child or pregnancy in the Alberta cases prior to the revision was admitted or accepted by counsel and those cases did not turn upon that question. The evidence in the present case disclosed no cause of action.\nAPPEAL by the female plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] dismissing her appeal from the judgment of Ives J.[2].\nThe action was brought by the present appellant and her father for damages for alleged seduction of her by the defendant. At the trial before Ives J. and a jury, the jury found that the defendant seduced the present appellant and found damages for $10,000 in her favour and for $5,000 in favour of the other plaintiff. Upon announcement of the verdict by the jury, plaintiffs' counsel moved that judgment be entered in accordance therewith and defendant's counsel moved for dismissal of the action, submitting that there was no cause of action shewn. Ives J. reserved judgment and later delivered judgment dismissing the action2. His grounds were stated as follows:\nUpon the verdict being announced by the jury, counsel for the defendant moved for dismissal of the action on the ground that there was no evidence of any interference with the daughter's services to the parent to which he was entitled and no evidence that the seduction in any way interfered with the daughter's ability to serve.\nIt is quite clear that the daughter left her home in Edson with the consent and approval of her parents and was accompanied to Edmonton by her mother. It is equally undoubted that no illness resulted from the seduction and no evidence that the ability of the daughter to render services was in any way interfered with.\nIn my opinion the law is well settled that damage is the gist of the action and I am also of the opinion that the damage necessary to found a right of action in the woman must be of the same character as gave the master his right of action, that is, loss of service, or at least an interference with the woman's ability to serve. I see nothing in our statute to convey a contrary intendment of the Legislature.\nIn my view of the law the action must be dismissed with costs, * * *\nAn appeal by the plaintiffs to the Appellate Division was dismissed (Clarke and Lunney, J.J.A., dissenting as to the appeal of the present appellant)[3]. The present appellant then appealed to this Court.\nThe operative sections of The Seduction Act, R.S.A. 1922, c. 102, read as follows:\nPERSONS ENTITLED TO MAINTAIN ACTION\n2. The father or, in case of his death, the mother (whether she remains a widow or remarries) of any unmarried female who has been seduced and for whose seduction the father or mother could maintain an action in case such unmarried female was at the time dwelling under his or her protection may maintain an action for the seduction, notwithstanding such unmarried female was at the time of her seduction serving or residing with another person upon hire or otherwise.\n[1903(2), c. 8, s. 1.]\n3. Upon the trial of an action for seduction brought by the father or mother it shall not be necessary to prove any act of service performed by the party seduced but the same shall in all cases be presumed and no evidence shall be received to the contrary; but in case the father or mother of the female seduced had before the seduction abandoned her and refused to provide for and retain her as an inmate then any other person who might at common law have maintained an action for the seduction may maintain such action.\n[1903(2), c. 8, s. 2.]\n4. Any person other than the father or mother who by reason of the relation of master or otherwise would have been entitled at common law to maintain an action for the seduction of an unmarried female may still maintain such action if the father or mother is not resident in Alberta at the time of the birth of the child which is born in consequence of the seduction or being resident therein does not bring an action for the seduction within six months from the birth of the child.\n[1903(2), c. 8, s. 3.]\n5. Notwithstanding anything in this Act an action for seduction may be maintained by any unmarried female who has been seduced, in her own name, in the same manner as an action for any other tort and in any such action she shall be entitled to such damages as may be awarded.\n[1903(2), c. 8, s. 4.] N. D. Maclean K.C. for the appellant.\nA. L. Smith K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret J. was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014This appeal raises an important question as to the construction of section 5 of The Seduction Act of Alberta (Cap. 102, R.S.A. 1922) which was first enacted as Cap. 8 of the Ordinances of the North West Territories, 1903.\nThere is undeniably force in the argument that the \"action for seduction,\" which an unmarried female is by that section given the right to institute, rests \"in its essentials\" upon the same cause of action as the \"action for seduction\" which the parents are entitled to bring under sections 2 and 3 of the statute. This is the view which prevailed with the majority of the Appellate Division and is supported by the Chief Justice of Alberta in a powerful judgment.\nEach part of the statute ought, it may fairly be argued, to.be read with each of the other parts; and, reading sections 2 and 3 with section 5, and section 5 with sections 2 and 3, and construing each of these parts of the enactment by the light of the other, and having regard to similarity of language in sections 2 and 5, the contention is by no means without substance that, prima facie, section 5 presupposes a cause of action capable of being asserted by the parents, if (at all events) living in Alberta, and that, given such a cause of action vindicable by the parents, a cause' of action having the same constitutive elements (the parental relations being, of course, in this case irrelevant) is, by section 5, bestowed upon the seduced woman.\nIt follows from this, it is said, that damage of the kind which is the gist of the action under sections 2 and 3 (disability for service resulting from childbirth, pregnancy or physical illness directly due to the sexual intercourse) is also of the essence of the cause of action under section 5.\nThe other view of the section, which was, I think, in effect accepted by Mr. Justice Clarke and Mr. Justice Lunney, may be summarily stated thus:\nSections 2 and 3 are concerned exclusively with conduct that constitutes a wrong to the parents, and, in point of law, the essence of this actionable wrong consists in the fact that it results in some loss of the services of the daughter, or illness entailing (presumptively or actually) some disability for service; while section 5, on the contrary, is concerned exclusively with the wrong which the law, by the parent enactment passed by the Legislature of the North West Territories in 1903, first recognized as effecting a prejudice to the interests of the seduced female herself, in respect of which she is entitled to legal protection, and that the sole purpose of the enactment in section 5 is to provide redress for this wrong.\nThen, it is said, in construing the enactment in which this novel rule and principle of liability are embodied, one would not appear to be justified in imputing to the words employed by the Legislature for that purpose alone, a rather artificial signification derived from the earlier sections which, notwithstanding the similarity of language, do deal with a subject-matter that is widely different; and, it is added, there is less likelihood of frustrating the legislative intention if one gives effect to this enactment according to the commonly understood meaning of the words, having regard, of course, to its manifest purpose. The cause of action under section 5 arises, no doubt, out of an occurrence or occurrences which, assuming the conditions to subsist as to resulting damage, might form the foundation of an action by the parents of the woman. But the action under section 5 is bestowed upon a person who, ex hypothesi, is a voluntary participant in the acts which are the essential basis of her right to redress; and, in consequence, in passing upon a claim for damages under section 5, the tribunal of fact is faced with issues and with considerations of an order totally different in their nature from anything that can arise in considering or adjudicating upon a claim under sections 2 and 3. That circumstance alone, it is said, sharply differentiates, in substance, the cause of action under the later section from that under the earlier.\nFirst of all, it is said that in an action under- sections 2 and 3, on the question whether or not the cause of action has been constituted (as distinguished from the assessment of damage), the conduct of the seduced woman is irrelevant; while leave and licence by the parents, which might be established by proving consent either by words or con duct, would be an answer to the action. In an action under section 5, on the other hand, the conduct of the woman as well as her character both enter into the determination of the existence of the cause of action. The relief given by section 5 presupposes, it is said, that the woman seduced was, at the time she was corrupted by the defendant, a woman of virtuous life and habits; and, moreover, that the words of the section, read according to the meaning they bear in the common language of men, imply that some enticement has been employed by the defendant, or some unfair advantage taken, through which he has induced the woman to have intercourse with him. All this, as has been said, would be irrelevant in an action under the earlier sections, which would lie even in a case in which it appeared that the advances of the woman seeking the gratification of her own desires were the preponderating factor in bringing about the common act. Again, no consent, no enticement or manoeuvring on the part of the parents could be relevant in determining the existence of a cause of action under section 5.\nIn this view, since the action under section 5 has nothing to do with the parental relation, nothing to do with the relation of master and servant, nothing to do with loss of service or service, there is, it is contended, no a priori probability that section 5 contemplates relief conditioned upon the seduction being followed by childbirth or pregnancy or illness directly traceable to physical act of copulation and giving rise to some disability for service; and it is not susceptible of dispute that the language of the section (assuming damages to be of the essence of the cause of action) when read alone, and without colour derived from the preceding sections, neither expresses nor implies such a condition.\nIn passing upon these rival views we are not without assistance from judicial decisions. The ordinance of the North West Territories of 1903 was reproduced in its entirety (with the addition of the heading \"Persons entitled to maintain action \") by Cap. 102 of the R.S.A. 1922, which came into force on the 19th January, 1923, by virtue of a statute which was assented to on the 9th day of March, 1923.\nBefore that date, two decisions were pronounced by the full court of Alberta, one in 1916 and one in 1922, both in the same sense. The decisions are concerned with the construction of section 5 of the North West Territories Ordinance; and, in so far as they involve a construction of that section, they must, we think, be taken to have received legislative sanction when section 5 was reproduced without material alteration in R.S.A. which came into operation in 1923. (Barras v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling & Fishing Co.)[4].\nI turn now to the decisions. The first in Gibson v. Rabey[5]. Two judgments were delivered, one by Scott J., another by Beck J., in which Stuart J. concurred. Scott J. proceeded upon the ground that seduction in section 5 has its ordinary meaning and implies some enticement on the part of the seducer by which a virtuous woman is induced to give herself to him. That appears conclusively from the sentence:\nIn my view the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion the trial judge must have reached that she was enticed and persuaded by\nthe defendant to commit the act. Beck J., in the course of his judgment, observes at p. 414 that,\nThe section of the ordinance already quoted, though awkwardly drafted, inasmuch as in giving the woman herself a right of action it does away with the whole idea of service and loss to a master, by the clearest necessary intendment constitutes the seduction, not mere seduction but seduction followed by damages consequent upon the seduction, the cause of the action. For I think that damage was the \"gist\" of the action in the case, and at all events the ordinance itself, I think, makes it the gist of an action by the woman seduced. It was contended that, in an action by a woman for her own seduction, the word should be interpreted as it appears to be very generally by the American authorities to involve an enticing by the defendant. The history of the action shews that so long as the action was based on loss of service, seduction was ultimately taken to mean no more than having carnal intercourse with. The reason, however, was that damage by way of loss of service was the gist of the action and consent by the servant was no answer to an action by the master.\nHe proceeds, at p. 415:\nNow that the woman herself is enabled to be the plaintiff, 1 think her action is subject to a like defence, that is, if she be the tempter or even if she deliberately consents from lasciviousness or even from the strength of mere natural passion, provided her consent has not been brought about by enticement of the defendant, she cannot recover.\nIn this way, I come in effect to the same conclusion as my brother Scott.\nI think, however, that in the absence of evidence of loose behaviour on the part of the woman, the presumption is that there was enticement on the part of the defendant in cases of this sort and that the burden of shewing that the plaintiff cannot succeed on the ground that she was at least equally morally guilty is on the defendant.\nAlthough it does not appear from the report, it seems that in this case pregnancy supervened, and, consequently, although it is stated by Beck J. that damage is of the gist of the action, no question arose as to the character of the damage necessary to sustain the action.\nThe second decision was pronounced in Tetz v. Tetz[6] by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (Scott C.J. Stuart, Beck, Hyndman and Clarke JJA.) The judgment of the Court was delivered by Beck J.A., and in the course of his judgment he summarizes the judgment of Stuart J. and himself in Rabey's case[7] at pp. 365 and 366, thus:\nIn that case I said that, in my opinion, it would be a defence to an action for seduction if it were shown,(1) that the woman was the tempter, or(2) even if she deliberately consented from lasciviousness or even from the strength of mere natural passion, provided her consent had not been brought about by the enticement of the defendant. To this I added that, in my opinion, in the absence of evidence of loose behaviour on the part of the woman, the presumption is that there was enticement on the part of the man and that the burden of showing that the plaintiff could not succeed on the ground that she was at least equally morally guilty is on the defendant. Stuart J. concurred with me and Scott C.J. (the Court being composed of three members) was evidently of the same opinion.\nNow, it is clear that some points were decided in these two cases touching the construction and effect of section 5. In each it is declared that the plaintiff's right to recover under that section is conditioned in certain specified respects. When the facts are ascertained, it is held, the plaintiff cannot succeed if certain propositions of fact are established concerning the conduct of the plaintiff and defendant towards one another; and the investigation, when the plaintiff's right to recover is disputed, will involve the assignment to one or other of the parties the preponderating role in bringing about the result, the investigation of the part played by the woman's natural passion, and, it may be, the determination of the relative moral guilt of the pair.\nThese decisions, in other words, recognize that, in examining a disputed claim for relief under section 5, the court must deal with issues and considerations which could not arise and would not be relevant in the trial of an action under sections 2 and 3. It is of no importance that the matters mentioned in the judgment of Beck J.A. are said to be matters of defence; the investigation of these matters necessarily results, the judgments recognize, from the fact that the right to relief under section 5 is given to the seduced woman herself.\nSeduction, as Beck J.A. says, at common law and in the earlier sections of the Act signifies nothing more than carnal intercourse. Enticement on one side or the other, relative moral responsibility, and so on, are matters which, as already observed, have no bearing upon the issue as to the existence of the cause of action. Under section 5, according to the decisions, such matters are the determining factors; and, in view of these decisions, since the re-enactment of the statute in 1922, any construction is precluded by force of which the determining factors in the trial of an action of seduction under section 5 are to be deemed essentially or substantially the same as those in the trial of an action of seduction under the earlier sections or at common law.\nThese decisions have nothing to say as to the nature of the damages which must be proved by the plaintiff under section 5, although in the first of them it was definitely stated that under that section damage is the gist of the action.\nStarting from this point, it follows, we think, that section 5 should be construed according to the ordinary meaning of the words and that damage of the special character mentioned\u2014damage actually or presumptively entailing some loss of service or some disability for service\u2014is not of the gist of the action under that section.\nNeither have we any doubt that there was sufficient evidence of damage to support the action.\nThere remains the question raised by the able argument of Mr. Smith in support of his contention that the judgment of the Appellate Division should not be disturbed on the ground that, on the evidence, the only reasonably admissible finding would be one against the plaintiff, or, in the alternative, that there should be a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence and particularly that the damages awarded are unreasonably excessive. This argument presents a question of a type with which the courts are very familiar. It is no part of our duty to ask ourselves what verdict we should find upon the evidence as presented to us in the record without the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses. The settled rule is that the verdict of the jury must stand unless, examining the evidence as a whole, the court is clearly of opinion that it is one which no jury, acting judicially, could give. This, in our opinion, has not been established by argument. So also as regards damages. It was for the jury to determine whether the evidence, or how much of the evidence, of the appellant should be accepted as correct; and we find ourselves unable to say that if her evidence was accepted the sum awarded was such as no tribunal of fact acting reasonably could have awarded.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division should be vacated and in lieu thereof it will be ordered that judgment be entered for the amount of the verdict. The appellant will have her costs throughout.\nKERWIN J.\u2014I agree with the judgment proposed by my Lord the Chief Justice and with the reasons therefor given by him, but I think I should add that a consideration of the language of section 5 of the Act leads me to the same conclusion.\nThe section does not provide that \"the\" action of \"seduction\" may be maintained, but the expression used is \"an action for seduction.\" In the old action of seduction at common law, the master was required to prove an act of service. A parent as master or mistress would not be able to prove that act where the daughter was serving or residing with another person, and, it being deemed that the parent should have a right of action under those circumstances, the first change in the common law, made by statute, was to provide that the parent might maintain an action for seduction notwithstanding the daughter was serving or residing with another person, and it was also provided that the parent need not prove any act of service performed by his daughter for the parent. Then in 1903 when the Ordinance was passed, the intention was to give to the woman, by section 5, a right of action of some sort even though a parent could by statute maintain the ordinary action for seduction notwithstanding the absence of the daughter from home, etc. Hence the expression \"notwithstanding anything in this Act.\" The decisions as to the effect of the first alteration by statute in the common law are clear that, when the new right of action was given to the parent, while the statute provided that evidence of service need not be given, the Act did not dispense with the necessity of proving loss of service. There is no provision in section 5 that in the action thereby given \"it shall not be necessary to prove any act of service performed by the party seduced.\" If the contention that section 5 is speaking of the old form of action be correct, there would appear to be as much reason for the plaintiff to prove actual service (to someone) as the loss of that service.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Alberta was of opinion that the words \"in the same manner as an action for any other tort\" dealt with a mere matter of procedure, but, with respect, it seems to me rather that they are part of the substantive provisions dealing with the right of action thereby given and lend weight to the argument that the unmarried female may maintain a new action and not the old action of seduction.\nThe section concludes that \"she shall be entitled to such damages as may be awarded,\" It does not say that she is entitled to \"the\" damages, thus indicating that the damages in an action brought by her may be on a different basis from the damages that could have been given in an action by a parent.\nHUDSON J. concurred in the result.\nDAVIS J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant, an unmarried female, brought an action for seduction in the Supreme Court of Alberta against the respondent, a married man. The appellant's own story may be shortly but I think fully stated. From October, 1930, until July, 1933, she says she had frequent sexual intercourse with the respondent who she knew from the beginning was a married man with a wife and family. When the relations first commenced she was a girl of about 18 years and 4 months of age. During the summer of 1932 she consulted a physician, as she had lost weight during the two prior years. She says she had \"stomach trouble brought on by nerves\" and she felt \"very tired all the time,\" and that the pills she had been taking to avoid pregnancy had upset her. The physician, who was called by her counsel as a witness at the trial, described her then condition as \"irritable colon,\" an irregular function which \"might be produced by any systemic condition which causes fatigue or running down of the patient by the use of cathartics to correct constipation which had existed \"\u2014and which condition, he said, is frequently associated with a nervous condition. He said that there was no doubt that she was suffering from constipation. At that time she went home to the country to her parents for 5 or 6 weeks' rest. Upon her return to Edmonton, she admits she continued her relations with the respondent. In January, 1933, she says she told with a good deal of remorse a young man of her own age who, she says, was proposing marriage to her, of her relations with the respondent. But she admits she continued thereafter the same relations. In May, 1933, she says that at the instance of the young man she consulted a solicitor. Obviously this was with a view to taking some action against the respondent. But she admits again that she continued thereafter the same frequent relations with the respondent down to July 3rd, 1933. On the evening of July 5th, 1933, she says the young man and the solicitor pursued in a motor car the car in which she and the respondent were driving about the city, and that the respondent became aware that his car was being followed. The respondent was a man prominent in the public life of the province and the episode of that evening appears to have put an end to the relations between the parties, if there ever were any such relations as the appellant describes. Shortly thereafter the writ in this action was issued. It is admitted that there was not a child, or even pregnancy, resulting from the alleged relations. Nor is the action founded upon any misrepresentation, coercion or deceit. It is a suit upon section 5 of the Alberta Seduction Act, being chap. 102 of the Revised Statutes of 1922.\nIn my opinion, one has only to state the facts of this case to see, and I say it with the greatest deference to those from whom I differ, that the appellant cannot succeed upon the broadest possible interpretation, most favourable to the appellant, that can be put upon section 5 unless it be reduced to giving a cause of action for fornication per se. If the cause of action in section 5 (excluding necessarily the relation of master and servant) is the same as in the other sections of the statute, the birth of a child or pregnancy or at least some physical disability as a direct result of the conduct complained of is an essential element of that cause of action, and the illness that was proved in this case was too remote and insufficient to sustain the action. If, on the other hand, the cause of action in section 5 is to be regarded as a new and independent tort, separate and distinct from the action for seduction referred to in the other sections of the statute, then, whatever be the essential elements of this new cause of action, there must be, it seems to me, at least something in the nature of negation of choice. Taking either interpretation of section 5, the action, in my opinion, fails upon the evidence.\nThe proper method of interpretation of section 5, in my view, is to read the statute as a whole. Section 5 is part and parcel of the entire statute. The statute is a very short one, there being only four operative sections. It was enacted in its entirety as an ordinance of the North West Territories in 1903 and became part of the statute law of the province of Alberta when that province was formed out of a part of the Territories. The statute has remained unchanged except that in the revision of 1922 a heading in large type \"Persons Entitled to Maintain Action\" was inserted at the commencement of the operative provisions of the statute. Section 5 therefore ought to be interpreted, not as an isolated piece of legislation to be given a new meaning and significance, but as part of an entire statute dealing with the same subject-matter.\nIn examining the statute, it is to be observed that the right of action is given firstly to the father or, in case of his death, to the mother, notwithstanding that the unmarried daughter was at the time of her seduction serving or residing with another person upon hire or otherwise; and proof of acts of service in such case is dispensed with and no evidence shall be received to the contrary. Secondly it is provided that in case the father or mother had before the seduction abandoned the daughter and refused to provide for and retain her as an inmate, then any other person who might at common law have maintained an action for the seduction may maintain such action. Thirdly it is pro vided that any person other than the father or mother \"who by reason of the relation of master or otherwise\" would have been entitled at common law to maintain an action for the seduction of an unmarried female may still maintain such action (and the following words are very significant),\nif the father or mother is not resident in Alberta at the time of the birth of the child which is born in consequence of the seduction or being resident therein does not bring an action for the seduction within six months from the birth of the child.\nThose are all the provisions of the statute save and except the last section, section 5. Now those provisions necessarily import as an essential ingredient of the cause of action an illegitimate child born or conceived as a result of the relations complained of. And that, I believe, has always been the common understanding in Canada of the cause of action for seduction. It is not without its own significance that counsel have not been able to find any case in Canada where an action for seduction has succeeded without proof of at least pregnancy, and no reported case in England since Manvell v. Thomson[8]. Not only was the question not raised in that case, but the case was prior to the legislation enacted in Upper Canada in 1837, being 7 William IV, chap. 8, \"An Act to make the remedy in cases of seduction more effectual, and to render the fathers of illegitimate children liable for their support,\" which statute without substantial change became the law of the province, of Ontario at Confederation and (except that the provisions for the maintenance of illegitimate children were carried forward in a separate statute) remained substantially unchanged until 1903, when the North West Territories enacted the Ontario statute verbatim and added thereto the section which is now section 5 in the Alberta revised statute.\nSection 5 uses the same words as used throughout the other sections of the statute. \"Any unmarried female who has been seduced\" are the same words as used in section 2. The words \"an action for seduction\" in section 5 are substantially the same as \"an action for the seduction\" that are used throughout the statute. Then there is the general heading: \"Persons entitled to maintain action.\" The words in section 5, \"Notwithstanding anything in this Act,\" mean, I think, that notwithstanding that the action for seduction may be maintained by the several classes of persons referred to in the preceding sections, the unmarried female may herself maintain the action, and the words \"in the same manner as an action for any other tort\" refer to the procedure for maintaining in her own name the right of action and are not words creating the substance of a new cause of action.\nIt is a safe rule of statutory interpretation to assume, in the absence of an expressed intention to the contrary, that a Legislature when it uses the same words in different sections of the same statute, particularly a very short statute, uses the words in the same sense throughout the statute. Are we to interpret section 5 so as to import into the words used in that section a different quality or meaning from that which the same words have in the other sections of the statute? If the Legislature had intended that the words in section 5 should mean something different from what they mean in the other sections, the Legislature could have said so. Of course, where the right of action is given to the unmarried female herself there is necessarily excluded the relation of master and servant as an essential in the cause of action and with it the necessity for proof of loss of service; but the substance of the statutory cause of action, the birth of a child or at least the condition of pregnancy, remains. Again, with the greatest deference to those from whom I differ, I cannot see that the re-enactment of the statute in the revision of 1922 touches the point as to the substance of the cause of action, because the fact of the birth of a child, or pregnancy, in the Alberta cases prior to the revision has been admitted or accepted by counsel and those cases did not turn upon that question.\nIn the view I take of this appeal, it becomes unnecessary to examine minutely the evidence at the trial, as we were invited by counsel for the respondent to do, to ascertain whether or not the jury was justified in arriving at its verdict of guilt against the respondent. In my opinion, the evidence discloses no cause of action and therefore the action was properly dismissed. The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1935] 1 W.W.R. 199; [1935] 1 D.LH. 481.\n[2] [1934] 2 W.W.R. 511.\n2 [1934] 2 W.W.R. 511.\n[3] [1935] 1 W.W.R. 199; [1935] 1 D.L.R. 481.\n[4] [1933] A.C. 402.\n[5] (1916) 9 Alta.

The sale was (as found) openly and fairly conducted. The treasurer of the municipality did not send the notice (as to fact and date of sale and right to redeem) required by s. 174 of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, as amended by 23 Geo. V (1933), c. 2, s. 14, but gave notice as required before said amendment. The land was not redeemed within one year after the sale, and the official deed of the land was delivered to the purchaser. Plaintiff sued to have the tax sale set aside.\nSec. 181 of said Act provides: \u201cIf any part of the taxes for which any land has been sold * * * had at the time of the sale been in arrear for three years * * * and the land is not redeemed in one year after the sale, such sale, and the official deed to the purchaser (provided the sale was openly and fairly conducted) shall notwithstanding any neglect, omission or error of the municipality or of any agent or officer thereof in respect of imposing or levying the said taxes or in any proceedings subsequent thereto be final and binding * * *, it being intended by this Act that the owner of land shall be required to pay the taxes thereon within three years after the same are in arrear or redeem the land within one year after the sale thereof; and in default of the taxes being paid or the land being redeemed as aforesaid, the right to bring an action to set aside the said deed or to recover the said land shall be barred.\u201d\nHeld: The treasurer\u2019s neglect, omission or error in not giving the proper notice was that of an officer of the municipality within the contemplation of the words \u201cagent or officer\u201d in s. 181; and s. 181 applied to bar plaintiff\u2019s right to bring an action to set aside the deed or to recover the land. The sending of the notice required by s. 174 is not a condition precedent to the right of the proper officials to execute the deed.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1936] O.R. 409, reversed.\nCummings v. Township of York, 59 Ont. L.R. 350, and Cruise v. Town of Riverside, [1935] O.R. 151, discussed. This Court did not read those decisions as deciding that the treasurer when he gives or omits to give the notice after sale provided by s. 174 is not an officer of the municipality within s. 181, but if they intended to lay down that proposition, this Court could not accept them.\nThere is no element of forfeiture or confiscation in legislation enabling a municipality to realize upon its statutory lien given to secure payment of its taxes.\nCity of Toronto v. Russell, [1908] A.C. 493, at 501; Cartwright v. City of Toronto, 50 Can. S.C.R. 215, at 219, cited.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Langdon, the purchaser at the tax sale in question, from that part of the judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which held that the proceedings purporting, by reason of arrears of taxes due to the Municipal Corporation of the Township of Tisdale, to effect a sale of certain lands in the Township of Tisdale, in the Province of Ontario, were irregular and that the sale must be set aside.\nThe material facts of the case, for the purposes of the judgment of this Court now reported, are sufficiently set out therein, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nSection 181 of the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, dealt with in the judgment now reported, is set out (in part) in the above headnote.\nWilfrid Heighington K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.J. Gray for the (plaintiff) respondent.\nPeter White K.C. for the respondents the Municipal Corporation of the Township of Tisdale and the Treasurer thereof.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by DAVIS J.\u2014This is an action to restrain the registration of a tax deed and to have the tax sale set aside. Mr. Justice Jeffrey, the learned trial judge, dismissed the action. He found as facts that the taxes for which the land had been sold had been at the time of sale in arrear for more than three years, that the sale had been \u201copenly and fairly conducted,\u201d that the land had not been redeemed within one year after the sale and that the official deed of the land had been executed and delivered to the purchaser. These findings of fact were affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nWithin sixty days from the day of the sale, the municipal treasurer should have sent by registered mail to the plaintiff as registered owner and to any incumbrancer a notice stating that the land had been sold for taxes, the date of the sale, and that the incumbrancer or owner was at liberty within one year from the day of sale, exclusive of the day of sale, to redeem the estate sold by paying to the treasurer the amount of the purchase money together with ten per centum added thereto and other petty charges, as provided by sec. 174 of the Ontario Assessment Act as amended by 23 Geo. V (1933), ch. 2, sec. 14. The sale was on February 28, 1934, and the treasurer, being unaware of this amendment to the statute, made in 1933, followed the provisions of sec. 174 of the statute which had stood unchanged for many years before the amendment, and gave notice as thereby provided, stating that the incumbrancer or owner was at liberty within thirty days from the date of the notice to redeem the estate sold by paying to the treasurer the amount of the purchase money together with fifteen per centum thereon added thereto and other petty charges. The learned trial judge came to the conclusion that sec. 181 of the Assessment Act applied to a case such as this and that notwithstanding the neglect, omission or error of the treasurer in not complying with the amended provisions of sec. 174, in default of the taxes being paid or the land being redeemed, the right to bring an action to set aside the deed or to recover the land had been barred. The Court of Appeal, on the other hand, did not think that the provisions of sec. 181 applied, and reversed the trial judge. That is the real point in this appeal. Other alleged irregularities and objections to the sale raised by the plaintiff were determined against the plaintiff by both courts below and although pressed again upon this Court they are in their very nature such as will not induce this Court to consider an interference with the concurrent conclusions of the courts below in this respect.\nWe may observe at once that it is an entire misconception of the right of a municipality to enforce payment of its taxes by realizing its statutory lien upon the land to speak of that right in terms of either forfeiture or confiscation. There is no element of either in legislation which enables a municipality to realize upon a lien which the statute has given to the municipality to secure the payment of its taxes. The sole question here is whether or not the provisions of sec. 181 apply to the neglect, omission or error of the treasurer in not giving the notice required by sec. 174 as amended. The intention of the Legislature in enacting sec. 181 is expressly stated in the section to be\nthat the owner of land shall be required to pay the taxes thereon within three years after the same are in arrear or redeem the land within one year after the sale thereof; and in default of the taxes being paid or the land being redeemed as aforesaid, the right to bring an action to set aside the said deed or to recover the said land shall be barred.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, felt bound to follow the decision of Logie J. in Myers v. Cochrane[2], affirmed with a variation by the Court of Appeal[3], where it was held that the sending of the notice required by sec. 174 is a condition precedent to the right of the proper officials to execute the deed. We cannot accept that proposition of law. Section 174 is not open to any such construction. No such sanction or penalty for non-performance is imposed by the section. A general provision imposing a penalty upon any treasurer, clerk or other officer who refuses or neglects to perform any duty required of him by the Act is provided by sec. 209.\nMoreover, the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that the neglect, omission or error on the part of the treasurer in this case was not covered by the provisions of sec. 181. That Court treated the treasurer as persona designata and denied that he was an agent or officer of the municipality within the meaning of sec. 181, relying on two Ontario decisions\u2014Cummings v. Township of York[4] and Cruise v. The Town of Riverside[5]. In the former case, it was not open to the plaintiff to have the tax sale in question set aside because it had been validated and confirmed by statute; the plaintiff\u2019s claim was based upon the failure of the treasurer of the municipality to give the notice required by sec. 174 (then sec. 171) and was a claim for the amount he had been forced to pay to the purchaser at the tax sale in order to obtain a reconveyance of the property to him. Wright J. expressed the view that it was doubtful whether a municipal corporation would be liable for failure to observe or perform a statutory duty where the statute creating such duty does not either directly or by inference give a remedy to the person aggrieved through its non-performance, the cases appearing to him to establish that a municipal corporation is only liable for acts of nonfeasance where the statute expressly gives a right of action. But the learned Judge put his conclusion that the action failed upon the ground that the treasurer in selling the land for taxes had acted solely in pursuance of the statutory duties imposed upon him by the provisions of the Assessment Act and had not acted as an agent for or on behalf of the defendant corporation and therefore the defendant corporation was not liable for any of the acts of its treasurer relating to the said tax sale. \u201cWhile it is true,\u201d he said,\nthat the defendant corporation appointed the treasurer, yet, so far as the duties of the latter under the Assessment Act are concerned, the same are defined by the statute and are not prescribed by the defendant corporation, so that, in that view, the treasurer is persona designata and in the performance of his duty is acting as such and not as servant or agent of the municipality.\nCruise v. The Town of Riverside5 was an action brought by a purchaser of lands at a tax sale against the municipality to set aside the purchase and for the return of the purchase price paid by him. The plaintiff, who had purchased three different parcels of land which had been advertised for sale as one parcel, alleged that the treasurer had informed him that if the lands were sold together as one parcel they could only be redeemed as one parcel. The owner redeemed one of the three parcels and the plaintiff thereupon sought to rid himself of his purchase at the tax sale of the three parcels. The trial judge set aside the sale and directed the municipality to repay the purchase moneys upon the ground that each parcel of land should have been individually put up for sale and that the parcels could not be sold as one block. The defendant appealed and the appeal was allowed and the action dismissed without prejudice to any other action which the plaintiff might be advised to bring. It was said that the plaintiff had no right to recover the moneys unless and until the sale was set aside and, further, that the sale could not be set aside except in an action to which the treasurer was a party. Mr. Justice Riddell said,\nIt must be clearly understood that the only point decided by us is that the plaintiff is not now entitled to maintain this action.\nbut he did say in the course of his judgment\nthat the treasurer in selling was not the agent of the defendant, but was acting under his statutory duty and, consequently, the contract of purchase was not made with the defendant.\nWe do not read those decisions as deciding that the treasurer, when he gives or omits to give the notice after sale provided by sec. 174, is not an officer of the municipality within the meaning of sec. 181, but if those decisions intended to lay down any such proposition, we cannot accept them.\nThe sale of the land for taxes was here an accomplished fact and the execution and delivery of the deed of conveyance or transfer of the land became thereafter a corporate act of the municipality, even though specific officers are designated by the statute to execute the deed. By sec. 177 the deed shall be according to statutory form XI, or to the same effect, and the form provides for the seal of the municipality to be affixed. Notwithstanding that the treasurer through neglect, omission or error failed to give the notice after sale within the time and containing the statement required by sec. 174 as amended, the expressed intention and effect of sec. 181 is that the right of the former owner to bring an action to set aside the deed or to recover the land shall be barred where the owner has not paid the taxes on the land within three years after the same became in arrear or has failed to redeem the land within one year after the sale. The purpose of sec. 181 is very plain. While the treasurer in selling the land acted in pursuance of a statutory power vested in him, and in that sense may be regarded as persona designata, he did not cease to be, in any proper sense of the words \u201cagent or officer\u201d within the contemplation of sec. 181, an officer of the municipality.\nIn City of Toronto v. Russell[6], the Privy Council had occasion to consider the provision of a section of a remedial Act (sec. 8 of 3 Edw. VII, c. 86) passed to cure defects in tax sales which had taken place in the City of Toronto. The section read as follows:\nAll sales of lands within the said city, up to and including the one held in the year 1902, and purporting to be made for arrears of taxes in respect of the lands so sold are hereby validated and confirmed, notwithstanding any irregularity in the assessment or other proceedings for imposition of any taxes so in arrear, or any failure to comply with the requirements of The Consolidated Assessment Act, 1892, or of The Assessment Act in regard to the manner in which any assessment roll, or collector\u2019s roll of the said city has been prepared, * * *\nTheir Lordships at p. 501 expressed their opinion\nthat, since the main and obvious purpose and object of the Legislature in passing the Act 3 Edw. 7, c. 86, was to validate sales made for arrears of taxes in the carrying out of which the requirements of the different statutes as to the mode in which they should be conducted had not been observed, and to quiet the titles of those who had purchased at such sales, the statute should, where its words permit, be construed so as to effect that purpose and attain that object.\nTheir Lordships continued:\nThe council can only act through its officers. The notice to be given by the council must be given by or through one of its officers. The omission to give it may therefore be fairly held to be \u201ca failure or omission on the part of an official of the said city\u201d to comply with the requirements of the Consolidated Assessment Act, 1892, and the Assessment Act, within the words of this statute.\nIn Cartwright v. City of Toronto[7], the present Chief Justice of this Court, in discussing the decision in City of Toronto v. Russell7, said:\nI see no reason to doubt that the passages of the judgment at page 501 form a part of the ratio decidendi. The effect of these passages, in my judgment, is to explode the notion which appears to have been founded on some decisions of this court, that statutes of this character are subject to some special canon of construction based, apparently, upon the presumption that all such statutes are prima facie monstrous. The effect of the judgment of the Judicial Committee is that particular provisions in such statutes must be construed according to the usual rule, that is to say, with reasonable regard to the manifest object of them as disclosed by the enactment as a whole.\nWe are all of opinion that the neglect, omission or error of the treasurer in this case comes within the provisions of sec. 181 and that the right to bring an action to set aside the tax deed in question or to recover the land is barred by the statute.\nThe appeal is allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Symons, Heighington & Shaver.\nSolicitor for the (plaintiff) respondent: J.J.

Authorities cited.\nThe verdict of a jury will not be set aside as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Jeffrey J. on the verdict of a jury, in an action (and counterclaim) for damages suffered through a motor vehicle collision.\nThe collision occurred on September 5, 1935, about 9.30 p.m. The defendant had been driving a truck in a northerly direction when there was a break-down in its electrical equipment and its lights went out and its motor stopped. Defendant and some men to whom he had been giving a lift pushed the truck some distance along the highway and then partially off the travelled portion, on the east (right hand) side of the road, but part of the truck projected on to the paved part. On the opposite side of the highway there were a store and a gasoline station. There was a space at the gasoline station where there would have been room for the truck to have been placed clear of the travelled portion of the highway. Leaving the truck parked as aforesaid, the defendant went into the store to telephone for assistance. There were no lights (there was a reflector) on the rear of the truck and no steps were taken to warn oncoming traffic. It was a clear moonlight night. The highway was straight. The plaintiff in a motor car, travelling also in a northerly direction, collided with the truck. There were other factors or alleged factors in the situation, as, the position in which the truck was parked, and whether or not at an angle, interference with outlook by reason of lights at the gasoline station, lights from a motor car coming behind the plaintiff.\nAt the trial questions were given to the jury and answered as follows:\n1. Were the injuries of which the parties complain caused by the negligence of the defendant? Answer: Yes.\n2. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Answer: In not taking proper precaution, as he and the men were able to move the truck along highway, he should have moved truck to the clear space at left hand of highway, where it would have been clear of pavement at store or station.\n3. Was the plaintiff guilty of negligence which caused or contributed to cause the injuries and damages of which the parties complain? Answer: No.\n4. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Answer fully: [No answer.]\n5. Could the plaintiff notwithstanding the negligence of the defendant, if any, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident? Answer: No.\n6. Q. If you answer question 5 \u201cYes,\u201d say what he should have done or failed to do? Answer fully. [No answer.]\nThe jury found damages for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,300. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff for that sum and costs.\nThe defendant\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed with costs, Fisher J.A. dissenting (who would allow the appeal and dismiss the action, with costs). The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada (and, by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, also appealed as to the dismissal of his counterclaim). On behalf of the defendant (appellant) it was claimed (inter alia) that the jury\u2019s answer to the second question was not supported by the evidence and further that it was not a finding of negligence in law and did not support a judgment for the plaintiff; and that the jury\u2019s answers to the third and fifth questions were perverse and unreasonable and not such as a reasonable jury might find on the evidence and should be set aside.\nBy the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. for the appellant.\nM.A. Miller K.C. and R.B. Hungerford for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014We are all agreed that the questions involved in this appeal are questions of fact and that the majority of the Court of Appeal were right in their conclusion that the findings of the jury are sufficient and that the verdict could not properly be set aside.\nWe do not consider it necessary to review at large the questions raised in the able argument of Mr. Cartwright which were fully discussed on the hearing of the appeal. It seems desirable, however, to add a word or two in respect of the principle on which this Court acts in setting aside the verdict of a jury, as against the weight of evidence, with a view to granting a new trial or giving judgment in favour of one of the parties.\nThe principle has been laid down in many judgments of this Court to this effect, that the verdict of a jury will not be set aside as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it. That is the principle on which this Court has acted for at least thirty years to my personal knowledge and it has been stated with varying terminology in judgments reported and unreported. It will be sufficient to refer to the judgments in one of the most recent decisions, C.N.R. v. Mutter[1]. In the course of the reasons delivered by the majority of the judges who heard the appeal (p. 769) there occurs this passage:\nWe premise that it is not the function of this Court, as it was not the duty of the Court of Appeal, to review the findings of fact at which the jury arrived. Those findings are conclusive unless they are so wholly unreasonable as to show that the jury could not have been acting judicially (C.C.P., Arts. 501 and 508(3); Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Wright[2]). In construing the findings, moreover, one must not apply a too rigorous critical method; if, on a fair interpretation of them, they can be supported upon a reasonable view of the evidence adduced, effect should be given to them.\nMr. Justice Lamont, who delivered a separate judgment, said this (p. 772):\nThe same principle was followed in Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Wright[3]. There, as in the case at bar, there was evidence given on both sides and on all the issues proper to be submitted to and considered by a jury. In neither case could the trial judge properly have withdrawn the evidence from the consideration of the jury who are the proper judges of the facts. In both cases the jury found negligence on the part of the company.\nIn the Wright case3 the House of Lords held that, under these circumstances, the well established rule should apply, namely, that the verdict should not be disturbed unless it appeared to be not only unsatisfactory, but unreasonable and unjust, so unreasonable and unjust as to justify the court in concluding that the jury had not really performed the judicial duty cast upon them.\nThat the guide indicated in these judgments is precisely the guide by which judges in England have governed themselves in considering such questions is plain from the judgment of Lord Wright delivered in the recent case, Mechanical and General Inventions Co. Ltd. and Lehwess v. Austin[4], a judgment which, as to form and as to substance, was adopted by Lord Atkin and Lord Macmillan. In view of what was said in the Court below, it is, perhaps, desirable to transcribe the following passage (p. 374):\nThe objection in Wood v. Gunston[5] was that the damages were excessive, and a new trial was there ordered. The use of the phrase \u201cmiscarriage of juries\u201d is significant. It indicates what there must be to justify the appellate Court in interfering with or controlling the verdicts of juries. Since then many cases have been reported on these matters, but I think most useful guidance to help the appellate Court is to be found in Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Wright3. Lord Fitzgerald[6] states the question to be \u201cwhether the evidence so preponderates against the verdict as to show that it was unreasonable and unjust\u201d: and he adds that the onus is on the appellants to establish that this condition is fulfilled. But the most illuminating statement is, I think, to be found in the observations of Lord Halsbury[7]. He refers to the case of Solomon v. Bitton[8], where the question according to the report (the correctness of which was afterwards disputed in Webster v. Friedeberg[9] was stated to be \u201cwhether the verdict was such as reasonable men ought not to have come to.\u201d Lord Halsbury said8 that was an erroneous statement of the principle. \u201cIf a Court,\u2014\u201d he proceeded, \u201cnot a Court of Appeal in which the facts are open for original judgment, but a Court which is not a Court to review facts at all,\u2014can grant a new trial whenever it thinks that reasonable men ought to have found another verdict, it seems to me that they must form and act upon their own view of what the evidence in their judgment proves. That, I think, is not the law. * * * I think the test of reasonableness, in considering the verdict of a jury, is right enough, in order to understand whether the jury have really done their duty. If their finding is absolutely unreasonable, a Court may consider that that shows that they have not really performed the judicial duty cast upon them; but the principle must be that the judgment upon the facts is to be the judgment of the jury and not the judgment of any other tribunal. If the word \u2018might\u201d were substituted for \u2018ought to\u2019 in Solomon v. Bitton[10] I think the principle would be accurately stated.\u201d\nLord Halsbury in these valuable observations is, I think, going back to the test applied in Wood v. Gunston[11], which was whether there was a miscarriage of the jury. Thus the question in truth is not whether the verdict appears to the appellate Court to be right, but whether it is such as to show that the jury have failed to perform their duty. An appellate Court must always be on guard against the tendency to set aside a verdict because the Court feels it would have come to a different conclusion.\nThis, as we have observed, is the principle on which this Court has always acted in dealing with such questions, but the principle is so completely settled and so well known that in many cases it has not been considered necessary to state it in terms.\nThere being some evidence for the jury, that is to say, the evidence being of such a character that the trial judge could not properly have withdrawn the issue from the jury, the question whether, in such circumstances, a jury, considering the evidence as a whole, could not reasonably arrive at a given finding may be, it is obvious, a question of not a little nicety; and the power vested in the court of appeal to set aside a verdict as against the weight of evidence in that sense is one which ought to be exercised with caution; it belongs, moreover, to a class of questions in the determination of which judges will naturally differ, and, as everyone knows, such differences of opinion do frequently appear.\nIn exercising this power under the guidance of the general principles stated in the judgment of Lord Wright, the court has not the advantage of more specific rules of general application; and it may be worth while to advert to the risk of treating decisions dealing with controversies touching its exercise in relation to the facts of a particular case and expressions found in judgments as binding authorities constraining other courts to a particular course in dealing with a different case involving different facts. It would, perhaps, not be entirely without value to cite a passage from the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Colls v. Home and Colonial Stores Ltd.[12] The judgment, it is true, concerns generally an entirely different head of law, but the passage has, we think, no little relevancy to the topic now under discussion. It is in these words:\n* * * Speaking for myself, I doubt very much whether it is a profitable task to retry actions which depend simply on questions of fact, or to review and endeavour to reconcile or distinguish a number of cases that naturally enough contain some statement which, taken by themselves and apart from the context, may seem to be contradictory, but which must all proceed upon the same principle. It would only be another link in the embarrassing chain of authority, or, if I may venture to say so, only another handful of dust to be cast into one scale or the other when the claims of opposing litigants come to be weighed in the balance. I think there is much good sense in the observations of Brett L.J. in Ecclesiastical Commissioners v. Kino[13]. \u201cTo my mind,\u201d said his Lordship, \u201cthe taking of some expression of a judge used in deciding a question of fact as to his own view of some one fact being material on a particular occasion as laying down a rule of conduct for other judges in considering a similar state of facts in another case, is a false mode of treating authority. It appears to me that the view of a learned judge in a particular case as to the value of a particular piece of evidence is of no use to other judges who have to determine a similar question of fact in other cases where there may be many different circumstances to be taken into consideration.\u201d\nI do not think Lord Macnaghten means to say that the course taken by judges of great experience in applying a principle to particular facts may not be exceedingly instructive and helpful as illustrating the practical working of the principle; but it is a very different matter to treat such expressions and such decisions as absolving the judges who are called upon to exercise this power to set aside verdicts as against the weight of evidence from the responsibility of determining in each particular case whether or not the conditions have arisen under which the power can properly be put into effect.\nIt is, perhaps, advisable to observe that what has been said above does not contemplate cases in which there is some valid objection to directions given by the court to the jury in respect either of insufficiency or impropriety, or where the court may have to consider some circumstance connected with the conduct of the proceedings at the trial as having a bearing upon the question whether, consistently with justice, the verdict can be allowed to stand.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae, Greer & Cartwright.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Miller & Hungerford.\n[1] [1934] 1 D.L.R. 768.\n[2] (1886) 11 App. Cas. 152, at 156.\n[3] (1886) 11 App. Cas. 152.\n[4] [1935] A.C. 346.\n[5] (1665) Style, 466.\n[6] 11 App. Cas. 152, at 155.\n[7] 11 App. Cas. 152, at 156.\n[8] (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 176.\n[9] (1886) 17 Q.B.D. 736.\n[10] (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 176.\n[11] (1655) Style, 466.\n[12] [1904] A.C. 179, at 191.\n[13] (1880) 14 Ch.

The trial Judge, Rose C.J.H.C. ([1935] O.R. 410), held that, though the judgment attacked could not successfully be impeached on the ground of fraud, yet plaintiff should succeed on the ground that newly discovered evidence, of which it could be said that it could not by the exercise of due diligence have been discovered before the judgment attacked was pronounced, established that the judgment attacked was one to which the party obtaining it was not entitled. The judgment of Rose C.J.H.C. was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1936] O.R. 75) which dismissed the action. The grounds taken by Middle-ton J.A. in that Court were: that fraud in obtaining the judgment attacked, charged as the basis of the present action, was not proved; also that a defendant who allows an action to go to trial upon a certain defence of facts set up which fails, cannot by bringing an action to set aside the judgment set up another and inconsistent defence of facts. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed, on said grounds taken by Middleton J.A. and also on the following ground: A judgment cannot be set aside on the ground of facts established by newly discovered evidence, unless it is proved that the evidence relied upon could not have been discovered by the party complaining by the exercise of due diligence. This is a rule which must be applied with the utmost strictness, otherwise the finality of judgments generally would be gravely imperilled. In the present case the plaintiff was bound to establish in the most entirely convincing way that the rule had been met, and this had not been done in the case presented at trial.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of Rose C.J.H.C.[2]) dismissed the action.\nBy an order of McEvoy J. dated November 9, 1934, \u201cin the matter of the bankruptcy of William D. Trenwith,\u201d leave was given (upon terms) to Margaret Trenwith, the wife, and a creditor, of said William D. Trenwith, to commence proceedings in the name of the Trustee (G.F. Glatt) at her own expense for the purpose of setting aside a judgment obtained in the Supreme Court of Ontario on December 27, 1932 (for $5,186.94) by G.F. Glatt, Trustee of the Estate of Stewart Goddard, against said William D. Trenwith.\nThe action was brought, and was tried before Rose, C.J.H.C, who gave reasons for judgment in which the facts are discussed at length2. He held that, though the judgment atacked in the action could not successfully be impeached on the ground of fraud, the relief claimed by the plaintiff could be granted upon the ground that newly discovered evidence established the fact that the judgment was one to which Goddard (or his trustee) was not entitled; that the evidence was new and convincing and it could be said that the evidence could not by the exercise of due diligence have been discovered before the judgment was pronounced; and that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed. He thought that plaintiff\u2019s pleading was sufficient to justify the judgment upon the ground taken, but would allow any amendment deemed requisite. By the formal judgment it was declared and adjudged that the said judgment of December 27, 1932, was null and void, and the defendant was restrained from taking any action upon or in any manner enforcing that judgment. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the action[3]. In his reasons, Middleton J.A. (with whom Mulock, C.J.O., in that Court, and with whom also this Court, in the judgment now reported, agreed) stated that the action as brought was to declare that the judgment in the original action was procured by fraud. He referred to the holding of the trial Judge; also to the fact that no amendment in plaintiff\u2019s pleading had been made; and held that plaintiff\u2019s pleading, which charged fraud, was not sufficient to justify the judgment of the trial Judge. He then proceeded to say, in part, as follows (including a short outline of facts):\nTaking the narrow view of this appeal, it appears to me that the judgment cannot stand. Fraud is charged and fraud is not proved. It follows that the action fails.\nBut I prefer to place my judgment upon broader grounds and so it is necessary to very shortly outline the facts giving rise to the litigation. In the original action Goddard claimed that he was liable upon a covenant in a mortgage upon certain Florida lands; that he sold the lands to Trenwith who as part of the consideration undertook to assume and pay off the mortgage made by Goddard; that Trenwith had failed in this duty and that the mortgagee had recovered against him, Goddard, upon his covenant. He therefore sought a judgment to indemnify him as covenanted and agreed. In this action Trenwith denied that he was a purchaser of the lands in question and that he had covenanted as alleged. When a deed was produced bearing apparently his signature he denied his signature and charged that it was a forgery. The action was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Logie and he found on this issue against Trenwith, the signature was his and judgment followed. An appeal was had from this judgment and the judgment was affirmed.\nThis action was to set aside the earlier judgment. In it Trenwith changes his front entirely. He now says that the signature is his signature, but that it was obtained to the document fraudulently by Stephens, Inc., a real estate agent in Florida, that he signed the document in blank intending it to be filled up and to be used by Stephens, Inc., to aid in the carrying out of altogether another transaction concerning other lands not in the same township. The trial Judge has found this to be established and that it is sufficient to entitle Trenwith to the relief sought. It is to be observed that the fraud proved was not that of Goddard, or of the present defendant, his assignee, but it was fraud of a third party. It is also to be observed that it is not a discovery of new facts, or of new evidence. It is a discovery by Trenwith of the fact that his own evidence at the earlier trial was erroneous and the telling by him of an entirely different story. It is perhaps not material but the issue raised by Trenwith was supported by substantially the same witnesses as those who testified on his behalf at the former trial, but these witnesses gave entirely different evidence at the two trials. It does not necessarily follow that Trenwith and these witnesses are guilty of perjury. It is certain that he and they testified to two totally and irreconcilable stories and the Judge who heard this evidence is convinced that on the latter occasion the story told is true.\nI quite agree with the learned trial Judge that Goddard in the first action was guilty of no fraud or perjury, and a fortiori Glatt as his trustee in bankruptcy, and who had been substituted as plaintiff before the date of the trial, was innocent, and I assume that in that action Trenwith would have been entitled to succeed had he put forward the story which he now tells.\nIt is I think clear beyond possibility of a doubt that a defendant who is sued must in the action in which he is sued put forward all defences which he has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. He cannot allow the action to go to trial upon a certain defence which he sets up and when that defence fails set up another and inconsistent defence by bringing an action to set aside the judgment. If in the original action he applies for some relief, his application will be scrutinized with the greatest of care, but there would be no end to litigation if proceedings such as these received the sanction of the court. I can find no trace of any similar action ever having been brought.\n* * *\nThe plaintiff appealed to this Court. By the judgment now reported the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nA.C. Heighington K.C. and H.G. Steen for the appellant.\nG.R. Munnoch K.C. and F.A. Brewin for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed.\nI should be satisfied to put my judgment upon the grounds stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton in the court below. There is, however, a supplementary ground which I think it is desirable to state.\nAdmittedly, the appellant could not succeed on the ground that the judgment was procured by fraud. The learned trial Judge held, however, that certain\nnewly discovered evidence establishes the fact that the judgment is one to which Goddard (or his trustee) was not entitled.\nIt is well established law that a judgment cannot be set aside on such a ground unless it is proved that the evidence relied upon could not have been discovered by the party complaining by the exercise of due diligence. The importance of this rule is obvious and it is equally obvious that the finality of judgments generally would be gravely imperilled unless the rule were applied with the utmost strictness.\nThe appellant was bound to establish this proposition in the most entirely convincing way. On this point, the case presented by the appellant to the trial Judge was not, in my judgment, satisfactory. I mention only one circumstance,\u2014the solicitor who had the conduct of the proceedings on behalf of Goddard leading to the judgment in question was not called and no explanation is offered of the failure to call him.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Symons, Heighington & Shaver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McRuer, Mason, Cameron & Brewin.\n[1] [1936] O.R. 75; [1936] 1 D.L.R. 387.\n[2] [1935] O.R. 410; [1935] 4 D.L.R. 99.\n[3] [1936] O.R. 75; [1936] 1 D.L.R. 387.\n"}

By his will he devised and bequeathed all his property to his executors and trustees upon trusts. The will set aside three specific funds, one for each of the daughters for life, and, subject thereto, gave to the widow a life interest in the estate. She was also given a power of appointment, which she exercised, as to one-half of the residue of the estate, and this was not now in question.\nThe daughter G. died in 1885, ten days after the birth of her only child, who died within two months later, leaving his father as next of kin. The daughter H. died without issue in 1907. The widow died in 1909. The daughter L. died, unmarried, in 1934.\nQuestions then arose, under provisions in the will, and in the above circum stances, as to who were now entitled to (1) that half of the residue of the estate over which the widow was not given a power of appointment, (2) the fund set aside for the daughter L. during her life, and (3) the fund set aside for the daughter H. during her life.\nAs to said half (in question) of the residue, the will directed the trustees to pay the income thereof to the testator's wife during her life and, on her death, then to pay the income to G. during her life, and upon her death to pay the principal \" to the lawful issue of my said daughters L. and G. or should only one of them have children, then to the lawful issue of such daughter, share and share alike.\"\nHeld: G.'s child took at birth a vested interest in the principal of said half of the residue. Though vesting in possession was postponed until the expiration of the life interest of the widow and of the subsequent life interest of G. had she survived her mother, the vesting of an interest in G.'s child was not dependent or expectant upon the prior life interest or interests; it did not depend on his being alive at the time of distribution. (Brown v. Moody, [1936] A.C. 635; Hickling v. Fair, [1899] A.C. 15, at 35; and Duffeld v. Duffield, 3 Bligh's New Reports, 260, at 330-331, cited).\nAs to the fund set aside for L. during her life, the will directed the trustees, upon the death of L. having issue, to pay it to such issue, and in default of issue then to pay it \" to my daughter G., should she survive my daughter L., or should my said daughter G. not be living at the death of my said daughter L., then to pay [the fund] to the lawful issue then living of my said daughter G., share and share alike.\"\nHeld: The words \"then living\" clearly related to the last antecedent, the date of L.'s death, and, there being no issue of G. living at that date, the fund fell into the residue of the estate, half of which passed under the widow's appointment and the other half to those entitled through G.'s child's vested interest.\nAs to the fund set aside for H. during her life, the will directed the trustees upon her death to pay it to her issue and in default of issue to pay it to G. if living \" and should she not be then living to pay the same to the lawful issue of my daughters L. and G. share and share alike or should there be but one child of either of my said daughters then to such child absolutely.\"\nHeld: The fund became (for the same reasons as those for the above conclusion as to the residuary clause) vested in G.'s child at birth, and there was no intestacy. The court could not insert such words as \" then living\" after the words \" to pay the same to the lawful issue.\" (Re Litchfield; Horton v. Jones, 104 L.T. 631).\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal in Equity of Prince Edward Island, [1936] 4 D.L.R. 443, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Equity of Prince Edward Island ([1]) affirming (except in a matter of costs, the variation made in this respect not being appealed against) the judgment of Saunders M.R. ([2]) in a suit brought by the surviving executor and trustee of the last will and testament of Edward Roberson, de ceased, by bill of complaint in the Court of Chancery of Prince Edward Island, asking for a declaration as to who are the persons now entitled to the assets of the estate of the said deceased which still remain in the hands of said executor and trustee and for an order for payment over or distribution and for an order and direction regarding further administration.\nThe determination of what persons are now entitled to the assets of said estate involved the interpretation of certain clauses in the will of said deceased and their effect in the events which have occurred. The material facts and circumstances, the relevant clauses of the will, and the questions for consideration, are sufficiently stated in the judgment of this Court now reported, and are indicated in the above head note. The appeal to this Court was allowed, the judgments of the Courts below set aside, and judgment directed to be entered declaring the rights of the parties in accordance with the reasons for judgment of this Court now reported; the costs, as between solicitor and client, to all the parties throughout to be paid out of the residue of the estate.\nA. A. McLean K.C. and Donald McKinnon K.C. for the appellants.\nE. K. Williams K.C. and W. E. Bentley K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014This litigation is to determine the proper interpretation and effect of the will of Edward Roberson, late of the province of Prince Edward Island, who died in 1883, in respect of the final distribution of certain substantial portions of the estate. The principal difficulty arises out of the fact that the only grandchild of Edward Roberson was not born until 1885 and lived less than two months. The real contest is between those persons who claim through the grandchild on the basis that the grandchild acquired at birth a vested interest in those portions of the testator's estate now involved in this litigation and those persons who claim through those who were the next of kin of Edward Roberson at the date of the latter's death on the basis that in the events which have occurred since the death of the testator there is an intestacy in respect of the said portions of the estate.\nThe grandchild's mother was a daughter of Edward Roberson. She died ten days after the birth of the child and on the child's death a few weeks later his father became the only next of kin. In later years the father remarried and had three sons by his second marriage. He died in 1921, his second wife having predeceased him, and the three sons survived him and are still alive. In reality, the three sons by the second marriage, who are, of course, strangers to Edward Roberson, are claiming through their father against those persons who claim through those who were the next of kin of Edward Roberson at the date of his death.\nThree separate portions of the estate of Edward Roberson are involved in this litigation and they have been described throughout, for convenience, as funds A, B and D. The main point is whether or not the corpus of all, or of any, of these funds became vested in the grandchild. No real difficulty will be met in the ascertainment of the persons now beneficially entitled to the corpus of the funds, or of the shares in which they will take, once it is determined, upon the proper interpretation and effect of certain provisions of the testator's will, whether or not the grand child acquired at birth a vested interest.\nBefore turning to the language of the will it is convenient to set out certain facts and dates. The testator was survived by his widow and three daughters. All his property, real and personal, was by his will expressly devised and bequeathed to his named executors and trustees upon certain trusts and, broadly speaking, the will set aside three specific funds, one for each of the daughters for life, and subject thereto the widow was given a life interest in the estate. The widow and the three daughters are now dead. The questions raised in these proceedings concern the disposition of the corpus of two of the specific funds and of one half of the residue of the estate, and the alleged improper payment by the trustees of some of the income from these funds over a period of years. The daughter Georgianna died February 10, 1885. Her child was born on February 1, 1885, and died on March 26 of the same year. The daughter Hannah Louisa married and died with out issue on April 9, 1907. The widow of the testator died on November 28, 1909. The daughter Lucy Jane never married and lived until January 13, 1934. Alexander Cameron, who married Georgianna and who was the father of the grandchild, died on July 16, 1921, leaving all his property by will to his three sons, share and share alike.\nWhat is described as fund A is the specific fund set apart by the will for the daughter Lucy Jane during her lifetime; what is described as fund B is the specific fund that was set aside for the daughter Hannah Louisa during her lifetime, and what is described as fund D is that half of the residue of the estate over which the widow was not given a power of appointment. The other half of the residue was duly appointed by the widow, by virtue of a power vested in her by the will, to her daughter Lucy Jane who survived her. The same problem is raised in respect of the corpus of each of these funds, A, B and D, that is, whether it became vested in the grandchild or is there an intestacy? The executors of the father of the grandchild are the appellants in this Court and the respondents represent next of kin of Edward Roberson. Counsel for the respondents con tended that there was an intestacy in respect of funds A and B and admitted that if that contention was sound those funds had fallen into the residue. They further contended that there was an intestacy in respect of half the residue, i.e., fund D.\nWe may conveniently turn at once to the provisions of the will relating to the residue. Omitting those parts that gave a power of appointment to the widow with respect to the disposition after her death of one half of the residue, the residuary clause reads as follows:\nAnd the said trust premises shall be held by my said trustees upon the further trust to pay the net annual interest and income of all the residue of my said estate * * * to my said dear wife during the term of her natural life, and on the death of my said wife * * * then to pay the annual income * * * of the remaining moiety of the residue of my said estate to my daughter Georgianna during the term of her natural life, and upon the death of my said daughter Georgianna to pay the principal money to the lawful issue of my said daughters Lucy and Georgianna or should only one of them have children, then to the lawful issue of such daughter, share and share alike.\nThe widow died, as we have stated, in 1909. Her daughter Georgianna had predeceased her. The only issue of the daughters Lucy and Georgianna was the child of Georgianna. Much stress is laid by counsel for the respondents upon the fact that the grandchild was not alive at the date of the death of the testator and was not alive at the date of the death of the widow.\nThe contention on behalf of the respondents is that there was a mere direction to pay and that by force of the repetition of the word \"then\" in the language of the residuary clause the gift to the issue was contingent upon being alive at the date of distribution. In other words, the contention of the respondents in effect is that we should read into the language of the clause the words \"then living\" after the words \"lawful issue\" so that the provision shall require that the issue be \"then living,\" i.e., at the date of distribution. The respondents treat the provision as disclosing an intention on the part of the testator to create a contingent gift to a class to be ascertained at the date of distribution, and contend that, there having been no one of the class then alive, there is an intestacy. Further, the respondents point to the power of appointment given to the widow in respect of one half of the residue of the estate and contend that, as that half of the residue was plainly not to become vested in any one until the death of the widow provided she exercised the power, it may fairly be implied that the testator did not intend any part of the residue to vest before the date of his widow's death. But the two halves of the residue are subject to separate and different trusts and are quite independent one from the other and it is a forced construction to import the contingency with respect to the disposition of one half of the residue into the provisions governing the disposition of the other half.\nThe questions of interpretation were raised by a bill of complaint in the Court of Chancery of the province of Prince Edward Island. Saunders J., the Master of the Rolls of that Court, came to the conclusion in a carefully considered judgment that the gift of half the residue to the issue of Lucy and Georgianna was contingent upon such issue being alive at the date of distribution. The learned Judge relied mainly upon decisions in this Court of which In re Browne ([3]) was then the latest. An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal in Equity of the province of Prince Edward Island and the judgment was affirmed by the members of that Court (Mathieson C.J. and Arsenault J.) who also put the ground of their decision principally upon the authority of the decision of this Court in the Browne case ([4]). But subsequently the Judicial Commit tee delivered judgment in an appeal that had been taken from the judgment of this Court in the Browne case ([5]). Their Lordships reversed the judgment (Browne v. Moody ([6])). We have no doubt that if the Judges in the Courts below had had the advantage of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Browne case ([7]) they would have reached a different conclusion in this case. It will be sufficient if we quote two passages from the judgment de livered by Lord Macmillan in the Privy Council: Their Lordships observe, in the first place, that the date of division, of the capital of the fund is a dies certus, the death of the son of the testatrix, which in the course of nature must occur sooner or later. In the next place, the direction to divide the capital among the named beneficiaries on the arrival of that dies certus is not accompanied by any condition personal to the beneficiaries, such as their attainment of majority or the like. The object of the postponement of the division is obviously only in order that the son may during his lifetime enjoy the income. The mere postponement of distribution to enable an interposed life-rent to be enjoyed has never by itself been held to exclude vesting of the capital.\nThe law, their Lordships said, had been correctly stated by Sir William Page Wood, V.C., in In re Bennett's Trust ([8]) as follows:\nIt is clear that the use of the words \"pay and transfer,\" as the only words of gift, does not make such a bequest contingent. The true criterion is that which is mentioned in Leeming v. Sherratt ([9]), namely, whether the postponement of the payment or division was on account of the position of the property, or of the person to whom the deferred interest is given. If the reason is simply, that a life interest is previously given to another person, so that the fund cannot be divided or paid over until his death, and is not a reason personal to the legatee of the absolute interest, such as his attaining twenty-one, it is treated as a gift to one for life, with a vested remainder to the legatees who are to take subject to the life interest.\nMr. E. K. Williams, in his very clear and direct argument on behalf of the respondents, naturally sought to escape from the force and effect of the Browne case ([10]) and he really rested his argument that there was no vesting in the grandchild in the present case upon the fact that there was no issue of the daughters Lucy and Georgianna alive at the date of the death of the testator, and he contended that there must be a vesting, if at all, a morte testatoris, and therefore the direction to pay to the issue of Lucy and Georgianna must be interpreted as creating only a contingent, as distinguished from a vested, interest. Mr. Williams did not refer us to any authority in support of this contention and it appears to us to be such an artificial construction of the settled rule as not to justify our acquiescence in it. No doubt the distinction is not with out importance and in certain circumstances may well be an element in determining whether vesting has or has not taken place. There are, however, in this will no conditions or contingencies attached to the gift to the issue and no clause of survivorship or gift over. Lord Davey in the course of his speech in the House of Lords in Hickling v. Fair ([11]), said:\nIt is an elementary principle in the construction of wills that a gift to a class after a life interest or life-rent includes all persons within the description of the class who were alive at the testator's death, or have come into being during the lifetime of the life tenant or life-renter. That principle is common to Scotland and England, and is applicable, I should suppose, wherever the English language is used. I think it is equally clear that when the gift is made to depend on the happening of a contingency, that contingency is not imported by implication into the description of the class so as to confine the gift to those members of the class who survive the contingency.\nIn approaching the construction of a will and the question of vesting of legacies, the courts have often cited, with approval, the language in Duffield v. Duffield ([12]) (which case Lord Eldon expressed the hope would be a leading case ([13])):\nThe rights of the different members of families not being ascertained whilst estates remain contingent, such families continue in an unsettled state, which is often productive of inconvenience, and sometimes of injury to them. If the parents attaining a certain age, be a condition precedent to the vesting estates by the death of their parents, before they are of that age, children lose estates which were intended for them, and which their relation to the testators may give them the strongest claim to.\nIn consideration of these circumstances, the judges from the earliest times were always inclined to decide, that estates devised were vested; and it has long been an established rule for the guidance of the Courts of Westminster in construing devises, that all estates are to be holden to be vested, except estates, in the devise of which a condition precedent to the vesting is so clearly expressed, that the Courts cannot treat them as vested, without deciding in direct opposition to the terms of the will. If there be the least doubt, advantage is to be taken of the circumstance occasioning that doubt; and what seems to make a condition, is holden to have only the effect of postponing the right of possession.\nThe grandchild born in 1885 was the only issue of Lucy or Georgianna and as such, in our opinion, took at birth a vested interest in one half of the residuary estate which, though it was not to vest in possession until the expiration of the life interest of the widow and of the subsequent life interest of Georgianna had she survived her mother, was not dependent or expectant upon the prior life interest or interests. The vesting of the ultimate gift was independent of any prior life interest. Turning now to the language of the will with respect to the specific fund set apart for the benefit of the daughter Lucy during her life, fund A:\nAnd upon the death of my said daughter Lucy Jane having lawful issue to pay over the said sum of seven thousand dollars to such issue share and share alike and in default of issue then to pay over said sum of seven thousand dollars to my daughter Georgianna, should she survive my daughter Lucy, or should my said daughter Georgianna not be living at the death of my said daughter Lucy, then to pay over said principal sum of seven thousand dollars to the lawful issue then living of my said daughter Georgianna, share and share alike.\nThe daughter Lucy Jane, as already stated, did not die until 1934 and Georgianna died in 1885. The pertinent words therefore are\nshould my said daughter Georgianna not be living at the death of my said daughter Lucy, then to pay over said principal sum of seven thousand dollars to the lawful issue then living of my said daughter Georgianna, share and share alike.\nThe words \"then living\" clearly relate to the last antecedent, i.e., the date of the death of Lucy. There was no issue of Georgianna living at that date and the fund fell into the residue of the estate, half of which passed under the widow's appointment and the other half passed to those entitled through the grandchild's vested interest.\nDirecting now our attention to the words employed by the testator respecting the specific fund set apart for the benefit of the daughter Hannah Louisa during her life, Fund B:\nAnd upon the death of my said daughter Hannah Louisa to hold the said sum of seven thousand dollars upon trust to pay the same to her lawful issue share and share alike, and in default of such issue then upon trust to pay the said principal sum of seven thousand dollars to my said daughter Georgianna if living, and should she be not then living to pay the same to the lawful issue of my daughters Lucy and Georgianna share and share alike or should there be but one child of either of my said daughters then to such child absolutely.\nHannah Louisa died in 1907 without issue and her sister Georgianna had predeceased her. The effect of this pro vision of the will is that if Georgianna should \" be not then living,\" i.e., at the date of the death of Hannah Louisa, the fund is to be paid over to the lawful issue of Lucy and Georgianna, share and share alike, or should there be but one child of either of the said daughters, \" then to such child absolutely.\" We are not entitled to insert such words as \" then living \" after the words \" to pay the same to the lawful issue.\" See Re Litchfield; Horton v. Jones ([14]). For the reasons given for our conclusion as to the residuary clause, this fund also became vested in the grandchild at birth, and there was no in testacy.\nThis disposes of the questions raised respecting the disposition of the corpus of each of the funds A, B and D, but a further question is raised in the proceedings as to the alleged improper disposition of some of the income from these funds. A proceeding of this kind is not, however, a convenient procedure for determining such a question and our judgment will be without prejudice to that question. If the parties cannot now agree upon an adjustment and settlement of their differences in respect of the impeached payments of income, that part of the bill of complaint should be remitted to the Court of Chancery. The facts in connection with the payments of income from these funds are not at all complete in the record before us but there is sufficient to indicate that there may well have been such an acquiescence on the part of the late Mr. Cameron, the father of the grandchild, who was himself one of the executors of the testator's will, as to preclude those now claiming through him from recovering against the surviving executor income which has been actually paid out by him, though, perhaps, to persons for the time being not strictly entitled to this income upon the construction which we have now put upon the provisions of the will respecting the funds in question. A great many years have elapsed since many of the payments were made, the surviving trustee obviously acted throughout in absolute good faith, and many matters of fact and questions of law may arise for consideration if the question of the actual payments of income is pressed. The evidence before us is quite in sufficient to enable us to deal with the dispute.\nThe judgment below should be set aside and a declaration made in accordance with the foregoing conclusions. The costs, as between solicitor and client, of all parties throughout should be paid out of the residue of the estate.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A. A.

Throughout the process the sidewall of the tire was not dismantled or destroyed, the numerical identification of the original tire was not destroyed, the name of the manufacturer of the original tire was still clearly marked upon its sidewalls, upon which appellant also marked a serial number.\nHeld: What appellant sold after said process were \u201cgoods produced or manufactured\u201d by appellant within the meaning of s. 86 (1) (a) of the Special War Revenue Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, and amendments) and were \u201ctires manufactured or produced\u201d by appellant within the meaning of s. 80 and Schedule II (item 3) of said Act; and appellant was liable to pay in respect thereof the sales tax and excise tax imposed by said sections respectively.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada whereby the plaintiff recovered judgment against the defendant for $5,318.46 and costs.\nThe action was brought in the Exchequer Court of Canada by information filed by the Attorney-General of Canada on behalf of His Majesty the King, to recover sums alleged to be due from the defendant (a firm carrying on business in Toronto, Ontario) for sales tax and excise tax under the Special War Revenue Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, and amendments), by reason of the alleged manufacture or production, and sale, of tires or tubes. Plaintiff also claimed penalties and licence fees. The defendant claimed that it was not a \u201cproducer or manufacturer,\u201d within said Act, of tires or tubes and that the provisions in question of said Act did not apply to it. A statement of facts was agreed upon, the material parts of which are set out in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nWilfrid Heighington K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. E. Day K.C. and B. Matthews for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014Section 86 of the Special War Revenue Act (R.S.C. 1927, chapter 179, and amendments) provides:\u2014\n86. 1. There shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of six per cent, on the sale price of all goods,\u2014\n(a) produced or manufactured in Canada, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the delivery of such goods to the purchaser thereof.\nThe first question arising for determination on this appeal is whether the appellant produced or manufactured goods within the meaning of this enactment and is therefore liable for the payment of sales tax.\nSection 80 of the same Act, so far as applicable, enacts:\u2014\n80. 1. Whenever goods mentioned in Schedules I and II of this Act are imported into Canada or taken out of warehouse, or manufactured or produced in Canada and sold, there shall be imposed, levied and collected, in addition to any other duty or tax that may be payable under this Act or any other statute or law, an excise tax in respect of goods mentioned\n(a) * * *\n(b) In Schedule II, at the rate set opposite to each item in the said schedule.\nItem 3 of Schedule II referred to reads as follows:\u2014\n3. Tires and Tubes:\n(iii) Tires in whole or in part of rubber for automotive vehicles of all kinds, including trailers or other wheeled attachments used in connection with any of the said vehicles\u2014two cents per pound.\nThe second question is whether the appellant manufactured or produced tires within the meaning of this section and schedule and is therefore subject to the payment of excise tax.\nThe matter was presented before the Exchequer Court on an agreed statement of facts from which it appears that the appellant \u201cpurchased, in bulk lots, by the pound, old and worn-out motor vehicle tires,\u201d generally from \u201cjunk dealers or storage yards\u201d in Canada and the United States; Furthermore, \u201cany duty that was exacted upon the articles when brought into Canada was paid on entry.\u201d After receipt of the tires by the appellant at its place of business, the first step was to place them in a heater where \u201call dampness was taken from the tires, both inside and out.\u201d Each tire was next placed upon a rack where the holes or \u201cblow-outs\u201d in it were buffed and cleaned. The tire was then placed in a frame against which a sharp dented wheel revolved and the tread was removed.\nFollowing this the tire was cemented on the inside and the holes patched with cord material and the tire was then cemented on the outside. After being placed in another machine, each tire received an application of \u201ccallendered tread stock,\u201d a plastic preparation.\nAs to the subsequent steps, the statement of facts continues:\u2014\nThe tire was then taken to what was termed the \u201ccure-room,\u201d where it was placed first in an iron mould which was firmly clamped about it. The mould was in the shape of a wheel and the mould, complete with its encased tire, was placed flat on a press inside a large boiler. A number of tires, each in a clamp as stated, were piled one on top of the other until the boiler was filled with twenty tires or so. A lid was then placed upon the boiler and firmly sealed. Hydraulic pressure was then applied for an hour or an hour and a half. This had a squeezing effect upon the clamped tires, they were firmly held and cooked into a state in which the repairs to the holes and blow-outs, the cementing inside and without, and the new tread, were firmly and permanently affixed to the carcass, i.e., the fabric and side walls of the original tire. In no part of these steps, including the final one, was the numerical identification of the original tire destroyed. The name of the manufacturer of the original tire was still clearly marked upon its side walls upon which the defendant company also marked a serial number.\nThe only other feature, and one upon which the appellant lays particular stress, is that throughout all the steps taken by it \u201cthe sidewall of the tire was not dismantled or destroyed.\u201d\nSo far as the claim for sales tax is concerned, what the appellant sold, after these proceedings in its establishment, would undoubtedly be termed \u201cgoods.\u201d Are they goods manufactured or produced by appellant? What the appellant did was to remove part of the old or worn-out tire and add to the remnant the plastic rubber preparation. It would appear that the position is the same as if the appellant had purchased an old or worn-out tire which had already been treated by the vendor in the manner described above, down to and including the cutting off of the old tread. If then the appellant had purchased from a third party the rubber preparation and had applied the latter and continued with the subsequent steps, could it be suggested that the article in its final condition had not been produced or manufactured by the appellant? The definitions of the words \u201cmanufacture\u201d and \u201cproduce\u201d as nouns or verbs, in the standard dictionaries, clearly indicate that such proceedings would constitute the appellant a manufacturer or producer. And the mere fact that the appellant has itself performed the defined operations on the old tire cannot exclude it from the operation of the section.\nThe point for determination in connection with the claim for excise tax is a little different from that involved in the question of the liability for sales tax. Is the appellant a manufacturer or producer of tires? It is suggested that the old or worn-out tire did not lose its identity qua tire and that, therefore, the appellant could not be said to have manufactured or produced a tire. However, when one bears in mind the various steps taken by appellant and particularly the state of the article when the tread was removed, it would appear that appellant cannot be any less the manufacturer of a tire because it started with something that had once been a usable tire than if, as suggested in the preceding paragraph, it had commenced with two substances purchased from different sources.\nThe liability of the appellant for licence fees follows from what has been said, and, since we understand no question is raised as to the proper amount for which judgment should go, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Symons, Heighington & Shaver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. Stuart Edwards.\n"}

One of them brought an action against the appellant to recover the damages sustained by him as a result of the accident which he attributed to the fault and negligence of the appellant. The appellant, alleging that he was protected against the liability thus incurred under the policy above mentioned, brought, in his own name, an action in warranty against the respondent insurance company.\nHeld that, under the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, the respondent company was liable to indemnify the appellant for all losses or damages resulting from the accident.\nThe appellant was legitimately in possession of the automobile, was driving it with the permission of the insured and was legally responsible for the manner in which the automobile was being driven. He was, therefore, one of the persons whom, under the terms of the policy and in consideration of the premium paid to it by the mis-en-cause, the respondent insurance company undertook to indemnify. He was not therein mentioned by name; but, according to the law of Quebec, as expressed in the French doctrine and jurisprudence, it is not necessary for its validity that the stipulation for the benefit of third parties should be made in words definitely ascertaining these persons; it is sufficient if they are ascertainable on the day when the stipulation takes effect in their favour. Therefore the respondent company cannot escape the obligation of indemnifying the appellant unless it is shown that its stipulation is prohibited by law. But the clause in favour of third persons invoked by the appellant against the respondent company is valid and enforceable, because stipulations in favour of third parties are valid and enforceable in civil law. They are expressly authorized by article 1029 C.C.; and no special rule exists, in the chapter of the code dealing with insurance, of a nature to exclude insurance contracts from the application of the general principle enacted in article 1029 C.C. And this view is strengthened by the enactments of article 2480 of the above chapter, where the civil code expressly singles out a class of policies which are declared prohibited. \u2014The definition of \u201cinsurance\u201d as contained in article 2468 C.C. adapts itself to the policy issued by the respondent company: it applies both to the main obligation undertaken for the benefit of the mis-en-cause and to the undertaking towards the other persons ascertainable under the above-cited clause.\u2014The fact that up to the moment of the accident the appellant had not yet signified his assent to the stipulation made in his favour by the mis-en-cause is not a bar to the action: his assent was not necessary to bind the insurance company and it was sufficient if he manifested his intention to avail himself of the stipulation as soon as the event happened which made the stipulation effective in his favour. In civil law, a valid stipulation in favour of a third person creates a contract (viniculum juris) between the third person and the person who has agreed to be bound by the contract. Vandepitte v. Preferred Accident Insurance Corporation ([1933] A.C. 70) not applicable to this case.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, Lalibert\u00e9 J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action in warranty with costs.\nThe respondent is a Casualty Insurance company who had issued to Rolland Hall\u00e9, the mis-en-cause, an automobile accident liability insurance policy containing the so-called omnibus clause whereby the insurance company agreed to protect from liability persons driving Rolland Hall\u00e9\u2019s car with his consent. On August 27, 1934, the appellant, who is a brother of Rolland Hall\u00e9, was driving the automobile covered by this policy when he met with an accident in which one Louis Bourget was seriously hurt. The latter claiming that this accident was due to the driver\u2019s fault, brought on December 26, 1934, an action in damages against Joseph Hall\u00e9, the appellant, claiming $14,500. The writ was sent to the respondent, who re- turned it to the appellant with a letter disclaiming any responsibility. Thereupon, Joseph Hall\u00e9, the appellant, brought an action in warranty against the insurance company, invoking the omnibus clause and praying that the insurance company be declared bound to defend the principal action and indemnify the appellant from any condemnation up to the limit stated in the policy, namely, $10,000 for personal damages and $1,000 for damages to property.\nLs. St-Laurent K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and V. A. De Billy K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Mr. Rolland Hall\u00e9, of the city of L\u00e9vis, on the 11th day of May, 1934, took out an insurance policy issued by the company respondent and whereby, in consideration of the payment of the agreed premium, the company undertook to indemnify him for all losses or damages resulting from his legal responsibility towards third persons as a consequence of bodily injuries or of the death sustained by the latter and caused to them through the maintenance or the use of a certain automobile described in the policy.\nUnder another clause of the same policy (about which more will have to be said later), the company also undertook to indemnify certain other persons in respect of similar liability incurred through their use of the same automobile.\nOn August 27, 1934, Rolland Hall\u00e9 lent his automobile so insured by the respondent to his brother, Joseph Hall\u00e9, who is the appellant in this case.\nWhile the appellant was driving the automobile on that day, having with him as passengers in the car the Messrs. Louis and Antoine Bourget, he met with an accident in the course of which his two companions were seriously injured. Louis Bourget, one of them, brought an action against the appellant to recover the damages sustained by him as a result of the accident which he attributed to the fault and negligence of the appellant.\nThe appellant, alleging that he was protected against the liability thus incurred, under the policy issued by the respondent to his brother Rolland Hall\u00e9, brought, in his own name, an action in warranty against the respondent insurance company. The company repudiated any obligation towards the appellant in the premises, for several reasons later to be stated in detail. The action in warranty was dismissed by the Superior Court of Quebec, and that judgment was upheld by a majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in appeal (Bernier, Hall and Barclay JJ.; Sir Mathias Tellier C.J. and Galipeault J. dissenting).\nThe case is now submitted to this Court; and the decision is of exceptional importance, because the point on which it was rendered in the courts below admittedly affects practically all liability insurance policies on automobiles in the province of Quebec.\nOf the several grounds of defence raised by the defendant insurance company, two only were upheld by the trial judge and relied on by one or the other of the judges forming the majority in the Court of King\u2019s Bench. In our view, it will be sufficient to deal with those two points, more particularly since, on the other matters, the respondent, for its success, had to depend upon questions of fact which have been decided against it by the trial judge and also inferentially by the appeal court. It may be added that, before this Court, counsel for the respondent did not press these other points.\nThe first point held against the appellant was that the stipulation in the insurance policy on which the present suit is based was void because the mis-en-cause Rolland Hall\u00e9, who took out the policy, had no insurable interest in any liability that his brother, the appellant, might incur.\nFor the purpose of discussing this point, it will be necessary to analyse the insurance policy itself and to quote from it the material clauses having reference to the matter.\nThe document is called: \u201cPolice Automobile Combin\u00e9e.\u201d It begins by reciting in full the application of Rolland Hall\u00e9. It then comes to what forms the essential part of the contract (\u201cConventions d\u2019assurance\u201d) upon which the parties have agreed and which reads thus:\nEn consid\u00e9ration du paiement de la prime stipul\u00e9e et des d\u00e9clarations contenues dans la proposition, le tout sujet aux limites, termes et conditions des pr\u00e9sentes, * * * cette convention fait foi des stipulations suivantes:\n* * * Section A.\u2014L\u2019assureur s\u2019engage \u00e0 indemniser l\u2019assur\u00e9 pour toute perte ou dommages entra\u00eenant la responsabilit\u00e9 du dit assur\u00e9, \u00e0 la suite de blessures corporelles (y compris mort en r\u00e9sultant) subies par toute personne, \u00e0 raison du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019entretien ou de l\u2019usage de l\u2019automobile.\nSection B.\u2014L\u2019assureur s\u2019engage \u00e0 indemniser l\u2019assur\u00e9 pour toute perte ou dommages entra\u00eenant la responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale du dit assur\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de la destruction ou de dommages (y compris la perte d\u2019usage en d\u00e9coulant) aux biens de toute personne, \u00e0 raison du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019entretien ou de l\u2019usage de l\u2019automobile.\nEt relativement aux sections A et B pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, l\u2019assureur s\u2019engage de plus:\u2014\n(1) Sur r\u00e9ception d\u2019avis de blessures corporelles ou de dommages mat\u00e9riels, de se mettre au service de l\u2019assur\u00e9 en faisant enqu\u00eate, n\u00e9gociant avec le r\u00e9clamant ou r\u00e9glant toute r\u00e9clamation en r\u00e9sultant, en la fa\u00e7on que l\u2019assureur jugera appropri\u00e9e;\net (2) A contester, au nom de l\u2019assur\u00e9, toute action au civil intent\u00e9e contre lui en tout temps, \u00e0 raison de telles blessures corporelles ou dommages mat\u00e9riels, le tout aux frais de l\u2019assureur;\net (3) A acquitter les frais tax\u00e9s contre l\u2019assur\u00e9 dans toute action au civil contest\u00e9e par l\u2019assureur, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s par jugement sur telle partie du dit jugement qui n\u2019exc\u00e8de pas la limite de responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019assureur;\net (4) A rembourser l\u2019assur\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses encourues pour tous secours chirurgicaux urgents n\u00e9cessaires au moment de l\u2019accident causant les blessures corporelles;\net (5) Si l\u2019usage de l\u2019automobile est sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 par les mots \u2018Usages priv\u00e9s\u2019 ou \u2018Usage priv\u00e9 et visites d\u2019affaires\u2019 (livraison commerciale except\u00e9e) seulement, \u00e0 indemniser, en la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et aux m\u00eames conditions auxquelles l\u2019assur\u00e9 y a droit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9sentes, toute personne transport\u00e9e dans l\u2019automobile ou la conduisant l\u00e9gitimement ainsi que toute personne, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou corporation l\u00e9galement responsable de la conduite du dit automobile, \u00e0 condition que permission en soit donn\u00e9e par l\u2019assur\u00e9, ou si l\u2019assur\u00e9 est un particulier, que telle permission provienne d\u2019un membre adulte de sa maison autre qu\u2019un chauffeur ou serviteur domestique; pourvu, toutefois que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 payable en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes soit appliqu\u00e9e d\u2019abord \u00e0 la protection de l\u2019assur\u00e9, et le reste, s\u2019il en est, \u00e0 la protection d\u2019autres personnes y ayant droit en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes et ce, en conformit\u00e9 aux instructions que l\u2019assur\u00e9 en donnera par \u00e9crit. * * *\nThe balance of subsection (5) has no bearing in the circumstances of the case.\nObviously, in support of his right to bring the action in warranty, the appellant relies on that portion of subsection (5) of section B above quoted. And it is that stipulation in his favour which has been declared illegal and void by the judgments appealed from, on the ground that Rolland Hall\u00e9, who was held to be the insured (and the only insured) in the policy, had no insurable interest in the liability provided against in the clause in question.\nIt may be well first to ascertain the purport and the extent of the clause under discussion. That clause constitutes one of the obligations undertaken by the insurance company (\u201c l\u2019assureur s\u2019engage de plus \u201c) in the contract it has made with Rolland Hall\u00e9 and in consideration of the premium paid by the latter to the company (\u201cen consid\u00e9ration du paiement de la prime stipul\u00e9e\u201d).\nThe obligation thus assumed by the respondent is:\n\u00e0 indemniser, en la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et aux m\u00eames conditions auxquelles l\u2019assur\u00e9 y a droit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9sentes, toute personne transport\u00e9e dans l\u2019automobile ou la conduisant l\u00e9gitimement (which is the case here), ainsi que toute personne * * * l\u00e9galement responsable de la conduite du dit automobile, \u00e0 condition que permission en soit donn\u00e9e par l\u2019assur\u00e9\nThere is no question that, in the insurance policy, Rolland Hall\u00e9, who made the application for it, is styled \u201cl\u2019assur\u00e9\u201d; and that, wherever the word \u201cassur\u00e9\u201d occurs in the document, it is intended to refer to Rolland Hall\u00e9 (\u201cci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 Fassur\u00e9\u201d). But, of course, it does not follow that, because the parties adopted that word for the purpose of designating Rolland Hall\u00e9 in the policy, the other persons who may rightfully come under it are, for that sole reason, to be excluded from the benefits deriving to them, and that they are not to be regarded as insured, merely because they have not been described by that term in the document. The question is not how they have been described, but whether, by force of the stipulations in the policy, they have the rights of insured persons.\nNow, the policy expressly states that, in addition to its engagements towards the \u201cassur\u00e9,\u201d Rolland Hall\u00e9, the company obliges itself\n\u00e0 indemniser * * * toute personne conduisant l\u00e9gitimement (l\u2019automobile) ainsi que toute personne * * * l\u00e9galement responsable de la conduite du dit automobile, \u00e0 condition que permission en soit donn\u00e9e par l\u2019assur\u00e9.\nIn this case, there is no doubt that Joseph Hall\u00e9, the appellant, was legitimately in possession of the automobile, that he was driving it with the permission of the \u201cassur\u00e9,\u201d and that he was legally responsible for the manner in which the automobile was being driven. The appellant was, therefore, one of the persons whom, under the terms of the policy and in consideration of the premium paid to it by Rolland Hall\u00e9, the respondent insurance company undertook to indemnify. He was one of the persons who, in the intention of both contracting parties, was to be insured against loss or liability from the risks described in the policy. He was not therein mentioned by name; but, according to the law of Quebec, as expressed in the French doctrine and jurisprudence, it is not necessary for its validity that the stipulation for the benefit of third parties should be made in words definitely ascertaining these persons; it is sufficient if they are ascertainable on the day when the stipulation takes effect in their favour (Vide: Pardessus, Droit commercial, 6e \u00e9dition, 1856, tome 2; Colin & Capitant, tome 2, pp. 324 et suiv., referred to by Sir Mathias Tellier, C.J., in his reasons for judgment).\nPlaniol (Trait\u00e9 El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil, 9e \u00e9dition, tome 2, p. 418, nos. 1236 & seq.) puts the question:\nPeut-on stipuler au profit de personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es? Oui, \u00e0 la condition que les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la stipulation, actuellement ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s, soient d\u00e9terminables au jour o\u00f9 la convention doit recevoir effet \u00e0 leur profit. Ce qui peut mettre obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 d\u2019une stipulation pour autrui, ce n\u2019est donc pas, \u00e0 proprement parler, la simple ind\u00e9termination actuelle de ces b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, si l\u2019on poss\u00e8de un moyen de les reconna\u00eetre quand il le faudra; c\u2019est leur ind\u00e9termination future, devant persister d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ind\u00e9finie, autrement dit leur ind\u00e9terminabilit\u00e9.\nAnd in the following number 1237, he gives, amongst other illustrations (\u201capplications\u201d):\n1\u00b0 l\u2019assurance contract\u00e9e \u201cpour le compte de qui il appartiendra\u201d, qui est assez fr\u00e9quente, tant en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assurance terrestre qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assurance maritime,\nin which he says that\nLa jurisprudence a admis dans (ces) hypoth\u00e8ses la stipulation au profit de personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es.\nWe find the same doctrine in Planiol & Ripert, Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais (1930, tome 6, p. 502, no. 367):\nLa stipulation au profit de personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es n\u2019est pas valable lorsque le contrat ne permet pas de les d\u00e9terminer au jour o\u00f9 il doit recevoir effet \u00e0 leur profit. Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019obligation sans un cr\u00e9ancier d\u00e9terminable. Mais il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que d\u00e8s le moment du contrat il soit d\u00e9terminable nominativement. La jurisprudence a admis la validit\u00e9 de stipulations au profit de personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es dans de nombreuses hypoth\u00e8ses.\nThe appellant undoubtedly comes within the description of the persons whose liability is covered by the undertaking of the company. Consequently he is one of the persons insured under the policy and towards whom the respondent has assumed the obligation of indemnifying in accordance with the terms of the policy. The company cannot escape that obligation, unless it is shown that its stipulation is prohibited by law.\nAnd such is the contention of the company. It submits that the stipulation could be valid only if Rolland Hall\u00e9, who took out the policy, had himself an insurable interest in the liability of his brother, the present appellant, or, in other words, that an insurance policy is allowed by the law of Quebec only if the person who applies for the policy and pays the premiums therefor has a personal insurable interest in the subject-matter of the policy. Under that contention, it does not matter if the person really insured has an insurable interest; the argument proceeds on the assumption that the only person who may become insured under the law is the person who applies for the policy and who pays the premiums therefor.\nWe must say that we cannot admit that contention, as the law stands in the province of Quebec; and our reasons for holding that view are already so well and so ably exposed in the reasons for judgment in this case of the Honourable the Chief Justice of the province that we do not find it advisable to develop them at the same length as we might otherwise have found necessary.\nIn the Civil Code of Quebec, insurance is defined as follows:\n2468. Insurance is a contract whereby one party, called the insurer or underwriter, undertakes, for a valuable consideration to indemnify the other, called the insured, or his representatives, against loss or liability from certain risks or perils to which the object of the insurance may be exposed, or from the happening of a certain event.\nWe find no difficulty in applying the definition to the policy issued by the respondent. It applies both to the main obligation undertaken for the benefit of Rolland Hall\u00e9 and to the obligation undertaken towards the other persons ascertainable under subsection 5 of section B. In the terms of the document, the insurer or underwriter, The Canadian Indemnity Company, undertakes for a valuable consideration to indemnify both Rolland Hall\u00e9 personally and the persons coming within the description in subsection 5 (who may be called the insured)\nagainst loss or liability from certain risks * * * or from the happening of a certain event.\nThere is nothing in the definition of the code to the effect that the person \u201ccalled the insured\u201d must be the person who applies for the policy or who pays the premium.\nIn the article just quoted, we see nothing to prevent a person requesting the issue of an insurance policy for the benefit of another person. And there is nothing to that effect in any other article of the code. Article 2472 C.C., pointed to by counsel for the respondent, enacts that\nAll persons capable of contracting may insure objects in which they have an interest and which are subject to risk;\nand counsel argued from this that only the actual contracting party may take out an insurance policy for his benefit upon objects in which he has an interest.\nWe cannot agree with that narrow interpretation.\nIt should be noticed, at first, that the article is permissive only and that it should be construed in accordance with article 15 of the code:\nThe word \u201cshall\u201d is to be construed as imperative, and the word \u201cmay\u201d as permissive.\nArticle 2472 C.C. does not mean that only the contracting party may insure objects in which he has an interest, or which are subject to risk. We agree with Chief Justice Tellier, when he says:\nTout ce que signifie la disposition de l\u2019article 2472, c\u2019est qu\u2019on ne peut avoir d\u2019assurance que sur des objets dans lesquels on a un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable et qui sont expos\u00e9s \u00e0 quelque risque.\nO\u00f9 prend-on que, lorsqu\u2019il m\u2019est permis de prendre ou d\u2019avoir une assurance, je ne pourrais la recevoir par les soins d\u2019un interm\u00e9diaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u2019un mandataire, d\u2019un g\u00e9rant d\u2019affaires, ou, dans un des cas pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019article 1029, d\u2019un parent ou ami bienfaisant ou obligeant, la stipulant \u00e0 mon profit, comme condition ou charge d\u2019un contrat qu\u2019il fait pour lui-m\u00eame, ou d\u2019une donation qu\u2019il fait \u00e0 un autre?\nUne telle r\u00e8gle n\u2019existe nulle part dans le Code.\nFar from there being in the code a prohibition against a stipulation of the nature stated by the learned Chief Justice, the validity of such a stipulation is expressly recognized in article 1029 referred to by the Chief Justice:\n1029. A party in like manner may stipulate for the benefit of a third person, when such is the condition of a contract which he makes for himself, or of a gift which he makes to another; and he who makes the stipulation cannot revoke it, if the third person have signified his assent to it.\nThe stipulation made by Rolland Hall\u00e9 and agreed to by the Canadian Indemnity Company in subsection 5 of the policy now in question is a valid stipulation under article 1029 C.C. Rolland Hall\u00e9 has made it a condition of the contract which he made for himself; and the premium which he paid to the company was the consideration for it. That premium was paid as well for the insurance in his favour as for the insurance for the benefit of the third persons. It is well understood in the legal doctrine that the word \u201ccondition\u201d in the text of article 1029 C.C. is meant to connote a charge imposed upon the other contracting party and which the latter assumes as part of his obligations under the contract. The Chief Justice asserts as being now quite beyond dispute that it is looked upon as a \u201ccharge obligatoire et exigible\u201d; and in support of that proposition, he cites Larombi\u00e8re, art. 1121, no. 2; Laurent, t. 15, no. 552; Aubry et Rau, t. 4, par. 343 ter. note 15; Mourlon, t. 2, no. 1075.\nNo difficulty lies in the fact that up to the moment of the accident Joseph Hall\u00e9 had not yet signified his assent to the stipulation made in his favour by Rolland Hall\u00e9. His assent was not necessary to bind the insurance company. It was sufficient if he manifested his intention to avail himself of the stipulation as soon as the event happened which made the stipulation effective in his favour. The notice of the accident given by him to the insurance company was already an indication to the latter that Joseph Hall\u00e9 was availing himself of the protection afforded by the policy. In his action in warranty against the company, he expressly declared that intention. It will be noticed that, under article 1029 C.C., the only effect of the assent of the third person is to make the stipulation irrevocable by the person who has made it.\nAnd in civil law a valid stipulation in favour of a third person creates a contract between the third person and the person who has agreed to be bound by the contract. It establishes a vinculum juris between the latter and the third person.\nSpeaking particularly of the present case, the policy confers an independent right upon the third person who is insured under it. Planiol & Ripert (Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, t. 6, p. 496, no. 362) say on this subject:\nC\u2019est le but et l\u2019effet essentiel de la stipulation. Pour r\u00e9aliser cette acquisition conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019intention du stipulant qui normalement doit procurer au tiers le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tous autres, on a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 dire que le tiers a contre le promettant un droit direct et personnel remontant aux sources du contrat.\nThis Court has accepted the principle of that doctrine in the case of The Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Company v. Lefaivre[1].\nArticle 1029 of the Civil Code is of general application in the law of contracts in Quebec; and it applies as well to the contract of insurance, unless some special rule should be found in the particular chapter specifically dealing with insurance.\nTogether with the learned Chief Justice of Quebec, we have already stated that no such special rule exists excluding from the insurance contract the application of the article. We have also observed that article 2472 C.C. is merely permissive. Incidentally it may be pointed out that this article, in terms, would appear to contemplate only insurance upon objects, while, by force of the definition of insurance given by article 2468 C.C., not only the perils to which an object may be exposed are stated to be valid subject-matter of an insurance contract, but also the \u201cliability from certain risks *\u2019 * * from the happening of a \u201ccertain event.\u201d\nBe that as it may, the true interpretation of article 2472 C.C. is that one may become insured against loss or liability from certain risks or perils only if he has an interest in the objects exposed to such risks or perils, or in the happening of the event from which such risks or perils result. For article 2472 C.C. must necessarily be read together with article 2468 C.C; and they must complete one another. In the insurance world as well as in legal parlance, the rule laid down in article 2472 C.C. is that, in order to be legally and validly insured, one must have an insurable interest in the object or the risk insured against for his benefit. That rule is, of course, rudimentary in insurance law; and it is significant that, in the Civil Code, it is nowhere stated as essential to the validity of a policy, unless it is to be found in article 2472 C.C., and, in our view, that is precisely where the codifiers and the legislature intended to lay down the rule.\n\u201cInsurable interest\u201d is defined in article 2474 C.C. as follows:\nA person has an insurable interest in the object insured whenever he may suffer direct and immediate loss by the destruction or injury of it.\nThere, again, it may be pointed out, the article speaks only of insurance upon an \u201cobject\u201d (\u201cla chose\u201d), while it must be beyond dispute that the definition also applies to an insurance against the risks resulting \u201c from the happening of a certain event,\u201d and that here also article 2474 C.C. must be read with article 2468 C.C. It cannot be questioned that, so far as insurable interest is concerned, the third persons described in subsection 5 of section B of the policy now in issue, and Joseph Hall\u00e9 in particular, have such interest in the risks insured against, within the definition given by article 2474 C.C. Joseph Hall\u00e9 has so much an insurable interest in the risk against which he was insured by Rolland Hall\u00e9 that he might well have taken out a valid insurance policy in his own name against that risk.\nSo far, therefore, we find that the clause in favour of third persons, invoked by the appellant against the respondent, is valid and enforceable, because stipulations in favour of third parties are valid and enforceable in civil law. They are expressly authorized by article 1029 C.C. of the Civil Code; and no special rule exists, in the chapter of the Civil Code dealing with insurance, of a nature to exclude insurance contracts from the application of the general principle enacted in article 1029 C.C. But we think article 2480 C.C., of the same chapter, serves to strengthen the view already stated; for, in that article, the Civil Code expressly singles out a class of policies which are declared prohibited. The article begins by reciting that the contract of insurance is usually witnessed by an instrument called a policy of insurance; that the policy either declares the value of the thing insured, and is then called a valued policy, or it contains no declaration of value and is then called an open policy. The article then prescribes:\nWager or gaming policies, in the object of which the insured has no insurable interest, are illegal.\nIt is better, we think, to quote also from the French version; for it appears to be susceptible of a clearer meaning of the intention of the legislature:\nLes polices d\u2019aventure et de jeu, sur des objets dans lesquels l\u2019assur\u00e9 n\u2019a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat susceptible d\u2019assurance, sont ill\u00e9gales.\nIn connection with that article, it is interesting to read the report of the codifiers (vol. 3, p. 240) concerning that section of the Title of Insurance embracing articles 2468 to 2484 C.C. The report says:\nThis section consists of seventeen articles.\nArticle 1 is a definition of the contract of insurance, prepared upon the authority of the best writers, under the several systems of law, indicated by the citations. There is an advantage in giving a clear and precise definition in this instance, in order to make prominent the essential characteristic of insurance, viz: that it is a contract of indemnity for loss or liability; thus distinguishing the legitimate contract from that class of transactions which sometimes assume its form, but are in their nature mere bets or wages.\nThe passage is illuminating in that it distinguishes that class of transactions which sometimes assume the form of insurance but which, states the report, \u201care in their nature mere bets or wagers,\u201d from what the codifiers call the \u201clegitimate contract,\u201d which they describe as \u201ca contract of indemnity for loss or liability.\u201d\nAnd, in order to define the \u201clegitimate contract\u201d of indemnity for loss or liability, the codifiers have, in their own words, made \u201cprominent the essential characteristic of insurance,\u201d which is that the insured must have an insurable interest (articles 2472 and 2480 C.C.) and that the contract should otherwise comply with the requirements of the definition contained in article 2468.\nThe wager or gaming policies are those which are prohibited by the code: The policies issued in conformity with the definition proposed by them (and which has been embodied in the code) against risks in respect to which the insured has an insurable interest are those which the codifiers call the \u201clegitimate contracts,\u201d because they contain the \u201cessential characteristic\u201d exposed in the \u201cseventeen articles\u201d of the section.\nThis result would seem also to follow from article 2476 C.C., whereby\nInsurance may be made against all losses by inevitable accident, or irresistible force, or by events over which the insured has no control; subject to the general rules relating to illegal and immoral contracts.\nIn our view, the policy issued by the respondent, including the clause invoked by the appellant, well comes within the definition of the code; it contains the essential characteristics prescribed by the legislature; it is not prohibited by any article of the code; and the particular stipulation in favour of the third persons (and in favour of Joseph Hall\u00e9 amongst others) is well grounded on and well justified by article 1029 C.C.\nIt may be interesting to note further that article 1121 of the French Civil Code corresponds to article 1029 of the Quebec Civil Code and that, in the French doctrine and jurisprudence, the stipulation for the benefit of the third person in insurance policies is held to be valid and enforceable. May we quote from the Pandectes fran\u00e7aises, vbo Assurances en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, no. 361:\nMais il va soi que l\u2019assurance est valable s\u2019il \u00e9tabli que le tiers a agi comme g\u00e9rant d\u2019affaires et pour le compte du principal int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Elle le serait \u00e9galement si elle \u00e9tait faite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 1121 C.C., c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, pour une personne stipulant \u00e0 la fois, tant en son propre nom pour un risque personnel, qu\u2019au nom du tiers expos\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre risque.\nThe second objection upheld by the Superior Court against the action of the appellant is only subsidiary. Indeed, it does not go to the merits of the claim. It is only to the effect that the action was brought prematurely. The point was not discussed by Bernier and Barclay JJ. because, in the view they took of the first question, it was unnecessary for them to pass upon this second one. Sir Mathias Tellier C.J., and Galipeault J., both rejected it; Hall J. alone approved the trial judge upon it.\nThe objection is the following: Subs. (5) of section B of the policy, after having provided that the company undertakes to indemnify, \u201cen la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et aux m\u00eames conditions auxquelles l\u2019assur\u00e9 y a droit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9sentes,\u201d the third persons described in the section, contains the following proviso:\npourvu toutefois que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 payable en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes soit appliqu\u00e9e d\u2019abord \u00e0 la protection de l\u2019assur\u00e9, et le reste, s\u2019il en est, \u00e0 la protection d\u2019autres personnes y ayant droit en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes et ce, en conformit\u00e9 aux instructions que l\u2019assur\u00e9 en donnera par \u00e9crit.\nIn this case, the \u201cassur\u00e9,\u201d Rolland Hall\u00e9, has given no such written instructions; and it was argued on behalf of the respondent that the giving of these instructions was a condition precedent to its liability towards third persons under the policy, and that, failing those instructions, the rights of the appellant had not yet accrued.\nBut the proviso must be construed in light of the law of Quebec, as we understand it, in accordance with the views already expressed in our discussion of the first point raised in this appeal; and it must also be construed in light of the tenor and purport of the whole insurance policy envisaged from the viewpoint of that law.\nFrom that standpoint, the insurance company has subscribed an absolute undertaking to pay the third persons coming under the description of the policy, in the events insured against for their benefit. The obligation so undertaken by the insurance company creates an independent right accruing to the third persons as soon as they have manifested their intention to avail themselves of it. That right, by force of art. 1029 C.C., is no longer subject to the will of the \u201cassur\u00e9,\u201d Rolland Hall\u00e9, when once the third person has \u201csignified his assent to it\u201d (art. 1029 C.C.). Interpreted in that sense, the proviso comes into play-only if there are concurrent claims for loss or liability either on behalf of the \u201cassur\u00e9\u201d and the other third persons or on behalf of several other third persons. It qualifies the obligations of the insurer and, as a consequence, the rights of the several insured persons, only as regards distribution of the amount payable. The text of the policy is quite clear: \u201cpourvu, toutefois, que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 payable en vertu \u201cdes pr\u00e9sentes soit appliqu\u00e9e etc.\u201d First, the indemnity must have become \u201cpayable\u201d; and it is in the distribution of the money so payable that the proviso regulates that: 1st. The money shall be applied towards the \u201cprotection de l\u2019assur\u00e9\u201d; 2nd. The balance, \u201c\u00e0 la protection d\u2019autres personnes y ayant droit en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes.\u201d\nThe insurer is liable under the policy only up to a certain limited amount for each accident. The proviso declares how that amount is to be distributed if the limit of that liability be reached as a result of each accident. The contracting \u201cassur\u00e9\u201d is to be paid first. Then, the other person, out of the balance, if any. And if there are several other persons and they cannot all be paid out of the balance, the distribution is to be made \u201cen conformit\u00e9 aux instructions que l\u2019assur\u00e9 en donnera par \u00e9crit.\u201d\nThat interpretation agrees with that of Chief Justice Tellier and of Mr. Justice Galipeault.\nIn this case, there was no occasion for written instructions on the part of Rolland Hall\u00e9, for the situation contemplated in the proviso did not arise.\nBut, moreover, Rolland Hall\u00e9 was mis-en-cause. The mise-en-cause is resorted to either for the purpose of securing a judgment personally against the third party so called in, or\nen d\u00e9claration de jugement commun, quand on ne le cite que pour voir dire qu\u2019il y a chose jug\u00e9s, \u00e0 la fois, contre lui et contre le d\u00e9fendeur principal.\n(Garsonnet, Trait\u00e9 de Proc\u00e9dure, 3e. \u00e9di., tome 3, p. 197, no. 574). The latter purpose was obviously the reason here for adding Rolland Hall\u00e9 as a party. He has not raised a word of objection. He shall be bound by the judgment ordering that the indemnity be paid to his brother, Joseph Hall\u00e9. That consequence, in the premises, meets any purpose derived from the proviso with regard to written instructions. Now, the policy further contains some statutory conditions; and one of them reads as follows:\nAucune action aux fins de recouvrer le montant d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation en raison de cette police ne pourra \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre l\u2019assureur \u00e0 moins que les exigences ci-haut n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es et que telle action ne soit entam\u00e9e apr\u00e8s d\u00e9termination du montant de la perte soit par un jugement contre l\u2019assur\u00e9 apr\u00e8s audition du litige, soit par convention entre les parties avec le consentement \u00e9crit de l\u2019assureur, et, de toute fa\u00e7on, aucune telle action ne pourra \u00eatre intent\u00e9e \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne soit entam\u00e9e avant l\u2019expiration d\u2019une ann\u00e9e subs\u00e9quemment.\nWhen the action in warranty was brought by the appellant, no judgment had yet been recovered against him on the principal action, nor of course had any amount been determined by agreement with the written consent of the insurer. And the respondent, therefore, contends that, for this second reason, the action in warranty was premature.\nIt will be observed that the restriction put upon the right of the insured by the statutory condition, is that he may not bring an action to recover the amount of his claim under the policy, before the measure of his liability towards the victim has been determined by judgment or by agreement. The right to bring an action in warranty is not touched. Under the policy, the insurer is obliged\n\u00e0 indemniser en la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et aux m\u00eames conditions auxquelles l\u2019assur\u00e9 y a droit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9sentes, toute personne etc.\nThat provision gave \u201ctoute personne\u201d (and, therefore, Joseph Hall\u00e9) all the rights of Rolland Hall\u00e9. The words are most comprehensive and they are wide enough to include all the obligations enumerated in subsections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of section B. The respondent was, therefore, obliged to contest, on behalf of Joseph Halle, the action brought against the latter by Louis Bourget, and to do so at its own costs. As the respondent refused to comply with that obligation, the appellant rightly brought the action in warranty to compel it to fulfil its undertaking.\nAs for the incidental demand, it was not probably necessary, for we think, as already stated, that the statutory condition above quoted does not prevent the insured from bringing the action in warranty at once\u2014though, in practice, the occasion for it will rarely happen, because the insurer generally takes up the instance and contests the principal action in the name of the insured. However, the incidental demand appears to have been justified, in the circumstances; it was filed after judgment rendered in the principal action and it has been regarded in the provincial courts as a procedure rightly taken under paragraphs 2 and 3 of art. 215 of the Code of Procedure. This is not a circumstance where this Court may be asked to interfere.\nWe have purposely avoided in these reasons to refer to the case of Vandepitte v. Preferred Accident Insurance Corporation of New York[2] expressly relied on by the trial judge and also, to a certain extent, by one of the learned judges forming the majority in the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nIt will not be necessary to repeat that the courts ought always to be careful, even when the texts are apparently the same, in accepting as authority for a proposition of law under one system, a judgment rendered under a different system of jurisprudence.\nAs pointed out by the Honourable the Chief Justice of the province of Quebec in the present case:\nLe jugement du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9, dans la cause Vandepitte2 ne peut nullement \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 au demandeur: d\u2019abord parce que cette cause-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait bien diff\u00e9rente de celle-ci, et ensuite parce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9pendait d\u2019une loi diff\u00e9rente de na n\u00f4tre.\nWith those remarks we fully and completely agree. The Vandepitte case2 was decided under the Insurance Act of British Columbia. The statutory law and the general legal principles to be applied differed in most material respects. Even where certain language of the statutes or of the policies might in some respects have appeared to correspond with the language now in issue, it had to be interpreted and to be applied according to different conceptions of the legal doctrine. Moreover, in the Vandepitte case2, the victim of the accident was himself suing the insurance company. Neither the insured nor his daughter (as third person) was asserting any right. We ought to repeat what was said in this Court re Desrosiers v. The King[3]:\nThis case affords an excellent illustration of the danger of treating English decisions as authorities in Quebec cases which do not depend upon doctrines derived from the English law.\nThe appeal ought to be allowed, and the action in warranty and the incidental demand should be maintained with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St-Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Dupr\u00e9, De Billy, Pr\u00e9vost & Home.\n[1] [1930] S.C.R. 1.\n[2] [1933] A.C. 70.\n2 [1933] A.C. 70.\n2 [1933] A.C. 70.\n2 [1933] A.C. 70.\n[3] (1920) 60 S.C.R. 105, at 119.\n"}

In 1933 the claims lapsed through T.B. failing to perform the work required under the mining regulations (Regulations for the Disposal of Quartz Mining Claims, approved by order in council (Dom.) dated 19th January, 1929, and made applicable by order in council (Sask.) dated 27th November, 1931). In August, 1934, T.B. staked three of the claims on behalf of the defendant J.B. and the other three on behalf of the defendant E.B., and had them recorded in the names of J.B. and E.B. respectively. Subsequently the plaintiff M., personally and on behalf of the plaintiff P., purported to stake the same claims, believing that said staking as done by T.B. was not in accordance with the regulations. He applied for a record of the claims, but this was refused because the claims were already recorded as aforesaid\nThe affidavit in form \u201cA,\u201d required on an application to record a claim, contains the statement \u201cthat to the best of my knowledge and belief the ground * * * is unoccupied and unrecorded by any other person as a mineral claim.\u201d M. varied this by \u201cexcepting\u201d J.B. or E.B. respectively and inserting: \u201cThat I claim that the staking and recording by [J.B. or E.B. respectively] of said ground was illegal and that the said ground was open for staking at the time that I staked the same.\u201d\nPlaintiffs brought action for a declaration that the alleged claims of J.B. and E.B. to the claims were null and void and that plaintiffs were the holders or owners of the claims and were entitled to have records in their names, and other relief. MacDonald J. dismissed the action on the ground that plaintiffs had no status to maintain it ([19351 3 W.W.R. 226). An appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan ([1936] 2 W.W.R. 129). Plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal should be dismissed.\nThe case was not one contemplated by ss. 7 and 8 of the regulations (requiring certain procedure and permission as to relocating). Ss. 7 and 8 contemplate a case where, a claim having been abandoned or forfeited (and assuming, but not deciding, that this embraces a case in which the claim has lapsed by reason of failure to perform the representation work), the owner wishes to relocate the claim for himself. The question whether or not in point of fact T.B. was not acting on behalf of J.B. and E.B. but under some understanding, express or tacit, was making an unlawful use of their licences for the purpose of acquiring the ground for himself, was not a question upon which it was competent to the mining recorder to enter.\nThe claims having been staked out and the mining recorder having accepted the staking as bona fide and sufficient, there were records of them in the names of J.B. and E.B. ex facie valid which the mining recorder could not treat as nullities. Plaintiffs could not, when they staked their claims, make the affidavit in form \u201cA,\u201d and, such being the case, they could not lawfully either stake out the ground as a mineral claim or obtain a record of it as such.\nOsborne v. Morgan, 13 App. Cas: 227, Hartley v. Matson, 32 Can. S.C.R. 644, and other cases discussed. To what extent the principle of those decisions is applicable for the protection of a holder of a record of a mineral claim under the regulations now in question, it was not necessary to determine for the purposes of the present appeal. This Court did not endorse, or decide on, the view that the existence of a record in itself precludes a licensee from all remedy against the holder of the record where the facts of the particular case bring it within a class of cases in which the regulations expressly or by necessary implication enact that the ground within the limits of the claim described in the record is open to location generally by the holders of miners\u2019 licences.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] dismissing their appeal from the judgment of MacDonald J.[2] dismissing their action.\nThe action was brought for a declaration that alleged claims of the defendants Jean Box and Elizabeth Box to certain mineral claims in the vicinity of Beaver Lodge, Saskatchewan, were null and void and for a declaration that the plaintiffs were the holders or owners of said mineral claims and were entitled to have records in their names thereof, and other relief.\nIn the year 1930 the claims (six in number) were recorded in the names of certain persons who subsequently transferred or assigned them to the defendant Tom Box who registered the transfers and became the recorded owner of the claims. In November, 1933, the claims lapsed through Box failing to perform the work required to be done under the mining regulations (Regulations for the Disposal of Quartz Mining Claims, approved by Dominion order in council dated 19th January, 1929, and made applicable by Provincial order in council dated 27th November, 1931).\nIn August, 1934, Box purported to restake three of the claims on behalf of the defendant Jean Box and the other three on behalf of the defendant Elizabeth Box. In so doing he made use of the stakes previously placed, placing the new inscriptions below the inscriptions already there; he did very little reblazing and relied upon the old lines. He then made application for records of such claims, and orally made known to the acting mining recorder just what he had done by way of staking and marking. The acting recorder recorded the claims in the names of said Jean Box and Elizabeth Box respectively on October 15, 1934.\nSubsequently, in May, 1935, the plaintiff MacPhee, personally and on behalf of the plaintiff Pointer, purported to stake the same mineral claims. He had knowledge of what had been done by Box, but thought that it was contrary to the mining regulations and that the records issued were invalid and void. He later applied for a record of said mineral claims, which application was refused because the claims were already recorded in the names of Jean Box and Elizabeth Box as aforesaid.\nParagraph 9 of the affidavit in form \u201cA,\u201d required to accompany an application, is as follows:\n9. That to the best of my knowledge and belief the ground comprised within the boundaries of the said claim is unoccupied and unrecorded by any other person as a mineral claim; that it is not occupied by any building or any land falling within the curtilage of any dwelling house or any orchard, or any land under cultivation or any land reserved from entry under the Quartz Mining Regulations.\nThe affidavit of MacPhee varied this by inserting after the words \u201cis unoccupied and unrecorded by any other person\u201d the words \u201cexcepting Jean Box\u201d (or \u201cexcepting E. Box\u201d) and by adding at the end of the paragraph the words: \u201cThat I claim that the staking and recording by said Jean Box [or \u201cby said E. Box\u201d] of said ground was illegal and that the said ground was open for staking at the time that I staked the same.\u201d The plaintiffs then brought the present action. They made the Sterling Collieries Co. Ltd. a party defendant on the ground that, by virtue of an agreement with the defendant Tom Box dated December 14, 1934, and subsequently recorded in the Department of Natural Resources, the company claimed an interest in the claims.\nBesides alleging that the mineral claims recorded in the names of the defendants Jean Box and Elizabeth Box were invalid and null and void by reason of non-compliance with the mining regulations in the staking thereof, the plaintiffs alleged in the alternative that the defendant Tom Box relocated the mineral claims by and on behalf of himself and that such relocation was invalid and null and void by reason of his failing to comply with the regulations as to staking, etc., and also by reason of his failing to obtain permission from the mining recorder to relocate and also failing prior to so relocating to post a notice of the abandonment or forfeiture of the claims and also failing to file a statutory declaration of posting notice.\nSections 7, 8, 53, and (in part) 65, of the regulations, read as follows:\n7. If a mineral claim has been abandoned or forfeited by any person, the mining recorder may, in his discretion, permit such person to relocate such mineral claim or any part thereof; Provided that such relocation shall not prejudice or interfere with the rights or interests of others.\n8. No claim shall be so relocated by or on behalf of the former holder thereof within thirty days of its being so abandoned or forfeited, nor until after notice of such abandonment or forfeiture has been posted up for at least a week in a conspicuous place on the claim and in the office of the mining recorder, nor until a statutory declaration has been filed with the mining recorder that the notice has been so posted.\n* * *\n53. If, however, the amount of work is not done and duly recorded, as prescribed in section 52, the claim shall, at the expiration of the period of one month provided for, lapse, and shall forthwith be open to relocation under these regulations, without any declaration of cancellation or forfeiture on the part of the Crown, subject, however, to the provisions of section 65 of these regulations.\n* * *\n65. Where forfeiture or loss of rights has occurred,\u2014\n* * *\n(b) by reason of failure to submit evidence that the prescribed work has been performed, as provided in subclause 4 of section 52:\n* * *\nthe Minister may, within three months after such default has occurred, upon such terms as he may deem just, make an order relieving the person in default from such forfeiture or loss of rights, and upon compliance with the terms, if any, so imposed, the interest or rights forfeited or lost shall be revested in the person so relieved, * * * The trial Judge, MacDonald J., dismissed the action, on the ground that the plaintiffs had no status to maintain it[3]. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan was dismissed[4].\nBy the judgment now reported, the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed with costs.\nO. M. Big gar K.C. for the appellants.\nS. W. Field K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal presents questions of no little difficulty. I have reached the conclusion that the appeal must be dismissed; and that conclusion rests upon a rather limited ground which can be explained without much elaboration. I prefer to express no opinion upon some questions suggested by the judgments in the Saskatchewan courts which, in the view I take, it is unnecessary to decide.\nThe purpose of the Regulations under examination is to regulate the location of mineral claims upon lands which, by the provisions of the Regulations, may be \u201clocated for such purposes.\u201d One of the cardinal features of them is found in sections 12, 13 and 14 which provide for the grant of miners\u2019 licences; and which make it perfectly clear that no person who is not and has not been the holder of a miner\u2019s licence can lawfully prospect for minerals upon the lands affected by the Regulations, or acquire any interest of any description in any mineral claim for which a lease or a patent \u201chas not been issued.\u201d\nSection 65 authorizes the Minister to relieve a person who has suffered loss of rights or forfeiture by reason of the failure to renew his miner\u2019s licence; but there is no authority under the Regulations, and, so far as I know, no authority derived from any source, vested either in the Minister or in any official to recognize any person who has never held a miner\u2019s licence as the occupant of mineral lands governed by the Regulations; or, indeed, to recognize anybody as entitled to mine upon lands governed by the Regulations except in pursuance of the Regulations themselves. The holder of a miner\u2019s licence is entitled, subject to s. 16, to enter, locate, prospect and mine upon \u201cvacant Dominion lands\u201d for minerals defined by the Regulations, and also to mine for gold and silver on land in respect of which the right to mine for such minerals has been reserved to the Crown. By section 16, the licensee is excluded from certain defined classes of lands, which classes include \u201cany land lawfully occupied for mining purposes.\u201d\nThere are some enactments in the Regulations, which it is convenient to notice at the outset, that provide, either expressly or by necessary implication, for cases in which lands that have been lawfully occupied for mining purposes under the Regulations cease to be lands within that category, and become subject to location under the provisions contained in sections 18 to 36 inclusive. By section 37, for example, a claim which has not been recorded within the appropriate period prescribed shall be deemed to be abandoned or forfeited without any declaration of abandonment or forfeiture on the part of the Crown.\nSection 49 provides for the abandonment of a mineral claim by the holder, which is effected by giving notice in writing to the Mining Recorder.\nBy section 53, where the holder of a mineral claim has failed within the prescribed periods to do the work required by section 52 upon his claim and to file evidence of it with the Recorder, the claim lapses and becomes \u201cforthwith * * * open to relocation under\u201d the Regulations \u201cwithout any declaration of cancellation or forfeiture on the part of the Crown.\u201d\nBy section 60, failure to make application for a certificate of improvements within the prescribed period results in the lapsing of the claim as under section 53, subject always to the authority of the Minister to grant relief under section 65.\nSection 37 deals with the recording of mineral claims and provides that application for a record shall be made within fifteen days after the \u201cclaim has been staked out\u201d; or a more extended period according to the circumstances as defined by the section. This section contains a vitally important provision which is to the effect that the application shall be made in \u201cthe prescribed form.\u201d\nBy section 40, no claim can be recorded unless the application is accompanied by an affidavit or solemn declaration in form A of the Regulations. Form A includes, in paragraph 9, this affirmation:\nThat to the best of my knowledge and belief the ground comprised within the boundaries of the said claim is unoccupied and unrecorded by any other person as a mineral claim; that it is not occupied by any building or any land falling within the curtilage of any dwelling house or any orchard, or any land under cultivation or any land reserved from entry under the Quartz Mining Regulations.\nIt is plain, when sections 37 and 40 are read in light of the terms of form A, that the Regulations do not contemplate the granting of an application for a record where the applicant knows he cannot truly affirm that\nthe ground comprised within * * * [his] claim is unoccupied and unrecorded by any other person as a mineral claim.\nThis language is very sweeping and in Wekusko Mines Ltd. v. May[5] the Manitoba Court of Appeal seems to have thought that where a claim has lapsed and, by section 53, has become \u201cforthwith\u201d open to \u201crelocation\u201d under the Regulations, the ground cannot, if the former holder of the lapsed claim remains in possession, be located and recorded as a mineral claim by another licensee, in consequence of the fact that such licensee cannot, in such circumstances, truly make this affirmation; and, if the owner of the lapsed claim remains in possession with the intention of applying within three months for relief under section 65, this view is, perhaps, not without plausibility, although not easy to reconcile with the explicit words of section 53. By section 49,\n* * * Upon any forfeiture, abandonment, or loss of rights in a mineral claim, the mining recorder shall forthwith enter a note thereof, with the date of entry, upon the record of the claim, and shall mark the claim \u201clapsed.\u201d\nIt is unnecessary for the purposes of this case to consider whether we should be forced to hold, in virtue of the terms of form A and the provisions of sections 37 and 40, that a claim which has been staked out, and is still, to the knowledge of the applicant, in the physical occupation of the locator, can be located or recorded as a mineral claim by another licensee in circumstances in which the Regulations, either expressly or by necessary implication, declare that the claim first located never came into existence as a mineral claim (where, for example, the locator has never held a miner\u2019s licence); or has ceased to exist in the eye of the law by reason, for example, of failure to obtain a record within the period prescribed by s. 37, or by reason of failure to do and file evidence of the work required by section 52. It is not necessary to enter upon these questions because, in the view I take of sections 7 and 8, the claims now in question having been \u201cstaked out,\u201d and the Mining Recorder having accepted the staking as bona fide and sufficient, there were records of them in the names of Elizabeth and Jean Box ex facie valid which the Mining Recorder could not treat as nullities.\nThe effect of sections 7 and 8 is, I think, when they are read together, this: where a claim has been forfeited or abandoned, the owner of the claim is not entitled to relocate the ground embraced within the claim for himself, either personally, or by the agency of another. Section 7 makes it quite clear that the cases contemplated are such cases. By that section the permission authorized is a permission given to the person who has lost a claim by abandonment or forfeiture, not a permission given to a licensee as agent of somebody else.\nIt follows, therefore, that the locations in the name of Elizabeth Box and Jean Box were valid locations on their face. The question whether or not in point of fact Tom Box was not acting on behalf of these persons but under some understanding, express or tacit, was making an unlawful use of their licences for the purpose of acquiring the ground for himself, was not a question upon which it was competent to the Mining Recorder to enter. He had no means at his command of investigating such a question and the Regulations give him no authority to make any such investigation.\nSome elucidation may, perhaps, be useful at this point. The holder of a miner\u2019s licence, by section 15, is given the right \u201cto enter, locate, prospect and mine,\u201d as already observed, \u201cupon any vacant Dominion lands,\u201d but that section makes it quite clear that this right of the licensee must be exercised by him \u201cpersonally, but not through another\u201d except in the cases provided for by section 20. Section 20, in so far as pertinent, is in these words:\n20. A licensee may, in any one licence year in any one mining division, stake out and apply for:\u2014\n(a) Not more than three mineral claims on his own licence;\n(b) Not more than three claims each for not more than two other licensees, being nine claims in all; By section 26, it is the duty of the locator to place upon \u201cpost No. 1\u201d not only his own name and the number of his licence as the person staking the claim, but also, where the claim is staked on behalf of another licensee, the name of such other licensee; and, by section 37, the licensee who stakes a claim on behalf of another is authorized to make application for a record of such claim, and it is the duty of the applicant, when the application is made on behalf of another, at the time of the application, to produce, not only his own licence, but also the licence of the licensee on whose behalf the application was made. And it is the duty of the recorder to endorse upon this last mentioned licence, and not upon the licence of the staker, a note in writing of the record of claim; and no such record is \u201ccomplete or effective until such endorsement has been made.\u201d\nIn paragraph 1 of form A the applicant gives the number and date of his own licence and in paragraph 11 he gives the residence, the post office address, the number and date and the place of issue of the licence of the person in whose name the claim is to be recorded. From these provisions of the Regulations and paragraphs 2 and 11 of form A, it is plain that section 20 contemplates the use by one licensee of the licence of another; and that the first mentioned licensee is acting on behalf of the second.\nNow, there is a general principle of law stated very clearly and forcibly by Sir George Jessel in In re Hallett\u2019s Estate[6] which comes into play here. The passage is in these words:\nNow, first upon principle, nothing can be better settled, either in our own law, or, I suppose, the law of all civilized countries, than this, that where a man does an act which may be rightfully performed, he cannot say that that act was intentionally and in fact done wrongly. A man who has a right of entry cannot say he committed a trespass in entering. A man who sells the goods of another as agent for the owner cannot prevent the owner adopting the sale, and deny that he acted as agent for the owner. It runs throughout our law, and we are familiar with numerous instances in the law of real property. A man who grants a lease believing he has sufficient estate to grant it, although it turns out that he has not, but has a power which enables him to grant it, is not allowed to say he did not grant it under the power. Wherever it can be done rightfully, he is not allowed to say, against the person entitled to the property or the right, that he has done it wrongfully. That is the universal law. Therefore, Tom Box, having, in recording the claims in question in the names of Elizabeth and Jean Box, professed to act as their agent, would not be permitted to aver as against them that he, and not they, was the owner of the claims recorded in their names. In an adverse proceeding by the Crown, or by any other party having a status to take such a proceeding, based upon allegations that Tom Box was not acting for his wife and daughter but for himself or some other person, it would be necessary to establish in fact that there was some arrangement, express or tacit, between Elizabeth Box, Jean Box and Tom Box and the alleged beneficial owner other than Tom Box (if there should be such) which had the effect of making Tom Box\u2019s use of the miners\u2019 licences of his wife and daughter illegal. That would, probably, be a very difficult proposition to establish.\nThe case in this respect is very different from the case in which a claim is staked out for a person who is not the holder of a miner\u2019s licence. That is a matter upon which it is the plain duty of the Mining Recorder to satisfy himself in performing his duties under section 37; the record, by the explicit terms of the section, is incomplete until the licence is produced and the proper endorsements are made upon it. Nor is it at all like the case in which a claim has lapsed by reason of the failure of the owner of the claim to do and record his representation work. That again is a matter with which the Mining Recorder is officially concerned because, as above pointed out, by sections 49 and 53 it is his duty in such a case forthwith to mark the claim \u201clapsed.\u201d\nIn the circumstances before us, it seems to me that the appellants could not, when they staked their claims, make the affidavit in form A and, such being the case, they could not lawfully either stake out the ground as a mineral claim, or obtain a record of it as such.\nI am assuming, I should observe, for the purposes of this discussion that section 7 embraces a case in which the claims have lapsed by reason of failure to perform the representation work. It must be understood, however, that I am not deciding the point or expressing an opinion upon it. I assume in favour of the appellants that such is the case; and on that assumption Tom Box\u2019s procedure on its face and that of the Mining Recorder were not obnoxious to the enactments of sections 7 and 8 for the reasons I have mentioned.\nThe respondents rely, and the Saskatchewan courts largely, if not entirely, proceeded, upon the authority of Osborne v. Morgan[7]; Hartley v. Matson[8]; St. Laurent v. Mercier[9], and Seguin v. Boyle[10]. I am not going to express any decided opinion upon the question whether, when a record has been obtained ostensibly under these regulations, there is any general rule by which the holder of the record is protected under a principle analogous to that which was applied in these cases. It is unnecessary to pass upon this point for the purposes of this appeal; but one or two observations upon these decisions may not be entirely valueless.\nAs regards St. Laurent v. Mercier[11], one is not entitled to assume (it should be noticed) that the reasons given by Mr. Justice Mills in his judgment were the grounds upon which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Sedgwick proceeded in deciding that the appeal should be dismissed. In that case, when Mercier received his renewal grant the original Hill claim had lapsed and the lands were vacant. As the present Chief Justice of British Columbia, then Martin J., pointed out in his judgment in Voight v. Groves[12], the Privy Council held in Chappelle v. The King[13] that the placer miner (that is to say, Mercier)\non renewal holds under an annual grant in substitution for, but not in continuation of, his original grant.\nThe Chief Justice and Sedgwick J. may very well have taken the view that the invalidity of Mercier\u2019s original grant did not affect the validity of the renewal grant and, besides, counsel for the respondent contended that on the facts the ground was open for location in 1899 when Mercier staked out his claim. In truth, St. Laurent v. Mercier11 ought never to have, been reported. Anybody familiar with the process of reporting decisions of this Court in those days will readily realize that in the circumstances the head-note cannot safely be relied upon. In Osborne v. Morgan[14] (supra) the Privy Council held two things: first, that no land within the boundaries of a lease for any purpose other than pastoral purposes fell within the category of \u201cCrown lands\u201d; and, consequently, that the rights conferred by \u201cminers\u2019 rights\u201d did not affect such land; second, they held also that the lease, if impeachable at the suit of the Crown, was, even in such a proceeding, voidable only, and not void.\nIn Hartley v. Matson[15], this Court had to consider a case in which an hydraulic mining lease had been granted to the defendants by the Minister of the Interior, and the decision was that holders of free miners\u2019 licences could not, by \u201cstaking claims\u201d within the boundaries of the lease, acquire a right to impeach the lease upon the ground that it had been obtained by misrepresentation; a sufficiently obvious conclusion when the regulations governing the granting of such leases are considered. That such cases as Osborne v. Morgan14 and Hartley v. Matson15 are generally applicable in protection of the person who has obtained a record from a mining recorder professing to act under the Regulations before us is a proposition not obviously deducible from these decisions. Seguin v. Boyle[16], in so far as pertinent, involved the same question as that raised by Hartley v. Matson15.\nIt is perfectly plain, of course, that if the holder of a miner\u2019s licence has staked a claim on lands open for location in complete conformity with the requirements of sections 18 to 36, the Mining Recorder has no discretion to refuse his application for a record when it is made within the proper time. The licensee in such circumstances has a statutory right to a record. On the other hand, the Mining Recorder has no discretion to dispense with statutory prerequisites generally. He has no authority to grant a record in response to an application by a person who by the Regulations is disqualified from locating mineral claims generally, or locating a mineral claim upon the ground to which the application relates.\nIn Osborne v. Morgan14, the lessee held under a formal lease granted by the Governor of the colony in the name of Her Majesty, and the regulations provided the machinery by which lands in de facto occupation under the Crown, but liable to forfeiture, could be purged of any such occupation and thrown open to location by free miners.\nThe regulations under consideration in Hartley v. Matson[17] affecting the granting of hydraulic leases vested a discretionary authority in the Minister of the Interior whose duty it was to satisfy himself that the provisions of the law had been complied with. The lessee held under a formal lease and by the regulations he had the exclusive right to enter upon and occupy the leased premises for the purpose of mining thereon with the exception of quartz mining and, subject to the right of any free miner to enter upon the premises to locate and mine for minerals in veins and lodes. Free miners were excluded from mining in such location by the express terms of the regulations except in pursuit of quartz mining. Such a formal lease, if obtained by misrepresentation, might have been voidable at the suit of the Crown, but it is difficult to understand on what principle the holder of a free miner\u2019s licence, which could be obtained by anybody on payment of the specified fee, could attack the validity of the lease as a hindrance to the exercise of the rights of such licence holders in placer mining. So long as the lease subsisted, licence holders were excluded from placer mining within the leased premises and no such licence holder had any title to maintain an action in the interests of all persons who might hold a free miner\u2019s licence or who might obtain one on the payment of the specified licence fee.\nTo what extent the principle of these decisions is applicable for the protection of a holder of a record of a mineral claim under these Regulations it is not necessary to determine for the purposes of the present appeal; and I am not endorsing (I wish to make it quite clear) the view that the existence of a record in itself precludes a licensee from all remedy against the holder of the record where the facts of the particular case bring it within a class of cases in which the Regulations expressly or by necessary implication enact that the ground within the limits of the claim described in the record is open to location generally by the holders of miners\u2019 licences. While I am not endorsing that view, I am giving no decision upon the point involved. It is, perhaps, advisable to add that, although these Regulations were originally based upon the British Columbia Mineral Act of 1896, the provisions for recording mineral claims in their present form differ in several material respects from the corresponding provisions of British Columbia statutes upon which the Regulations were originally founded. Under the B.C. Regulations the duty of the free miner who has located a claim is to record it within the time specified. Under these Regulations, his duty is to apply for a record. Under the B.C. statutes, no such affirmation as that contained in paragraph 9 of form A is required; and it may be added that the duty of passing on the bona fides and sufficiency of the locator\u2019s proceedings in staking his claim by these Regulations devolves, within rather broadly defined limits, upon the Mining Recorder, while under the B.C. statutes it devolves upon the courts of law. Moreover, the B.C. statute contains no provision corresponding to section 65.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacPherson & Leslie.\nSolicitors for the respondents: MacKenzie, Thorn, Bastedo, Ward & McDougall.\n[1] [1936] 2 W.W.R. 129; [1936] 3 D.L.R. 286.\n[2] [1935] 3 W.W.R. 326.\n[3] [1935] 3 W.W.R. 326.\n[4] [1936] 2 W.W.R. 129; [1936] 3 D.L.R. 286.\n[5] [1926] 1 W.W.R. 225.\n[6] (1880) L.R. 13 Ch.

There is a very slight difference between the patents. The alleged invention consists in the combination of the wrapping material and a tearing strip or ribbon of the same material, though in a different colour, affixed to the wrapper, and a tab or tongue composed of a little piece of the wrapper and ribbon. In the Lindsey patent the tab projects from one side of the package. In the Van Sickels patent the tab, instead or projecting, is formed by two small slits cut into the wrapper, one on each side of the ribbon. In both patents the effect of the arrangement is that when the tab is grasped the wrapper proper is readily torn and may conveniently be removed from the package.\nFor the purposes of this litigation counsel for the appellants treats the patents as relating to small packages that are wrapped in cellophane instead of in paper. Cellophane, so far as the record shows, is a trade name for a grainless, transparent, moisture-proof material made of regenerated cellulose that has become of popular use as a wrapping material. This material exhibits great tenacity against rupture, but, when once a break has been made in it, it tears very readily, though in all directions. A small package of chewing gum or cigarettes that has been wrapped in cellophane and sealed offers considerable resistance to any effort of the fingers to open it, and the patents in question are alleged to disclose a new and useful device for assisting in the breaking open of such a package.\nThe respondent denies the validity of the patents upon the ground of lack of subject-matter and upon the ground of anticipation and alleges that in any event it has not infringed. Its cigarettes are sold in small packages wrapped in cellophane with a ribbon tab flush with the outer edge and with a slit in the wrapper along the edge of the ribbon. In the view we take of the appeal, it will be unnecessary for us to consider the question of infringement.\nThe appellants support the patents upon the ground of combination\u2014the combination of the cellophane wrapper, the ribbon and the tab. Considering the patents as if they were limited in their claims to the use of cellophane as the wrapping material, which is the basis upon which the action has been fought out (although the claims are broad enough to cover a wrapper of any readily tearable material), the combination has artistic advantage and undoubtedly is attractive to purchasers of chewing gum and cigarettes. Packages wrapped according to the Lindsey patent were not put on the market in Canada by the Wrigley Company until July, 1934, and by the time of the trial of this action in March, 1936, the company had wrapped in Canada over eighty millions of packages in this manner, and the Imperial Tobacco Company had up to the date of the trial used two hundred and sixteen millions of wrappers of the type shown in the Van Sickels patent. Though no evidence was directed to show any increase in the sales of these well-known products attributable to the use of the new wrapper, it may be assumed that there was some commercial advantage in the adoption of the idea.\nThe result sought to be attained through the combination is the convenient removal of the cellophane wrapper. If, however, the use of the ribbon is eliminated, the learned trial judge has assumed, and the evidence rather points to the conclusion, that the use of the tab alone would enable one to rupture the wrapper. Then the problem to which the alleged invention is addressed, viz., to make use of cellophane as a wrapper in such a manner as to avoid the difficulty of rupturing it with the fingers, with consequent irritation and annoyance to the customer, ceases to be a problem. The rupture having been effected, the wrapper can easily be removed with the fingers. In answer to this, it is said that the presence of the ribbon enables one to tear the wrapper in a straight line. This unquestionably is a neater method of unwrapping a package but if it be the sole advantage to be derived from the combination of the ribbon with the tab, as distinguished from the use of the tab alone which is not claimed as invention in the patents sued upon and was admittedly old, it is difficult (since, as we shall proceed to point out, the general idea of the alleged invention was not new) to regard the combination of the ribbon and the tab as producing an improved result of sufficient substance to establish invention.\nHowever that may be, the general idea of the appellants, it is admitted, does not differ from that exemplified by the old, well-known method of tearing open a package of cigarettes wrapped in paper by the use of a string attached to the inside of the paper wrapper with a loose end projecting from it. Then, as to the means employed, it would appear to be reasonably clear that a person who was competently skilled in the art of devising wrappers for packages to be placed on the market for sale, and who was confronted with the problem that the witness Thomas says presented itself to the patentees, could hardly fail, on reverting to the devices and methods employed in the prior art and to the publications disclosed in the exhibits, to hit upon the use of the ribbon and the tab as providing an easy solution for that problem. Reference need only be made to the Boyd patent (British no. 8873\u20141901). That was an improvement in wrappers. Boyd used \u201ca tape or ribbon of any suitable material, one end of which may or may not extend slightly beyond the end of the sheet\u201d of paper or of other material suitable for wrapping. The tape or ribbon was by means of an adhesive sealed to the wrapper.\nBefore covers or wrappers are put round articles to be protected a slit or notch should be made on them on each side of the end of the tape or ribbon unless such tape or ribbon extends slightly beyond one end of the covers or wrappers * * * This enables any one to take hold of the tape or ribbon and by pulling it to open covers or wrappers instantly without the slightest difficulty and without injury to goods covered.\nBut it is contended by counsel for the appellants that the evidence establishes that the idea of the combination claimed was only hit upon after investigation and experiment extending over a year. Neither of the inventors was called as a witness and Thomas, the sole witness who was called in support of this allegation of fact, had, apparently, as the learned trial judge thought, no personal knowledge of any such investigations or experiments. We agree with the learned trial judge in his conclusion that the evidence adduced by the appellants upon this point is not satisfactory.\nIf the patents sued upon are not the identical thing disclosed in the Boyd patent, the difference is so trifling as to be of no substance in a patent sense.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Code, s. 1036\u2014Proceeding instituted at the instance of a Department of the Government of Canada in which that Government \u201cbears the cost of prosecution\u201d (exception (b) in s. 1036(1), Cr. Code).\nThe question was whether certain fines in question should be paid to the Treasurer of the Province of Nova Scotia or to the Minister of Finance for Canada.\nAn information was laid at Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the instance of the Department of National Revenue of the Government of Canada, against certain persons as having conspired to commit specified indictable offences against the Excise Act and the Customs Act, and contrary to s. 573 of the Criminal Code.\nThe accused were, on a preliminary inquiry at Halifax, committed for trial, were subsequently admitted to bail, later they surrendered to the gaol keeper, they were granted writs of habeas corpus and recipias corpus to bring them before the stipendiary magistrate in and for the City of Halifax, before whom they were brought and charged, they consented to be tried by him under Part XVI of the Criminal Code, pleaded guilty, were convicted and adjudged to be imprisoned and to pay the fines now in question, aggregating $16,000, which were paid to the treasurer of the City of Halifax.\nCounsel for the informant, on instructions of the Department of National Revenue, appeared at the preliminary inquiry, on the applications for bail and for writs of habeas corpus, etc., and at the trial. The prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax, or his assistant, appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia on the same proceedings except the preliminary inquiry.\nThe Province or the Municipality of the County of Halifax made no disbursements. The Department of National Revenue paid direct to the parties concerned the fees of informant\u2019s counsel, costs of stenographer\u2019s notes, and other costs, and fees of witnesses for the prosecution and fees and allowances of the justice of the peace on the preliminary inquiry. Witnesses\u2019 fees or the justice\u2019s fees and allowances were never certified to be correct nor produced or presented to the treasurer of the municipality in manner prescribed under The Costs and Fees Act, R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 252 (which provides for payment thereof) and no claim for fees by witnesses or the justice was made to the treasurer of the municipality. The Dominion Government did not pay for the services of the said prosecuting officer (or his assistant) or of the stipendiary magistrate (who each receive remuneration annually from the Government of Nova Scotia or the municipality).\nHeld: The fines in question were imposed in a proceeding instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada or of a department thereof, in which that Government bore the cost of prosecution, within the meaning of exception (b) in s. 1036 (1) of the Criminal Code, and were payable to the Minister of Finance for Canada.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, 11 M.P.R. 335, affirmed on above ground.\nPer Duff C.J., Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: The words \u201cin which that Government bears the cost of prosecution\u201d in said exception (b) in s. 1036 (1) do not relate to what may take place in a particular prosecution; they connote something broader than the mere casual occurrence of the payment of the costs in an individual case; they imply a consistent course of action sanctioned by law or by custom. The existence of The Costs and Fees Act of Nova Scotia cannot affect the construction nor preclude the true effect of s. 1036 of the Criminal Code, which is essentially federal legislation. As to custom or practice, the Government of Canada had full right to institute the proceedings and to conduct the prosecution in question; and the costs thereof were such as would usually and properly be borne by the Dominion of Canada; and, moreover, they in fact were so borne.\nThe provinces establish and maintain the ordinary criminal courts and, for this reason in itself, the \u201ccost of prosecution\u201d referred to in said exception (b) must be of a character apart from the ordinary costs of maintenance of those courts.\nThe said words \u201ccost of prosecution\u201d which the \u201cGovernment bears\u201d are necessarily referable to cost specially incurred in connection with the proceeding it has instituted. The fact that the trial was presided over by a stipendiary magistrate who is not paid by the Government of Canada, or the participation by the prosecuting officer, or his assistant, who are not paid by that Government, does not affect the situation. When acting in the premises, said magistrate and prosecuting officer (who receive their remuneration annually as aforesaid) are doing so merely as part of their regular duties; they were not paid specifically in connection with the prosecution in question.\nPer Davis J.: Without attempting to define the full scope and extent of the statutory condition that the Government of Canada \u201cbears the cost of prosecution,\u201d it is plain that in this case that Government did bear such cost within the meaning of that condition; and this is sufficient for the purpose of deciding the present question.\nQuaere, as to the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the appeal (on noting the language of the relevant provisions\u2014ss. 1 and 6 of c. 226, R.S.N.S. 1923, under which the Reference was made to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and s. 43 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35) APPEAL by the Attorney-General of the Province of Nova Scotia from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], holding that the amount of certain fines which the Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia claimed should be paid over to him by the City of Halifax or the Treasurer of the City of Halifax under s. 1036 of the Criminal Code, and which claim was referred to that Court by order in council under and by virtue of R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 226 (Of the Decision of Constitutional and Other Provincial Questions), was not payable over to the Provincial Treasurer under s. 1036 of the Criminal Code in the circumstances set forth in the statement of facts contained in the order in council, but that the same was payable to the Minister of Finance of Canada.\nThe material facts are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.\nJ. H. MacQuarrie K.C. for the appellant.\nH. P. MacKeen K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J., Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014By order in council dated the 12th day of June, 1936, the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, by and with the advice of the Executive Council of Nova Scotia, and acting under chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia 1923 (Entitled: \u201cOf the Decision of Constitutional and other Provincial Questions\u201d), referred this matter to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for hearing and consideration.\nThe Provincial Treasurer claims that the amount of certain fines hereinafter mentioned should be paid over to him by the City of Halifax, or the Treasurer of that city, under section 103G of the Criminal Code; and the question to be decided in this appeal is whether the fines in question belong to the Province, represented by the Provincial Treasurer, or to the Dominion of Canada, represented by the Minister of Finance, under the following circumstances set forth in the order in council: On the 10th day of June, 1935, an information was laid in the city of Halifax, before a justice of the peace in and for the county of Halifax, by Frank E. McGowran, a corporal of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, on the instructions of the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the instance of the Department of National Revenue of the Government of Canada.\nThe information and complaint were to the effect that certain persons therein named and domiciled respectively in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had, at Halifax and elsewhere, between the 1st day of January, 1927, and the 8th day of June, 1935, conspired together and with one another to commit the following offences:\n1. The indictable offence of having in their possession without lawful authority spirits unlawfully imported contrary to section 181 of the Excise Act 1927, and section 169 of the Excise Act, 1934, and section 573 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\n2. The indictable offences of harbouring, keeping, concealing, purchasing and selling without lawful excuse alcoholic liquor unlawfully imported into Canada of a value for duty exceeding two hundred dollars, to wit, of a value of upwards of one millions dollars, without paying the duties lawfully payable thereon contrary to section 217 (3) of the Customs Act, 1927, and section 573 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\n3. The indictable offence of smuggling and clandestinely introducing into Canada alcoholic liquor subject to Customs Duty of a value for duty of over two hundred dollars, to wit, of a value of upwards of one million dollars, contrary to section 203 (3) of the Customs Act as amended, and section 573 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\n4. The indictable offence of by deceit or falsehood or other fraudulent means defrauding His Majesty the King in the Right of the Dominion of Canada of Customs and Excise duties to the extent of upwards of one million dollars.\nThe several persons charged in this information appeared before the justice of the peace in the city of Halifax to answer the charge; and a preliminary inquiry was held, as a result of which they were committed to the common gaol at the city of Halifax for trial on the said charge.\nAt the preliminary inquiry, the prosecution was conducted by counsel for the informant on instructions of the Department of National Revenue.\nThe persons charged were subsequently admitted to bail by a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. On the application for bail counsel appeared on behalf of the informant, again on the instructions of the Department of National Revenue. On that occasion, the assistant to the prosecuting officer for the county of Halifax appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia.\nLater on, on the 27th day of September, 1935, the persons charged surrendered to the keeper of the common gaol and applied to a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for writs of habeas corpus and recipias corpus to bring them before the stipendiary magistrate in and for the city of Halifax. On the application for these writs both the prosecuting officer for the county of Halifax appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia and counsel appeared on behalf of the informant on instructions of the Department of National Revenue.\nThe writs were granted, and by virtue thereof the accused were brought before the stipendiary magistrate and charged with the offence set forth in the information (then amended as will be mentioned later). They consented to be tried before the stipendiary magistrate under Part XVI of the Criminal Code. The amendment to the information consisted in striking off paragraphs 2 and 3 the words: \u201cto wit, of a value of upwards of one million dollars\u201d; thus leaving the \u201cvalue for duty\u201d of the alcoholic liquor unlawfully imported, or introduced, into Canada as exceeding two hundred dollars, without stating any definite amount. The information was further amended by striking out paragraph 4 thereof.\nThe accused pleaded guilty and they were convicted and adjudged to be imprisoned for terms varying in length, and also to forfeit and pay certain fines to be \u201capplied according to law,\u201d the aggregate of which amounted to $16,000.\nAt the trial, the prosecuting officer appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, and counsel appeared on behalf of the informant on the instructions of the Department of National Revenue.\nThe fines imposed by the stipendiary magistrate were paid to the Treasurer of the City of Halifax, who has since held the same; and, in effect, the question submitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was: To whom, of the Provincial Treasurer or of the Minister of Finance of Canada, the amount of the fines should now be paid over by the Treasurer of the City of Halifax?\nThe judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia were unanimous in the opinion that the amount of the fines were not payable over to the Provincial Treasurer under section 1036 of the Criminal Code, in the circumstances set forth in the statement of facts contained in the order in council; but that the same were payable to the Minister of Finance. Their reasons, however, for reaching that conclusion differed in the following respects: The Chief Justice (Mr. Justice Carroll and Mr. Justice Doull concurring) was of opinion that the fines should go to the Dominion Government, both because they have been \u201cimposed in respect of the breach of the revenue laws of Canada\u201d and also because they were imposed \u201cin a proceeding instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada, or of a department thereof, in which that Government bore the cost of prosecution.\u201d Mr. Justice Ross (with whom Mr. Justice Hall concurred), while sharing the opinion on the second point and, therefore, on the result, stated that he was \u201cnot prepared at the moment to agree that the fines were imposed in respect of a breach of the revenue laws of Canada.\u201d\nThe matter is now referred to us under section 43 of the Supreme Court Act, in view of the fact that, by section 6 of chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923, the opinion of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upon the reference, although advisory only, is, for all purposes of appeal to this Court, to \u201c be treated as a final judgment of the court between parties.\u201d\nThe answer to the question put by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of Nova Scotia must result from the interpretation of the first paragraph of section 1036 of the Criminal Code.\nThat paragraph is as follows:\n1036. Whenever no other provision is made by any law of Canada for the application of any fine, penalty or forfeiture imposed for the violation of any law or of the proceeds of an estreated recognizance, the same shall be paid over by the magistrate or officer receiving the same to the treasurer of the province in which the same is imposed or recovered, except that\n(a) all fines, penalties and forfeitures imposed in respect of the breach of any of the revenue laws of Canada, or imposed upon any officer or employee of the Government of Canada in respect of any breach of duty or malfeasance in his office or employment, and the proceeds of all recognizances estreated in connection with proceedings for the prosecution of persons charged with such breaches or malfeasances; and\n(b) all fines, penalties and forfeitures imposed for whatever cause in any proceeding instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada or of any department thereof in which that Government beans the cost of prosecution, and the proceeds of all recognizances estreated in connection with such proceedings, shall belong to His Majesty for the public uses of Canada, and shall be paid by the magistrate or officer receiving the same to the Minister of Finance and form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada.\n(N.B.\u2014We omit the last part of the paragraph which concerns exclusively the province of Ontario.)\nBy force of the enactment, as will be observed, the general rule is that fines are payable over to the Treasurer of the province. They belong to His Majesty for the public use of Canada, they are to be paid to the Minister of Finance and to form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada only in some particular cases which are exceptions to the rule.\nThe Dominion government claims that the fines here in question come within either of two of the exceptions prescribed in the enactment. It is contended by the Attorney-General of Canada that they were \u201c imposed in respect of the breach of any of the revenue laws of Canada,\u201d and that they were \u201cimposed * * * in a proceeding instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada or of a department thereof in which that Government bore the cost of prosecution.\u201d The Dominion, to succeed, must establish that the fines came within one of the exceptions mentioned; but, on the other hand, the Province cannot succeed unless it is able to eliminate both exceptions.\nFor that reason, we find it sufficient to examine the question submitted in its relation to the second exception relied on by the Attorney-General of Canada. Our reason for doing so is obvious: it was the ground upon which all the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia agreed in their answers upon the reference; and, moreover, if we should reach the same conclusion as they have, it becomes unnecessary to deal with the respective claims of the parties in their relation with the first exception.\nIt is conceded that the proceeding as a result of which the fines were imposed was instituted at the instance of a department of the Government of Canada. It remains only to be seen whether it was a proceeding in which \u201cthat Government bears the cost of prosecution,\u201d within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 1036. The order in council states in terms that \u201cno disbursements in connection with the said prosecution have been made by the Province of Nova Scotia or by the municipality of the county of Halifax.\u201d It is also therein stated that the fees of counsel who appeared on behalf of the informant on instructions of the Department of National Revenue, the amount of the account of the stenographer for taking shorthand notes of the evidence on the preliminary inquiry and for transcribing the same, and any other costs, fees, charges or expenses there may have been in connection with the said prosecution, were paid direct to the parties concerned also by the same Department of National Revenue. This Department likewise paid direct to them the sums of money required to the witnesses for the prosecution on the preliminary inquiry, or to the justice of the peace for fees and allowances claimed by him for his services in respect of the preliminary inquiry. No claim or demand by or on behalf of the witnesses or of the justice of the peace was ever made to the Treasurer of the municipality of the County of Halifax.\nBut, on behalf of the Province, the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia points out that, of course, the services of the prosecuting officer and those of the stipendiary magistrate were not paid by the Dominion Government. It is further asserted that, although the fees and allowances claimed by the justice of the peace and the witnesses\u2019 fees were paid by the Dominion, that was on the latter\u2019s part a purely voluntary and gratuitous payment, because these fees, charges and expenses are already provided for in a provincial statute, The Costs and Fees Act (ch. 252 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923); and that such fees and charges were never certified to be correct, nor produced and presented to the Treasurer of the municipality of the county of Halifax in the manner prescribed in the schedule to Part II of that provincial statute; whereas, if the prescriptions of that statute had been followed by the justice of the peace and the witnesses, their fees and charges would have been met and paid as provided for therein.\nThe respective rights of the parties, however, must be determined in accordance with the true construction of the section of the Criminal Code which applies; they cannot be made to depend upon what may have happened in this particular instance. It may not be left to the option of one party to act in a certain way and later to claim the fines on the strength of the procedure it has elected to follow. The answer which the court must give must flow essentially from the language of the statute. And when the statute enacts that the fines are to belong to the Government of Canada in a proceeding \u201cin which that Government bears the cost of prosecution,\u201d that language does not relate to what may take place in a particular prosecution.\nThe phrase in the enactment: \u201cin which that Government bears the cost of prosecution\u201d connotes something broader than the mere casual occurrence of the payment of the costs in an individual case; it implies a consistent course of action sanctioned by law or by custom.\nMoreover, the words \u201ccost of prosecution\u201d which, so it is enacted, the \u201cGovernment bears\u201d are necessarily referable to cost specially incurred in connection with the proceeding it has instituted and resulting in the imposition of the fines which, under the exception, become payable to the Minister of Finance.\nFor that reason, the fact that the trial was presided over by a stipendiary magistrate, who is not paid by the Government of Canada; or the participation of the prosecuting officer and his assistant, who are not paid by that Government, does not affect the situation. The magistrate and the prosecuting officer are receiving their remuneration annually either from the municipality or from the Government of Nova Scotia; and, when acting in the premises, they are doing so merely as part of their regular duties; they were not paid specifically in connection with the prosecution with which we are concerned, or with the proceeding herein instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada.\nIt cannot be questioned, as stated moreover in the order in council, that all the \u201ccosts, fees, charges or expenses there may have been in connection with the said prosecution\u201d have been incurred and paid by the Government of Canada, and the question is whether they were costs which the Government of Canada bore within the meaning of section 1036. Whether the stipendiary magistrate could or could not have ordered the costs to be paid otherwise, it is sufficient to note that, in the convictions adjudging the payment of the fines, no order was made as to costs.\nWe have said that subs. (b) implied a consistent course of action sanctioned by law or custom. As to the law, there are no provisions in the Criminal Code expressly dealing with the matter in issue. Of The Costs and Fees Act of Nova Scotia, it is sufficient to say that, in our view, its existence cannot affect the construction, nor preclude the true effect, of section 1036 of the Criminal Code, which is essentially federal legislation. As to custom or practice, it cannot be doubted that the Government of Canada had full right to institute the proceedings and to conduct the prosecution before the court.\nThe provinces establish and maintain the ordinary criminal courts and, for this reason alone, we think that the costs of prosecution referred to in section 1036 of the Criminal Code must be of a character apart from the ordinary costs of maintenance of these courts.\nAs stated by Chief Justice Chisholm in his reasons for judgment in the present case:\nIt has always been the practice to permit counsel for the Government of Canada to act in revenue eases, nominally under the Attorney-General of the Province. The Attorney-General has the nominal, the counsel for the Government of Canada has the virtual conduct of such prosecutions. In no other way can the revenues of Canada be adequately or at all protected unless the Dominion is represented and given the conduet of the case.\nWe have no doubt that this statement of the learned Chief Justice, concurred in by the other judges of the court, rightly represents the situation.\nIn our view, the costs of prosecution in this case are such as would usually and properly be borne by the Dominion of Canada and, moreover, they here in fact were borne by the Dominion of Canada. For these reasons, we think that the amount of the fines in question is not payable to the Provincial Treasurer but is payable to the Minister of Finance of Canada.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed. There will be no order as to costs. Davis J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed, but it is sufficient, in my opinion, to rest that conclusion upon the sole ground that the particular facts stated in the Reference satisfy the condition of section 1036 (b) of the Criminal Code that the Government of Canada \u201cbears the cost of prosecution,\u201d it being admitted that the proceedings were instituted at the instance of a department of that Government.\nThe facts are not in dispute. It is stated in the Reference that the information was laid by a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the instructions of the Commissioner at the instance of the Department of National Revenue of the Government of Canada; that the preliminary inquiry before a Justice of the Peace in the City of Halifax extended to eleven days during the months of July and August, 1935; that at the said preliminary inquiry the prosecution was conducted by two counsel for the informant, on instructions of the said Department of National Revenue; that on the application before a Judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia of the several accused for bail, counsel appeared on behalf of the informant, on the instructions of the said department, and that an assistant to the prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax (receiving an annual salary from the Government of Nova Scotia) appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia; that subsequently on the return of writs of habeas corpus, counsel appeared on behalf of the informant, on instructions of the said department, and the prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia; that at the trial counsel appeared on behalf of the informant, on instructions of the said department, and the said prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia; that no disbursements in connection with the said prosecution have been made by the Province of Nova Scotia or by the Municipality of the County of Halifax, but the said prosecuting officer was receiving an annual salary from the Provincial Government; that the fees of counsel for the informant in connection with the said prosecution and the amounts of the account of a stenographer for taking shorthand notes of the evidence on the said preliminary inquiry and transcribing the same, and any other costs, fees, charges or expenses there may have been in connection with the said prosecution (other than those prescribed in the Schedule to Part II of The Costs and Fees Act, ch. 252 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923) were paid direct to the parties concerned by the said Department of National Revenue; that the said department paid sums of money direct to the witnesses for the prosecution on the said preliminary inquiry, as fees claimed by them and prescribed in the said Schedule to said Part II of The Costs and Fees Act for their travel and actual attendance; that the said Department of National Revenue paid sums of money direct to the said Justice of the Peace as the fees and allowances claimed by him and prescribed in the said Schedule to said Part II of The Costs and Fees Act, for his services in respect of the said preliminary inquiry.\nWithout attempting to define the full scope and extent of the statutory condition that the Government of Canada \u201cbears the cost of prosecution,\u201d it is plain, I think, in this case that the Government of Canada bore the cost of the prosecution within the contemplation of the statutory condition. It would, in my opinion, entirely defeat the object of the provision of sec. 1036 (b) if the facts of this case were held not to come within the language of the provision. That being so, there is no necessity to consider whether or not the Dominion could recover by virtue of the provision of sec. 1036 (a).\nAs the appeal is to be dismissed, it is not necessary to discuss the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the appeal, but it may be observed that sec. 43 of the Supreme Court Act gives a right of appeal to this Court\nfrom an opinion pronounced by the highest court of final resort in any province on any matter referred to it for hearing and consideration by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of such province whenever it has been by the statutes of the said province declared that such opinion is to be deemed a judgment of the said highest court of final resort and that an appeal shall lie therefrom as from a judgment in an action.\nThe provincial statute under which this Reference was made by the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in Council to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia is chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923. The relevant sections, 1 and 6, are as follows: 1. The Governor in Council may refer to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, for hearing or consideration, any matter which he thinks fit to refer, and the court shall thereupon hear and consider the same.\n6. The opinion of the court upon any such reference, although advisory only, shall, for all purposes of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, or to His Majesty in Council, be treated as a final judgment of the court between parties.\nHad we reached a different conclusion on the merits of this appeal, the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the appeal would have presented some difficulty.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F. F. Mathers.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. P. MacKeen.\n[1] 11 M.P.R. 335; [1937] 1 D.L.R. 534.\n"}

The powers of the provincial society included (inter alia) powers \u201cto pass by-laws to regulate the powers and duties of the officers of the association, the amount and manner of the payment of contributions * * * the manner of choosing officers * * * and * * * of admission of new members, and generally such other by-laws as may be necessary for the purpose of effectually carrying out the objects of the association\u201d and \u201cto amalgamate or affiliate with any other society existing at the date hereof or which may be incorporated or formed in the future, and whose aims and purposes are similar\u201d to those of said provincial society.\nHeld: (1) Ch. 12 (s. 1) of the Statutes of Manitoba, 1937 (An Act respecting the Capacity of Companies) applied to the provincial society. Though that statute was repealed by the Consolidated Amendments, 1924, it was then re-enacted, by s. 24 of c. 35 thereof, in exact terms. Said s. 24 of c. 35, though included in a chapter entitled An Act to amend \u201cThe Companies Act,\u201d cannot be said to have been repealed by the Companies Act, 1932. In any, event, most of the things of which plaintiff complained were done prior to the coming into force of the Companies Act, 1932, and the proceedings leading up to amalgamation of the provincial society with the Dominion society were under way, and defendants invoked s. 31 of the Manitoba Interpretation Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 105.\n(2) Under its charter and the above provisions of the statutes of Manitoba, the provincial society had power to pass the by-laws attacked by plaintiff, and also to establish branches outside the province and to amalgamate with or transfer its assets to another body having similar powers. The only provision in the Dominion incorporating Act claimed to be dissimilar from the powers held by the provincial society\u2014a certain restriction in qualification for future membership\u2014was not a sufficient departure from the purposes of the provincial society as to prevent it from amalgamating with or transferring its assets to the Dominion society.\n(3) As it was not suggested that plaintiff\u2019s case rested upon fraud or oppression attempted against the minority of the society\u2019s members, plaintiff\u2019s right to sue as a member of the provincial society in respect of its acts was limited to the purpose of preventing it from commencing or continuing the doing of something which was beyond its powers.\n(4) In view of the above and for reasons aforesaid the plaintiff had no status to bring the action.\n(5) Further, in view of the fact that all of the assets of the provincial society were actually transferred to the Dominion society, which had been in full operation for over three years with the approval of governmental authorities, both federal and provincial, the judgment appealed from dismissing the action should not be interfered with under the circumstances.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 44 Man. L.R. 280, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action, affirmed in the result.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] dismissing his action. He brought the action as a member of the defendant provincial society, incorporated in 1915, under the Manitoba Charitable Associations Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 27, and (as so alleged) on behalf of himself and all members of the defendant provincial society other than the individual defendants; in which action he claimed declarations that certain by-laws of the society passed (as alleged) in contemplation of extending its objects and powers throughout Canada and obtaining a Dominion charter, were invalid, as were also the establishment of lodges or branches outside of Manitoba, the method of electing trustees or directors, the use of moneys of the society to obtain a Dominion charter, and the application of its funds to the objects and purposes of the defendant Dominion society (incorporated by Dominion Act, 1930, c. 71, revived or continued by amending Act, 1933, c. 64), and he asked for injunctions, accountings and restitution.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claims and the facts and issues appear more extensively in the reasons for judgment now reported and are discussed at some length in the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[2]. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nH. A. Bergman K.C. and Wasyl Swystun for the appellant.\nF. Heap K.C. and J. W. Arsenych K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014The plaintiff brings his action as a member of St. Nicholas Mutual Benefit Association of Winnipeg, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cProvincial Society,\u201d and in this action he has joined a number of individuals as well as Ukrainian Mutual Benefit Association of Saint Nicholas of Canada, a body incorporated by Dominion statute for the purpose of taking over the assets and liabilities and carrying on the work of the Provincial Society. The plaintiff claims\u2014\n(a) a declaration that certain by-laws passed by the Provincial Society are invalid;\n(b) a declaration that the acts of the said society in establishing lodges or branches outside of Manitoba were ultra vires of the society; (c) a declaration that the method of electing trustees or directors of the society is and always has been illegal;\n(d) an accounting of moneys spent by the said society in securing a charter under the Dominion Companies Act;\n(e) an injunction against the expenditure of further moneys for such purposes;\n(\u0192) an accounting of moneys transferred by the Provincial Society to the Dominion Society;\n(g) an injunction restraining the Dominion Society from further use of the moneys transferred;\n(h) an injunction restraining the defendants from surrendering the charter of the Provincial Society, except in accordance with the statutes in that behalf.\nThe defendant, the Provincial Society, in its defence set up various defences, among others, objections to the plaintiff\u2019s status to bring the action, alleging in particular that he was a party to such acts and, further, that by reason of laches and delay the situation has been so changed that it would be inequitable and unjust to grant the relief claimed. Subsequently, an order was made by the Referee in Chambers\nthat all personal objections against the plaintiff to commence, maintain and prosecute this action and of the issues more particularly set out in paragraphs 18, 19 and 21 of the defence of the defendants be tried before the other issues herein.\nThe issues so set forth were tried before Mr. Justice Taylor of the Court of King\u2019s Bench and, as usually happens in cases of a partial trial, nearly all of the facts relating to the cause of action were explored. Mr. Justice Taylor held that the plaintiff was entitled to bring the action but expressly disclaimed any disposition of the question of ultra vires, holding that this was a matter which could only be properly settled when the action was tried out on its merits.\nFrom this decision the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal and that court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of Mr. Justice Taylor and dismissed the action[3]. From this decision the plaintiff now appeals to this Court.\nThe St. Nicholas Mutual Benefit Association of Winnipeg was incorporated in 1915 under the Charitable Associations Act of Manitoba. It was given powers, two of which require special mention. The first was a power\u2014\nTo pass by-laws to regulate the powers and duties of the officers of the association, the amount and manner of the payment of contributions, dues and assessments to be paid by the members of the association, the payment of sick, funeral or other benefits by the association to its members, the manner of choosing officers to succeed the present officers and trustees and the manner of admission of new members, and generally such other by-laws as may be necessary for the purpose of effectually carrying out the objects of the association.\nand secondly\u2014\nTo amalgamate or affiliate with any other society existing at the date hereof or which may be incorporated or formed in the future, and whose aims and purposes are similar to the above.\nThe charter did not otherwise limit the powers of the association to make by-laws in regard to membership or otherwise.\nThe Statutes of Manitoba, 1917, chap. 12, sec. 1, applied to this corporation and provided that:\nunless otherwise expressly declared in the Act or instrument creating it, have and be deemed to have had from its creation the capacity of a natural person to exercise its powers beyond the boundaries of the Province to the extent to which the laws in force where such powers are sought to be exercised permit, and to accept extra provincial powers and rights and shall, unless otherwise expressly declared in the Act or instrument creating it, have and be deemed to have had from its creation the general capacity which the common law ordinarily attaches to corporations incorporated by Royal Charter under the Great Seal.\nIn Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. Ltd. v. The King[4], Lord Haldane, in referring to a corporation created by charter, states:\nIn the case of a company created by charter the doctrine of ultra vires has no real application in the absence of statutory restriction added to what is written in the charter. Such a company has the capacity of a natural person to acquire powers and rights. If by the terms of the charter it is prohibited from doing so, a violation of this prohibition is an act not beyond its capacity, and is therefore not ultra vires, although such a violation may well give ground for proceedings by way of scire facias for the forfeiture of the charter.\nThe 1917 Statute of Manitoba was repealed by the Consolidated Amendments of 1924, but then re-enacted in exact terms: chapter 35, section 24. It is said that this provision was repealed by the Manitoba Companies Act, 1932. We are not of this opinion. Although section 24 of chapter 35, Consolidated Amendments, is included in a chapter entitled An Act to Amend \u201cThe Companies Act,\u201d it is not stated anywhere specifically to be part of the Companies Act; nor does it appear to have been repealed by implication. In any event, most of the things complained of in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim were done prior to the coming into force of the Companies Act, 1932, and the proceedings leading up to amalgamation of the Provincial Society with the Dominion Society were under way and the defendants invoked the aid of section 31 of the Manitoba Interpretation Act, chapter 105, R.S.M. 1913, as follows:\nAll things lawfully done and all rights acquired and liabilities incurred under any repealed Act shall remain valid and may be enforced, and all proceedings and things lawfully commenced under any repealed Act may be continued and completed under the repealing Act.\nWe are of opinion that under its charter and the above provisions of the Statutes of Manitoba the Provincial Society had power to pass the by-laws attacked by the plaintiff in his action, and also to establish branches outside the province of Manitoba and to amalgamate with, or transfer its assets to, another body having similar powers. It is not contended that the Dominion Act, Chapter 71, Statutes of Canada, 1930, gave the Dominion Society any powers dissimilar from those held by the Provincial Society, except in one particular, viz., that by section 5 of the\nDominion Act\nOnly persons considered by the Society to be of Ukrainian origin and who are of the Greek-Catholic faith, in communion with the Holy See of Rome, shall be admitted as members of the Society. Provided that the Society shall, upon the conclusion of any agreement such as provided for in section 17 hereof, admit as members all persons who are then members in good standing of the Provincial Society as at that time constituted.\nIn our opinion this restriction on future membership is not a sufficient departure from the purposes of the Provincial Society as to prevent the Provincial Society from amalgamating with, or transferring its assets to, the Dominion Society.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s right to sue as a member of the society in respect of its acts is limited to cases\u2014\n(a) to prevent the corporation from either commencing or continuing the doing of something which is beyond its powers;\n(b) to prevent the corporation carrying out something which purports to be a corporate act but which is in fact an attempt by the majority of its members to practise fraud or oppression against the minority. It was not suggested that the appellant\u2019s case rested upon fraud or oppression.\nWe are of opinion that the plaintiff has no status to bring this action. Having come to this conclusion, we do not think it necessary to consider the objections to the plaintiff\u2019s status on the ground of his acquiescence, which objections were dealt with in the court below.\nIn view of the fact that all of the assets of the Provincial Society were actually transferred to the Dominion Society, which society has been in full operation for a period of over three years with the approval of governmental authorities, both federal and provincial, we ought not now to interfere with the judgment appealed from under the circumstances. The appeal is dismissed with costs. There will be no costs of the motion to quash.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamont, Layton & Swystun.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Heap, Arsenych & Murchison.\n[1] 44 Man.

There was a dissent in the Court of Appeal on the ground of lack of corroborative evidence and misdirection with regard thereto.\nThe evidence against appellant was almost wholly that of one F., named as a co-conspirator of appellant but who had previously been tried and convicted. F.'s story set out conversations and dealings with appellant as to the sale of morphine and in particular an occasion when he had met him at a certain house and went with him out of a room there where others were gathered, and had a private conversation with him as to delivery of morphine. A police agent gave evidence that he was present on said occasion, that the place was one where dealings in morphine were being carried on by some of those involved in the conspiracy, and that he had seen F. and appellant leave the room together. Appellant in evidence admitted being present at the place at the time, but denied that he had any private conversation with F.\nIn the course of charging the jury the trial judge stated that, while it is open to a jury to convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it is dangerous to do so; that \"corroboration is such evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of the crime as related by the accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner; by that I do not mean that it will not be corroboration unless every circumstance is confirmed; it will be corroboration if there is confirmation as to a material circumstance of the crime and of the identity of the prisoner; evidence to amount to corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime, it may amount to corroboration if it is confirmation of a material circumstance and it connects the accused with the crime.\" Referring to the police agent's evidence, he said it \"amounts to only this: it is a confirmation, if you accept it, of F.'s evidence as to the conspiracy on the part of the others outside of [accused]; he does appear to corroborate him on substantial points\"; and that \"all that amounts to is this: it is proof of a fact, if you accept what F. tells you, that it did occur; if you accept that, then you have [the police agent's] corroboration of nothing more or less than that the conference which F. says occurred, did occur; that is all it corroborates, and the inference there is for you, ***.\" He further stated: \"If you think that corroboration is necessary then it is for you to say whether you have corroboration which falls within the definition I have given you.\"\nHeld (Kerwin J. dissenting): On consideration of the summing up as a whole and in view of all the circumstances, there was no material misdirection or non-direction on the point of corroboration. The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting): As the police agent's testimony indicated merely an opportunity on accused's part to discuss with F. the delivery of morphine, the trial judge was wrong in telling the jury that the police agent's evidence, if believed, was corroboration. There were no circumstances surrounding the particular episode that would tend to implicate accused in the commission of the crime charged (the house in question being a boot-legging establishment where those desiring beer, etc., might be served). Opportunity by itself is not sufficient (Burbury v. Jackson, [1917] 1 K.B. 16).\nKerwin J. criticized as improper the fact that, while F. had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy under the same Act, he had not been sentenced at the time he gave evidence at appellant's trial.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia affirming (Martin J.A. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant (on trial before Manson J. with a jury) for conspiracy with others to commit the indictable offence of distributing a drug (morphine) contrary to s. 4 (f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 (Dom.) and amendments thereto. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was dismissed, Kerwin J. dissenting. L. Clare Moyer K.C. for the appellant.\nGordon S. Wismer K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by\nHUDSON J.\u2014The appellant Canning was convicted at the trial before Mr. Justice Manson of the Court of King's Bench of British Columbia and a jury, of unlawfully conspiring to distribute morphine contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. From this decision he appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and in that court the appeal was dismissed by a majority of 2 to 1. In the formal judgment the reasons for dissent by Mr. Justice Martin are stated to be that\nthere is no evidence to corroborate the witnesses for the prosecution; and that there was misdirection and non-direction amounting to misdirection respecting said corroboration and also respecting the consequences of the erroneous direction that there was such evidence.\nNo written reasons for dissent appear to have been delivered.\nUnder section 1023 of the Criminal Code our jurisdiction in this case is confined to any question of law in which there has been dissent in the court of appeal. Neither in the language of the formal judgment nor in the notice of appeal is there a clear statement of the point or points of law upon which dissent rests, and it is questionable whether or not there is sufficient to give jurisdiction. However, we have not thought it necessary in the present instance to decide this question.\nThe evidence against Canning was almost wholly that of a man named Furumoto who was named in the indictment as a co-conspirator of Canning but who had previously been tried separately and convicted. Furumoto gave a detailed story setting out various conversations and dealings with Canning in regard to the sale of morphine and, in particular, that on one occasion in the course of the negotiations he had met him at the house of one Ferraro and while there went out of the room where others were gathered and had a private conversation with Canning in regard to the delivery of a quantity of morphine. A man named Morley Fisher, an agent of the Mounted Police, was called as a witness on behalf of the Crown and stated that he was present on the occasion above mentioned, that the place was one where dealings in morphine were being carried on by some of the parties involved in the conspiracy and that he had seen Furumoto there in conversation with Canning and that they had gone out together. Canning was called as a witness on his own behalf and admitted being present at this place on the evening in question but denied that he had any private conversation with Furumoto.\nThe learned trial judge in his charge to the jury correctly stated the law in regard to the danger of accepting the evidence of an accomplice without corroboration and expressly gave to the jury the necessary warning as stated in the judgment of this Court in the case of Vigeant v. The King[1] . It was contended before us that in this instance the trial judge should not only have stated the law and given the warning as to the danger of accepting the evidence of an accomplice, but also should specifically have charged that the evidence of Fisher put forward on behalf of the Crown did not amount to corroboration.\nThe learned trial judge in his charge stated :\nCorroboration is such evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of the crime as related by the accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner. By that, I do not mean that it will not be corroboration unless every circumstance is confirmed. It will be corroboration if there is confirmation as to a material circumstance of the crime and of the identity of the prisoner. Evidence to amount to corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime\u2014it is important to bear that in mind here. Let me repeat it. Evidence to amount to corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime, it may amount to corroboration if it is confirmation of a material circumstance and it connects the accused with the crime. I repeat: while it is open to a jury to convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it is dangerous to do so.\nHe further stated:\nNow you will remember what I said about corroboration. Corroboration is always important, whether the question of an accomplice arises or not, particularly when you have a flat contradiction, as you have here. Fisher says he was there on the famous Saturday night. It is urged upon you, and it is something for you to consider, that as Fisher said he did want to get Canning\u2014there is no denying that he said he was the very man he wanted to get\u2014it is suggested to you in the defence that Fisher is not telling the truth. Now how far does Fisher go, taking his own statement: \"I knew about this man Canning and wanted to get him.\" What evidence have you that he wanted to get him? The only evidence he gives is the evidence that on this Saturday night he saw the accused call Furumoto away from the kitchen for a conference. He says they went to the foot of the stairs in the front room, and he said at one point that they went upstairs, but obviously he did not actually see them go upstairs. He perhaps, giving him credit for truthfulness, if you so desire, he probably was giving a conclusion there from what he saw them do, rather than an actual statement of fact, because he says in cross-examination he did not see them go upstairs, although he said so before, and he then said \"the living room and the foot of the stairs were out of my range of vision.\" Furumoto says definitely they did leave the kitchen at the accused's request and did go upstairs. Fisher's evidence amounts to only this: it is a confirmation, if you accept it, of Furumoto's evidence as to the conspiracy on the part of the others outside of Canning. He does appear to corroborate him on substantial points.\nAt the conclusion of the charge, counsel for the prisoner asked this question :\nDid I understand your lordship's instructions to be the jury might consider Morley Fisher's statement that he heard Canning ask Furumoto to go upstairs, to be corroborative evidence\u2014that they might consider it as such?\nThe Court:\nYes, I think so. The charge is that this conspiracy was between certain dates, and it is not confined to the sale of these two particular half pounds, if sale there was, by Furumoto to Canning. The charge is not confined to these two particular incidents. It says he did conspire between the 15th day of August, 1934, and the 1st day of March, 1936. Now then if it be that Furumoto and the accused conferred at a time and place within these dates\u2014Fisher does not say, of course, and you know this perfectly well, members of the jury, Fisher does not say he overheard the conversation. He does not know what the conversation was. It might have been as to the weather. All that amounts to is this: it is proof of a fact, if you accept what Furumoto tells you, that it did occur. If you accept that, then you have Fisher's corroboration of nothing more or less than that the conference which Furumoto says occurred, did occur. That is all it corroborates, and the inference there is for you, as I pointed out.\nThen, after some further discussion, the learned trial judge said :\nI think the best thing I can do for you is to read again what constitutes corroboration. It may be just as well that I should read that to you now so that you will have it fresh. Corroboration is such evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of the crime as related by the accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner. By that I do not mean that it will not be corroboration unless every circumstance is confirmed. It will be corroboration if there is confirmation as to a material circumstance of the crime and of the identity of the prisoner. Evidence to amount to corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime, it may amount to corroboration if it is confirmation of a material circumstance and it connects the accused with the crime. Then you will remember with what I concluded. I told you it is open to a jury to convict upon the evidence of an accomplice alone if they are so advised\u2014if that is their opinion\u2014but it is dangerous to do so without corroboration. If you think that corroboration is necessary then it is for you to say whether you have corroboration which falls within the definition I have given you.\nOn consideration of the summing up as a whole and in view of all the circumstances, we do not think that there was material misdirection or non-direction on the point of corroboration. The appeal should be dismissed.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant was convicted of unlawfully conspiring to distribute morphine contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. The only direct evidence against him was given by one Furumoto, who testified that on a certain occasion a conversation took place between him and the accused, and that at a subsequent date, in the house of one Ferraro, another conversation occurred between them. It is of this latter date that the witness Fisher, a Mounted Police agent, spoke, and he testified that he saw the two leave Ferraro's kitchen together. Furumoto's evidence was that they went upstairs and that it was there a conversation occurred in regard to the delivery of a quantity of morphine. Fisher, of course, could not, and did not, attempt to speak of what transpired between Furumoto and the accused.\nThe learned trial judge told the jury that Fisher's evidence, if believed, was corroboration within the meaning of the rule. With this I cannot agree, as Fisher's testimony indicated merely an opportunity on the part of the accused to discuss with Furumoto the delivery of morphine. There were no circumstances surrounding the particular episode that would tend to implicate the accused in the commission of the crime charged, as Ferraro conducted a boot-legging establishment, according to all the evidence, where those who desired to obtain beer and other refreshments might be served.\nOpportunity by itself is not sufficient. Burbury v. Jackson[2] . The main judgment in that case was delivered by Lord Reading, who had delivered the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Baskerville[3] . At page 18 of the Burbury case[4] , the Lord Chief Justice states:\nThe evidence here shows nothing more than that it was possible to have committed the misconduct at the material date. That is not enough. The evidence must show that the misconduct was probable. If the parties were seen in the neighbourhood of a wood or other dark place where they had no occasion to be, that might possibly be corroborative evidence. So in the case cited of Harvey v. Anning[5] the fact of persons of different social positions being seen together in lanes was held enough. Whether there was other evidence in which the jury could, if properly directed, find corroboration, is immaterial as the trial judge did not refer to it in his charge but on the contrary directed the jury that Fisher's evidence, if believed, was corroboration. Hubin v. The King (1).\nWhile not open on this appeal, there is a matter that should, I think, be referred to. That is, that while Furumoto had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy, under the same Act, he had not been sentenced at the time he gave evidence at the trial of the present applicant. This is a practice that should not be tolerated.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William J.

On an appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta from a District Court judgment dismissing an appeal from an order of a police magistrate under s. 26 of The Domestic Relations Act, 1927 (c. 5) (Alta.), finding that B.K., being able wholly or in part to maintain his wife, M.K., did wilfully neglect to do so and did desert her, and ordering him to pay her the sum of $4 a week, the Appellate Division (by a majority) held ([1936] 3 W.W.R. 699) that the province was without legislative authority to confer upon the magistrate the powers purported to be granted to him by said s. 26, and set aside the magistrate's order. Before the Appellate Division the Attorney-General for Alberta intervened to support the constitutionality of the Act.\nSpecial leave to the Attorney-General and to M.K. to appeal to this Court was granted by the Appellate Division; but M.K. failed to perfect her appeal.\nHeld: On an appeal to this Court by M.K., the Attorney-General would, in the ordinary course, have the right to appear in order to support the validity of the legislation; but he had no status to appeal to this Court; and, as M.K. had not perfected her appeal (a delay for opportunity to do so having been given by this Court but her application under s. 66 of the Supreme Court Act for leave now to perfect her appeal having been dismissed by the Appellate Division), this Court had not jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nMOTION by way of appeal from the order of the Registrar affirming the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the appeal.\nThe appeal was from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1].\nBy an order of a police magistrate under s. 26 of The Domestic Relations Act, 1927 (c 5) (Alta.), as amended in 1928, c. 25, and 1933, c. 14, it was found that Bery Kazakewich (the present respondent in this Court), being able wholly or in part to maintain his wife, Mary Kazakewich, did wilfully neglect to do so and did desert her and he was ordered to pay her the sum of $4 per week.\nAn appeal from said order was taken to the District Court and His Honour Judge W. A. Macdonald gave judgment dismissing the appeal. From his judgment an appeal was taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (by leave granted under The Summary Convictions Act, 1935, c. 9, s. 15) on two questions of law, one of which was the claim that the provisions of The Domestic Relations Act, 1927, and, in particular, s. 26 as amended, are ultra vires the Provincial Legislature. On the appeal to the Appellate Division, the Attorney-General for Alberta intervened to support the constitutionality of the Act. In the Appellate Division, the majority of the Court (Harvey C.J.A., Ewing J., and McGillivray J.A.) held (Clarke and Lunney, J.J.A., dissenting) that the province was without legislative authority to confer upon the magistrate the powers purported to be granted to him by Part IV (which includes said s. 26) of The Domestic Relations Act, 1927, and the appeal was allowed and the police magistrate's order set aside[2]. The judgment of the Appellate Division was pronounced on December 17, 1936.\nThe Appellate Division granted (by order dated January 13, 1937, and on certain terms) special leave to the Attorney-General for Alberta (intervener) and to the said Mary Kazakewich to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe Attorney-General for Alberta applied to the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada to affirm the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the appeal. The Registrar, dealing with the matter as presenting the question whether or not the appeal was one in a \"criminal cause\" within the exception in s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), held that the appeal was not in a criminal cause and affirmed the jurisdiction. On the appeal from his order coming on to be heard before this Court, on April 27, 1937, it appeared that the said Mary Kazakewich had not perfected her appeal. Judgment was reserved, and later, on May 3, 1937, the direction of the Court was delivered by the Chief Justice as follows:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: The judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was a judgment reversing that of His Honour Judge W. A. MacDonald and setting aside the order of the Magistrate, D. C. Sinclair, dated the 31st of January, 1936. The Magistrate's order was an order directing certain payments to be made by the respondent Bery Kazakewich to his wife Mary Kazakewich on a finding that the respondent was able to support his wife and had neglected to do so, contrary to section 26 of the Domestic Relations Act of 1927.\nThe Attorney-General intervened on the hearing of the appeal in the Appellate Division and, having obtained leave to appeal to this Court, applied to the Registrar for and obtained an order affirming the jurisdiction of this Court to hear his appeal.\nWe have no doubt that the Attorney-General had no status to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Appellate Division which, as already mentioned, was a judgment setting aside an order of the Magistrate direct- ing the respondent to pay to his wife certain sums of money; but, on appeal to this Court by the wife, Mary Kazakewich, against this judgment of the Appellate Division, the Attorney-General for Alberta would, in the ordinary course, have the right to appear in order to support the validity of the legislation which the Appellate Division by its judgment has declared to be ultra vires.\nThe Appellate Division has granted to the wife, Mary Kazakewich, leave to appeal to this Court, but she has not taken the necessary steps to perfect her appeal by providing security and having that security allowed, as required by the statute.\nWe think the proper course is to make no formal order for the present on the appeal from the Registrar in order to give the wife, Mary Kazakewich, an opportunity to perfect her appeal. The appeal from the Registrar's order must be disposed of before the final termination of the present sittings of this Court, and it may be spoken to after the hearing of the appeals has been concluded.\nOn the matter coming on again before the Court on May 19, 1937, and it appearing that the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta had dismissed an application (made under s. 66 of the Supreme Court Act) by the said Mary Kazakewich for leave now to perfect an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the appeal from the Registrar's order affirming jurisdiction was allowed.\nMotion by way of appeal allowed.\nR.

As the motorman did not slow down to stop at the usual car stop, she rang again. The motorman, noticing her at the exit door, quickly stopped the car at a point which was not a usual stopping place, and then caused the door to open. She alighted and was almost immediately struck and injured by an automobile driven by S. from the rear. She sued for damages. At the trial the jury found that defendant's motorman was negligent \u201cin stopping the tram too suddenly at other than a customary car stop without taking proper precaution for the safety of passengers\u201d; they negatived negligence in S. and the plaintiff. Judgment was given to plaintiff for damages, which was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1937] O.R. 256). Plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The judgment for plaintiff at trial should be restored.\nThere is no absolute rule that the duty of a street railway company towards its passengers ends when they alight and that it is not responsible for any mishap that may overtake the passenger making his way to the sidewalk. Each case must depend on its own circumstances. There is a duty on the company not to place its passenger in danger at the moment of alighting or immediately thereafter. There were precautions that might have been taken by the motorman, which the jury, no doubt, took into account.\nPer Duff C.J.: Defendant's duty was to exercise reasonable care for the safety of its passengers. What constitutes reasonable care (where no special rule of law comes into play) is a question of fact, to be determined according to the circumstances.\nSec. 37 (1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act (as to vehicles not passing a street-car which is stationary for taking on or discharging passengers) was intended to provide a specific safeguard for (inter alia) passengers leaving street cars. It imposes a duty upon drivers of motor cars directly, but has significance in relation to a street railway company's execution of its duty to exercise reasonable care in the carriage of passengers. The conduct of a company, which stops its car for the discharge of passengers at such a place and in such a manner as to render nugatory said statutory safeguard, is a circumstance not irrelevant in determining whether it has acquitted itself of its obligations to them. Ex facie, it is not a wholly unreasonable con- clusion that the company is not sufficiently attending to the safety of passengers if it acts in disregard of the contingency (when the emergence of that contingency ought to be foreseen as a practicable possibility) that a motor car may at the moment be in the act of passing and may, if the street-car is too suddenly stopped and the doors too suddenly thrown open, be carried through the place where passengers are alighting. In the absence of circumstances implying assumption of the risk by the passenger (which in itself in most cases would probably be an issue of fact for the jury; and which assumption of risk could not be affirmed in the present case) it is a question of fact for the jury whether, in managing its street-car in such a manner as to deprive descending passengers of the safeguard contemplated by the statute, the company is fulfilling its duty to take reasonable care for its passengers' safety.\nFurther, in the present case, it was, upon the evidence, open to the jury to take the view that the sudden stopping of the street-car might set up motions in the car itself, which, when the doors were opened almost simultaneously with the application of the brakes, might cause the plaintiff, in descending, to lose her balance and distract her attention from street traffic; and that such things did occur and had that effect upon the plaintiff; and in such view it would be a natural and proper conclusion that defendant was not reasonably entitled to assume that no precautions on its part were necessary\nThere was evidence from which the jury might not improperly find that the situation of danger from the passing automobile was one created by the unreasonable and imprudent stopping of the street-car in the manner in which and at the place where it was stopped; and that this situation of danger ought to have been anticipated as a reasonably possible contingency; and that defendant could not reasonably assume that, in the circumstances, plaintiff, without negligence on her part, would not be unaware of the risk involved in defendant's acts or of the actual danger from the approaching motor car.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment at trial in her favour on findings of a jury) dismissed her action. In the action the plaintiff claimed damages for personal injuries received by being struck by an automobile after alighting from defendant's street-car (a \u201cone-man\u201d operated street-car, south bound on Bathurst street, Toronto) which, to allow her to alight, had been stopped suddenly at a place which was not a usual stopping place.\nAt trial, on verdict of a jury, the plaintiff recovered judgment for $2,000. This was reversed by the Court of Appeal (Fisher J.A. dissenting) which dismissed the action(1). Special leave was granted by the Court of Appeal to the plaintiff to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment at trial restored, with costs throughout.\nR. Roy McMurtry and B.J. Spencer Pitt for the appellant.\nIrving S. Fairty K.C. and A.H. Young for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I am in complete agreement with the reasons and the conclusion of my brother Hudson; but there are some additional observations which may, I think, be not without value.\nThe duty of the respondents is to exercise reasonable care for the safety of their passengers. What constitutes reasonable care (where no special rule of law comes into play) is a question of fact, to be determined according to the circumstances.\nBefore proceeding to discuss the facts it will be necessary to state briefly a consideration which would appear to be of some importance. By section 37 (1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act:\n37. (1) Where a person travelling or being upon a highway in charge of a vehicle, or on a bicycle or tricycle, or on horseback or leading a horse, overtakes a street-car or a car of an electric railway, operated in or near the centre of the travelled portion of the highway which is stationary for the purpose of taking on or discharging passengers, he shall not pass the car or approach nearer than six feet measured back from the rear or front entrance or exit, as the case may be, of the car on the side on which passengers are getting on or off until such passengers have got on or got safely to the side of the street, as the case may be. Provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply where a safety zone has been set aside and designated by a by-law passed under the provisions of paragraph 48 of section 399 of The Municipal Act, but no vehicle or horse shall pass such safety zone at a speed greater than is reasonable and proper and in no event greater than ten miles an hour and with due caution for the safety of pedestrians.\nThe terms of this enactment sufficiently evince its purpose. It was intended to provide a specific safeguard for (inter alia) passengers leaving street cars, in respect of the peril (well recognized by everybody concerned with such matters) to which such persons were not uncommonly subjected from the incompetence or inattention of drivers of automobiles passing a street car on the side from which passengers are in the habit of leaving it. The statute is not designed principally for the protection of the careful, the alert, the circumspect. It is within the experience of everyone that for diverse reasons people emerging from a vehicle do not infrequently, by reason of inattention due to commonly operating causes, fail to take into account risks which would be obvious to a person on the alert for the dangers of the street.\nThe framers of the statute, no doubt, had in mind the ordering of traffic for the general convenience, but that one of its main objects is to secure the safety of persons intent on getting on or leaving street cars is indisputable.\nThe statute imposes a duty upon the drivers of motor cars directly; but it does not necessarily follow that the enactments of the statute are without significance in relation to the execution by the owner of the street car of his duty to exercise reasonable care in the carriage of his passengers. The statute having provided a specific safeguard for the protection (inter alia) of passengers alighting from street cars, the question whether the conduct of the street car owner, who stops his vehicle for the discharge of passengers at such a place and in such a manner as to render nugatory this statutory safeguard, is a circumstance not irrelevant in determining whether he has acquitted himself of his obligations to them as carrier of passengers, is a question which ought not to be lightly dismissed.\nThe legislation has, in effect, declared that passengers on street cars ought to enjoy the protection of the safeguard prescribed. Ex facie, it is not, I think, a wholly unreasonable conclusion that the street car owner is not sufficiently attending to the safety of his passengers if he acts in disregard of the contingency (when the emergence of that contingency ought to be foreseen as a practicable possibility) that a motor car may at the moment be in the act of passing him, and may, if the street car is too suddenly stopped and the doors too suddenly thrown open for the exit of passengers, be carried, in spite of the driver's efforts, through the place where passengers are alighting, with consequent molestation of, and injury to, such passengers.\nIt is conceivable, of course, that the passenger may, by his words or conduct, assume the risk; but that, as we shall presently see, cannot be affirmed in this case. In the absence of circumstances implying assumption of the risk by the passenger (which in itself in most cases would probably be an issue of fact for the jury), it would appear to be a question of fact for the jury whether, in managing his street car in such a manner as to deprive descending passengers of the safeguard contemplated by the statute, the owner is fulfilling his duty to take reasonable care for the safety of his passengers.\nBut the conclusion I have reached may be put also upon a narrower ground.\nThere is evidence from which the jury might conclude that the sudden stopping of the car in the manner in which it was effected in this case might not improbably set up motions in the car itself which, when the doors are opened, as here, almost simultaneously with the application of the brakes, may deprive a descending passenger of full control of his movements, completely distracting his attention from the possible proximity of approaching motor cars. I find myself unable to accept the view that the appellant must be held upon her own evidence to have been in a position immediately before leaving the steps to observe the approaching car. Her English is very imperfect and whatever doubt there may be upon other points, she is attempting to say, it seems to be quite clear, that she was thrown off her balance and lost, in consequence, control of her movements. She says the car was still moving when the door was opened and \u201cI like fly from the car.\u201d In cross-examination she says:\nQ. Now, you did not fall off the street car?\nA. I didn't fall; just like somebody threw me out, and I fell on my feet.\n* * *\nQ. He stopped the car?\nA. Yes, and the door was open, and I held it in my hand and he started the car sudden and it like threw me out * * *\nQ. You lost your balance?\nA. Yes.\nOn re-examination she says:\nA. No. when the car try to stop, and move, I try to make the step, and it threw me off.\nThe witness Wojonski in cross-examination says:\nA. I see her when the door is open from the street-car, and the lady is gone.\n* * *\nQ. Did she fall?\nA. She fall. Q. Did she fall out of the street-car?\nA. Yes.\nQ. She fell out of the street-car?\nA. She fell down on the road.\n* * *\nMr. JUSTICE MCFARLAND: * * * Would she have fallen down on the road if there had not been any automobile there at all?\nA. Yes, she fall.\nThe witness Saracini in examination in chief says:\nWhen you put the brakes on a car so quick there will be a certain amount of sway.\nThe evidence of the appellant and Wojonski that, in leaving the street car, she lost her balance, is supported by Saracini's evidence that the street car was still swaying when his car and the appellant came into contact; and continued to sway until the door was closed. Saracini says the sudden stopping of the car would set up a swaying motion and that such was its effect on the occasion in question. Moreover, Saracini says that, after reaching the ground, the appellant was \u201cstaggering.\u201d The motorman says he stopped the car as quickly as he could. Saracini says that when a car is brought to a stop as abruptly as on this occasion a swaying motion will be set up. He was for some years a conductor in the employ of the respondents; and there is no apparent reason why the jury might not, on this point, properly accept his evidence.\nThere was, therefore, evidence for the jury that such a sudden stopping of the car would be calculated to embarrass the passenger in the attempt to descend and to distract her attention from the traffic in the street; and that it, in fact, had such affect upon the appellant. It is impossible to affirm as a proposition of law that, in the circumstances, the respondents were entitled to act upon the assumption that she was in a situation to take care of herself. She had rung once without response; she rang a second time before the usual stopping place was reached and, although she, no doubt, observed, before alighting, that the car had passed the usual stopping place, it was not necessarily inconsistent with reasonable conduct on her part that she should not have anticipated the suddenness of the motorman's action or its effects, either on the motions of the street car itself, or in rendering it impracticable for the driver of a motor car in the situation of Saracini to stop in time to enable her to pass on to the sidewalk unmolested. These were all matters within the special cognizance of the respondents. The argument that a jury might not properly think that such matters, in the circumstances, would not probably present themselves in all their practical significance to the mind of a passenger (especially one disturbed in mind as they may very well have supposed the appellant to have been in view of the possibility of being carried on to the next stopping place) is not, to me, a very convincing one. Nor can I endorse the proposition of law, that, the facts being such as I have stated, the passenger must be taken, by ringing the bell a second time, to have assumed the risk of what happened in consequence of the ill-advised sudden stop and immediate opening of the doors.\nThe views of Mr. Justice Middleton are, I think, summed up in this passage:\nFrom this evidence it is clear that what happened was that the plaintiff succeeded in reaching the pavement. She was then entirely free from the street-car. She took one step upon the pavement and looked and saw the automobile approaching. She attempted to step back towards the street-car and did take one step backwards, but, this not being sufficient, she was struck by the approaching automobile and so injured.\nIt will be noticed that, at the trial, notwithstanding the endeavour of the plaintiff's counsel to get her to say that she fell from the street\u2011car, she adhered to her former statement that she did not fall until struck, that she was safely on the pavement and off the street\u2011car, took one step towards the sidewalk and, thinking of cars, she turned around to see if any automobile was approaching, tried to step back to a position of safety and was hit by the automobile.\nAt the trial she endeavoured to show that, at the time she alighted from the car, the car was yet moving and did not come to rest. On the examination for discovery, she had taken the position that the car had been stopped and that she was thrown out of the car by reason of the motorman \u201cstarted the car sudden,\u201d thus causing her to lose her balance.\nThe jury found the driver of the automobile was not negligent, but they found the motorman was negligent \u201cIn stopping the tram too suddenly at other than a customary car stop without taking proper precaution for the safety of passengers.\u201d No explanation was had of this somewhat ambiguous and enigmatical answer. In the light of the proceedings at the trial I think its meaning becomes clear. It was not unlawful for the motorman to stop his car for the convenience of passengers at other than a regular stopping place. It was suggested that here a stop was made too quickly, made so quickly that it did not afford Saracini in his motorcar an opportunity of getting it under control. When the car had passed the usual stopping place Saracini was justified in assuming that it would not again stop until Queen street was reached and so was off his guard, and the car stopping suddenly at other than a customary car stop, he was excused and not subject to any adverse comment. The jury apparently thought that when stopping at other than a usual stopping place there was an obligation on the part of the railway company to take some pre- caution for the safety of passengers from the risk of passing automobiles. What precautions precisely should have been taken the jury have not intimated.\nWe think that the duty of the street railway company towards its passengers ends when they alight from the car, and that the railway is not responsible for any mishap that may overtake the passenger making his way to the sidewalk. The operation of these one\u2011man cars is authorized by the law, and it is obvious that a motorman who is located at the front of the car discharges his entire duty to the passenger when he brings the car to a standstill and opens the door, thus permitting the passenger to alight. The passenger when alighting must take all precautions necessary to ensure his own safety and must observe whether there is any danger from a passing automobile. The motorman would not be justified in starting up the car until he had seen that the passenger had safely reached the ground. His duty was to observe this through the mirror provided for that purpose. The jury having by the answers given in effect negatived all other charges of negligence, the action must, as a result, be dismissed.\nAs will appear from what I have said, I am, with the greatest possible respect, unable to agree that the view stated in this passage as to the effect of the evidence is one which the jury was bound to accept and act upon. There is some confusion, no doubt, in the evidence of the appellant, but, as I have said, she adheres firmly to the statement that she lost her balance and was involuntarily ejected from the car. This evidence is supported by Wojonski and corroborated by the statement of Saracini repeated more than once that, after reaching the ground, she \u201cstaggered\u201d towards his car. Wojonski says, \u201cOne moment decided everything.\u201d If the jury took the view (which was open to them on the evidence) that the sudden stopping of the car would cause it to sway and that the motions of the car after the opening of the door did in fact cause the appellant to lose her balance, then the conclusion that the respondents were not reasonably entitled to assume that no precautions were necessary would be a natural and proper one.\nThere was evidence from which the jury might not improperly find that the situation of danger from the passing automobile was a situation created by the unreasonable and imprudent stopping of the car in the manner and at the place where it was brought to a stop. The jury were also entitled to hold that this situation of danger ought to have been anticipated as a reasonably possible contingency; and that the respondents could not reasonably assume that, in the circumstances, the appellant would not, without negligence on her part, be unaware of the risk involved in the respondents' acts or of the actual danger itself from the approaching motor car.\nHUDSON J. (all the other members of the Court concurring)\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario allowing, by a majority of 2 to 1, an appeal from the judgment pronounced by the Honourable Mr. Justice McFarland, after trial with a jury, awarding the plaintiff $2,000 damages against the defendant, the Toronto Transportation Commission. The action was brought against the Commission and one Saracini for personal injuries arising under the following circumstances:\nThe plaintiff was a passenger in one of the defendant's street cars. Desiring to alight, she signalled the motorman and arose and went to the exit door at the side of the car. The motorman not slowing down to stop at the usual car stop, she rang again. The motorman, then noticing her at the exit door, quickly stopped his car at a point which was not a usual stopping place. He then did what was necessary to open the door, in order to enable her to alight. She did alight and was almost immediately thereafter struck and injured by an automobile driven by Saracini and approaching from the rear. The following questions were put to and answered thus by the jury:\n1. Was the motorman negligent?\nAnswer: Yes.\n2. If so, in what did such negligence consist?\nAnswer: In stopping the tram too suddenly at other than a customary car stop without taking proper precaution for the safety of passengers.\n3. Was Saracini negligent?\nAnswer: No.\n5. Was the plaintiff negligent?\nAnswer: No.\n10. At what amount do you assess the plaintiff's damages? If any?\nAnswer: $2,000.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal took the view that the duty of the street railway towards its passengers ends when they alight from the car and that the railway is not responsible for any mishap that may overtake the passenger making his way to the sidewalk, and that, therefore, as a matter of law, according to the answer of the jury to question 2 there was no negligence on the part of the motor- man. With this view I cannot agree and, in my opinion, there is no such absolute rule. Each case must depend on its own circumstances. There is a duty on the street railway not to place a passenger in danger at the moment of alighting or immediately thereafter. The question has been asked: What precautions might have been taken by the motorman? It is not difficult to suggest a number. In the first place, he might have brought his car to a stop more slowly and in this way given warning to the driver of the approaching motor car. In the second place, he might have kept the door closed after stopping for a few seconds, which would have enabled any motor car approaching from the rear to pass before the passenger was permitted to alight.\nThe jury, having expressly negatived negligence on the part of Saracini and contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, no doubt took into account precautions which might have been taken such as above suggested.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial court with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: B.J. Spencer Pitt.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Irving S. Fairty.\n[1] [1937] O.R. 256; [1937] 1 D.L.R. 756.\n"}

V, c. 32.\nIn an action brought by the appellant under section 60 of the Patent Act praying for a declaration that the respondent\u2019s patent was void or that, in the alternative, it was not infringed by the manufacture of certain shirt collars by the appellant, the Exchequer Court of Canada held that the respondent\u2019s patent was \u201cvalid and infringed by the\u201d appellant and dismissed the action. On appeal, this Court reversed this judgment and declared the respondent\u2019s patent void, the judgment proceeding upon the sole grounds that the claims were too broad and embraced, within their scope more than the alleged invention disclosed in the specifications; and, further, that the claims, properly construed, had been anticipated by certain United States and British patents, this Court not finding it necessary to consider the issue of infringement or any of the other grounds upon which the appellant attacked the validity of the respondent\u2019s patent. Before the judgment of this Court had been formally drawn up or entered, the respondent filed a disclaimer in the Patent Office, stating that through mistake, accident or inadvertence and without any wilful intent to defraud or mislead the public, the specification had been made too broad, asserting a claim to more than that to which the inventor was entitled. The respondent, arguing that the disclaimer had the effect of correcting the fault in the claims as found by this Court and that it should have an opportunity under sections 50 and 53 of the Patent Act to establish the validity of the patent as amended by the disclaimer, then moved for an order directing a rehearing of the appeal \u201cin order to meet the new conditions that have arisen since the delivery of the judgment and to provide in the formal judgment of the Court for the filing already made of the disclaimer * * * .\u201d On the hearing of the application, leave was given to the respondent to move that, in lieu of a rehearing of the appeal, the judgment of this Court should be varied by directing a reference to the Exchequer Court of Canada to determine whether effect ought to be given to the disclaimer, and whether relief ought to be given to the respondent under subsection 2 of section 53 of the Patent Act.\nHeld, that the respondent\u2019s application should be dismissed; under the circumstances of this case, neither a rehearing of the appeal nor a reference back to the Exchequer Court of Canada ought to be directed.\nThe direction the respondent is asking for could not be given (without disregarding the appellant\u2019s legal rights) unless this Court is prepared to rehear the appeal and enter upon a full examination of all the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant. At the time of the hearing of the appeal, this Court then had power to amend the pleadings and, if necessary, to hear fresh evidence in order to dispose of all the issues raised by the appeal as well as those which the respondent is submitting by its motion; but the respondent then insisted on maintaining the judgment of the trial judge, declaring its claims, as framed, to be valid claims. Having lost on that issue of validity, the respondent is now seeking a rehearing in order to take up a new position never before suggested by it, with all the attendant delay and inconvenience. By its conduct, the respondent has definitely elected against taking the position which it is now endeavouring to take and, on grounds both of justice and convenience, the application should fail.\nMOTION by the respondent (after a judgment of this Court had declared its patent void for being too broad and embracing more than the alleged invention disclosed in specifications) for an order directing a rehearing of the appeal in order to give effect to a disclaimer filed in the Patent Office before formal judgment had been entered and, upon leave of the Court, for an order directing a reference back to the Exchequer Court of Canada to determine whether effect ought to be given to the disclaimer and whether relief ought to be given to the respondent under subsection 2 of section 53 of the Patent Act. The motion was dismissed with costs.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and H. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. formotion.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The Exchequer Court of Canada[1], on the 26th of March, 1936, delivered judgment declaring that the defendants\u2019 patent \u201cis valid and infringed by the plaintiff\u201d and dismissing the action of the appellants under section 60 of the Patent Act, 1935, praying for a declaration that the patent was void or that, in the alternative, it was not infringed by the manufacture of certain shirt collars by the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs appealed and this Court delivered judgment on the 19th day of March, 1937[2], allowing the appeal and declaring the patent of the respondents void. The judgment proceeded upon the grounds that the claims in the patent were too broad and embraced within their scope more than the alleged invention disclosed in the specification and, further, that the claims, properly construed, had been anticipated by certain United States and British patents.\nOn the 31st of March, 1937, the respondents filed a disclaimer in the Patent Office in the following terms:\nWhereas, the undersigned Canadian Celanese Limited, a body politic and corporate, having its head office and principal place of business in the city of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, Canada, is the owner of Canadian letters patent no. 265,960 granted on the 16th day of November, 1926, for an invention entitled fabrics and sheet materials and the manufacture thereof.\nAnd whereas, through mistake, accident or inadvertence, and without any wilful intent to defraud or mislead the public, the specification has been made too broad, asserting a claim to more than that of which Camille Dreyfus was the inventor.\nNow therefore, the undersigned disclaims from the scope of claims 1 to 6 inclusive, and 25 the the use of a fabric or fabrics containing a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose except where such thermoplastic derivative of cellulose is in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres.\nIt further disclaims from the scope of claims 7 to 12, inclusive, the use of a fabric or fabrics containing an organic derivative of cellulose except where such organic derivative of cellulose is in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres.\nIt further disclaims from the scope of claims 13 to 18, inclusive, the use of a fabric or fabrics containing a cellulose ester except where such cellulose ester is in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres.\nIt further disclaims from the scope of claims 19 to 24, inclusive, the use of a fabric or fabrics containing cellulose acetate except where such cellulose acetate is in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres;\nand on the 27th of April, they moved for an order directing a rehearing of the appeal in which, as already mentioned, this Court has pronounced judgment\nin order to meet the new conditions that have arisen since the delivery of the judgment and to provide in the formal judgment of the Court for the filing already made of the said disclaimer, the whole upon such terms and conditions as to this honourable Court may seem just.\nOn the hearing of this application, leave was given to the respondents to move that in lieu of a rehearing of the appeal, the judgment of this Court, which had not been formally drawn up or entered, should be varied by directing a reference back to the Exchequer Court of Canada to determine whether effect ought to be given to the disclaimer, and whether relief ought to be given to the respondents under subsection 2 of section 53. We have fully considered the application of the respondents and have come to the conclusion that neither a rehearing of the appeal nor a reference back to the Exchequer Court can properly be directed.\nThe grounds upon which the appellants appealed from the judgment of the Exchequer Court are summarized in their factum thus:\n(1) that the defendant\u2019s patent 265,960 is void on the grounds:\u2014\n(a) that the patent claims do not specify what is admittedly the \u201call important feature\u201d of the alleged invention, namely, that the cellulose derivative used should be in the form of yarns woven or knitted into a fabric;\n(b) that as they stand the claims are anticipated by the United States patent to Van Heusen and the British patents to Green and H. Dreyfus;\n(c) that if, in the process the patent covers, the cellulose derivative need not be made to flow by taking advantage of its thermoplastic quality, the claims are also anticipated by the United States patents to Kennedy, Oliver and Weidig, the British patents to Berard and Miller, and the Swiss patents to Le Faguays and Nachmann;\n(d) that if, on the other hand, it is essential that the cellulose derivative should be made to flow by heat and the claims extend beyond this, they assert a monopoly to more than the patentee invented;\n(e) that claims 7-48 do so extend and are therefore invalid;\n(\u0192) that claims 19-24 either do so extend or are unnecessary;\n(g) that the product claim (25) is anticipated;\n(h) that the specification discloses no invention having regard to the state of the art;\n(i) that the specification is misleading in respect of the directions given as to the use of cellulose acetate, nitrocellulose and methyl cellulose:\n(j) that either the specification is ambiguous on the point of the impermeability of the resulting composite sheet or the claims assert a monopoly of more than the relatively impermeable sheets to the production of which the invention is confined; or\n(2) that the process used by the plaintiff is not an infringement of the patent on the grounds:\n(a) that the claims extend only to a process in which a thermoplastic cellulose derivative is made to flow by the application of heat and that this does not occur in the plaintiff\u2019s process;\n(b) that the expression \u201csoftening agent\u201d does not include volatile solvents and that in the plaintiff\u2019s process only a volatile solvent is used.\nThis Court, in disposing of the appeal, did not find it necessary to consider the issue of infringement, or any of the grounds upon which the appellants attacked the validity of the patent other than those indicated in paragraphs 1 (a) and 1 (b). Upon these grounds, and these grounds alone, we allowed the appeal and held the patent void.\nIt is necessary to set out the relevant statutory provisions. They are sections 50, 53 and 60 of the Patent Act, 1935, which are textually in these words:\n50. (1) Whenever, by any mistake, accident or inadvertence, and without any wilful intent to defraud or mislead the public, a patentee has (a) made his specification too broad, claiming more than that of which he or the person through whom he claims was the first inventor; or\n(b) in the specification, claimed that he or the person through whom he claims was the first inventor of any material or substantial part of the invention patented of which he was not the first inventor, and to which he had no lawful right;\nhe may, on payment of the fee hereinafter provided, make disclaimer of such parts as he does not claim to hold by virtue of the patent or the assignment thereof.\n(2) Such disclaimer shall be in writing, and in duplicate, and shall be attested by one or more witnesses. One copy thereof shall be filed and recorded in the office of the Commissioner. The other shall be attached to the patent and made a part thereof by reference. The disclaimer shall thereafter be deemed to be part of the original specification.\n(3) No disclaimer shall affect any action pending at the time when it is made, except as to unreasonable neglect or delay in making it.\n(4) In case of the death of the original patentee or of his having assigned the patent a like right to disclaim shall vest in his legal representatives, any of whom may exercise it.\n(5) The patent shall, after disclaimer as in this section provided, be deemed to be valid for such material and substantial part of the invention, definitely distinguished from other parts thereof claimed without right, as is not disclaimed and is truly the invention of the disclaimant, and the disclaimant shall be entitled to maintain an action or suit in respect of such part accordingly.\n53. (1) A patent shall be void if any material allegation in the petition or declaration of the applicant in respect of such patent is untrue, or if the specifications and drawings contain more or less than is necessary for obtaining the end for which they purport to be made, and such omission or addition is wilfully made for the purpose of misleading.\n(2) If it appears to the court that such omission or addition was an involuntary error, and if it is proved that the patentee is entitled to the remainder of his patent pro tanto, the court shall render a judgment in accordance with the facts, and shall determine as to costs, and the patent shall be held valid for that part of the invention described to which the patentee is so found to be entitled.\n(3) Two office copies of such judgment shall be furnished to the Patent Office by the patentee. One of them shall be registered and remain of record in the office and the other shall be attached to the patent and made a part of it by a reference thereto.\n60. (1) A patent or any claim in a patent may be declared invalid or void by the Exchequer Court of Canada at the instance of the Attorney-General of Canada or at the instance of any interested person.\n(2) If any person has reasonable cause to believe that any process used or proposed to be used or any article made, used or sold or proposed to be made, used or sold by him might be alleged by any patentee to constitute an infringement of an exclusive property or privilege granted thereby, he may bring an action in the Exchequer Court of Canada against the patentee for a declaration that such process or article does not or would not constitute an infringement of such exclusive property or privilege.\n(3) Except the Attorney-General of Canada or the Attorney-General of a province of Canada, the plaintiff in any action under this section shall, before proceeding therein, give security for the costs of the patentee in such sum as the Court may direct, but a defendant in any action for the infringement of a patent shall be entitled to obtain a declaration under this section without being required to furnish any security.\nBefore proceeding further, it is convenient to point out that the respondents from the outset took the position that their invention in its essence consisted in the\nuse of thermoplastic yarns of a cellulose derivative woven into the fabric. That was the new and all-important feature of the invention. We are not concerned with the uniting of fabrics otherwise than in the presence of a cellulose derivative in the form of yarn woven into the fabric;\nthis was stated by counsel at the beginning of the trial on being invited by the trial judge to outline the nature of his case. In answer to a question put by the trial judge,\nYou are limiting to yarns, are you?\nMr. Lajoie: I am not limiting, but the patent limits it very definitely, there can be no doubt about it.\nThis Court, in allowing the appeal, held that, on the true construction of the claims, the monopoly claimed was not limited by reference to this feature of the alleged invention disclosed; and that the claims on their true construction were anticipated by the United States and British patents of Van Heusen, Green and H. Dreyfus; and that, consequently, the patent was invalid.\nThe respondents urge that the effect of the disclaimer is to correct this fault in the claims and that they should have an opportunity, either on a rehearing, or on a reference back to the Exchequer Court, to show that the claim of excessive monopoly was due to\nmistake, accident or inadvertence and without any wilful intent to defraud or mislead the public\nwithin the meaning of section 50, or to \u201cinvoluntary error\u201d within the meaning of section 53; and to establish the validity of the patent as amended by the disclaimer.\nWe shall not enter upon an examination of the precise meaning of subsection 1 of section 53 and we postpone for the present any reference to section 50 (3); we shall assume that, in an action under section 60, if a claim to relief under section 53 (2) were advanced at the proper stage by a prayer, for example, in the statement of defence for a declaration in the sense of that subsection, or where a disclaimer has been filed, in the sense of section 50 (5), it would be competent to the Court to grant such relief.\nAssuming, then, that in the action out of which this appeal arises (in which the respondents by their statement of defence ask for a declaration that their patent, as it stood before the filing of the disclaimer, was a valid patent) it would have been competent to make a declaration in the sense of section 53 (2) or in the sense of section 50 (5); it is, of course, quite indisputable that no such declaration could be made in this action, first, until all the grounds of invalidity advanced by the appellants had been considered and rejected; or, second, without disposing of the issues relating to infringement.\nIt is important at this point to notice that relief of such character involves\u2014where, a disclaimer having been filed, a declaration is prayed under section 50 (5)\u2014a declaration in the terms of that subsection that the\npatent * * * is valid for such material and substantial part of the invention, definitely distinguished from other parts thereof claimed without right, as is not disclaimed and is truly the invention of the disclaimant, and the disclaimant shall be entitled to maintain an action or suit in respect of such part accordingly.\nWhere a declaration is prayed under section 53 (2), there are two essential conditions of this relief: first, an adjudication that \u201cthe addition\u201d which would otherwise render the patent void under section 53(1) was not \u201cwilfully made for the purpose of misleading\u201d; and, second, an adjudication that such addition was \u201can involuntary error\u201d and \u201cthat the patentee is entitled to the remainder of his patent pro tanto.\u201d The Court, having adjudicated in this sense, may pronounce \u201cthe patent valid for that part of the invention to which the patentee is so found to be entitled.\u201d\nNow, as will appear from what has already been said, this Court did not find it necessary to pronounce upon the questions whether the specification did disclose any invention for which the patentee, under claims properly framed, would be entitled to protection. Counsel for the respondents did on this application refer to some expressions in the reasons for judgment which, he suggested, pointed to an intention to pronounce a decision upon that issue; but this Court did not intend to pass on the question, and did not in fact decide it.\nOn the appeal, the appellants contended that they were entitled to judgment, not only on the ground on which they ultimately succeeded, but on all the other grounds designated above, including the ground numbered 1(h), that the specification discloses no patentaible invention. It is their right to have these grounds of appeal considered and adjudicated upon before any judgment is pronounced establishing the validity of the respondents\u2019 patent qualified in the sense of the disclaimer. It is their right, moreover, to have such adjudication by this Court.\nFurther, if this Court, we repeat, should hold a view adverse to them on these grounds of appeal, it is their right to have this Court decide upon their contention that, assuming the patent to be valid, they do not by their manufacture infringe it.\nIt is plain, therefore, that we could not give the direction the respondents ask for (without disregarding the legal rights of the appellants) unless we are prepared to rehear the appeal and enter upon a full examination of all the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellants (except those upon which our judgment in the appeal is based), including the issue of subject-matter, as well as the determination of the issue raised by the allegation now for the first time submitted by the respondents, namely, that the excessive scope of the claims is due to \u201cinadvertence\u201d or \u201cinvoluntary error.\u201d\nThe issues raised by the contentions upon which we have not passed and upon which it is now proposed that we shall adjudicate are substantial issues. We do not comment upon them further except to say this: Some of these contentions attack the claims as too broad in respects other than that in which we have held them to be excessive; and, as regards excessive scope in these respects, it would be necessary, also, if excessive scope in the pertinent sense were found to exist, that the respondents establish the existence of the preliminary condition of relief under sections 50 and 53 that such excess was due to \u201c inadvertence\u201d or \u201cinvoluntary error.\u201d\nIt may be observed, that, as regards excessive scope of the claims due to the absence of reference in them to the essence of the invention (the presence of cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres woven into a fabric) the evidence now in the record presents facts casting upon the respondents a burden of explanation by no means trivial. The limiting words, for example, which the respondents have sought to introduce by their disclaimer are, in effect, found in the English patent and the United States patent, and there is no suggestion of a reason why they were omitted from the Canadian patent, nor is there anything pointing to a satisfactory explanation of the terms of the licences granted by the respondents.\nOur attention has, moreover, been called to the successful efforts of the respondents in resisting discovery in relation to matters which prima facie might appear to be not without bearing upon this issue, as well as upon the issues of misrepresentation, anticipation and subject-matter (the learned judge assumed that experiment had been necessary, notwithstanding his order sustaining a refusal to answer questions concerning the respondents\u2019 investigations on the examination for discovery). If we had been disposed to allow a rehearing, it might have been necessary to exact, as a condition, that complete discovery should be made.\nThe respondents urge that a refusal of their application will, in effect, deprive them of relief which the legislature intended patentees in their situation to have.\nWe are far from convinced that, in view of their conduct, the respondents have not disentitled themselves to such relief. They had notice from the particulars of objection that their patent was attacked on the ground that claims were excessive, and, moreover, on the ground that the claims, on their proper interpretation, had been anticipated by Van Heusen, Green and Dreyfus. They succeeded at the trial on this issue of anticipation because the trial judge held that the essence of their invention consisted in the presence in one of the component fabrics of cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres, and that, in view of this, the patents mentioned in which this was not an element of the invention did not constitute anticipation. The amendment to which they now seek to give effect, if made by disclaimer filed before the statement of defence, could not have prejudiced their just rights because it could only result in bringing the claims into conformity with what they were insisting was the true character of their invention. Assuming their bona fides, they must have desired that the monopoly claimed should not extend beyond that to which they were entitled. If the respondents, instead of asking simpliciter by their statement of defence for a declaration that the patent was valid, had asked for a declaration under section 53(2) in the event of the Court holding the claims to be too broad, the issue of bona fides would have been raised and the litigation would have proceeded with full knowledge of all parties that the respondents intended to pray for relief under that section; the same result might possibly have been reached by filing a disclaimer and praying, in the statement of defence, a declaration in the sense of section 50 (5).\nOn the appeal to this Court, the respondents\u2019 counsel contented himself with answering the attack on the claims thus:\nIn my submission, we are absolutely entitled to go back to the body of the specification to find out the meaning of those claims. My friend referred to the recent judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Mullard Radio Corporation v. Philco[3]. In that case Lord Macmillan repeats what has been said over and over again, that, while each claim must be read independently, you look at the body of the specification to find out the meaning of each claim. Your Lordships have held time and again, in Schweyer Electric and Manufacturing Co. v. New York Central R.R. Co.[4] and in Western Electric Co. v. Baldwin International Radio of Canada[5], that the patentee is entitled to have his claims construed in the light of the dictionary he supplies in the body of the specification. In my submission, there cannot be the slightest question but that he is talking about cellulose derivative or cellulose acetate in the form of yarns. There can be no question about it.\nAt the stage at which this argument was made, this Court had power to amend the pleadings and, if necessary, to hear fresh evidence in order to dispose of the issues which the respondents now desire to litigate. Had the respondents then taken the position they now take (which, as already observed, could not have prejudiced their just rights) all the issues raised by the appeal could have been examined and disposed of as well as those which the respondents now for the first time ask us to consider and determine on a rehearing of the appeal.\nThe respondents, nevertheless, insisted on maintaining the judgment of the trial judge, declaring these claims, as framed, to be valid claims. Now, having lost on that issue of validity and judgment having been pronounced against them, the respondents seek a rehearing in order to take up a new position never before even suggested by them, with all the attendant delay and inconvenience already indicated.\nWe think that by their conduct they have definitely elected against taking the position which they are now endeavouring to take; and, however that may be, we are satisfied that, on grounds both of justice and convenience, the application should fail. We do not think it necessary to express an opinion upon the construction and effect of the third subsection of section 50. We decide nothing, moreover, as to the relation between the procedure authorized by section 60 and that contemplated by section 53. We have assumed (for the purposes of this judgment only) that a defendant in an action under section 60 can, by a proper and timely proceeding, obtain relief under subsection 2 of section 53 and, if there is a valid disclaimer, that the Court can in such an action take cognizance of that disclaimer; but we decide none of these points.\nThe application is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1936] Ex.

Ry. Cas. 84) held that, under the Quebec Order in Council of October 30, 1794, the Municipal Code and certain provincial Acts, the municipality was senior at the point of crossing and placed the cost of construction and maintenance on the railway company. The latter then applied under section 51 of the Railway Act for a re-hearing of the application and on the re-hearing, which was first refused and subsequently granted, both parties submitted additional evidence, and the case was re-argued. On April 8, 1936, the Board of Railay Commissioners for Canada rendered its decision, (45 Can. Ry. Cas. 208); but the Chief Commissioner, the Assistant Chief Commissioner and the Deputy Chief Commissioner (the latter differing from the Chief Commissioner in his view of the facts and of the law) were all of the opinion that a case should be stated in writing for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada on the following questions: 1. Whether the Chief Commissioner was right in holding that the Orders in Council of 1794 do not constitute a valid reservation for highways as against subsequent grantees of the Crown. 2. Whether the Chief Commissioner was right in holding that the grant from the Crown to the railway company in 1933 is sufficient in itself to rebut any presumption in favour of such a reservation which might otherwise arise either from the terms of the Orders in Council or by reason of the practice which has been followed for many years in the survey of Crown lands in the province of Quebec. 3. Whether the Chief Commissioner was right in holding that the railway company occupies a position of seniority in respect of the railway crossing, the subject of this application. 4. Had the Board jurisdiction under section 51 of the Railway Act to grant a re-hearing of the application?\nHeld that, as to the first and second questions the title of the railway company to the lands in question was not subject to any reservation in respect of highways; and as to the fourth question, that the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada had jurisdiction under section 51 of the Railway Act to give a direction for, and to proceed with, the re-hearing of the municipality\u2019s application.\nAs to the third question, no answer was given to it, as, in the opinion of the Court, it was no part of its functions to define the practice of the Board in respect of the apportionment of cost of works upon an application to construct a railway crossing on a highway or a highway crossing on a railway.\nREFERENCE by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada[1] to the Supreme Court of Canada of certain questions of law contained in a stated case in writing for the opinion of that Court, pursuant to the provisions of section 43 of the Railway Act.\nThe facts as set out in the stated case are summarized as follows: By grant from the Crown in the right of the province of Quebec of June 12, 1933, the Interprovincial and James Bay Railway Company (the railway now forming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway) became \u201cthe absolute owner\u201d of a railway right of way through the lands of the Crown in certain townships, including the lands at the point of crossing here in question. The operative words of the instrument transfer and convey full ownership to the railway company subject to express reservations of minerals and of the right to retake any part of the lands situate on the shores of lakes and rivers. Two Orders in Council made in 1794, during Lord Dorchester\u2019s administration, were put in evidence. The first, dated 10th October, 1794, approves a diagram for a river township nine miles broad by twelve miles deep, to be adopted in the laying out of the ungranted lands of the Crown; and it directs that the Surveyor General make a diagram on the same principle for an inland township of ten miles square. The Order in Council refers in terms to the reserves for the Crown and church, and these reserves are shewn in red and black on the diagram, but there is no reference to road allowances. The second Order in Council, dated 30th October, 1794, adopts a similar diagram for an inland township, and quotes the report of the Land Committee to His Excellency that \u201cit has been necessary in order to make each lot contain two hundred and ten acres (the allowance of five for every hundred acres for highways included) to make the township contain ten miles, five chains in length and ten miles, three chains and fifty-five links in breadth.\u201d The Township of Baby, in which the crossing in question is situate, is a river township. It was shown to be the practice of the Department of Lands, in making grants to settlers, to include in the grant 105 acres of land for each 100 acres bought and paid for by the settler subject to a reservation, commonly but not uniformly contained in the grants, for highways. In the forms of Crown grant the words \u201cand the usual allowance for highways\u201d form part of the description of the land granted, and are not inserted by way of reservation. The application for the crossing was originally made by letter from the municipality to the Board, which issued its order authorizing the crossing, and directed that the question of the apportionment of the cost should be reserved for further consideration. A judgment was subsequently delivered by the Deputy Chief Commissioner, concurred in by Commissioner Norris, and in part concurred in by the Assistant Chief Commissioner, directing that the crossing should be provided at the expense of the railway company, and a formal order was issued accordingly [2]. The railway company thereupon applied for a re-hearing which was first refused but subsequently granted. The case was then set down for further hearing, additional evidence was put in by both parties and the case was re-argued before the Chief Commissioner, the Assistant Chief Commissioner and the Deputy Chief Commissioner. Subsequently a judgment was delivered by the Chief Commissioner in which he reached conclusions completely at variance with those reached by the Deputy Chief Commissioner, but expressing the opinion that a case should be stated for the opinion of this Court. In his opinion the Assistant Chief Commissioner and the Deputy Chief Commissioner (the latter differing from the Chief Commissioner in his view of the facts and the law) concurred[3].\nG. A. Walker K.C. for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nR. Cannon K.C. for the municipality of St. Eug\u00e8ne de Guigues.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal concerns three questions stated for the opinion of this Court by the Board of Railway Commissioners. The nature of the proceedings giving rise to the stated case appears in the first three paragraphs of that case, which are these:\n1. On October 13, 1933, the municipality of St. Eug\u00e8ne de Guigues applied for a crossing over the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s tracks at Angliers, which is situate within the township of Baby.\n2. On March 5, 1934, the Board authorized the construction of this crossing, and by its order no. 50814 reserved its decision in regard to the apportionment of the cost of construction and maintenance. Subsequently, by order no. 51463, of October 25, 1934, the cost of construction and maintenance was ordered to be borne and paid by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\n3. On December 17, 1934, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company applied under section 51 of the Railway Act for a re-hearing of the application, and on the re-hearing, which was first refused and subsequently granted, both parties submitted additional evidence, and the case was re-argued by all parties interested.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners has authority under section 259 to apportion the cost of works constructed pursuant to the authority of the Board given upon an application under section 256 for leave to construct a railway crossing on a highway or to construct a highway crossing on a railway. The authority under section 259 is a statutory authority the exercise of which is entrusted to the Board. It seems very clear that this Court has no power, by laying down a rule, nor has the Board itself power, by establishing a practice, to limit the discretion with which the Board is invested by that section (Attorney-General v. Emerson)[4].\nIt appears that in fact, when such applications are made to the Board, the determining circumstance, under the practice of the Board, in respect of the apportionment of cost, is what is described as \u201cseniority\u201d; by which is meant, apparently, that when the railway is constructed on land over which the public have a right of passage by virtue of statute, dedication or otherwise, the incidence of the cost of the works necessary to provide a highway crossing over the railway, upon the site over which there existed these rights of passage, falls upon the railway company; while, if, when the railway was constructed, there were no such rights of passage, the cost of the works is borne by the municipality or other public authority applying for the order.\nI do not profess to be stating with accuracy or completeness the practice of the Board; and, indeed, one of the questions submitted to us would seem to indicate that the practice is not so definitely settled as to enable one, with confidence, to sum it up in a precise rule.\nIt is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that it is no part of the functions of this Court to define that practice. Accordingly, we shall not attempt to do so, and no answer will be given to the third question.\nWhile it is beyond our province authoritatively to define, or even to describe, the practice, still more to enunciate any rule supposed to be evidenced by the practice, yet there is one question upon which we think we may give our opinion with some advantage, and we proceed to do so.\nWe have come to the conclusion that the title acquired by the railway company under the grant by the province of Quebec designated in the stated case is not subject to any reservation of any highway or any right on the part of the Crown, or any other public authority, to construct a highway in or upon the lands which are the subject of the grant. We are also of the opinion that there is no right reserved to take lands without compensation from the area granted for the construction of highways.\nThe first two questions submitted are in these words:\n1. Whether the Chief Commissioner was right in holding that the Orders in Council of 1794 do not constitute a valid reservation for highways as against subsequent grantees of the Crown.\n2. Whether the Chief Commissioner was right in holding that the grant from the Crown to the railway company in 1933 is sufficient in itself to rebut any presumption in favour of such a reservation which might otherwise arise either from the terms of the Orders in Council or by reason of the practice which has been followed for many years in the survey of Crown lands in the province of Quebec.\nThe meaning of \u201creservation for highways\u201d is not free from doubt, but we think that what we have just said constitutes an answer to these questions in substance.\nWe do not consider it necessary to determine the effect of the Orders in Council of 1794, upon which the appellant municipality relies; that is to say, we do not think it necessary to determine what effect these Orders in Council had at the time they were passed. Assuming they were legislative in character, and assuming they imposed a legal duty upon the officers of the Crown to include in each patent of Crown lands, of the character contemplated by the Orders in Council, a reservation for the benefit of the public of the right to take land for constructing highways in the premises granted up to the limit of the percentage mentioned, we are still unable to agree that these Orders in Council affect the rights of the railway company arising from the grant now under consideration.\nThe authority of the legislature of the province of Quebec in respect of the disposition of the Crown lands of that province is indisputable. In St. Catherine Milling Co. v. The Queen[5] Lord Watson said:\nBy an Imperial statute passed in the year 1840 (3 and 4 Vict., c. 35), the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, then known as Upper and Lower Canada, were united under the name of the province of Canada, and it was, inter alia, enacted that, in consideration of certain annual payments which Her Majesty had agreed to accept by way of civil list, the produce of all territorial and other revenues at the disposal of the Crown arising in either of the united provinces should be paid into the consolidated fund of the new province. There was no transfer to the province of any legal estate in the Crown lands, which continued to be vested in the Sovereign; but all moneys realized by sales or in any other manner became the property of the province. In other words, all beneficial interest in such lands within the provincial boundaries belonging to the Queen, and either producing or capable of producing revenue, passed to the province, the title still remaining in the Crown.\nHis Lordship then discusses the terms of sections 108 and 109 of the British North America Act and proceeds (pp. 57, 58):\nThe enactments of section 109 are, in the opinion of their Lordships, sufficient to give to each province, subject to the administration and control of its own legislature, the entire beneficial interest of the Crown in all lands within its boundaries, which at the time of the union were vested in the Crown, with the exception of such lands as the Dominion acquired right to under section 108, or might assume for the purposes specified in section 117.\nBefore turning to the legislation of Quebec affecting the disposal of Crown lands, it is convenient to quote some of the recitals of the grant now in question as well as the operative words:\nWhereas, under production of new plans supplied by said railway company, it was shown that the lands used by said railway company were not all included in the above Orders in Council;\nWhereas said railway company required an absolute deed of ownership on and upon the Crown lands actually occupied by its railway line, in accordance with the plans supplied by said railway company respectively the twentieth day of May, the third day of April, the thirtieth day of April, the twenty-sixth day of June, the ninth day of July and the first day of August, nineteen hundred and thirty, and signed by F. Taylor, Quebec professional engineer, and Malcolm D. Barclay, Quebec land surveyer.\nWhereas the railway company further required an absolute title of ownership on the additional lands that will be necessary for the carrying out of its said railway line, as figuring on the above-mentioned plans;\nWhereas under the above-mentioned Order in Council no. 599, the Minister has been authorized to sign and execute in favour of said railway company, a deed of transfer and conveyance of the rights of property on and upon all said lands.\nNow, therefore, it has been agreed and covenanted as follows, by and between the parties hereto:\u2014\nFor the above purposes, the Minister does hereby by these presents, transfer and convey in full ownership, subject to the reservation clause hereinafter mentioned, unto the railway company, hereto present and accepting, for itself, its successors and assigns the following parcels of land, to wit:\u2014\nThen follows a description of the lands granted.\nIt sufficiently appears from this, and, indeed, it is not disputed that, at the date of the grant, the land affected by it was in possession of the railway company, that their railway had been constructed upon it, and that they were occupying it as their right of way. Under section 189 of the Railway Act, by consent of the Governor in Council, a Dominion railway company may take possession of Crown lands for the purposes of its right of way. That section prohibits the company taking possession of, using or occupying any lands vested in the Crown without such consent; and it must be assumed that consent was obtained. It has now been settled by a decision of this Court (Reference re s. 189, Railway Act)[6], affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on appeal[7], that this section embraces the Crown lands of a province. It follows that the railway company was lawfully in occupation of these lands as part of the site of its railway at the date of the grant, and the grant must be construed, therefore, in relation to that circumstance.\nTurning now to the pertinent provisions of the Quebec statutes. Section 24 of chapter 44 (R.S.Q. 1925) is thus expressed:\n24. With the exception of lands subject to the Mining Act (chap. 80) the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may, when he deems it expedient, fix the price per acre of public lands, and the terms and conditions of sale and of settlement and payment.\nIt was not seriously disputed at bar, and we have no doubt upon the point that, by this section, combined with the provisions of chapter 43, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is empowered to authorize the Minister of Crown lands for the province to convey to a Dominion railway company lands required by that company for use as its right of way upon such terms and conditions as may be decided upon by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. We do not doubt that, in virtue of this power, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may convey lands in absolute ownership without any reservation of any description in respect of highways.\nComing to the grant itself. The grant in our opinion sufficiently evidences an intention that the title of the railway company shall be affected by no reservation in respect of highways.\nThe answer to the first and second questions is:\nThe title of the railway company to the lands in question is not subject to any reservation in respect of highways.\nAs to the fourth question. It appears from the stated case that in fact a re-hearing was directed. We have no doubt of the jurisdiction of the Board under section 51 to give such a direction and to proceed with the re-hearing.\nThe fourth question is answered in the affirmative.\nThere will be no order as to costs.\n[1] (1936) 45 Can.

Alan Maclean for the appellant.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff, the Attorney-General of British Columbia, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] , affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson[4] which dismissed the plaintiff's motion for judgment upon admissions made in the pleadings. In the action the plaintiff claimed a certain sum of money on deposit with the Royal Bank of Canada standing in the name of Island Amusement Company, Limited, as bona vacantia. The courts below, with Mr. Justice Martin dissenting in the Court of Appeal, have disallowed this claim, and in my view they were correct in so doing.\nIsland Amusement Company, Limited, was incorporated in 1912 under the British Columbia Companies Act then in force. In 1917 the company went into voluntary liquidation and one A. S. Innis was appointed liquidator. On October 25th, 1928, the Registrar of Companies struck the company off the Register of Companies in pursuance of section 167 of the Companies Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, chapter 38, for failure on the part of the liquidator to make the returns required by the Act. This action of the Registrar followed the publication in the British Columbia Gazette of the required notice, and in accordance with subsection 4 of section 167 of the Act, the Registrar published notice of the striking of the company off the register, and according to the same subsection, upon the latter publication, the company was \" dissolved.\" It will be necessary to revert to the provisions of the 1924 Act in order to determine the meaning and effect of this dissolution.\nOn July 2nd, 1933, Mr. Innis, the liquidator, died. Some time before the making of an order, April 5th, 1935, by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the Crown made a claim to the moneys on deposit with the Royal Bank of Canada standing in the name of the company. No explanation is forthcoming as to how this deposit had been overlooked by the liquidator and those interested in the company. The order referred to was made on the appli- cation of three shareholders of the company pursuant to the terms of the Companies Act then in force, being chapter 11 of the British Columbia Statutes of 1929. That order is as follows:\nUpon the application of Bernard Sigismund Heisterman, Joseph Eil-beck Wilson, and Joseph Charles Bridgman, members of the above-named company, by petition dated the 28th day of March, 1935, and upon hearing the solicitor for the applicants, and upon reading the affidavits of the said Bernard Sigismund Heisterman and of William Henry Langley, respectively, both filed herein, and it appearing that the Registrar of Companies does not oppose such application:\nIt is ordered that the name of the above-named Island Amusement Company Limited, be restored to the Register of Companies for a period of one year from the date of its restoration to said Register for the purpose of enabling the company to be wound up voluntarily, and that pursuant to the Companies Act the company shall be deemed to have continued in existence as if its name had never been struck off, without prejudice, however, to the rights of any parties which may have been acquired prior to the date on which the company is restored to the register.\nAnd it is ordered that the time within which an office copy of this order shall be filed with the Registrar of Companies and his lawful requirements (if any) in respect to the company fulfilled shall be thirty days from the date of this order.\nWhile this order does not so state, we were informed that counsel for the Attorney-General of British Columbia appeared on the motion although we were also informed that the order was issued without having been approved by him.\nOn June 10th, the Attorney-General, suing on behalf of His Majesty the King in the right of His Province of British Columbia, brought action against the Royal Bank of Canada for a declaration that the money on deposit in the bank to the credit of Island Amusement Company, Limited, was bona vacantia and had been ever since October 25th, 1928, the date on which the company was struck off the register, and for an order directing the bank to pay to the plaintiff the said money. On June 19th, 1935, on the application of the defendant bank, it was ordered that the company be joined as a party defendant in the action. As the company was without a liquidator, no appearance was entered for the added defendant. On November 15th, 1935, the plaintiff's motion for judgment was dismissed and the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. The appeal first came before that court on January 24th, 1936, and then again on January 29th, May 14th, June 26th and October 13th. At some date prior to November 4th, 1936, when judgment was delivered by the Court of Appeal, a new order was made under the Companies Act, 1929, and while this order does not appear in the case, we were informed that it was made in terms similar to the order of April 5th, 1935. The Court of Appeal had found it impossible to determine the real matter in dispute by reason of the fact that Island Amusement Company, Limited, was not represented but by agreement, after a new liquidator had been appointed, the company was represented by counsel before the Court of Appeal, which counsel adopted the argument that had already been advanced on behalf of the defendant bank. The members of the court were unanimous that the appeal should be allowed as against the Royal Bank, and an order was made for payment of the money into court by the bank. As against the Island Amusement Company, Limited, the appeal was dismissed, and it was ordered that the money was the property of that company. Mr. Justice Martin dissented as to the latter provision, being of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed in its claim.\nWhat is the nature of a claim to bona vacantia? This matter was discussed at length by the Court of Appeal in England in In re Sir Thomas Spencer Wells[5] , where it was held that the doctrine of bona vacantia extended to leaseholds, and that the equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises there in question passed to the Crown as bona vacantia on the dissolution of the company. It was pointed out in the judgment of Lord Hanworth, the Master of the Rolls, at page 43[6] :\nThe principle under which the Crown takes bona vacantia is badly stated in the argument of the Attorney-General in Middleton v. Spicer[7] : \"The King is the owner of everything which has no other owner.\"\nThe Master of the Rolls further pointed out that that view was accepted by Lord Thurlow in his judgment in that case and also by the Privy Council in Dyke v. Walford[8] . At page 49[9] , Lawrence L.J. quotes Blackstone's definition of \"bona vacantia \"as\" goods in which no one else can claim a property,\" and refers to the fact that\nthe expression \" goods\" in this definition has admittedly a larger significance that \" goods\" properly so-called and has long since been construed and accepted by the Court as extending to personal property of every kind. Romer L.J., at page 55[10] , states:\nIn my opinion it is established law that the Crown is entitled to all personal property that has no other owner,\nand on page 56 emphasizes the point\nthat the rule at common law is that property must belong to somebody and where there is no other owner, not where the owner is unknown, that is the distinction, it is the property of the Crown.\nThe exact point for determination in that case was as to the applicability of the doctrine of bona vacantia to an equity of redemption in mortgaged leasehold premises. The company had been dissolved and there were no enactments in question, such as we have in the instant case.\nThe actual decision in Russian and English Bank and Florence Montefiore Guedalla v. Baring Brothers and Company[11] , does not assist on the point that arises for determination here. The head-note of the report correctly sets forth the decision:\u2014\nA foreign company which after carrying on business in this country has been dissolved in the country of its incorporation may, notwithstanding its dissolution in that country, be wound up as an unregistered company under s. 338, ss. 1 and 2, of the Companies Act, 1929, although the dissolution took place before the passing of that Act; and, with the leave of the Registrar in Companies Winding-up, on the instruction of the liquidator with the approval of the committee of inspection, an action may be brought in the name of the foreign company to recover sums which at the date of its dissolution were due to the company and unpaid.\nSo held by Lord Blanesburgh, Lord Atkin and Lord Macmillan, Lord Russell of Killowen and Lord Maugham dissenting.\nAt the conclusion of the report appears this note:\u2014\nOrder appealed from reversed: Ordered that the stay of proceedings be recalled and that the action be allowed to proceed, and that the respondents do pay to the appellants their costs in the Court of Appeal and in this House.\nFrom this it appears that the only point decided was that the action might be brought in the name of the company.\nAt page 422, Lord Blanesburgh states:\u2014\nI would only add, by way of a general observation, that any difficulties in this liquidation will, I doubt not, be met as they arise. It will be open to the Court completely to control the liquidator at every step. In the present action the Court will doubtless be vigilant to see that no order possibly affecting either the Attorney-General on behalf of the Crown or the Soviet Government is made without due notice to each.\nLord Atkin in his speech, at page 426, states that:\u2014\nOn the assumption adopted by the judgments under appeal *** there is the further difficulty that all that which had been the moveable property of the company has become vested in the Crown as bona vacantia. And later, on the same page, in discussing the effect of the judgments under review, he points out:\u2014\nWhat has been the property of the company now belongs to a third person, the Crown, and there is no power to vest the property of a third person in the liquidator;\nbut, on the assumption Lord Atkin preferred to adopt,\nthe Crown acquired a defeasible title defeated upon the making of a winding-up order.\nLord Macmillan, the third member of the House, who concurred in allowing the appeal, refers at page 439 to sections 294 to 296 of the Act there in question and pointed out that the provisions of section 296 as to the property of a dissolved company becoming bona vacantia were in his view, inapplicable to the Russian and English Bank case[12] .\nBut (he continues), if the assets of the bank on its dissolution become bona vacantia, either at common law or by statute, the Attorney-General on behalf of the Crown was present when the winding-up order was pronounced and in acquiescing in that order he must be taken to have had in view all its consequences, including the consequence that it would involve the effective collection and distribution of the assets which belonged to the company.\nI must confess that, with respect, I find it difficult to follow this last statement since the report of the decision on the petition for a winding-up order, In re Russian and English Bank[13] , shows, at page 666, that the Crown took the position that \" the Court has no power to accede to the present petition,\" and further,\nin the present case the Crown has a claim to the goods as bona vacantia if it is able to obtain possession of them.\nHowever, I have referred to these extracts from the speeches of their Lordships who, comprising the majority, allowed the appeal, merely to show that each one took a different view as to the possible claim of the Crown to bona vacantia.\nOf the dissenting Judges, Lord Russell of Killowen, at page 434, states :\nThe property which it owned in this country thereupon became the property of the Crown,\nand Lord Maugham at page 444 :\nIt would seem that unless the Crown waives its claim to the assets in question (as in the case of In re Hendersons' Nigel Co.[14] there will be no assets available for distribution. In the absence of the Crown I do not wish to be taken as expressing a final opinion on this question, but it seems to me to suggest a further difficulty in the way of the nominal plaintiff. Except, therefore, for such assistance as may be gleaned from the expressions of opinion of their Lordships in the Russian and English Bank case[15] , it would appear that one must find the solution to the problem in this appeal from a consideration of the extent of the doctrine of bona vacantia and of the sections of the Act itself. The case of The King v. Attorney-General of British Columbia[16] , affords no guide since, as remarked by Lord Sumner at page 215:\u2014\nAll that need be noted about the actual subject-matter of the dispute is that as the parties have admitted it to be in itself bona vacantia, their Lordships have proceeded on the footing of this admission inter partes to consider the right to it.\nAnd accordingly, on the basis of that admission, it was determined that bona vacantia are \" royalties \" within section 109 of the British North America Act, 1867, and belong to the Province and not to the Dominion. In view of the admission in that case, it is not important to consider how the company referred to in the proceedings had been dissolved.\nThe applicants for incorporation of Island Amusement Company, Limited, had filed a memorandum of association with the Registrar of Companies, and under the provisions of the Companies Act in force at that time, the company became incorporated upon the Registrar retaining and registering the memorandum. It has already been mentioned that the company went into voluntary liquidation in 1917 and thereupon it became the duty of the liquidator, from time to time, to make returns to the Registrar, and it was for failure in this respect that on October 25th, 1928, the Registrar struck the company off the register.\nSection 167 (R.S.B.C., 1924, chapter 38) which is the section under which the Registrar acted, appears in Part IX of the Act which deals with \"Dissolution.\" The first division of this Part is headed \"Cancellation of Incorporation \" and section 166, which is the only section in that division, empowers the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to revoke and cancel the incorporation of a company and declare the company to be dissolved. The second division, headed \"Removal from Register of Companies in Default or Defunct,\" comprises sections 167 to 171 dealing with failures to file certain returns. The third division is headed \"Winding up,\" and it is interesting to note that by section 233 provision is made for the dissolution of a company at the expiration of three months from the receipt by the Registrar of Companies of a return showing how the property of the company had been disposed of. We are not concerned with the dissolution provided for by sections 166 or 233 but with the dissolution under section 167. That section (the underlining is mine) is as follows:\n167. (1) Where a company or an extra-provincial company has failed to file any return, notice, or document required to be filed with the Registrar pursuant to this Act or any former Companies Act for two consecutive years after the return, notice, or document should have been so filed, or the Registrar has reasonable cause to believe that a company or extra-provincial company is not carrying on business or in operation, he shall send to the company by post a registered letter notifying it of its default or inquiring whether the company is carrying on business or in operation.\n(2) If within one month of sending the letter no reply thereto is received by the Registrar, or the company fails to fulfil the lawful requirements of the Registrar, or notifies the Registrar that it is not carrying on business or in operation, he may, at the expiration of a further fourteen days, publish in the Gazette a notice that at the expiration of two months from the date of that notice the company mentioned therein will, unless cause is shown to the contrary, be struck off the register, and the company will be dissolved, or, in the case of an extra-provincial company, will be deemed to have ceased to carry on business in the province.\n(3) In any case where a company or extra-provincial company is being wound up, if the Registrar has reasonable cause to believe that no liquidator is acting or that the affairs of the company are fully wound up, or if the returns required to be made by the liquidator have not been made for a period of three consecutive months, after notice by the Registrar demanding the returns has been sent by post to the registered office of the company, or, in the case of an extra-provincial company, to the attorney of the company under Part VIII, and to the liquidator at his last-known place of business, the Registrar may publish in the Gazette a like notice as is provided in subsection (2).\n(4) At the expiration of the time mentioned in the notice, and also in any case where a company has by resolution requested the Registrar to strike it off the register, and has filed with him a statutory declaration of two or more directors proving that the company has no debts or liabilities, the Registrar may, unless cause to the contrary is previously shown, strike the company off the register, and shall publish notice thereof in the Gazette, and on the publication in the Gazette of this notice the company shall be dissolved, or in the case of an extra-provincial company, shall be deemed to have ceased to carry on business in the province: Provided that the liability (if any) of every director, manager, officer, and member of the company shall continue and may be enforced as if the company had not been struck off the register.\nAt the time the restoring order of April 5th, 1935, was secured, the Companies Act in force was chapter 11 of the statutes of 1929, sections 199 and 200 of which are as follows (the underlining again being mine):\u2014\n199. (1) Where a company or an extra-provincial company or any member or creditor thereof is aggrieved by the company having been struck off the register, the Court, on the application of the company or member or creditor, may subject to section 200 and if satisfied that the company was at the time of the striking off carrying on business or in operation, or otherwise that it is just that the company be restored to the register, order the company to be restored to the register, and thereupon the company shall be deemed to have continued in existence, or in the case of an extra-provincial company, to be a company registered under Part VII, as if it had not been struck off.\nProvided that the Court shall not make an order:\n(a) In the case of a company formed for the purposes of a club, without the written consent of the Attorney-General; or\n(b) In the case of a company struck off the register at its own request without the written consent of the Registrar; or\n(c) In the case of a public company incorporated before the first day of July, 1910, without the written consent of the Registrar.\n(2) Where the period fixed for the duration of a company expired before the first day of September, 1921, without a grant of perpetual existence having been obtained by the company under any Act in that behalf, an application to restore the company to the register may nevertheless be made under this section, and if the Court makes an order restoring the company, the company shall be deemed to have been granted perpetual existence as from the date when its time of existence expired, but no member of the company shall be liable for anything done between the time when the company ceased to exist and the date of the order, unless he has consented in writing to the application under this section to restore the company.\n(3) A company may for the purposes of its restoration to the register hold such meetings and take such proceedings as may be necessary as if the company had not been dissolved, or in the case of an extra-provincial company as if the company were registered under Part VII, R.S. 1924, c. 38, s. 168.\n200. (1) The Court may make an order restoring a company to the register for a limited period or for the purpose of carrying out a particular purpose, and after the expiration of that period or the execution of that purpose the company shall forthwith be struck off the register by the Registrar.\n(2) The Court may by an order restoring a company to the register give such directions and make such provisions as seem just for placing the company and all other persons in the same position as nearly as may be as if the company had not been struck off, but, unless the Court otherwise orders, the order shall be made without prejudice to the rights of parties acquired prior to the date on which the company is restored by the Registrar.\n(3) The Court shall not make an order restoring a company to the register, unless notice of the application, together with a copy of the petition and any document filed in support thereof with the Court, has been sent to the Registrar, and, except where the application is for an order under subsection (1), notice of the application has also been advertised in two issues of the Gazette.\n(4) The Court shall by the order restoring a company to the register fix a time within which an office copy of the order shall be filed with the Registrar and his lawful requirements (if any) in respect of the company fulfilled, and may extend such time, but no order shall take effect until an office copy is so filed and such lawful requirements are so fulfilled; and when the office copy is so filed and such lawful requirements are fulfilled, the Registrar shall issue under his seal of office a certificate that the company is restored to the register.\n(5) Where the application is not made within one year from the date on which the company was struck off, and another company or extra-provincial company has been incorporated or registered, as the case may be, under the same or a similar name, and the Registrar objects to the restoration of the company to the register under its own name, the Court shall by the order provide that the company be restored under another name approved by the Registrar in writing and the order shall, subject to subsection (4), take effect in the same manner as if the company had changed its name and the Registrar had issued a certificate thereof in accordance with this Act, but in the case of an extra-provincial company the Court shall not make an order unless the company has changed or undertakes to change its name in accordance with its charter and regulations, but this provision shall not apply to a Dominion company.\n(6) The expression \"lawful requirements\" in subsection (4) shall, in addition to any requirement of this Act, be deemed to authorize the Registrar to require a public company incorporated before the first day of July, 1910, to comply with sections 40 or 41 before it carries on business, and to require a company any of whose shares are of a nominal or par value of less than fifty cents for each share to consolidate and divide such shares into shares of a nominal or par value of not less than fifty cents for each share. R.S. 1924, c. 38, s. 168.\nWhile the order restored the company to the register for a limited period and for a particular purpose, it seems plain that in determining the effect of the order regard must be had to the provisions of section 199 as well as the provisions of section 200.\nFirstly, it is only section 199 which refers to those who may apply for an order.\nSecondly, by subsection 3 of section 200 the court is not to make an order restoring a company to the register unless notice of the application has been sent to the Registrar and except where the application is for an order under subsection 1 notice of the application has also been advertised in two issues of the Gazette. The part underlined contains the provision for notice of the application appearing in the Gazette but excepts therefrom the case where an application is for an order under subsection 1 of section 200. Thirdly, the provisions of subsections 4 and 5 must refer as well to a general order made under section 199 as to an order under subsection 1 of section 200 when it is borne in mind that the powers of the court to restore companies to the register were given in the Act of 1924 (chapter 38) in one section, 168.\nReading these sections together, therefore, the effect of the order was, as stated in subsection 1 of section 199, that\nthereupon the company shall be deemed to have continued in existence *** as if it had not been struck off.\nThe enactment in subsection 2 of section 200 that\nunless the Court otherwise orders, the order shall be made without prejudice to the rights of parties acquired prior to the date on which the company is restored by the Registrar,\nwhen read in the light of the terms of section 199 that \" the company shall be deemed to have continued in existence\" causes no difficulty as I have concluded that the making of the order in 1928, striking the company from the register, never gave the Crown a right to the money as bona vacantia. (It should be added that the insertion in the order restoring the company to the register, of the \"without prejudice \" clause adds nothing to the effect of subsection 2 of section 200.)\nSuch a right arises only when there is no other owner, and how can it be said that the money on deposit was without an owner when the company was not really dead for all purposes? By subsection 1 of section 199, the company itself may apply for the order, and by subsection 3 the company\nmay for the purposes of its restoration to the register hold such meetings and take such proceedings as may be necessary as if the company had not been dissolved ***\nAdded to which is the explicit statement as to the effect of the order.\nThis view is strengthened by a perusal of the earlier legislation. In 1910 the Companies Act appeared as chapter 7, and section 265 thereof provides that where a company has failed for any period of two years to send or file any return, notice or document required to be made or filed or sent to the Registrar pursuant to this Act, or the Registrar has reasonable cause to believe that such company is not carrying on business or in operation, he shall send an inquiry as to whether such company is carrying on business or in operation and notifying it of its default (if any). By subsection 2, if within one month no reply to such letter is received, etc., the Registrar may at the expiration of another fourteen days publish in the Gazette and send to such company a notice that at the expiration of two months the name of such company will, unless cause is shown to the contrary, be struck off the register and the company will be dissolved. By subsection 3, at the expiration of the time mentioned in such last-mentioned notice, the Registrar shall, unless cause to the contrary is previously shown by such company, strike the name of such company off the register and shall publish notice thereof in the Gazette for one month, and on such last-mentioned publication the company shall be dissolved.\nBy subsection 4\nif any such company or a member or creditor thereof feels aggrieved by the name of such company having been struck off the register in pursuance of this section, the company or member or creditor may before the completion of the last-mentioned publication apply to the Court;\nand the court may order the name of the company to be restored to the register\nand thereupon the company shall be deemed to have continued in existence as if the name thereof had never been struck off.\nBy subsection 6:\u2014\n(6) Where a company is being wound up, and the Registrar has reasonable cause to believe either that no liquidator is acting or that the affairs of the company are fully wound up and the returns required to be made by the liquidator have not been made for a period of three consecutive months, after notice by the Registrar demanding the returns has been sent by post to the registered address of the company and to the liquidator at his last known place of business, the provisions of this section shall apply in like manner as if the Registrar had not within one month after sending the letter first mentioned received any answer thereto.\nIt seems therefore that subsection 2 and the other subsections would then apply so that in the case of a winding up, as well as other cases where default occurred, the company or member or creditor were obliged to apply to the court, before the completion of the month's notice in the Gazette, giving notice that the name of the company had been struck off the register. That is, under the Act of 1910 the court was empowered to act on an application to restore the company to the register only if such application were made within the time limited.\nThen came the revision in the Revised Statutes of 1911, chapter 39, in which section 268 replaced section 265 of the 1910 Act except for an unimportant amendment made in 1911. In 1913, by chapter 10, section 21, an important change was made. Subsection 4 of section 268 of the 1910 Act was repealed and a new subsection inserted. By it the application to the court could be made at any time but the new subsection provided that if the application was not made within one year any other company might change its name to the same or a similar name, etc. Subsection 3 was left as it was and it is that subsection which provides that the Registrar shall at a certain period strike the name of the company off the register and publish notice thereof in the Gazette for one month\nand on such last-mentioned publication the company *** shall be dissolved.\nThen in 1921, by chapter 10, these provisions were removed from Part IX of the 1911 Act, headed \"Winding up,\" of which Part section 268 was the last, and incorporated in Part IX of the Companies Act, which Part is headed \"Dissolution.\" Division I is headed \"Cancellation of Incorporation \"; Division II is headed \"Removal from Register of Companies in Default or Defunct,\" and Division III is headed \"Winding up.\" The important provisions are separated and appear in two sections, 167 and 168.\nThe amendments to the 1921 Act, by 1921 (Second Session), chapter 8, section 4, and by 1922, chapter 11 section 22, are not important. Then came R.S.B.C., 1924, chapter 38, sections 167 and 168, under the first of which the company was on October 25th, 1928, struck from the register.\nIt will, therefore, be seen that the legislature removed the time limit within which an application might be made to the court to restore the name of the company to the register, but the effect of any order so made was as it always was that\nthereupon the company shall be deemed to have continued in existence as if the name thereof had never been struck off.\nThe effect of the removal order of October 25th, 1928, was by the terms of section 167 of the Act then in force (R.S.B.C., 1924, chapter 38) that the company was struck from the register and \" dissolved.\" In view of the provisions of section 168, which would apply to any order of the court restoring the company to the register, made while that Act was in operation, and of sections 199 and 200 of the relevant Act of 1929, can it be said that the \" dissolu- tion \" was an end of the company for all purposes, and particularly for the purpose of the applicant's contention that the money on deposit in the bank ceased to have an owner, so as to permit the operation of the doctrine of bona vacantia? I conclude that the answer must be in the negative and that is sufficient to dispose of the present appeal.\nCounsel for the appellant, however, referred to the Escheats Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, chapter 81, as amended. The amendment of 1924, chapter 18, section 2, added section 3 (a) to the Act. Subsection 1 of section 3 (a) provides that where a corporation is dissolved, the lands, tenements and hereditaments, etc., shall for all purposes be deemed to escheat to the Crown in right of the province. By subsection 2 of section 3 (a) the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall not within one year from the date of the dissolution of the corporation make any grant or other disposition of escheated lands. By subsection 3 of section 3 (a) where a corporation is within one year from its dissolution revived pursuant to any Act, by order of any court, the order shall have effect as if the lands, etc., had not escheated, and subject to the terms of the order such lands, etc., shall ipso facto vest in the corporation.\nSection 7 of the Escheats Act as amended by section 3 of 1924, chapter 18, reads as follows, the words underlined being those which were inserted by the amendment:\u2014\n7. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make any assignment of personal property to which the Crown is entitled by reason of the person last entitled thereto having died intestate and without leaving any kin or other persons entitled to succeed thereto, or by reason of the same having become vested in the Crown as bona vacantia, or by reason of the same having become forfeited to the Crown, or may make an assignment of any portion of such personal property, for the purpose of transferring or restoring the same to any person or persons having a legal or moral claim upon the person to whom the same had belonged, or for carrying into effect any disposition thereof which such person may have contemplated, or of rewarding the person making discovery of the right of the Crown to such property, as to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may seem meet.\nWhile section 3 (a) deals with escheats, counsel adduced from its provisions the argument that the legislature having therein made definite provision for the case of a company being revived within one year of its dissolution and no similar provision having been made in section 7 referring to personal property to which the Crown is entitled, \"by reason of the same having become vested in the Crown as bona vacantia,\" the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, under the last section, is the only authority to determine the disposition of the money. However, for the reasons already given, I am of opinion that this money never was, under the circumstances, bona vacantia. On the proper constructions of sections 199 and 200 of the 1929 Act the doctrine of bona vacantia does not apply so as to include money of a company which, while \" dissolved,\" cannot be taken to be dead for all purposes when, by the very Part of the Act that refers to dissolution, provision is also made for an order of revivor, with the consequence that the company is deemed to have continued in existence as if it had not been struck off.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. When the matter first came on for argument before us no one appeared for the Island Amusement Company, Limited, and the hearing was adjourned to give an opportunity to the appellant to arrange that the company should be represented by counsel so that we might have the benefit of his argument. In view of this, we deem it unnecessary to make any order as to the costs of this appeal.\nDAVIS J.\u2014There can be no doubt of the right of the Crown to the personal property of an incorporated company which has become extinct by complete and effective dissolution and in this case we may well ask ourselves at the outset the question whether upon the proper construction of the statute under which the company was incorporated and under whose provisions its name was stricken from, and subsequently restored to, the register, there was at the time the company was stricken from the register an absolute and complete, or merely a qualified, dissolution because while section 167, which provides the machinery for the Registrar to strike a defaulting company from the register, says \" and the company will be dissolved,\" section 199 enables the company subsequently to apply to the court for an order restoring it to the register and for the purposes of its restoration, to hold such meetings and take such proceedings as may be necessary as if the company had not been dissolved, and expressly enacts that upon the order being made\nthe company shall be deemed to have continued in existence as if it had not been struck off (the register).\nCunnack v. Edwards[17] was the case of an unincorporated society, under the protection of the Friendly Societies Acts, which had lasted for nearly ninety years but had then become extinct. All the members were dead but a remnant of the common fund amounting to something over \u20a41,200 remained. Chitty J. held that there was a resulting trust in favour of the personal representatives of those who had contributed to the fund but the Court of Appeal (Lord Halsbury L.C., A. L. Smith and Rigby L. JJ.) were all of the opinion that that view could not be maintained because the entire beneficial interest had been exhausted in respect of each contributor and the funds were bona vacantia and belonged to the Crown in that character. That case is easy to understand because all the members of the unincorporated society had been natural persons and they were all dead.\nIn re Higginson and Dean ex parte The Attorney-General[18] was the case of a corporation created by statute that had proved in the bankruptcy of a trading firm, along with other creditors. The corporation subsequently was dissolved by an order of the court under the Companies Act. Afterwards it was discovered that the bankrupts had been entitled to certain railways shares and the official receiver recovered the value of the shares and held the proceeds as trustee in the bankruptcy. Another creditor moved to expunge the proof of the dissolved corporation, claiming that the money to which the corporation had been entitled as a creditor, and which was then in the hands of the official receiver as trustee, was divisible among the still existing creditors. The county court judge made an order expunging the proof. On appeal by the Attorney-General on behalf of the Treasury, it was held by the court (Wright and Darling JJ.) reversing the order, that on the dissolution of the corporation the proceeds of the shares in the hands of the official receiver as trustee in the bankruptcy had passed to the Crown as bona vacantia, and the Crown was entitled to the amount. But the cor- poration there was treated as one \"who has become extinct without successor or representative.\" R. S. Wright J. at p. 331 said that in the 17th and 18th centuries corporations aggregate, constituted by charters or letters patent, were numerous and questions frequently occurred as to the effect upon their rights and obligations of dissolution, revival and reincorporation, with or without change of name or constitution.\nI cannot find that in any case the rights or obligations of a corporation were held to be affected by a technical dissolution. Nor, on the other hand, can I find a case in which such a question has been decided, where the corporation had not been revived, or some provision made by statute or charter with reference to its obligations. In Mayor, &c., of Colchester v. Seaber[19] , the revived corporation sued in its own name on a bond given to the dissolved corporation, and succeeded. Sir Fletcher Norton, for the plaintiff corporation, argued that the goods and chattels of the old corporation, including its choses in action such as the bond, had on its dissolution passed to the Crown, and that the Crown in granting a charter of revival had regranted them to the revived corporation. Mr. Dunning, on the other side, neither admitted nor denied this, and the Court is not reported to have expressed any opinion on this point, it being held that there was only a qualified dissolution, and no absolute break of continuity.\nIn The King v. Pasmore[20] Lord Kenyon speaks of a corporation being dissolved \" to certain purposes \" and in considering very old cases goes on to say that\nby the new charter the King did not consider the old corporation as dissolved \" to all purposes.\"\nLord Maugham (Maugham J. as he then was) in In re Home and Colonial Insurance Company Limited[21] , says that it was settled by the decision in In re Higginson and Dean[22] that \" on a company being dissolved in the strict sense \" the whole of its assets undistributed at the date of dissolution passed to the Crown as bona vacantia.\nLord Macmillan in The Russian and English Bank case[23] , said:\nNow the purpose of pronouncing a winding-up order is to secure the collection and distribution of the assets of the company to which it relates. The logical inquirer may ask how a company which has ceased to exist can have any assets. But when the Legislature authorized the making of a winding-up order in the case of a dissolved company it must be presumed to have intended such order to be effective and to result in the collection and distribution of assets. To hold that the Legislature has authorized the collection of the assets of a dissolved company, but has withheld the power of recovering these assets, would be to attribute a singular ineptitude to Parliament.\nAnd again at p. 438:\nThe truth is that the whole procedure is highly artificial. Once it is conceded, as it must be, that a non-existent company may be the subject of a winding-up order it is inevitable that anomalous consequences must ensue, some of which may not have been foreseen by the Legislature.\nSection 167 of the British Columbia statute permits the Registrar of Companies to strike off the register any company which has failed to\nfile any return or notice or document required to be filed with the Registrar.\nThe language is sufficiently comprehensive to include defaults of the slightest nature-for instance, mere omission to make some annual or other return called for by the Act. Having regard to the provisions of the entire statute, the dissolution referred to in section 167 necessarily excludes in my opinion \" a general dissolution,\" to adopt the term used by Lindley on Companies, 6th ed., p. 821. The company does not \"become extinct without successor or representative,\" to use the words of Wright J. in the Higginson case[24] . The statute plainly negatives a complete dissolution whereby the company becomes extinct because the statute clearly recognizes that subsequent to the dissolution referred to in section 167 the company itself may apply to the court to be restored and for that purpose may hold meetings and take proceedings as if it had not been dissolved. In that view of the statute there was no such dissolution of the company in this case as to entitle the Crown to acquire ownership of the money on deposit at the bank as against the company and its creditors.\nBut assuming that we are not entitled to regard the dissolution under section 167 as anything but a real and effective dissolution that in itself entitled the Crown to the personal property of the corporation; as property having no other owner, the subsequent order of the court restoring the company to the register enjoins us to treat the company, \"in the words of the statute,\" as if it had \"continued in existence \" and \" had not been struck off.\" In that view it might be held that the Crown acquired at the time the company was stricken off the register title to the personal property of the company as bona vacantia subject to being defeated upon the subsequent making of a restoration order. But personally I find it exceedingly difficult, dealing with the matter as one of practical administration, to think of the Crown's right to ownership of goods in the character of bona vacantia in terms of a qualified or defeasible title. It appears to me to be a contradiction in terms to regard the property of a company as being without an owner and at the same time to recognize the possibility that at some undefined period of time in the future the corporation may be revived and the title of the Crown defeated.\nIt is argued on behalf of the Crown, however, that on the assumption that the dissolution can be set aside and the Crown's claims defeated, the order of the court in this particular case preserved the Crown's right by the provision in the order that the company should be restored and continued in existence as if its name had never been struck off,\nwithout prejudice, however, to the rights of any parties which might have been acquired prior to the date on which the company is restored to the register.\nBut when one considers the scheme of the statute as a whole and the various methods provided for the final winding up of a company (a) by voluntary winding up, or (b) by a court order in winding-up proceedings, and the provisions of the statute for the effectual collection of the assets and the distribution of them among the creditors and the final certificate to the Registrar of winding up whereby the company becomes ultimately dissolved (in the strict sense I take it of the word) in contradistinction to the dissolution referred to in section 167 (which precedes the special machinery set up for reviving the company and the carrying out of its liquidation in the ordinary course), it becomes apparent that the without prejudice clause in the statute, and which is found in the order restoring the respondent company, is intended to preserve legitimate claims of third parties which have arisen subsequent to the date that the company was stricken off the register because officers and agents of the company may not have heard of the striking of the name of the company from the register and may have gone ahead for some time carrying on the operations of the company in absolute good faith without notice or knowledge that the Registrar had stricken the name of the company off the register. That I believe is a fair interpretation to be put upon the without prejudice clause. I cannot bring myself to the view urged upon us that those words, properly construed, apply to such a claim as the claim of the Crown under the rule of bona vacantia.\nLord Blanesburgh in Morris v. Harris[25] in the House of Lords observed the apparent reason for the difference in phraseology and effect between section 223 and subsection 6 of section 242 in the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908:\nA dissolution under sec. 242, as I have said, is preceded by no winding-up, and the section had to envisage a dissolution which might have taken place without the knowledge of any one concerned in the company. Hence the wide powers given to the Court by subsection 6. Section 223, on the other hand, is confined to cases where the dissolution succeeds the complete winding up of the company's affairs and cannot take effect at all except at the instance or with the knowledge of the liquidator, the company's only executive officer. The Legislature has not seen fit to make provision for validating any intermediate acts done on behalf of such a company so dissolved.\nAdapting the language of Lord Blanesburgh to this case, the Legislature has seen fit in section 200 to make provision for validating any intermediate acts done on behalf of a company so dissolved. I cannot read the provision as intended to validate a vesting of all the personal property of the company in the Crown as a vesting which automatically took effect at the moment of the dissolution of the company under the provisions of section 167.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

Act, 1867, section 108, and third schedule\u2014Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 84, s. 19, 19 (b), 31\u2014Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170, ss. 164, 166, 215, 219, 220, 221, 222, 232,\u2014Chicoutimi Harbour Commissioners\u2019 Act, 1926, 16-17 Geo. V, c. 6.\nThe suppliant in his petition of right alleging to be the owner by letters patent from the province of Quebec of a certain water lot in the township of Chicoutimi and that the respondent entered into possession thereof, save for a small strip, for public purposes, claimed compensation for the land taken and for the damages suffered by such taking, to wit: $43,125. The respondent admitted the erection of a wharf on the property in question; but alleged that the suppliant was not the owner thereof, and that by virtue of section 108 of the British North America Act and its third schedule it formed part of the public domain of Canada in right of the Dominion, being, having been and forming part of a public harbour of the port of Chicoutimi in and before 1867. The province of Quebec intervened to support the letters patent issued by it to the suppliant, claiming that at such time it formed part of the public domain of the province. The Exchequer Court of Canada held that, from the evidence, the port of Chicoutimi was a public harbour in 1867 and previous thereto and it dismissed the suppliant\u2019s action and the intervention.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1936] Ex. C. 127), that, upon the evidence, there was no ground for judicially finding that the beach lot owned by the suppliant appellant was at the time of Confederation part of \u201ca public harbour\u201d within the contemplation of that term in the British North America Act.\u2014Without considering whether there was any \u201cpublic\u201d harbour within the meaning to be attributed to that term in the above Act, it is held that the beach lot in question became vested at Confederation in the province of Quebec, that the province had the right to convey it to the suppliant appellant as it did in 1897 and that therefore the latter is entitled to compensation in respect of the taking of the beach lot by the Dominion for the purpose of its public works.\u2014Without attempting to define strictly what sort of locality by its natural formation or constructed works may properly foe regarded as susceptible for use as a potential shelter for ships, it is obvious that there must be some physical characteristic distinguishing the location of a harbour from a place used merely for purposes of navigation; the mere fact that there are wharves and commercial activity along an open river cannot in itself constitute great stretches of the river a harbour. The provisions of the British North America Act dealing with harbours cannot have intended to include within the expression \u201charbour\u201d every little indentation or bay along the shores of all inland lakes and rivers as well as along the sea coast and the shores of the Great Lakes, where private owners had erected a wharf to which ships came to load or unload goods for commercial purposes.\nHeld, also, on the question of damages or compensation to be awarded to the suppliant appellant, that, although in view of this Court\u2019s decision on the first branch of the case the suppliant\u2019s action in the Exchequer Court of Canada on the petition of right should be treated, if a technical rule is applied, as an action in trespass and the damages assessed as in any other action in trespass, nevertheless the lands were virtually expropriated; and the Court is of the opinion that the proper course is to proceed to determine the amount of compensation to which the suppliant would have been entitled as if expropriation proceedings had been taken. The suppliant is entitled to recover besides the value of the lands, substantial damages for the severance of his property and the subsequent interference with his right of access to the river; but, in order to arrive at a fair amount of damages, the Court should have some evidence of what was the fair value to the suppliant of his estate at the time of the commencement of the construction of the public work complained of and of what is the fair value of the estate he has now after such construction. If the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission commence within one month expropriation proceedings, the compensation to the suppliant should be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Act, 1919, made applicable mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Chicoutimi Harbour Commissioners\u2019 Act; otherwise, a new trial should be held in the Exchequer Court of Canada limited to the ascertainment of the damages or compensation.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J.[1] dismissing a petition of right by the suppliant appellant, claiming compensation for land taken by the Dominion Government for public purposes and for damages suffered by such taking, which the suppliant appellant fixed at a sum of $43,125.\nThe material facts of this case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAt the first hearing of the appeal on May 1, 1936, the Court confined the argument to the question whether the lands of the suppliant appellant were part of a public harbour within the meaning of section 108 and the third schedule of the British North America Act, 1867, as property that passed at Confederation to the Dominion, leaving for later consideration, if necessary after the decision of this Court on that point, the question of damages or compensation to be awarded to this suppliant appellant.\nJ. A. Gagn\u00e9 K.C. for the suppliant appellant.\nLouis St-Laurent K.C. for the Attorney-General for Quebec.\nL. A. Pouliot K.C. and M. L. Beaulieu for the respondent.\nOn May 27, 1936, the Court made the following announcement:\nFor the information of the parties, we now announce our conclusion on the questions of right involved in this appeal before continuing the hearing of the argument on the question of damages.\nThe reasons of the judgment of the Court were delivered by\nDavis, J.\u2014Henri Jalbert, of the town of Chicoutimi, in the province of Quebec, claimed by petition of right against the King in the right of the Dominion of Canada, the sum of $43,125, alleging that he is the owner of a beach lot at Chicoutimi on the Saguenay River granted to him by letters patent of the province of Quebec dated June 16, 1907, and that he is the owner of other land of approximately 150 feet in width fronting on the Saguenay River and adjoining the beach lot at the rear thereof; that His Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada, acting through the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission incorporated by 16-17 Geo. V (1926), chapter 6, has taken possession of the greater portion of the beach lot, has demolished the appellant\u2019s private wharf thereon used by him in connection with his lumbering business, and has erected on the beach lot a part of public wharves and that the Commission has, by the erection of such works upon the said beach lot, destroyed the right of access to the river from the adjoining land lot. The respondent admits having taken possession of the greater portion of the beach lot where the works of the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission have been erected but claims, in so far as the beach lot is concerned, that this was part of the foreshore within an area that constituted a public harbour before July 1, 1867, and therefore became Grown land, in right of the Dominion of Canada, by virtue of section 108 of the British North America Act, and that the province of Quebec had no right to convey the land in 1907 to the appellant, and, in so far as the land is concerned, the respondent claimed that such land did not in fact border on the Saguenay river and that the appellant had no legal right of access therefrom to the Saguenay river but in any event that the appellant could use the new wharves built by the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission in front of the said land and that, in the alternative, the appellant consequently did not suffer any damages even if his land lot enjoyed a right of access to the river, which was denied, and further, that any damage that might have been suffered by the appellant in respect of the land lot was compensated by the increased value of such land due to the advantages afforded by the public works of the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission in front of the land. The respondent further alleged that the appellant had not obtained authorization from the Dominion Government to build the private wharf he had built on the beach lot as required by the provisions of the Navigable Waters\u2019 Protection Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 140, and that the appellant\u2019s private wharf upon the beach lot constituted an unauthorized work which the Minister of Marine and Fisheries under the Act could require to be removed or destroyed without compensation, and that in any event the claims of the appellant were grossly exaggerated.\nThe Attorney-General for the province of Quebec intervened in the case to support the validity of the letters patent granted by the province of Quebec in respect of the beach lot and alleged that the beach lot had become the property of the King, in right of the province of Quebec, at Confederation, that the letters patent granted to the appellant in 1907 were consequently legal, valid and operative and denied the plea of the respondent to the effect that the beach lot formed part of a public harbour at Confederation.\nThe action by petition of right was tried in the Exchequer Court of Canada by Mr. Justice Angers who dismissed the petition and intervention with costs, holding that the portion of the Saguenay river and foreshore where the beach lot is located formed a constituent part of a public harbour at the date of Confederation and became vested in the King in right of the Dominion of Canada. From that judgment the appellant appeals to this Court and the Attorney-General of the province of Quebec intervenes in support thereof.\nThe appeal raises again the important and difficult question as to what in point of fact is to be regarded as a \u201cpublic harbour\u201d within section 108 and the third schedule of the British North America Act. The beach lot is entirely on the foreshore between high and low water marks. In the early stages of the argument we stated that we would not hear or consider the matter of damages until we had disposed of the legal questions as to whether or not the appellant had acquired title to the beach lot by virtue of the letters patent granted to him by the province of Quebec and as to whether or not the appellant had any right of access from the land lot to the river that had been interfered with by the works of the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission.\nThe Saguenay river has a length of about seventy-five miles from its mouth at Tadoussac on the St. Lawrence river. It is a tidal and navigable river and at Chicoutimi is about half a mile in width. Chicoutimi was an early settlement and trading post located at the head of navigation on the river and as early as 1857 was an active trading centre with a population of about 1,000. It is plain upon the evidence that before Confederation there was considerable lumbering business carried on at that point and extensive trade and transportation by water. Ships and schooners came up and down the Saguenay river, some of the ocean vessels sailing to and from Europe. Chicoutimi became a place where ships came for the purpose of loading and unloading goods, especially lumber which was the principal industry, and there being no railroads, the entire trade of the community was carried on by water transportation. There is no necessity to review the evidence in detail as to the commercial user of the Saguenay river up as far as Chicoutimi long before Confederation. That fact is clearly established. What we are mostly concerned about in this appeal is whether or not there was at the specific location of what is now the appellant\u2019s land a harbour within the meaning of that word as found in the third schedule of the British North America Act. Unless the particular land was within the area of what was in fact a harbour before Confederation, there is no necessity for us to go farther to ascertain what is precisely involved in the words \u201cpublic harbours\u201d in the third schedule of the British North America Act in relation to section 108 of the Act which provides that\nthe public works and property of each province enumerated in the third schedule to this Act, shall be the property of Canada.\nIt is inexpedient to make general observations that may prejudice questions which may arise and come before us on other appeals, by any attempt to define strictly what sort of locality by its natural formation or constructed works may properly be regarded as susceptible for use as a potential shelter for ships. It is obvious that there must be some physical characteristic distinguishing the location of a harbour from a place used merely for purposes of navigation. The mere fact that there are wharves and commercial activity along an open river cannot in itself constitute great stretches of the river, a harbour. The provisions of the British North America Act dealing with harbours cannot have been intended to include within the expression \u201charbours\u201d every little indentation or bay along the shores of all the inland lakes and rivers as well as along the sea coast and the shores of the Great Lakes where private owners had erected a wharf to which ships came to load or unload goods for commercial purposes. Lord Dunedin in delivering the judgment in the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. Ritchie Contracting and Supply Company[2], said:\n\u201cPublic harbour\u201d means not merely a place suited by its physical characteristics for use as a harbour, but a place to which on the relevant date the public had access as a harbour, and which they had actually used for that purpose. In this connection the actual user of the site both in its character and extent is material.\nThe witnesses for the respondent located the limits of the harbour at Chicoutimi, as they termed it, as being from La Riviere du Moulin to the Basin, a distance of approximately two miles along the river shore. These witnesses gave evidence, and it is not in fact disputed, that there were three wharves along the river between these points; one at La Rivi\u00e8re du Moulin, another one farther up the river at Rat River, and a third still farther up the river at the Basin. Several maps and plans were put in at the trial but plan 13 is a very good indication of the Saguenay river, its width and meanderings, between La Rivi\u00e8re du Moulin and the Basin. Plan 11 shews the town of Chicoutimi as surveyed in 1845 by Ballantyne and the town site as then surveyed includes the area surrounding Rat River and the Basin. The appellant\u2019s land lot is part of lots 3 and 22 on the said plan, approximately 300 feet from the Rat river. Now in the stretch of the river from Riviere du Moulin to the Basin, the distance between Riviere du Moulin and Rat River is about a mile and a half, and the distance between Rat River and the Basin is somewhat less than half a mile. It is plain on the evidence that big ships, that is, three-masters, did not proceed farther up the Saguenay river than La Riviere du Moulin but that smaller ships and schooners did go up as far as Rat river and the Basin, anchoring out in the river. At the junction of Rat river with the Saguenay was situated in early days the business of a general merchant, Johnny Guay, often referred to in the evidence, who had a sawmill and wharf and carried on a general merchant\u2019s business at that point. In the Basin were located the wharves of the family of Price, who were pioneers in the lumbering business in that part of the province of Quebec. There were admittedly no public works or undertakings by the province along this stretch of the river, before Confederation. Now having regard to the natural formation of the river in this vicinity, can we say there was a single harbour\u2014from La Rivi\u00e8re du Moulin up to the Basin (a distance of some two miles) including the localities at the mouth of La Rivi\u00e8re du Moulin and at Rat river and at the Basin? Without laying down any criterion or test applicable to all cases I think we may safely say upon the evidence in this case that there is no solid ground for judicially finding that the small piece of land with which we are concerned in this appeal was within any harbour.\nIt is unnecessary in that view to consider whether there was any \u201cpublic\u201d harbour within the meaning to be attributed to that term in the British North America Act which transferred the public works and property of each province in public harbours to the Crown in the right of the Dominion, and we may conclude that the beach lot in question became vested at Confederation in the province of Quebec and that the province had the right to convey it to the appellant as it did in 1907. The appellant is therefore entitled to compensation in respect of the taking of the beach lot by the Dominion for the purpose of its public works.\nThere remains, apart from the ascertainment of damages, the question whether there was a right of access from the land lot, at the rear of the beach lot, to the river Saguenay and whether that right of access has been interfered with. The evidence leaves it perfectly plain that there was the right of access to the river from this land lot. A strip of land, about 40 feet in width, marked Street No. 1 on the Ballantyne plan of 1845, lying originally between the river and the land lot, was as a matter of fact never opened up as a street because in early days it disappeared by erosion and the river at high water came right up to the appellant\u2019s land lot. It is contended by the respondent that even if that is so, the appellant has now a right of access to the river across the public wharves erected in front of the property by the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission and has really suffered no damages in respect of interference, and, in any event, that the appellant\u2019s land has been increased in value by the advantages afforded by the new wharves of the Harbour Commission fronting on this land. All those matters, however, are matters to be considered in ascertaining the amount of damages.\nThe Court has for these reasons come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed but the learned trial judge unfortunately did not ascertain the damages, no doubt because of his conclusion that the suppliant was not entitled as a matter of law to any damages. Instead of sending the case back for the assessment of damages, the hearing of the appeal on the question of damages will be continued at the October sittings of the Court. On November 27, 1936, the Court heard the argument of the counsel for the suppliant appellant and the respondent on the question of damages or compensation claimed by the suppliant.\nJ. A. Gagn\u00e9 K.C. and B. Devlin K.C. for the suppliant appellant.\nL. A. Pouliot K.C. and M. L. Beaulieu for the respondent.\nOn February 2, 1937, the Court delivered the following judgment:\nThe appeal of the appellant Jalbert is allowed and the judgment appealed from set aside. Unless expropriation proceedings are commenced within one month judgment shall be entered declaring the rights of the suppliant and ordering a new trial in the Exchequer Court limited to the ascertainment of the damages or compensation. The suppliant shall be entitled to one-half of his costs (including counsel fees) here and below, together with all other disbursements in full, the costs of the new trial to be in the discretion of the trial judge. No order should be made with respect to the intervention and appeal of the Attorney-General for Quebec.\nThe reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered by\nDavis, J.\u2014This appeal was argued and considered by us in two steps. We first confined the argument to the question whether the lands of the suppliant were part of a public harbour within the meaning of the schedule of the British North America Act 1867 as property that passed at Confederation to the Dominion. If that was the true position of the land, and it was the conclusion of the learned trial judge, then the suppliant might have no right to damages or compensation in respect of lands taken or injuriously affected. Having taken time to consider that branch of the case we announced our conclusion that upon the evidence it could not be found that the lands in question were at Confederation part of a public harbour within the contemplation of that term in the British North America Act. That conclusion gave recognition to the suppliant\u2019s title and made it necessary for us to continue the hearing of the appeal on the question of damages or compensation.\nA difficulty at once presented itself in the fact that, in the absence of expropriation proceedings, there has been technically a trespass on the part of the Dominion in the view that we had taken of the case that the lands were not Dominion property. That the Dominion, acting through its Harbour Commission at Chicoutimi, had actually taken possession of part of the suppliant\u2019s land and had constructed substantial and permanent public works upon it and had thereby injuriously affected by severance the remaining portion of the suppliant\u2019s land is really not in dispute. On the assumption that our conclusion on the first branch of the case was correct, counsel for the Dominion and for the suppliant merely disagree upon the proper measure to be adopted in ascertaining the amount of damages or compensation. Had expropriation proceedings been taken, the rights of the parties and the procedure for determining compensation would have been found to have been covered by statutory enactment. The Chicoutimi Harbour Commissioners\u2019 Act, 1926, 16-17 Geo. V, c. 6, provides for the appointment of commissioners by the Governor in Council who shall have jurisdiction within the limits of the harbour of Chicoutimi, as in the Act defined, and who shall likewise have administration and control of the harbour and all harbour property. By the said statute, the commissioners may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, acquire or expropriate such real estate or personal property as they deem necessary or desirable for the development, improvement, maintenance and protection of the harbour but all such real estate shall be acquired in the name of and vested in His Majesty. It is further provided that should the commissioners be unable to agree with the owner of lands to be acquired for any of the purposes of the Act as to the price to-be paid therefor, the commissioners shall have the right to acquire such lands without the consent of the owner, and the provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, relating to the taking of land by railway companies shall, mutatis mutandis, be applicable to the acquisition of such lands by the commissioners, and in any such proceeding the powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners under The Railway Act shall be exercised by the Governor in Council. The provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, relating to the taking of land by railway companies, are now contained in the Revised Statutes of Canada 1927, c. 170. By section 164 the railway company shall make\nfull compensation in the manner herein and in the special Act provided, to all persons interested, for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise\nof the powers of the company. By section 166 the railway company shall not, except as in the Act otherwise provided, commence the construction of the railway, or any section or portion thereof, until the general location has been approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners as thereinafter provided nor until the plan, profile and book of reference have been sanctioned by and deposited with the Board and duly certified copies thereof deposited with the registrars of deeds, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The provisions relating to expropriation commence with section 215 of the Act. By section 219, when the parties cannot agree upon the amount of compensation or damages, either party may apply, in the province of Quebec, to a judge of the Superior Court for the district or place in which the lands lie, to determine the compensation to be paid. Section 220 provides that such judge shall, upon application being made to him as aforesaid, become the arbitrator for determining such compensation, and he shall proceed to ascertain such compensation in such way as he deems best and except as to the limited right of appeal given by section 232, his award shall be final and conclusive. Section 221 is what is sometimes called a betterment clause whereby the arbitrator shall take into consideration the increased value, beyond the increased value common to all lands in the locality, that will be given to any lands of the opposite party by reason of the construction of the railway, and shall set off such increased value that will attach to the said lands against the inconvenience, loss or damage that might be suffered or sustained by reason of the company taking possession of or using the said lands. Section 222 provides that the railway company may offer an easement in mitigation of any injury or damage caused or likely to be caused to any lands by the exercise of the company\u2019s powers.\nNow had the Dominion or its statutory agent, the harbour commission, taken expropriation proceedings as provided by the Chicoutimi Harbour Commissioner\u2019s Act, the amount of compensation would under that statute by virtue of the provisions of The Railway Act have been determined by a judge of the Superior Court of Quebec for the district in which the lands lie. The decisions upon The Railway Act have clearly established what is the proper measure of compensation within the language of the statute and applying the decisions a judge of the Superior Court would have fixed and determined in the expropriation proceedings the full compensation to which the suppliant would have been entitled. Expropriation would have been the simple and proper course for the Dominion to have taken had it not been for the fact that the Dominion claimed ownership of the property itself.\nBut the Dominion taking the view that it did that the lands in question were in fact the property of the Dominion as part of a public harbour at Confederation could not, nor could the harbour commission acting on its behalf, take expropriation proceedings without excluding the Dominion\u2019s claim that these lands were its own property and that the suppliant therefore was not entitled to compensation. When we announced our conclusion on the first branch of the case the Dominion could not then have commenced expropriation proceedings without acquiescing in that conclusion and thereby depriving itself of the right to have our judgment reviewed by the Judicial Committee if leave were given. The Dominion has not, in any case, commenced expropriation proceedings and we must therefore now deal with the petition of right as a claim for damages or compensation against the Crown for the actual taking of part of the lands of the suppliant and for the alleged injurious affection to the adjoining lands of the suppliant.\nThe first difficulty presented is to determine upon what basis the quantum is to be arrived at. Technically the acts of the Dominion are acts of trespass. There is no lawful authority for the actual taking possession of the lands in question. From that point of view the action in the Exchequer Court on the petition of right should be treated, if a technical rule is applied, as an action in trespass and the damages assessed as in any other action in trespass. But virtually the lands were expropriated and we think the proper course is to proceed to determine the amount of compensation to which the suppliant would have been entitled had expropriation proceedings been taken. The authorities amply justify that course.\nIn Parkdale v. West[3], no land was taken but there was interference by a railway subway with the plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of their lands and the question at issue was whether the municipal corporation of Parkdale was liable to the plaintiffs for damage done to the premises of which the plaintiffs were owners. The effect of lowering the roadway in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 property had been to deprive the plaintiffs of the access to a public street which they had previously enjoyed and to injure their property seriously. At the trial the claims of the plaintiffs were amended by setting out that the corporation of Parkdale alleged that the work was done by the railway companies under the Dominion Act, 46 Vict., c. 24, but that in fact the subway was being constructed by the corporation of Parkdale and not by the railway companies, and by claiming that if the work was done by the corporation of Park-dale under the Ontario Act, 46 Vict., c. 45, a mandamus should issue to them to compel the assessment of compensation under that Act. The railway companies were not made parties to the action. In their defences, as amended, the corporation of Parkdale relied on the ground that the work was done by the railway companies, through the corporation of Parkdale as their agents, pursuant to the requirements of the railway committee acting under the Dominion Act, 46 Vict., c. 24, and denied that they had acted under the Ontario Act, 46 Vict., c. 45. Wilson, C.J., who presided at the trial, gave judgment for the plaintiffs on the ground that the acts complained of were wrongful, not being authorized by the Order in Council. This judgment was upheld by a Divisional Court of two judges on the ground that the corporation could not act as agents for the railway companies, and on the further ground that by proceeding under the Ontario Act the corporation of Park-dale could by taking the necessary steps have legally done the work, and that consequently \u201cthe matter could not be treated as one to all intents ultra vires\u201d and that the corporation \u201cwere trespassers but within the scope of their authority.\u201d The judgment of the Divisional Court was reversed by the Court of Appeal of Ontario by a majority of three judges to one. The majority of judges held that the work was done by the railway companies under the order of the railway committee of the Privy Council of Canada and that the plaintiffs must look to the railway companies for compensation. This Court, upon further appeal, reversed this last-mentioned judgment and affirmed the judgment of the trial judge and of the Divisional Court. Gwynne, J. dissented, holding that the corporation of Park-dale was in fact acting under the Ontario statute and was liable thereunder to make compensation. The case was carried to the Judicial Committee and the appeal was dismissed. Lord Macnaghten in delivering the judgment of the Board said that their Lordships regretted that the railway companies had not been made parties to the action and that the litigation might have been disposed of more satisfactorily in the presence of the railway companies but that the absence of the railway companies did not relieve the corporation of Parkdale, which claimed to have acted as agent for the railways, from the obligation of showing that its principals were duly authorized to do the acts complained of. Their Lordships came to the conclusion that an order of the railway committee of the Privy Council for Canada under the 4th section of the Dominion Act of 1883 did not of itself, and apart from the provisions of law thereby made applicable to the case of land required for the proper carrying out of the requirements of the railway committee, authorize or empower the railway company on whom the order is made to take any person\u2019s land or to interfere with any person\u2019s rights. The provisions of law at the date of the order of the railway committee\napplicable to the taking of land by railway companies and its valuation and conveyance to them and compensation therefor\nwere to be found in the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, and in the opinion of their Lordships those provisions included the provisions contained in that Act for compensation in respect of land injuriously affected though not actually taken. Those provisions were so intermixed with the provisions applicable to the taking of land strictly so called, that their Lordships thought they might be properly included under the head of \u201cprovisions of law applicable to the taking of land.\u201d It was admitted that no plan or book of reference relating to the alterations required by the railway committee had been deposited as required by the provisions of the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, and as the provision as to the deposit of a plan or book of reference was the foundation of all steps for assessing compensation it appeared to their Lordships therefore that the railway companies had not taken the very first step required to entitle them to commence operations. Further, their Lordships held that under the provisions of the Act compensation had to be paid, before the land could be lawfully taken or the rights over land interfered with and that the payment of compensation, or the giving of security, was a condition precedent. Their Lordships held on these grounds that the corporation of Parkdale could not justify its acts by pleading the statutory authority of the railway companies. The judgment proceeds at p. 615:\nIf a person whose rights are injuriously affected is refused compensation, he may be compelled to bring an action for injunction. But even in that case the Court would probably not interfere with the construction of the works by an interlocutory injunction if the railway company acted reasonably, and were willing to put the matter in train for the assessment of compensation * * * As a general rule, it would only be right to grant an injunction where the company was acting in a high-handed and oppressive manner, or guilty of some other misconduct.\nTheir Lordships were asked by the appellants to express an opinion as to the measure of damages in case the appeal should be dismissed. It appears to their Lordships that, as the injury committed is complete and of a permanent character, the respondents are entitled to compensation to the full extent of the injury inflicted.\nTheir Lordships express no opinion as to the rights of the appellants to recover over again against the railway companies, either under the general law of principal and agent, or under the express provisions of their agreement with those companies. Whatever those rights may be, they are untouched by their Lordships\u2019 judgment.\nAlthough the construction of the subway had not been lawfully undertaken, the work had actually been done, and though the municipal corporation were strictly trespassers \u201cbut within the scope of their authority\u201d and as the injury committed was complete and of a permanent character, the Judicial Committee held that the plaintiffs were entitled in their action against the corporation of Parkdale to compensation \u201cto the full extent of the injury inflicted.\u201d\nThen in Dominion Iron and Steel Company Ltd. v. Burt[4], the Judicial Committee had to consider a Nova Scotia case where the appellants owned a provincial railway which crossed a highway. In pursuance of an order made by the Governor in Council under section 178 of the Nova Scotia Railways Act (R.S.N.S. 1900, c. 99), the appellants altered the highway so as to pass under the railway, and thereby necessarily caused injury to the respondent\u2019s property. The appellants did not deposit a map or plan of the alteration under section 124 of the Act, nor did they take any steps to compensate the respondent. The respondent had brought a prior action against the city of Sydney to recover the damages which he had sustained but that action had been held not to be maintainable. Burt v. The City of Sydney[5]. Then he commenced this action against the owners of the railway and it went to the Privy Council. Lord Parker, in delivering the judgment, said that the works had been carried out by the appellant company pursuant to a direction of the Governor in Council under the provisions of section 178 of the Nova Scotia Railways Act but that such a direction could not of itself confer on the company any power to interfere with the rights of others, though there could be no question that the appellant company had, under section 85 of the Act, general powers wide enough to enable them to carry out the works. Nevertheless the works, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, had been commenced before the company had made a new map or plan of the alteration in the highway which alteration had been designed with the object of carrying such highway under the railway and getting rid of the dangerous level crossing which had previously existed, and that if such map or plan had been deposited it could not have failed to show that the access of the respondents to the highway from their adjoining lands must necessarily be interfered with and that the alterations could not properly be commenced until compensation for such interference had been paid or tendered under section 159. No such compensation was, in fact, paid or tendered. Their Lordships said:\nThe result is that, in executing the works directed by the Governor in Council, the company acted illegally, not because they had no power to carry out the alterations, but because they did not trouble to observe the conditions precedent upon which alone their powers could be exercised. What they have done in Victoria Road constitutes, therefore, a nuisance in the highway, for which the respondents, who undoubtedly suffered special damage, had their common law remedy.\nAnd their Lordships were therefore of the opinion that the respondents were entitled to damages in the action. \u201cIndeed,\u201d their Lordships said,\nthe respondents might, strictly speaking, also claim a mandatory order for the restoration of Victoria Road to its former condition.\nIt had been suggested that, inasmuch as the Act contained a betterment clause, the measure of damages in an action of nuisance is not necessarily the same as the measure of compensation payable under the Act, but their Lordships said:\nIt is, however, difficult to see how the amount of damages to which the respondents are entitled can in any event exceed the amount which would have been payable to them by way of compensation if the appellant company had proceeded lawfully. The fact that it could have proceeded lawfully and that had it done so the betterment clause of the Act would have applied is not without materiality in assessing the damage.\nIn that case the Judicial Committee said the Court in its discretion would be entitled to refuse to make or to postpone the making of any mandatory order. Further, though it was a matter of indifference to the respondents whether what they received in respect of any injury to their land were by way of damage or by way of compensation, that was not necessarily so with regard to the appellant company, for in the one case it might have, and in the other it might not have, some remedy over against the corporation of Sydney under the order of the Governor in Council. It was \u201cunder these circumstances\u201d that it appeared to their Lordships that while the judgments below ought to be affirmed, any proceedings thereunder for ascertaining the amount of damage sustained by the respondents ought to be stayed so as to give the appellant company an opportunity of doing what they ought to have done in the first instance. For this purpose a reasonable interval was allowed, within which time if the company deposited a proper map or plan and proceeded with due diligence to have the compensation payable to the respondents ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the stay would become absolute. If within the time limited the company did not take such proceedings to ascertain the compensation, the stay would be removed.\nThere is no necessity to stay the proceedings in the action before us because there is no third party against whom the Crown might have some remedy by indemnity or otherwise depending upon whether the matter had been treated by way of damage or by way of compensation. In the Dominion Iron and Steel Company case[6], their Lordships said that it was a matter of indifference to the respondents there whether what they received in respect of an injury to their land were by way of damage or by way of compensation. This indicates clearly, I think, that so far as the quantum is concerned it will be the same in a case such as this whether it be ascertained by way of damage or by way of compensation.\nThe authorities therefore clearly justify us in proceeding with the ascertainment of damages on the basis of the land having been expropriated.\nThe jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada is ample for this purpose. That court, by chapter 34 of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1927, section 19, is given jurisdiction to hear and determine\n(a) every claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose;\n(b) every claim against the Crown for damage to property injuriously affected by the construction of any public work;\nThe parties put in at the trial all the evidence they desired to give on quantum. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court who tried the case did not assess the amount of damages or compensation because of his conclusion that the land was the property of the Dominion and we are without the benefit of his consideration of the evidence as to damage. This is unfortunate. Even though a trial judge may take, as a matter of law, a view of a case which precludes the plaintiff from recovering damages, an appellate court is entitled to have, in case it should reach a different conclusion on the question of liability, the advantage and assistance of the trial judge\u2019s views as to the weight which should be attached to the evidence of the several witnesses who appeared before him.\nThe facts may be stated briefly. The suppliant owned a water lot adjoining his land lot. His upland ran back to a public street in the town of Chicoutimi. The suppliant used the entire property in the conduct of his lumber business. He had a small lumber mill upon the property and the location was especially advantageous for his business because he brought in timber from his own limits and unloaded it directly from the boats to the lumber piles on a small wharf that he had built upon the water lot. The wharf bordered on and was attached to the upland. It was not a deep water wharf; at very low tide the water receded some distance from it. But it was a convenient means specially built by the suppliant for unloading timber that was brought in by water on flat-bottomed boats. At low tide the boats were quite secure on the beach. When the boats rested on the bottom their decks remained only a few feet lower than the top of the suppliant\u2019s wharf, causing no inconvenience in the unloading. There is said to have been a minimum amount of labour and time required in the handling of the timber under the conditions that existed before the construction of the harbour works complained of. The suppliant\u2019s lands were therefore used as a unum quid. Now when the Dominion, acting through the local harbour commission, constructed the public wharves at Chicoutimi a portion of the water lot alone was actually taken. The suppliant\u2019s wharf was not within the area taken nor was any of the upland. The land actually taken was of course subject to the public right of navigation and probably had little value in itself to the suppliant. The suppliant asked before us for 50 cents a square foot for this land and there is some evidence that it might be worth that amount if it were filled in but that the fill might cost about as much as the land would then be worth. The value of the land actually taken has not yet been assessed. The substantial damage to the suppliant, however, obviously lies in the severance of his property and the consequent interference with his right of access to the river. The land taken was so connected with and related to the lands that are left that it is plain that the suppliant is seriously prejudiced. Lord Sumner in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Holditch v. Canadian Northern Ontario Railway[7] said:\nThe basis of a claim to compensation for lands injuriously affected by severance must be that the lands taken are so connected with or related to the lands left that the owner of the latter is prejudiced in his ability to use or dispose of them to advantage by reason of the severance. The bare fact that before the exercise of the compulsory power to take land he was the common owner of both parcels is insufficient, for in such a case taking some of his land does no more harm to the rest than would have been done if the land taken had belonged to his neighbour. Compensation for severance therefore turns ultimately on the circumstances of the case.\nThe proper construction to be put upon the provision of section 164 of The Railway Act 1919 as to\nfull compensation * * * to all persons interested, for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of\nthe powers of the company is too well established by decisions to be any longer open to question. The Privy Council in Sisters of Charity of Rockingham v. The King[8] gave to the words \u201cinjuriously affected by the construction of any public work\u201d in the Exchequer Act, section 19 (b) the effect of the English decisions under the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845. In City of Montreal v. McAnulty Realty Co.[9], the present Chief Justice of this Court carefully reviewed the authorities and showed that notwithstanding the obvious differences in language between the clause in the Dominion Railway Act and the clauses of the English statutes out of which the rules developed, it was settled law that generally speaking the principles governing the right of compensation under The Railway Act were the same as those which were established in England under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act.\nThe City of Toronto v. Brown[10] was a case in this Court where the owner of property was held entitled to compensation for \u201cinjurious affection\u201d though none of his land was taken. The present Chief Justice in that case at page 179 showed that the phrase \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d used in the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and in the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, imports something which, if done without the authority of the legislature, would have given rise to a cause of action.\nIt has, moreover, been settled that since a condition of the right to compensation is that the claimant\u2019s property has been \u201cinjuriously affected,\u201d it is incumbent upon him to establish that the injury he complains of was an injury to his estate and not a mere obstruction or inconvenience to him personally or to his trade; Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[11]; and further that the damage complained of must be in respect of the property itself (in its existing state or otherwise) and not in respect of some particular use to which it may from time to time be put. Beckett v. Midland Railway Co.[12].\nIn Lake Erie and Northern Railway Co. v. Schooley[13], it was held by this Court that\nwhere property expropriated is owing to its location and adaptability for business, worth more to the owner than its intrinsic value, he is not entitled to have the capital amount representing the excess added to the market value of his property. His proper compensation is the amount which a prudent man in the position of the owner would be willing to pay.\nThe principle applied was that laid down by the Privy Council in Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister[14], that the special suitability of the lands expropriated for the carrying on of the business of the owner and the additional profits which the owner will derive from so carrying it on, are proper elements in assessing the compensation but the owner is not entitled to have the capitalized value of those savings and profits added to the market value of the land. Their Lordships said at p. 1088 of the report of that case:\nThat which the appellants were entitled to receive was compensation not for the business profits or savings which they expected to make from the use of the land, but for the value of the land to them. No doubt the suitability of the land for the purpose of their special business affected the value of the land to them, and the prospective savings and additional profits which it could be shewn would probably attend the use of the land in their business furnished material for estimating what was the real value of the land to them. But that is a very different thing from saying that they were entitled to have the capitalized value of these savings and additional profits added to the market value of the land in estimating their compensation. They were only entitled to have them taken into consideration so far as they might fairly be said to increase the value of the land. Probably the most practical form in which the matter can be put is that they were entitled to that which a prudent man in their position would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it. Now it is evident that no man would pay for land in addition to its market value the capitalized value of the savings and additional profits which he would hope to make by the use of it. He would, no doubt, reckon out those savings and additional profits as indicating the elements of value of the land to him, and they would guide him in arriving at the price which he would be willing to pay for the land, but certainly if he were a business man that price would not be calculated by adding the capitalized savings and additional profits to the market value.\nIn the case before us the serious claim, as we have said, is in the interference with the conduct of the suppliant\u2019s business on his lands but in order to arrive at a fair amount of damages for the \u201cinjurious affection\u201d it is really necessary that the Court should have some evidence of what was the fair value to the suppliant of his estate at the time of the commencement of the construction of the public work complained of and of what is the fair value of the estate he has now after the construction of the public work. The possibility of the betterment of his property is by virtue of section 221 of The Railway Act something, in the words of Lord Parker in the Dominion Iron and Steel case[15], \u201cnot without materiality in assessing the damage.\u201d\nSerious difficulty presents itself to us in the review of the evidence as to damage. Counsel for both parties admit that there was no evidence given at the trial by any one as to the value of the suppliant\u2019s estate in the lands before or of the value after the construction of the public work complained of. Counsel for the suppliant admitted that the evidence in support of the claim for damages was directed solely to showing an increased cost in operating the suppliant\u2019s lumber business on the property under the changed conditions and establishing some capitalized value of the loss. Now that is plainly the wrong principle to apply in the ascertaining of the damages and the case will have to go back for a new trial on that branch of the case.\nThe suppliant\u2019s appeal must be allowed and the judgment appealed from set aside.\nIf the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission should now desire to commence expropriation proceedings, in which case the compensation will be fixed by a judge of the Superior Court of Quebec for the district in which the lands lie in accordance with the provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, made applicable mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the special Act of the Chicoutimi Harbour Commissioners, and such proceedings are commenced within one month, the suppliant shall be entitled to a declaration of his rights but on account of the unsatisfactory and insufficient evidence of damage given in support of his claim he shall only be entitled to one-half of his costs here and below, together with his disbursements. If expropriation proceedings are not so taken, then judgment shall be entered declaring the rights of the suppliant and ordering a new trial in the Exchequer Court limited to the ascertainment of the damages or compensation. In the latter event, the suppliant shall be entitled to the same order as above stated as to the costs here and below but the costs of the new trial shall be in the discretion of the trial judge.\nThe Attorney-General for the province of Quebec intervened in the proceedings in the Exchequer Court and took an independent appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Exchequer Court. Section 31 of the Exchequer Court Act provides that when the legislature of any province has passed an Act agreeing that the Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction in cases of controversies between the Dominion and such province or between such province and any other province or provinces which shall have passed a like Act, the Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction to determine such controversies and an appeal shall lie in such cases from the Exchequer Court to this Court. Provinces which have passed such legislation have more than once resorted to this jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court and have brought actions in the Exchequer Court to recover on claims against the Dominion, as for instance in The Province of Ontario v. The Dominion of Canada[16]. The province of Quebec, however, has never passed the enabling legislation provided by section 31 of The Exchequer Court Act. But in any case it is plain that the Exchequer Court has no power to give relief to a province in a petition of right of a subject against the Dominion and although no exception was taken to the intervention or to the independent appeal the proper course is that no order should be made with respect to the appeal of the Attorney-General for Quebec.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the suppliant appellant: St-Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General for Quebec: Charles Lanct\u00f4t.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Marie-Louis Beaulieu.\n[1] [1936] Ex.

A fortiori, the filing of a petition in invocation of judgment does not operate as a stay of proceedings in appellate jurisdictions as a matter of course.\nAs to the appellant company\u2019s application that, in view of the fact that a petition in revocation has been duly filed in the Superior Court in Montreal, the record ought to be returned to that Court for hearing on the petition, held that, such matter being entirely within the discretion of this Court, such application should be refused as, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent having been awarded damages by the judgment appealed from, the balance of inconvenience would be entirely on the respondent\u2019s side if the application was granted. Kowal v. New York Central Railroad Co. ([1934] S.C.R. 214) dist.\nOn the merits of the case, the judgment appealed from, affirming the judgment of the trial judge with a jury and awarding the respondent damages resulting from an accident due to collision, should be affirmed.\u2014The jury\u2019s answer to the question, whether the accident has been the result of the sole fault of the appellant company and if so in what consisted that fault, was \u201cYes, excessive speed and negligence of the watchman\u201d Although the last underlined part of the answer should be disregarded, being clearly insufficient and irregular as not being \u201cspecial, explicit and articulated\u201d (art. 483, C.C.P.), the other part of the answer \u201cexcessive speed,\u201d taken separately\u2014as it must be under the circumstances\u2014is sufficient to meet the requirements of that article of the Code and render the verdict valid; and it is not the function of this Court under the circumstances of this case to review such finding (art. 501 C.C.P.). APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, with a jury and awarding the respondent damages in the sum of $11,000 in all, being $8,000 in his capacity of tutor to his minor daughter and $3,000 personally, the damages resulting from an accident due to a collision between a tram-car belonging to the company appellant and an automobile in which the respondent\u2019s daughters were passengers.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgments now reported.\nArthur Vall\u00e9e K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. P. Charbonneau for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court, on the application of the appellant company to suspend hearing of the appeal by this Court and to order the return of the record to the trial court, was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014In this case, upon the verdict of a jury, the respondent recovered against the appellants a sum of $3,000 for himself personally and a further sum of $8,000 for his daughter Pauline, for damages resulting from an accident which happened in Montreal. The presiding judge gave judgment in accordance with the verdict, and his judgment was confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe Montreal Tramways Company thereupon appealed to this Court from the verdict and from the judgments confirming it.\nThe appeal was set down for hearing at the present session of the Court, when the appellants applied for postponement and asked that the record be returned to the prothonotary\u2019s office of the Superior Court, in Montreal, on the ground that they had filed in that Court a petition in revocation praying that the judgment be annulled and that the parties be replaced in the same position as they were in before that judgment, in view of the discovery of new evidence, unknown to the appellants or their attorneys at the time of the trial and of such a nature that if it had been brought forward in time, it would probably have changed the result (art. 505 C.C.P.), and also upon other grounds within the provisions of art. 1177 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the province of Quebec. On behalf of the appellants, it was urged that the filing of the petition in revocation of judgment, under the Quebec law, had the effect ipso facto of suspending all proceedings in the case and that the Court was precluded from hearing the appeal until the petition in revocation had been disposed of.\nIn the alternative, it was submitted that, in the exercise of its discretion, the Court ought to delay the hearing of the appeal until a final decision had been pronounced on the petition.\nIt is not necessary, in this case, to determine whether the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to hear an appeal regularly entered before the Court may be interfered with by the effect of a proceeding lodged in the provincial courts, and that point will be reserved for our decision in a proper case.\nWe find however that, quite independently of that important objection which might possibly be found in the way of the appellants\u2019 present application and even under the law of the province of Quebec, the petition in revocation of judgment has not the effect ipso facto of suspending the proceedings in the case wherein the petition is presented.\nThe mooted question whether such a petition, before having any effect at all, ought to be received by a judge of the \u201csame court\u201d where the original judgment was pronounced has now been set at rest by the amendment to art. 1178 of the Code of Civil Procedure, introduced by s. 3 of chapter 97 of the statutes of Quebec 22 Geo. V (1931-32). By force of that amendment \u201cthe rules laid down by art. 1168\u201d (and that is to say: the rules applicable in the case of oppositions to judgments) \u201cshall govern as to the receiving of the petition in revocation of judgment.\u201d The result is that, since the amendment, the petition\nis without effect and cannot be received by the prothonotary, unless it is accompanied by an order of the judge allowing it to be filed (and) no petition in revocation of judgment may be authorized by the judge without a previous notice thereof to the parties.\nIn the present instance, from the material filed before us, the petition appears to have been duly filed (\u201cd\u00fbment produite\u201d) and to have been received by the prothonotary. But the filing of the petition, without anything more, does not operate as a stay of proceedings under the Quebec law. There is no express provision to that effect to be found in the Code of Civil Procedure. If it had been the intention of the legislature that it should be so, and more particularly that the hearing before an appellate jurisdiction should be suspended, it is to be expected that the Code would have said so in express terms.\nThere is, in the Code of Civil Procedure, article 1182, which says that \u201cthe petition in revocation cannot prevent or stay execution, unless an order to suspend is granted by the judge\u201d; and the logical inference to be drawn from that provision is that the stay of execution is the only consequence to result from the mere filing of the petition in revocation; and, moreover, such consequence does not follow as a matter of course, but only upon an order to that effect granted by the judge.\nOur conclusion is that a fortiori the filing of a petition in revocation of judgment does not operate as a stay of proceedings in the appellate jurisdictions as a matter of course. That view is further supported by: Bioche, Dictionnaire de proc\u00e9dure civile et commerciale, 5th edition, vol. 5, vbo. Requ\u00eate civile, p. 857, nos. 201 & 202; Garsonnet, Trait\u00e9 de proc\u00e9dure civile, 3rd ed., vol. 6, p. 828, no. 494; Glasson & Tessier, Pr\u00e9cis de proc\u00e9dure civile, 3rd ed., vol. 3, p. 439; Japiot, Proc\u00e9dure civile et commerciale, 2nd ed., p. 686, no. 1114: \u201cLa requ\u00eate civile ne produit pas d\u2019effet suspensif.\u201d\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the filing in the Superior Court of the petition in revocation of the judgment now subject to appeal had not the effect ipso facto of staying proceedings in appeal and the appellants fail on the first ground put forward by them in support of their application.\nThere remains to decide whether, in view of the fact that the petition in revocation was duly filed in the Superior Court, in Montreal, we should return the record to that court where, no doubt, it will be heard in due course.\nLooking at the application in that view and as a matter entirely within our discretion\u2014(in the words of Bioche, loc. cit.: \u201cLa convenance du sursis est au surplus abandonn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du juge\u201d)\u2014we find that, in the present case, the balance of inconvenience would be entirely on the respondent\u2019s side. The respondent holds an award for a total sum of $11,000 and has secured a judgment for that amount, with interest and costs. The verdict and the original judgment date back to the month of January, 1935, and they have been confirmed by the appellate court. It is desirable that the appeal in this Court should be disposed of without further delay. If the record should be returned to the Superior Court for the purpose of allowing the appellants to proceed with their petition in revocation, the decision on the petition in that court will not necessarily bring the litigation to an end on that branch of the case; it may be further carried on appeal to several successive jurisdictions and the hearing of the appeal in this Court might possibly be delayed for a not inconsiderable period of time.\nUnder the circumstances, the wise course is to allow the appeal to proceed. We cannot see that, by following this course, the appellants will suffer prejudice in any way; and it must be understood that we are not expressing any opinion on the merits or the demerits of the petition in revocation.\nA word ought to be said about the judgment of this Court in Kowal v. New York Central Railroad[1]. In the special circumstances of that case, the proceedings in the appeal to this Court were suspended for fifteen days to allow the appellant to present a petition in revocation of judgment to the Superior Court; but the application to that effect was made by the plaintiff, whose action had been dismissed by the Superior Court and by the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side); and it was thought that, under such conditions, the balance of convenience was in favour of granting the application. The situation, in our view, was practically the reverse of what it is in the present instance.\nThe application of the appellants to have the hearing of the appeal in this Court suspended and the record returned to the Superior Court will accordingly be dismissed with costs; but without prejudice to the right of the appellants to proceed with their petition in revocation of judgment before the Superior Court as they may be advised; and also with reserve of their right, should occasion arise, to pray before the Superior Court for a stay of execution under art. 1181 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The judgment of the Court, on the merits of the case, was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014Pauline and Lucienne Gu\u00e9rard, the daughters of the respondent, were passengers in an automobile driven by one Bastien, which was struck by a tramway belonging to the appellant. Lucienne Gu\u00e9rard died as a result of the accident. The other daughter, Pauline, was injured in that same accident. The respondent, both personally and as head of the community of property with his wife, sued the Montreal Tramways Company, its motorman, and Bastien, the driver of the automobile, to recover the damages resulting from the death of his daughter Lucienne. He also sued in his quality of tutor to his minor daughter, Pauline, to recover the damages resulting to the latter from her injuries.\nThe case was tried before a jury, who found that the accident was solely due to the fault of the motorman in charge of the tramway.\nThe driver of the automobile was exonerated by the jury.\nIn accordance with the jury\u2019s findings and assessment of damages, the action of the respondent against the driver Bastien was dismissed and his action against the appellant was maintained by the Superior Court for a sum of $3,000 allowed the respondent personally in respect of the death of his daughter Lucienne, and for another sum of $8,000 in his quality of tutor to his minor daughter Pauline.\nThe present respondent, Gu\u00e9rard, did not appeal from the judgment dismissing his action against Bastien.\nUpon appeal by the present appellant, Montreal Tramways Company, the verdict of the jury and the judgment of the Superior Court were upheld in the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) by a majority of judges, Mr. Justice Dorion dissenting.\nThe Montreal Tramways Company then appealed to this Court, upon several grounds which, however, at the hearing, were limited to two: it contended that the verdict was contrary to the evidence and that the amounts awarded were excessive.\nThe material questions put to the jury and the answers respectively given by it to those questions were as follows:\nTroisi\u00e8me question:\u2014Cet accident a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la seule faute d\u2019Henri Bastien, chauffeur de l\u2019automobile dans lequel avait pris place lea dlites Pauline Gu\u00e9rard et Lucienne Gu\u00e9rard, et si oui, dites en quoi a consist\u00e9 telle faute?\nNon, unanime.\nQuatri\u00e8me question:\u2014Cet accident a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la seule faute de la d\u00e9fenderesse Montreal Tramways Company et du wattman, Cl\u00e9bert Reumond, et si oui, dites en quoi a consist\u00e9 telle faute?\nOui, exc\u00e8s de vitesse et n\u00e9gligence de la part du wattman\u2014neuf pour et trois contre.\nCinqui\u00e8me question:\u2014Cet accident a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la faute commune des dites Pauline Gu\u00e9rard et Lucienne Gu\u00e9rard, d\u2019Henri Bastien, de la d\u00e9fenderesse Montreal Tramways Company et du wattman, Cl\u00e9bert Reumond, et si oui, dites en quoi a consist\u00e9 la, faute de chacun?\nNon. Neuf pour, trois contre.\nThe last part of the answer to the fourth question: \u201cn\u00e9gligence de la part du wattman,\u201d may be disregarded, as it was not \u201cspecial, explicit and articulated,\u201d as is required under article 483 of the Code of Civil Procedure whenever \u201cthere is an assignment of facts,\u201d as there was in the present case.\nThat part of the answer was clearly insufficient and irregular (Pinsonnault v. Montreal Light, Heat & Power Company[2]; Davis v. Julien[3]; and it is only necessary to read the reports in the cases of Martineau v. Dumphy[4], and of Deslongchamps v. Montreal Tramways[5], to see that they have no application here.\nHow far the insufficiency of that part of the jury\u2019s answer might have affected the regularity of the verdict as a whole is a point that was not taken and which need not, therefore, be discussed here.\nBut the other part of the answer to the fourth question, to wit: \u201cexc\u00e8s de vitesse,\u201d taken separately\u2014as it must be under the circumstances\u2014is sufficient to meet the requirements of article 483 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and it is not the function of this Court to review that finding (See decision in C.N.R. v. Muller[6]). Under the Code, a verdict may not be considered against the weight of evidence unless it is one which a jury, viewing the whole of the evidence, could not reasonably find (art. 501 C.C.P.); and the appellant has not succeeded in showing to us that the answer came within that provision of the Code.\nLikewise, on the question of assessment of damages, we cannot accede to the argument that the amounts awarded are so grossly excessive that it was evident that the jurors have been influenced by improper motives. Moreover, it was not shown that they had been led into error. In the absence of one or the other of these conditions, a new trial may not be granted under the Quebec law (art. 502 C.C.P.).\nA word ought to be said, however, with regard to the answers of the jury to questions nos. 3 and 5. On the evidence, it seems abundantly clear that, before entering on Monkland Avenue (which he intended to cross and where the accident happened), Bastien failed to look, in order to ascertain whether traffic was coming in either direction on that avenue.\nIt may be a question whether he looked some 25 feet south of the avenue, where he was supposed to stop in obedience to the by-laws of Montreal, in line with a post specially erected to warn the auto drivers in that respect. But there could be no question that he never looked subsequently, as he admits himself:\nJ\u2019\u00e9tais int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 regarder en avant, pas regarder \u00e0 chaque bord. J\u2019\u00e9tais int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 regarder en avant de mon char.\n* * *\nQ. Avez-vous regard\u00e9 ou si vous n\u2019avez pas regard\u00e9?\nR. Je ne me souviens pas au juste devoir regard\u00e9.\n* * *\nPar la Cour:\u2014\nQ. En aucun temps, vous n\u2019avez jamais vu le tramway qui vous a frapp\u00e9 avant qoi\u2019il Vous frappe?\nR. Non.\nQ. La premi\u00e8re fois que vous avez vu le tramway, c\u2019est dans le trajet, je suppose, \u00e0 alter au trottoir?\nR. Apr\u00e8s que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9, que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9barqu\u00e9 de mon char, c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que je l\u2019ai vu.\nQ. Vous l\u2019avez vu alors seulemeint?\nR. Oui.\nHe failed entirely to observe the universally accepted rule of prudence so often referred to by the courts: \u201cStop, look and listen.\u201d\nUnder the circumstances, it is not easy to understand the answers of the jury to questions 3 and 5 entirely exonerating the driver Bastien of all responsibility whatever.\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench, all the judges expressed their surprise. Mr. Justice Dorion said:\nJe ferais done porter toute la responsabilit\u00e9 sur le chauffeur de l\u2019automoibile. Mr. Justice Bond said he had reached the conclusion that the verdict could be upheld \u201conly after some hesitation.\u201d Mr. Justice Saint-Jacques said:\nLe moins que Ton puisse dire, c\u2019est que cette conclusion, ne peut pas manquer de causer quelque perplexit\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e la preuve sur la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019accident s\u2019est produit.\nAnd Mr. Justice Barclay (with whom Mr. Justice Saint-Germain concurred):\nHad I acted as trial judge, I might have been inclined to the view that there was common fault on the part of the Tramways Company and the driver of the automobile, but the jury having completely exonerated the latter, and there being sufficient evidence in the record to render such a finding reasonable, this Court cannot substitute a verdict for the verdict of the jury.\nOf course, as observed by counsel for the respondent, the obligation arising from the common offence, or quasioffence, of two or more persons is joint and several (art. 1106 C.C.); and if the answer to question no. 4 must stand against the appellant, the respondent may apply for payment of the whole amount of the awards against the appellant (art. 1107 C.C), notwithstanding the fact that the driver Bastien ought also to have been held responsible.\nBut, in my view, that is not quite the point; and the respondent\u2019s contention does not meet the situation to my satisfaction. So far as the driver Bastien is concerned, I do not think the answers of the jury can be supported on the evidence; and there is no saying how far a proper consideration of Bastien\u2019s conduct by the jury might have influenced the whole verdict. I mean by that: that if the jurors had applied their minds reasonably to the admissions made by Bastien and had acted judicially thereon, they might well have come to the conclusion that the accident was due exclusively and solely to the fault of Bastien.\nOf course, it is impossible to speculate as to what might have been the verdict, had the jury given proper and reasonable consideration to Bastien\u2019s admissions\u2014a consideration which the answers to questions 3 and 5 suggest that was not given by them. And it seems to me that the consequence\u2014that the jury\u2019s answers either to question 3, or at least to question 5, cannot be supported on the evidence\u2014might have led to an order for a new trial.\nBut I do not think the order can now be made upon the present appeal, having regard to the state of the record before us. The verdict of the jury in regard to Bastien has been definitely acted upon and acquiesced in. So far as Bastien is concerned, the action was dismissed by the trial judge and no appeal was taken from that dismissal. In this Court, he was kept outside the record. The inscription in appeal was served only upon the respondent. Not only was there no attempt to make Bastien a party to the appeal, but that could no longer be done as soon as the delays for an appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench had expired. As between the respondent and Bastien, the judgment then became res judicata in favour of the latter (Corporation de la Paroisse de Saint-Gervais v. Goulet)[7].\nUnder the circumstances, and in the absence of Bastien before us, the answers of the jury in regard to his responsibility can no longer be set aside. As a result, the jury\u2019s answer to question no. 4 stands and remains with its full effect.\nBut if such be the situation upon the record before us, there is no chose jug\u00e9e as between the appellant and the driver Bastien. The appellant may yet have recourse against Bastien under article 1118 of the Civil Code; and, in the course of his address to the jury, the learned trial judge expressed himself several times in that sense. I think, therefore, it should be stated that the rights as between the Montreal Tramways Company and Bastien, whatever they may be, are untouched by the present judgment.\nSo far as the rights between the appellants and the respondent are concerned, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the company appellant: Vall\u00e9e, Beaudry, Fortier, Letourneau & Macnaughton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lamothe & Charbonneau.\n[1] [1934] S.C.R., 214.\n[2] (1916) 23 R.L., N.S. 315.\n[3] (1915) Q.R. 25 K.B. 35.\n[4] (1909) Q.R. 19 K.B. 339.\n[5] (1905) Q.R. 14 K.B. 355; (1906) 37 S.C.R. 685.\n[6] [1934] 1 D.L.R. 768.\n[7] [1931] S.C.R. 437 at 441, 442.\n"}

In the month of August, 1926, the latter entered upon the operation of a marginal trading account at that branch. About a year later, two daughters of the respondent opened similar accounts of their own at the same branch office. These became very large and most active accounts until came the break in the stock market in October, 1929. The accounts went under the margin and even under the market, and the respondent and her daughters were continually called upon to supply funds or securities to support their accounts. The respondent, after her daughters had given all they had for that purpose, was able to support them for a certain period. Finally, having tried and failed to raise funds to provide for further margins required by the branch manager, the respondent expressed to the latter the desire to have an interview with one of the appellants, Mr. Johnston, in Montreal. The interview took place; and, after a long discussion about the exact positions of all the accounts, the respondent, according to Mr. Johnston\u2019s version, authorized the latter verbally to treat all three accounts as one, and to close them, agreeing to hold herself responsible for them and that any balance due on the other accounts should be charged against her account The respondent brought an action against the appellants asking, inter alia, that the latter be condemned to pay her the sum of $58,793.98, being the total of two debit balances in the accounts of one of her daughters charged to the respondent in the final statement of account sent to her by the appellants; the respondent specifically denying the fact of her alleged authorization to treat all accounts as one and arguing further that this alleged agreement was not susceptible of being proven by oral testimony. The trial judge held that the agreement on which the appellants relied was susceptible of being proven by oral testimony as he found sufficient commencement of proof in writing, and that the evidence had established the existence of such agreement. The appellate court held that such evidence was not legal and maintained the respondent\u2019s action in part.\n[page 87]\nHeld that verbal proof of the agreement alleged by the appellants was admissible, as, upon the facts and circumstances of this case, sufficient commencement of proof in writing under article 1233 (7) C.C. could be found in order to let in oral evidence of the particulars of such agreement.\nHeld also that, whatever may be the correct legal description of the agreement alleged to have been made by the respondent, it does not come within the transactions made by stock brokers in the ordinary course of their business; and, therefore, verbal evidence was not admissible as constituting proof of \u201cfacts concerning commercial matters\u201d within the meaning of those terms in paragraph 1 of article 1233 C.C.\u2014The decision of Forget v. Baxter ([1900] A.C. 467) is not applicable to the present case.\nThe expression \u201ccommencement of proof in writing,\u201d although no definition of it is contained in the Civil Code, connotes a writing emanating from the party against whom it is to be used which tend to render probable (in French \u201cvraisemblable\u201d) the existence of the fact which is desired to be proved\u2014It is not necessarily required that the writing should be in the hand of the party against whom it is sought to be used or that it should be signed by that party; it is sufficient if it \u201cemanates\u201d from him. \u2014The writing required for the commencement of proof may be replaced by the evidence of the party (article 316 C.C.P.)\u2014The question whether there is a writing and the further question whether that writing emanates from the party against whom it is sought to be used are questions of law; but the question whether the writing, or the evidence of the party against whom it is used, tends to render probable the existence of the fact which it is desired to be proved, is a question of fact.\nThe trial judge\u2019s finding, in this case, was in favour of the appellants; and it is a well established practice that an appellate court should not disturb such findings, on questions of facts, unless there could be found evident error by the trial judge in appreciating the evidence; but the rule must even be more strictly adhered to when it is applied to the question of whether a commencement of proof in writing is sufficient to let in oral evidence.\nThe trial judged finding, that \u201con important points, (respondent\u2019s) testimony was often evasive, confused and contradictory\u201d was peculiarly within the province of the trial judge, who was in the best position to pass upon it; and such a situation has always been recognized as a valid basis of commencement of proof in writing.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Denis J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in part.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above headnote and in the judgment now reported.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. and G. F. Osier for the appellants.\nJ. T. Hackett K.C. and J. E. Mitchell for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The real controversy between the parties, at the time when the action was brought, was whether or not Mrs. Buckland, at an interview with Mr. Johnston, head of the appellants (who are stock brokers), on October 14, 1930, authorized the appellants to consolidate her accounts with the accounts of her daughters and to charge to her any debit balances in her daughters\u2019 accounts.\nThis was not, however, the issue presented by the respondent in the original declaration accompanying the writ of summons served upon the appellants. In that declaration, the first conclusion was for an accounting; the second conclusion was that the appellants be jointly and severally condemned to return to the respondent any securities belonging to her which may still be in their possession; the third conclusion was that the appellants be ordered to pay to the respondent the value as of the dates of delivery by the respondent, or of purchase for her, of all her securities subsequently sold by the appellants illegally, wrongfully and improperly, as was alleged; and the fourth conclusion, which was only in the alternative, was that the appellants, upon their failure so to do,\nbe jointly and severally condemned to pay plaintiff the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) with interest from the sale of the said securities.\nIt was only several months after the institution of the action and after the appellants had filed their plea that the respondent amended her declaration so as to ask that\nin any event, (the appellants) be jointly and severally condemned to pay (the respondent) fifty-eight thousand seven hundred and ninety-three dollars and ninety-eight cents ($58,793.98), with interest from the 15th December, 1930, and costs.\nThis sum of $58,793.98 was the total of two debit balances in the accounts of one of Mrs. Buckland\u2019s daughters, Vera (Mrs. Webster), charged to Mrs. Buckland in the final statement of account sent to her by the appellants as of December 15, 1930.\nStill at a later date\u2014and, in fact, after enqu\u00eate was closed at the trial\u2014the respondent moved to further amend her declaration and to add the following words:\nand that, in so far as necessary, the statements furnished by the defendants (appellants) to the plaintiff (respondent) be corrected by returning to the plaintiff\u2019s account the said sum of $58,794.48 and by deleting from this said account the said transfer (N.B., meaning the transfer of the debit balances amounting to that sum of $58,794.48 from Mrs. Webster\u2019s account to Mrs. Buckland\u2019s account) and all interest charges in connection with it.\nIn truth, the conclusion implied in this last amendment was the only one aptly covering the facts and circumstances disclosed at the trial. Nevertheless, the new amendment was disallowed by the trial judge. While he permitted the respondent to amend in minor details some of the allegations of her declaration, he refused permission to amend her conclusions in the manner above set forth, on the ground that the new amendment was incompatible with the original conclusions and would \u201cchange the nature of the demand,\u201d contrary to the provisions of article 522 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nAs a result, and treating the respondent\u2019s proceedings as they stood before him, the trial judge dismissed the action as unfounded. But, although one of the grounds of dismissal was, no doubt, that the action as brought (and as legally amended up to the date of the judgment) could not be maintained having regard to the evidence, a further ground held by the trial judge was that the appellants were entitled to succeed because they had established that they were authorized by Mrs. Buckland to consolidate the accounts of herself and of her daughters and to charge to her the debit balances in her daughters\u2019 accounts.\nIn that way, the trial judge, though disposing of the litigation on the declaration as drafted, at the same time passed upon the real issue between the parties and decided that issue against the respondent.\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench, on the main issue, the judges were of opinion that the evidence adduced to prove the agreement was not legal; and, as a consequence of that opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed. Though the conclusions of the respondent for an accounting and for the return of the securities or, in the alternative, for a condemnation of $150,000 were rejected; though it was found that the conclusions for the payment of the specific sum of $58,793.98 could not be maintained, it was held possible on the pleadings to treat the action as one in the nature of a demand en reformation de compte. Accordingly, on the appeal, the adjudication was that, not only the two items amounting altogether to the sum of $58,793.98 (representing the debit balances transferred from Mrs. Webster\u2019s accounts), but all the items similarly transferred should be deleted from Mrs. Buckland\u2019s account, and that her action ought to have been maintained to that extent, with costs, reserving to her all her rights against the appellants in respect of her own account with them.\nThe appellants, in this Court, met the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench with two preliminary objections.\nIt was first said that it was not open to the appellate court to give the judgment it did on the pleadings as they stood. Indeed, it was urged that, in so doing, the Court of King\u2019s Bench had treated the action practically as if the last amendment prayed for by the respondent had been permitted, while, in fact, it had been disallowed by the trial judge.\nIn the second place, the appellants argued that, even assuming the action might be treated in that way by the appellate court, the adjudication made by it was ultra petita, since the respondent never asked for more than the striking out of the two particular debit charges transferred from Mrs. Webster\u2019s accounts and the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench goes further and also strikes out several other items transferred from Mrs. Webster\u2019s accounts and in regard to which no conclusions appeared in the respondent\u2019s declaration, even if due allowance be made for all the amendments sought to be introduced by her.\nTo the first objection of the appellants in that respect, the answer is that, undoubtedly, as stated at the opening of the present judgment, the true controversy between the parties and the only one really discussed at the trial, was whether on October 14, 1930, when Mrs. Buckland met Mr. Johnston, an agreement was reached whereby the firm of Johnston & Ward was authorized to liquidate all the accounts and to charge to Mrs. Buckland any resulting debit balances in the accounts of her daughters. That it was so, clearly appears from the judgment of the Superior Court, where the trial judge states that such question was\nthe only one in actual dispute and concerning which the rights of the parties can be seriously discussed.\nTrue, the learned judge, in using those words, refers solely to the prayer for a condemnation to pay the specific sum of $58,793.98, but that condemnation was sought as a consequence of the respondent\u2019s claim that no agreement of the nature and character alleged by the appellants had ever been made by her. The existence of that agreement was\n[Page 91\nthe bone of contention between the parties throughout the trial. Time and again, counsel on either side was heard to say that that question was \u201call that was before the Court at the moment in this case.\u201d The enqu\u00eate centred almost exclusively on the point whether the alleged agreement existed and whether it could be proved by oral evidence. The appellants themselves, in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, acknowledged that the main question on the appeal before that court was:\nWhether or not the appellant (the present respondent) at the interview with Mr. Johnston of October 14, 1930, authorized the respondents (now appellants) to consolidate her accounts with her daughters and to charge any debit balances in the latter to her.\nThe whole case was fought on that ground, to such an extent that, in its formal judgment, the Court of King\u2019s Bench characterizes the litigation by saying:\nC\u2019est \u00e0 ce seul point que se r\u00e9duit le litige et \u00e0 cette seule fin que la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nAnd, on the record, the assertion is justified in the most undisputable way.\nUnder the circumstances, the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench does not mean that, in a case such as this, the amendments made by the respondent should ordinarily be allowed consistently with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, and we do not wish to be understood ourselves as sustaining any such proposition. But what the Court of King\u2019s Bench states\u2014and that statement is fully warranted on the record\u2014is that, in the special circumstances of this case and having regard to the way the trial was conducted by the parties, it was and it is perfectly open to the courts to treat the litigation as one to have it decided whether or not the agreement contended for by the appellants was made by the respondent. In that view of the question, the objection of the appellants resolves itself into one of pure practice and procedure; and this is not a case where this Court would interfere with the decision of the highest court of final resort in the province. The whole defence of the appellants on that question was gone into and everything in any way pertaining to it was before the Superior Court. No possible injustice can have resulted against the appellants, and the Court of King\u2019s Bench having decided that, in the premises, the controversy as presented by the pleadings and as submitted at the trial opened the way to the adjudication made by that Court, it would not be in accordance with our usual practice to reverse its judgment upon an objection of the nature of that made by the appellants.\nNor do the appellants fare better on their second preliminary objection to the effect that the adjudication made by the appellate court is bad because it grants ultra petita. Assuming, as the Court of King\u2019s Bench did, that the real issue in the case was whether the agreement of October 14, 1930, had taken place, and that the issue was sufficiently raised by the pleadings or, at all events, that such was the issue fought at the trial, it follows that the consequential prayer in respect to an amount of $58,793.98 fully covered an adjudication in respect to a reduced amount.\nIt was claimed by the respondent that there was no such agreement and that, as a consequence, she was not properly charged with the two debit balances of Mrs. Webster\u2019s accounts. It stands to reason that, upon that point, having come to the conclusion that no agreement to that effect had been legally proven, the Court of King\u2019s Bench could, at the same time, decide that the result was not that Mrs. Buckland should have her account reduced by the deletion solely of the sum of $58,793.98 (representing only the two debit balances), but that all the items transferred by the appellants from Mrs. Webster\u2019s account on the assumption that the agreement existed, had to be struck from the respondent\u2019s account. That was the logical consequence of the decision reached by the Court of King\u2019s Bench. Any other conclusion in the premises would have been unfair to the appellants and very much open to challenge. It appears from the record that the net result of the adjudication appealed from is that a sum considerably lower than $58,793.98 was thereby struck from the respondent\u2019s account. Indeed, we were told at bar that when the final adjustment would be made on the basis of the judgment rendered by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the net amount whereof the respondent will benefit will prove to be in the neighbourhood of $10,000. We cannot see, therefore, how the appellants can contend that the judgment grants ultra petita; and, in our view, the effect of that judgment is exactly the other way.\nBut, for the same reason just stated, we think the respondent\u2019s preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of this Court also fails. It is apparent that the amount or value of the matter in controversy exceeds the sum of $2,000 (s. 39 of the Supreme Court Act). The respondent cannot, in the same breath, ask us to uphold the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, on the ground that the issue was whether the agreement of October 14, 1930, had been consented to by her (an agreement which is shown to involve a sum of at least $10,000) and then turn around to claim that the action is merely one for accounting and that, therefore, on the strength of some decisions in this Court, we have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. It is clear that the decisions on that score cited by the respondent (G\u00e9n\u00e9reux v. Bruneau[1]; Mathieu v. Mathieu[2]; Canada Car v. Bird[3]) in no way apply.\nThe preliminary objections made on behalf of both the appellants and the respondent must, therefore, be disregarded and we will now proceed to dispose of the main point in controversy.\nThe appellants were stock brokers in Montreal and had a branch in the city of Sherbrooke, where the respondent resided. In the month of August, 1926, the respondent entered upon the operation of a marginal trading account at that branch. As matters went on, the operations were made both on the New York and on the Montreal stock exchanges; and, for that purpose, an account was kept and known as the New York account and another account was kept and known as the Montreal account. About a year later, two daughters of Mrs. Buckland, Vera (Mrs. Webster), living in Sherbrooke, and Grace (later Mrs. Wasson, living in Boston), opened similar accounts of their own at the appellants\u2019 branch in Sherbrooke. They also traded in United States and Canadian securities and they also had each a New York account and a Canadian account. In addition to that and for reasons not material here, Mrs. Webster had a special New York account and a special Canadian account.\nThe accounts of Miss Grace never became of great importance; but Mrs. Buckland\u2019s and Mrs. Webster\u2019s gradually developed into heavy transactions, until they became what were probably the largest and most active accounts in the Sherbrooke branch.\nThen came the break in the market, in October, 1929. The accounts went under the margin and even under the market. Mrs. Buckland and Mrs. Webster were continually called upon to supply funds or securities to support their accounts; and there came a time when Mrs. Webster had given all she could in the way of money and securities. Mrs. Buckland was able to support Mrs. Webster and Miss Grace for a certain period. Then, it was found necessary to call another sister, Mrs. Greenleaf, of Decatur, Alabama, to the rescue; and some of the latter\u2019s securities were placed in Mrs. Webster\u2019s accounts. Later, the assistance of Miss Grace (who had become Mrs. Wasson) was also invoked; and, on the eve of the crucial interview between Mr. Johnston and Mrs. Buckland at Montreal, on October 14, 1930, Mrs. Buckland had just returned from Boston with some of Mrs. Wasson\u2019s securities for the purpose of supporting the accounts. There is a controversy as to whether it was only for her own account or also for Mrs. Webster\u2019s accounts; but this will be dealt with later.\nIn fact, the trip to Boston had been prompted by the reason that the appellants were pressing both Mrs. Buckland and Mrs. Webster for further margin; and, as she admitted to McAnulty, the manager of the Sherbrooke branch, the respondent was finding it\nvery heavy on her carrying those accounts * * * having to take care of them at that time.\nMrs. Buckland was a widow who had inherited from her husband the ownership of a newspaper known as The Sherbrooke Record. The paper was fairly prosperous and was bringing to Mrs. Buckland something like $11,000 annually. She had also owned interests in the O\u2019Cedar Manufacturing Company, which she had sold for a large amount, so that admittedly when she started her speculations on the stock markets, she enjoyed considerable wealth.\nAfter Mrs. Buckland returned from Boston, she went to the branch of the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Sherbrooke and endeavoured to borrow from that bank, on her Sherbrooke Record stock as collateral, a sum of between $245,000 to $250,000, with the avowed purpose of using that money to pay off all the accounts of herself and her daughters with the appellants. The local manager of the bank said that he recommended the loan, but the head office was unwilling to put it through.\nHaving failed in her proposition to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Mrs. Buckland expressed to McAnulty the desire to have an interview with Mr. Johnston; and this was arranged to take place in Montreal on October 14, 1930.\nBefore leaving for Montreal and in order to protect the accounts in the meantime, Mrs. Buckland deposited in the hands of McAnulty the securities belonging to Mrs. Wasson and which she had brought from Boston.\nWe have stated that there was a controversy as to whether the securities were left for the purpose of supporting only Mrs. Buckland\u2019s own accounts, or whether they were also deposited for the purpose of Mrs. Webster\u2019s accounts. As this point of fact is important, it may be cleared up at once. Unfortunately there is no express holding of the trial judge on that fact. McAnulty is positive that the securities were left for the protection of Mrs. Webster\u2019s account. Mrs. Buckland, in her deposition on discovery, referring to the incident, says in terms:\nYes, I had taken in some securities to Mr. McAnulty to cover my account and my daughters\u2019.\nWe are asked to disregard that answer, on the ground that it must be a mistake in the transcription of the stenographer\u2019s notes. It should be observed that this request could hardly be entertained in this Court. If there really was an error in the transcription of Mrs. Buckland\u2019s evidence, it should be pointed out that the alleged error appears in her deposition on discovery taken almost a year and a half before the trial, and that the so-called error was allowed to remain in the record since that time throughout the trial and throughout the proceedings before the Court of King\u2019s Bench, while a very simple procedure for correction is provided by the Code of Civil Procedure (art. 348), of which the respondent could have availed herself long before the hearing in this Court. We fear that, in the premises, we are not in a position to come to the relief of the respondent in that respect. It is true that the following questions and answers in the deposition on discovery lend some colour to the contention of counsel for the respondent; but even if Mrs. Buckland should be held to have stated on discovery that Mrs. Wasson\u2019s securities were deposited solely in support of her own account, there would stand against her statement the very positive assertion to the contrary made by McAnulty, whose evidence is supported by all the surrounding circumstances; for Mrs. Buckland had been in the habit of depositing securities to support Mrs. Webster\u2019s account; it was quite a usual thing for her to do, whether we call it a loan of the securities to Mrs. Webster or a straight pledge of the securities in aid of Mrs. Webster\u2014a point to which Mrs. Webster seemed to attach a great deal of importance, but which is of no real consequence for the purposes of this case.\nBut, above all, the main reason for accepting Mr. McAnulty\u2019s version is that, before Mrs. Buckland left for Montreal, Mrs. Webster\u2019s account needed support; it was badly in want of additional margin; the appellants had notified her that, if margin was not forthcoming, the securities held in her account would have to be sold at once. If, therefore, Mrs. Wasson\u2019s securities, on the morning of the Montreal interview had not been deposited with McAnulty in support of Mrs. Webster\u2019s account, the purpose would not have been served; the account would have been left unprotected; and there would have been no reason why McAnulty would have held it until he got the report of what had happened in Montreal. We think it must be held that McAnulty was right when he testified that the securities brought from Boston had been deposited with him as well for Mrs. Webster\u2019s account as for Mrs. Buck-land\u2019s. All the circumstances point in that direction.\nWe may now resume our recital of the trend of events interrupted by the digression just concluded.\nFor the purpose of the Montreal interview, Mrs. Buckland had caused McAnulty to prepare for her a list of all the securities held by the appellants for the accounts both of herself and of her daughters. She brought in that list with her in the office of Mr. Johnston and gave it to him. He called for his own record; and then proceeded to figure out what was the exact position of all the accounts. She offered to pledge her Sherbrooke Record stock in support of all the accounts This was discussed and Mr. Johnston advised her not to do so. The reason for this advice is thus stated by him:\nYou made a substantial loss on those operations in which you have engaged, and it is my opinion you should hold out that Sherbrooke Record stock. It gives you a revenue of $10,000 a year, and in Sherbrooke you could live on that.\nWe were asked by counsel on both sides to assume that Mr. Johnston had other reasons for refusing the Sherbrooke Record stock\u2014other reasons which he, at least, did not disclose. We do not think we should be called upon to speculate on what he had in his mind, in view of the fact that a long cross-examination failed to detract in any way from his own version of the motive which prompted him on that occasion.\nIt is fair to say that Johnston admitted that the Sherbrooke Record stock was \u201cnot a type of security upon which he would lend\u201d, but one is often willing to accept security in support of an already existing debt, although not prepared to make a new loan on that security. We do not think much help comes to the respondent from that admission.\nThe suggestion of pledging the Sherbrooke Record stock in aid of all the accounts having been discarded, it was incumbent upon Mrs. Buckland to find other means of meeting the situation and, no other acceptable suggestion being forthcoming from her, it was then that Mr. Johnston advised the respondent to liquidate all the accounts and proceeded to make an estimate, as of that date\u2019s market values, of all the securities, in order to figure out what debit or credit balance would remain in each account and what mutual transfers would be required to balance them; whereupon, according to the appellant\u2019s version, Mrs. Buckland said:\nNever mind doing that. Treat them all as one. I am responsible for them all. Close out the accounts; and, if there is any balance in the others, charge it against my accounts.\nThis is positively asserted both by Mr. Johnston and by Mr. Murray, in charge of Johnston & Ward\u2019s branch office accounts, who was present at the meeting.\nMrs. Buckland returned to Sherbrooke and, the next morning, she telephoned to McAnulty the result of the interview. McAnulty\u2019s version of what she then told him is as follows:\nShe said Mr. Johnston advised her not to put up any more collateral but to liquidate those accounts. She said they considered all the accounts in there as one and she instructed me to sell the accounts that morning, and that she would be down to see me later. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Buckland that morning did call on McAnulty. She is stated to have then repeated that: \u201cIn Montreal, they treat those accounts as one.\u201d McAnulty is asked whether he told Mrs. Buckland that the instructions he had received from Mr. Johnston were to put all the accounts together and charge them to her. His answer is:\nYes, because that was the condition upon which I gave her back the securities. I could not give them back otherwise.\nCounsel for the respondent may be right in pointing out that the latter part of that answer is argument rather than a statement of what McAnulty said. It is open to that interpretation. But the fact remains that Mrs. Wasson\u2019s securities left with McAnulty on the previous day for the purpose, as we have found, of supporting both Mrs. Buck-land\u2019s and Mrs. Webster\u2019s accounts, were delivered back to Mrs. Buckland; and the appellants thus deprived themselves of securities estimated, that day, at $11,420 and which otherwise they would have been entitled to hold. McAnulty\u2019s assertion is that he returned those securities to Mrs. Buckland upon instructions from the head office.\nWhen Mrs. Buckland came to McAnulty\u2019s office that morning, she brought with her a list of securities, which, at the trial, was marked \u201cExhibit D2.\u201d That was a list of securities belonging to Mrs. Greenleaf and which, from time to time, had been pledged to margin Mrs. Webster\u2019s account. The list also included certain securities supplied by Mrs. Buckland. The object of bringing that list to Mr. McAnulty was for the purpose, admitted by Mrs. Buckland, of asking him to keep those securities up to the last, that is: that Mrs. Buckland wished all the other securities in the accounts to be liquidated first and to keep the securities enumerated on the list D2 until it should be found necessary to sell them in order to balance the accounts.\nImmediately after Mrs. Buckland\u2019s visit to McAnulty that morning, the appellants began to liquidate the accounts and to sell the securities. As the sales were made, sold notes would be sent, in each instance, to Mrs. Buckland or to Mrs. Webster, advising them of the particulars of the sales, in accordance with the usual practice of stock brokers. On October 21, 1930, Murray (already referred to as having been present at the Montreal interview of October 14, 1930), telegraphed to McAnulty: Understand all accounts are to be consolidated. Also transfer funds as required.\nIt is established that this telegram had reference to what were known in the office as the \u201cChannell accounts,\u201d meaning: the accounts of Mrs. Buckland, Mrs. Webster and Miss Grace Channell.\nAt the end of October and of November, 1930, the usual monthly statements of their accounts were sent to Mrs. Buckland and Mrs. Webster respectively. The liquidation and sale of the securities in all accounts was completed by the 15th of December, 1930; and then the consolidation was made, placing in the name of Mrs. Buckland the credit balance in Mrs. Webster\u2019s New York account, representing the very substantial sum of $37,113.47, and also charging to Mrs. Buckland\u2019s account the several debit balances shown in Mrs. Webster\u2019s other accounts (two items of which made up the sum of $58,793.98, in regard to which alone conclusions were taken in Mrs. Buckland\u2019s declaration), and, at the same time, transferring to Mrs. Buckland\u2019s account the debit balance against Miss Grace Channell (Mrs. Wasson), and transferring also to the credit of Mrs. Buckland all the securities remaining in her daughters\u2019 accounts and which had not been sold. The result was that, on that date, in the language of the stock exchange, the accounts of Mrs. Webster and of Miss Channell became \u201cflat\u201d or even and the account of Mrs. Buckland was charged with the debits of her two daughters, but at the same time benefited from the transfer of the credits in money and in outstanding securities from those accounts. As already mentioned, it was stated at bar that the whole of the transfers was equivalent to a debit charge to Mrs. Buckland of approximately $10,000.\nBy that time, however, Mrs. Buckland had already asked her solicitors to take charge of the matter; and, since December, 1930, the latter had been asking Messrs. Johnston & Ward\nto replace and deliver to (their) client immediately all stocks which were sold after the credit balance in (her) American account was equal to the debit balance in (her) Canadian account.\nIn turn, Messrs. Johnston & Ward referred the matter to their solicitors; and, following the correspondence exchanged between the respective solicitors during the course of the month of December, 1930, and on the 2nd January, 1931, Mrs. Buckland was furnished with the monthly statements r prepared at the end of each month, showing how her account stood as a result of the consolidation of all the accounts. Additional correspondence ensued for a month or so, Johnston & Ward, through their solicitors, putting forward that all they had done, as shown in the consolidated account, was done in accordance with the instructions of Mrs. Buckland, and the latter, through her solicitors, denying Johnston & Ward\u2019s\ncontention that she gave instruction to sell the securities so that accounts other than her own might benefit from the proceeds.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that, when Mrs. Buckland brought her action, she was fully aware of the appellants\u2019 contention, and, notwithstanding her being aware of that fact and that they were relying on such an agreement, she brought her action for an accounting and for the return of the securities which had been sold from her account, without in any way referring to the transfers from her daughters\u2019 accounts and without praying that these transfers and charges be struck from her account. It was only much later that she moved for the amendment already discussed at the beginning of this judgment, remotely referring to the transfers from Mrs. Webster\u2019s account and, at that, incorrectly describing them. She never squarely asked in terms to delete from her consolidated account the transfers made to it as of December 15, 1930, by the appellants. Even in her last motion, presented after the whole enqu\u00eate was over, she moved for an amendment referring only to the two transfers of debit balances amounting to $58,793.98. And it was only through the adjudication made by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in the circumstances already discussed, that the other transfers were ordered to be deleted. As for the transfers charged from Miss Grace\u2019s accounts, they have never, to the present date, been requested to be struck from the respondent\u2019s account; and she made it clear, in the course of the trial, that she was not objecting to them.\nIt was under those circumstances that the trial judge came to the conclusion that the evidence had established the existence of the agreement alleged by the appellants and whereby they were authorized to consolidate the accounts and to make to the respondent\u2019s account the transfers in question from the accounts of both her daughters.\nThis finding made by the trial judge was not disturbed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench. Suffice it to say that, so far as we are concerned, we are of opinion that the finding could not be disturbed and that it is fully warranted by the evidence on record.\nThis means that the action of the respondent was rightly dismissed by the Superior Court, unless we should come to the conclusion, as the Court of King\u2019s Bench did, that the agreement on which the appellants relied was not susceptible of being proven by oral testimony; for the agreement was not made in writing and, in order to establish it, the appellants had to resort solely to verbal evidence.\nThe inadmissibility of that oral evidence was the ground on which the Court of King\u2019s Bench came to the conclusion that the judgment of the Superior Court ought to be reversed.\nUnder the law of Quebec (art. 1233 C.C.), proof may be made by testimony:\n1. Of all facts concerning commercial matters;\n* * *\n7. In cases in (which there is a commencement of proof in writing. In all other matters, proof must be made by writing or by the oath of the adverse party.\nWe have omitted the other provisions of article 1233 C.C., limiting our citation to the paragraphs on which the appellants relied for their contention that verbal evidence was admissible in this matter.\nBoth courts below held that the verbal evidence was not admissible as constituting proof of \u201cfacts concerning commercial matters\u201d; and, as we agree with them, we do not feel that we should discuss the point at any length.\nIt was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Forget vs. Baxter[4] that in an action by stockbrokers against their principal to recover the balance of their account in respect of sales and purchases on his account, these transactions were \u201ccommercial matters\u201d within article 1233 of the Civil Code which the stockbrokers might prove by oral evidence; and, of course, this judgment was greatly relied on by the appellants. But it is well to look at the judgment and to see what were the transactions that their Lordships of the Privy Council held to have been \u201ccommercial matters\u201d in that case. Sir Henry Strong delivered the judgment of the Board; and, referring to this particular point, he said:\nNeither in this or in any other article of the code is there to be found any definition of the meaning of the term \u201ccommercial matters.\u201d It cannot be doubted that the business carried on by the appellants as stockbrokers was of a commercial nature, nor that the purchases and sales of shares by the appellants for the behoof of the respondent in the ordinary course of that business were operations of commerce. It does not appear to their Lordships that the fact that the respondent was not himself a dealer trading in shares, but that his object in buying and selling through the agency of the appellants was that of private speculation only, in any way detracts from the commercial character of these transactions as regards the appellants. Unless such a construction is adopted, very great inconvenience, if not actual obstruction, must result in the despatch of business according to the methods in general use, for it must be often impossible to obtain the strict literal proof required in ordinary civil matters. Their Lordships are, therefore, of opinion that the execution by the appellants of the respondent\u2019s commissions constituted \u201ccommercial matters\u201d within art. 1233 which it was open to them to prove by oral evidence.\nAs will appear from the above passage, what their Lordships term \u201ccommercial matters within art. 1233\u201d are\nthe purchases and sales of shares by the appellants for the behoof of the respondent in the ordinary course of (their) business * * * as stockbrokers, (or) the execution by the appellants of the respondent\u2019s commissions.\nBut the judgment does not go any further; and it is clear that what is there called \u201coperations of commerce\u201d does not include any agreement such as the one now put forward by the appellants.\nWhatever may be the correct legal description of the agreement alleged to have been made by the respondent, it does not come within the transactions made by stockbrokers in the ordinary course of their business. It is, on the part of the respondent, an undertaking to pay to the appellants a sum due by a third party and, as such, we have no doubt that it must be treated as a civil matter or, at all events,\u2014and that is sufficient for the purposes of this case\u2014that it does not come within the term \u201ccommercial matters\u201d in paragraph 1 of article 1233 of the Civil Code.\nIt is not an undertaking in the ordinary nature of dealings between stockbrokers and their clients. On that point, we find ourselves in agreement with both the Superior Court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe reason why the Superior Court held the proof of the agreement admissible was that it found sufficient commencement of proof in writing under article 1233 (7) C.C., to let in oral evidence of the particulars; and, on that ground, we must say that, with great respect and contrary to the view entertained by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, we agree with the trial judge.\nAs we understand it\u2014for there is in the Civil Code no definition of what should be understood by \u201ccommencement of proof in writing\u201d\u2014the expression connotes a writing emanating from the party against whom it is to be used which tend to render probable the existence of the fact which is desired to be proved. This agrees with the definition of Pothier (3e \u00e9d. Bugnet, vol. 2, Trait\u00e9 des Obligations, p. 430, no. 801):\nLorsqu\u2019on a contre quelqu\u2019un, par un \u00e9crit authentique o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait partie ou par un \u00e9crit priv\u00e9, \u00e9crit ou sign\u00e9 de sa main, la preuve, non \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du fait total qu\u2019on a avanc\u00e9, mais de quelque chose qui y conduit ou en fait partie.\nIf one looks through the doctrine and the jurisprudence, he will find that the commentators and the courts all agree on a definition substantially in the above terms. It is not necessarily required that the writing should be in the hand of the party against whom it is sought to be used or that it should be signed by that party, it is sufficient if it \u201cemanates\u201d from him; and the French Civil Code (art. 1347) contains a definition which uses precisely the word \u201c\u00e9maner.\u201d In some cases, this has been held to extend to a writing, though not in the handwriting of the party or though not signed by him, yet which is used by him as his own (\u201c\u00e9crit qu\u2019il fait sien et dont il use comme s\u2019il \u00e9tait de lui\u201d).\nSo far, therefore, so as to have a commencement of proof in writing sufficient to let in oral evidence:\n1st: there must be a writing;\n2nd: the writing must emanate from the party against whom it is used;\n3rd: the writing must tend to render probable (in French \u201cvraisemblable\u201d) the fact which it is desired to be proved.\nBut it has come to be understood, both in the French doctrine and in the French jurisprudence, that the writing required for the commencement of proof may be replaced by the evidence of the party; and that question need not be discussed here, since the principle was incorporated in the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec (art. 316):\nA party may be examined by the opposite party and his evidence may be used as a commencement of proof in writing.\nThen, there is another principle which is generally accepted; and that is that the question whether there is a writing, and the further question whether that writing emanates from the party, are questions of law; but the question whether the writing, or the evidence of the party against whom it is used, tends to render probable the existence of the fact which it is desired to be proved, is a question of fact. The principle, we think, is well expressed in the following passage of Mignault, Droit Civil Canadien, vol. 6, pp. 79 & 80:\nLa question de savoir si un \u00e9crit quelconque rend vraisemblable le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 comme commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit est une question de fait enti\u00e8rement abandonn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du tribunal.\nIn the present case, there was both a writing (Ex. D2) which emanated from the respondent, at least in this sense that, to use the words of Aubry & Rau (tome VI, p. 451): \u201cElle se l\u2019\u00e9tait rendu propre par son acceptation expresse ou tacite\u201d\u2014a passage cited with approval by Demolombe (Trait\u00e9 des contrats, tome 7, \u00e9dit, par Paul Grevin, page 146, no. 132):\u2014and there was also the evidence of the respondent which, by force of art. 316 of the Code of Civil Procedure, could be used as a commencement of proof.\nThe two first conditions required by law, therefore, existed; and there can be shown no misdirection on the part of the trial judge in these respects.\nThis being so, the further question whether the writing Ex. D2 or the respondent\u2019s evidence rendered probable the existence of the agreement which it was desired to be proved, was nothing but a question of fact for the decision of the trial judge. We need not dwell on the function of an appellate tribunal in respect to a question of fact. It has been stated in this Court as often as the question came up. We find it defined in a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec, in the case of Ruthman v. La Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec[5]. It is expressed thus: Sans doute, la loi permet l\u2019appel sur le fait comme sur le droit. Mais lorsqu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit que d\u2019une question de fait, le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance ne doit \u00eatre infirm\u00e9 que s\u2019il y a eu erreur manifeste du juge dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve.\nEven if some allowance should be made to avoid too stringent an application of the practice on this subject, the passage just quoted shows that the principle is recognized in the jurisprudence of the Quebec courts.\nAnd if it be so in ordinary practice, we have no doubt that the rule must be more strictly adhered to when it is applied to the question of whether the commencement of proof in writing is sufficient to let in oral evidence. In support of that proposition, let us refer to the commentators and the jurisprudence on that point. Pothier expresses it (Trait\u00e9 des obligations, no. 801, \u00e9d. Bugnet, vol. 2):\nIl est laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage du juge de juger du degr\u00e9 de preuve par \u00e9crit pour, sur ce degr\u00e9 de preuve, permettre la preuve testimoniale.\nThe use of the word \u201carbitrage\u201d so used by Pothier is so strong that it might even be understood to mean that the holding of the trial judge is decisive.\nAmong the more recent authorities, expressions are to be found of a somewhat similar character. Speaking on the same subject, Demolombe (vol. 30, no. 139) says:\nL\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du degr\u00e9 plus ou moins grand de vraisemblance appartient souverainement, en fait, aux magistrats.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie & Barde, 3e \u00e9d. Des Obligations, tome 4e, no. 2614, after having stated that\nLes caract\u00e8res du commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit * * * i.e. si un \u00e9crit \u00e9man\u00e9 soit de celui \u00e0 qui on l\u2019oppose, soit de la personne qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sente ou par laquelle il \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, constitue une question de droit; et, par suite, la v\u00e9rification de l\u2019existence de cette condition rentre dans les attributions de la Cour de cassation.\nthen go on to say:\nMais le point de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9crit invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de commencement de preuve rend vraisemblable le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est, au contraire, une question de fait et, en cons\u00e9quence, les juges du fond l\u2019appr\u00e9cient souverainement.\nThis is in accordance with the passage of Mignault already referred to.\nPlaniol & Ripert (Trait\u00e9 pratique de droit civil, tome 7, no. 1534) consider it as\nune question de pertinence dont le juge du fond est le souverain appr\u00e9ciateur.\nAubry & Rau (5e \u00e9d. vol. 12, p. 362) do likewise.\nAs for Larombi\u00e8re (Th\u00e9orie des Obligations, \u00e9dition de 1885, tome 6e, at page 506) and Laurent (3e \u00e9d. tome 19e, p. 550), they go still further. Larombi\u00e8re says:\nLa question de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9crit invoqu\u00e9 rend vraisemblable ou non le cas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est abandonn\u00e9 dans tous les cas \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation discr\u00e9tionnaire du juge, qui n\u2019a alors d\u2019autre r\u00e8gle de d\u00e9cision que l\u2019examen consciencieux des circonstances de la cause. A lui seul appartient de r\u00e9soudre cette question de vraisemblance.\nAnd Laurent:\nPuisque l\u2019article 1347 d\u00e9finit le commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, le juge ne peut sans violer la loi s\u2019\u00e9carter de cette d\u00e9finition en admettant, par exemple, comme faisant commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit un acte qui n\u2019\u00e9mane point de celui \u00e0 qui on l\u2019oppose, ni de celui qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sente ou par lequel il est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Mais il y a aussi une question de fait; c\u2019est celle de la vraisemblance qui r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019\u00e9crit. Sur ce point, les juges du fait jouissent d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et, par cons\u00e9quent, ils d\u00e9cident souverainement.\nThe principle so expounded by the distinguished commentators to whom reference has just been made was applied, amongst other cases, in the province of Quebec, by the Court of Review, in the case of Malenfant v. Pelletier[6] where Sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux, C.J., speaking on behalf of the full court, said\nL\u2019ancienne Cour d\u2019appel a appliqu\u00e9 une r\u00e8gle l\u00e9gale dans l\u2019affaire de Fournier v. Morin[7]. C\u2019est qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re de preuve testimoniale admise vu l\u2019existence d\u2019un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance exerce un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et que les tribunaux d\u2019appel ne doivent troubler l\u2019existence de cette discr\u00e9tion que dans le cas d\u2019erreur manifeste. Cette r\u00e8gle bas\u00e9e sur le bon sens le plus \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et sur la loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suivie par les tribunaux d\u2019appel; et lorsque ces tribunaux s\u2019en sont \u00e9cart\u00e9s, ils ont, \u00e0 notre avis, commis une erreur grave.\nAnd, with due respect, it seems to us that from the very nature of the question it ought to be so for the reason so well expressed in Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire du droit fran\u00e7ais, vol. 31 vbis. Preuve par \u00e9crit (commencement de) p. 584, no. 232, and which we would like to adopt as our own:\nIl n\u2019est pas possible de tracer des r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises d\u2019apr\u00e8s lesquelles on puisse reconna\u00eetre les cas o\u00f9 un \u00e9crit doit rendre vraisemblable le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9. La vraisemblance est en effet un aper\u00e7u de l\u2019esprit qui nous porte \u00e0 penser qu\u2019une chose a tout au moins l\u2019apparence du vrai: elle est fond\u00e9e sur la liaison ou la connexit\u00e9 plus ou moins grande qui existe entre l\u2019\u00e9crit et le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9, et comme cette liaison peut \u00eatre plus ou moins \u00e9loign\u00e9e, il est \u00e9vident que la vraisemblance varie \u00e0 l\u2019infini, suivant les faits et suivant les esprits qui ont \u00e0 les appr\u00e9cier.\u2014Toullier, t. 8, n. 293, et t. 9, n. 56; Bonnier (\u00e9d. Larnaude), n. 169; Laurent, t. 19 n. 527 et s.; Demolombe, t. 30, n. 138 et s.; Aubry et Rau, t. 8, 764, p. 340; Larombi\u00e8re sur Part. 1347 n. 27 et s.; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Pr\u00e9cis, t. 2, n. 1275; Fuzier-Herman et Darras, sur l\u2019art. 1347, n. 161.\nWe do not intend to lay down here such a strict rule as that which would seem to follow from the statements of the commentators or of Sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux in the case of Malenfant v. Pelletier[8], for we do not believe it is necessary to go so far in the present case.\nWe are of opinion that there was ample justification for the trial judge to use the writing marked Exhibit D2, and more particularly the evidence of the respondent, as a commencement of proof in writing sufficient to permit the appellants to adduce verbal evidence of the agreement which they alleged.\nIt was pointed out by Mr. Justice Walsh that\na willingness to help support another is not necessarily the assumption of another\u2019s debt;\nand by Mr. Justice Saint-Jacques that\nElle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 faire tous les sacrifices possibles pour emp\u00eacher la liquidation imm\u00e9diate; * * * mais de l\u00e0 \u00e0 conclure que * * * elle aurait entrepris de payer le d\u00e9ficit du compte de sa fille * * * il y a une marge * * *.\nThese propositions, of course, should probably be accepted, but such was not, in our view, the point upon which the trial judge had to make up his mind. He had to decide whether, in his opinion, these facts and the others admitted by Mrs. Buckland in her evidence or to be deduced from the use she was making of the writing Exhibit D2, were of such a character that they rendered probable (\u201cvraisemblable\u201d) that, having failed to persuade Johnston to accept her other propositions, she had, in the end, agreed to what the appellants allege had been the final outcome of the interview in Montreal on October 14, 1930. And after having reached the conclusion that this was rendered probable by what was admitted in Mrs. Buckland\u2019s evidence or what could be deduced from Exhibit D2, the trial judge then declared the oral evidence of the agreement admissible in view of the commencement of proof in writing which he found in Mrs. Buckland\u2019s testimony and in the writing D2; and upon that evidence being adduced, he found that the agreement had been proven. As observed by Langelier, De la preuve en mati\u00e8re civile et commerciale, p. 241, no. 574:\nL\u2019\u00e9crit doit rendre vraisemblable le fait \u00e0 prouver. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019\u00e9crit le prouve; car, s\u2019il le prouvait, ce ne serait plus un commencement de preuve, mais une preuve compl\u00e8te qu\u2019il constituerait. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, non plus, qu\u2019il le fasse pr\u00e9sumer, car alors il rendrait la preuve par t\u00e9moins inutile. And what is said there of a writing is, of course, equally true of the respondent\u2019s evidence, by force of art. 316 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This brings us back to the statement of Pothier (loc cit.):\nLa preuve, non \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du fait total qu\u2019on a avanc\u00e9, mais de quelque chose qui y conduit.\nand, as stated in Planiol (tome 7, no. 1534):\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019\u00e9crit \u00e9tablisse un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du fait \u00e0 prouver. Il peut \u00eatre seulement le point de d\u00e9part d\u2019un raisonnement pour le juge. Le lien qui doit exister * * * lien de similitude * * * est laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 son enti\u00e8re appr\u00e9ciation.\nIt would serve no purpose for us to enter into the details of the testimony of the respondent in order to point out wherein the learned trial judge was warranted in finding in it evidence which could be used as a commencement of proof in writing. It is not so much each single fact admitted by the respondent as the \u201censemble\u201d of the facts so admitted which justified the holding that the learned trial judge made. We would be prepared to say that, had we been in his place, we would have come to the same conclusion; but it is sufficient to state that, at all events, we cannot find any justification for reversing his decision on that question. It may be that he gave too much importance to certain facts testified to by the respondent; it would seem to us that, on the other hand, he may not have given proper importance to certain other admissions; but, on the whole, we think the result of his findings is not open to criticism, more particularly if we bear in mind the views of the doctrine and the jurisprudence on the subject. (See Mathieu J., re Kay v. Gibeau[9], and numerous authorities there referred to).\nIn addition to the commencement of proof which he found in the admissions of the respondent, the learned judge further declared\nthat, on important points, plaintiff\u2019s testimony was often evasive, confused and contradictory.\nOf course, a finding of that nature was peculiarly within the province of the trial judge, who was in the best position to pass upon it; and it is needless to recall that such a situation has always been recognized as a valid basis of commencement of proof in writing. (Demolombe, vo. 30, p. 139; Baudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 15, no. 2613; Langlois v. Labb\u00e9[10]; Gagn\u00e9 v. Gagn\u00e9[11]; Boisclair v. Les Commissaires d\u2019Ecoles de St. G\u00e9rard de Magella, Cour de R\u00e9vision[12].\nFor these reasons, we have come to the conclusion that the appeal ought to be maintained and that, in the result, but subject to a further question still to be discussed, the judgment of the trial judge should be restored with costs throughout against the respondent.\nBut, unfortunately for the parties, this does not dispose of the whole case; for, by an amendment to her answer to plea, the respondent raised the subsidiary point that, even if she had agreed to assume liability for the indebtedness of her daughter, Mrs. Vera Webster, to the appellants, the transactions of Mrs. Webster were null and void because they were entered into without the authority of her husband and the agreement, therefore, ought to be set aside and annulled.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench did not pass upon that point because it was unnecessary, having regard to the view that Court took on the question of the commencement of proof in writing. But the Superior Court, in order to dismiss the action, was evidently obliged to decide the point, and it dismissed the respondent\u2019s contention in that respect for the following reasons:\n(1) the husband being the only person who could give or refuse the necessary authorization, his testimony was the only original source from which the information could be gathered;\n(2) his wife, outside of the fact that she was necessarily interested in testifying on behalf of her mother, was\nnot the real and legal source from which it can be gathered as to whether or not his authorization was ever given.\n(3) the evidence of Mrs. Webster to the effect that she was not authorized did not adduce the best proof of which the case was susceptible (1204 C.C.);\n(4) Mrs. Webster was \u201cpresumed to have been authorized\u201d; and\n(5) \u201cthe disposition of the law which renders invalid the acts of an authorized married woman was enacted for the protection of such person alone and not for the protection of third parties, and, therefore, does not apply to the plaintiff.\u201d\nWe are of opinion that this important question may not be disposed of in that way.\nIn so far as it tends to dispute the right of Mrs. Buckland to raise the point, the decision of the learned judge would seem to be directly contrary to art. 183 of the Civil Code:\n183. The want of authorization by the husband, where it is necessary, constitutes a cause of nullity which nothing can cover, and which may be taken advantage of by all those who have an existing and actual interest in doing so.\nIn so far as the decision of the learned judge was directed towards the proof of the lack of authorization adduced by the sole testimony of Mrs. Webster, it appears to us that the objection goes to the weight rather than to the legality of the evidence. (Taylor on Evidence, 12th ed., no. 393). But, in view of the conclusion to which we have arrived and presently to be announced, we prefer to refrain from expressing our own opinion on that whole question of the husband\u2019s authorization.\nIt is clear to us that no pronouncement can be made upon that point, which involves matters in which the appellants and Mrs. Webster are primarily interested, without Mrs. Webster being a party in the case; and she is not a party. This Court has always adhered to that principle (Burland v. Moffatt[13]; Lalibert\u00e9 v. Larue[14]; Goulet v. Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Gervais[15].\nOf course, it was Mrs. Buckland\u2019s duty to call Mrs. Webster as a party, since she raised the point necessitating the latter\u2019s mise-en-cause and since the point could not be decided without Mrs. Webster being made a party in the case. On that account, following the precedent in Burland v. Moffatt13, we might have disregarded that ground for the simple reason that the respondent, having failed to put the Court in a position to grant the relief prayed for by her, her demand must be dismissed. But while, generally speaking, we would probably do so in ordinary cases, we do not think it ought to be done in a case like the present one, where the question raised is one of public order and the law says that the want of authorization by the husband, where it is necessary, constitutes a cause of nullity which nothing can cover.\nIt is not so much that the undertaking of the respondent to pay the appellants and to assume liability for the indebtedness of Mrs. Webster to them must be set aside and annulled in so far as Mrs. Buckland is concerned (as was prayed for by the conclusions of the amended answer to plea), but the situation is that if Mrs. Webster\u2019s transactions can be brought within the prohibition contained in article 177 of the Civil Code, and that is to say: that those transactions cannot be held to have been authorized by her husband, within the meaning of that article, these transactions would be radically null; her debt to the appellants would be non-existent and, therefore, notwithstanding the agreement made by Mrs. Buckland, there would be nothing to pay for her. It would seem that, in that case, all of Mrs. Webster\u2019s transactions so unauthorized would have to be considered as not having taken place and both the credit and debit charges in her account would have to be assumed and borne by Johnston & Ward. (Johnston v. Channell[16].\nThe situation is still more compelling since it was alleged and it was common ground that Mrs. Webster has herself brought action to have all her transactions with Johnston & Ward set aside on account of the lack of authorization of her husband. It is easy to see the inconvenience that would result from a decision by us on that point in a case where she is not a party, if later, in her own case against the present appellants, the courts should decide in a different way. In truth, were Mrs. Webster one of the parties in the present case, the fact that she has a case of her own on the same point against the appellant would almost constitute a situation of lis pendens and it might, no doubt, be found proper, under such circumstances, to order that the present case should be suspended, at least so far as that issue is concerned, until the other case has been finally determined.\nThe consequence is that, much to our regret, we are constrained to adopt the course followed by this Court in the case of Lamarre v. Prud\u2019homme, referred to at p. 441 in La Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Gervais v. Goulet[17]; and the case must be remitted to the Superior Court for the purpose of trying that issue\u2014but it must be understood that it is so returned for that sole purpose.\nOn all the other questions, our decision is that the judgment of the Superior Court is, in the result, restored. On the issue arising out of the question of the authorization of Mrs. Webster\u2019s husband, if the respondent wishes to have a decision, she will have to take proper steps for the raise-en-cause of Mrs. Webster within one month from the date when the record is in due course returned to the Superior Court of the district of Montreal, where it belongs. Unless she adopts the necessary proceedings for that purpose within the delay now ordered, her action should stand finally dismissed for all purposes. The costs of the trial on this special issue will, of course, be in the discretion of the judge who will preside at the trial. In all other respects, the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court is restored with costs throughout against the respondent.\nThe formal judgment of the Court was settled as follows: The appeal is allowed with costs throughout; the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) is reversed and set aside and, in the result, the judgment of the Superior Court for the province of Quebec, sitting in and for the district of Montreal, is restored, save in so far as the same purported to deal with the issues of fact and law raised by or arising out of the allegation made by the appellants and the respondent relative to the alleged lack of marital authorization of Dame V. C. Webster, as to which issues, the said Dame V. C Webster not being a party to the present proceedings, the Court declines to adjudicate; and this Court further orders that this case be remitted to the said Superior Court for the sole purpose of enabling the respondent, if she so desires, to institute by impleading the said Dame V. C Webster within one month from the date of the return of the record herein to the said Superior Court, the necessary proceedings to try the sole issue of whether the transactions of the said Dame V. C. Webster with the appellants referred to in the amended answer to plea herein, were null, and if they were null, what is the effect, if any, of such nullity, as between the appellants and the respondent; and this Court further orders that the appellants be permitted to raise or allege or plead, at or for the purpose of the trial of such issue, in addition to any ground or matter already raised or alleged or pleaded, any other ground or matter or thing whatsoever directed solely to the trial of such issue, the question whether Mrs. Webster\u2019s transactions with the appellants are null and void for want of marital authorization, together with the consequences which flow from it, being the sole issue to be submitted to the Superior Court, without any objection being allowed as to the questions of procedure already decided; and this Court further orders that unless the respondent adopt the aforesaid proceedings within the above-mentioned period of one month, the action should stand finally dismissed for all purposes.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett & Hannen.\n[1] (1910) 47 Can.

Mildmay, [1937] 3 All E.R. 402, at 425, 426. Decision on that question not given (as being unnecessary in the present case); but inclination intimated of view in favour of that of Lord Wright (restrictive as to the courts\u2019 jurisdiction) in his said judgment.\nIn the present case, it was not argued that the disposition in question was void upon any particular rule or principle established by judicial decision. Therefore, taking the most liberal view of the jurisdiction of the courts, there were at least two conditions which must be fulfilled to justify refusal, on grounds of public policy, to give effect to a rule of law according to its proper application in the usual course in respect of a disposition of property. These conditions are: (1) That the \u201cprohibition is imposed in the interest of the safety of the State, or the economic or social well\u2011being of the State and its people as a whole. It is therefore necessary * * * to ascertain the existence and the exact limits of the principle of public policy contended for, and then to consider whether the particular contract [or disposition] falls within those limits\u201d (Fender v. Mildmay, supra, at 414); (2) \u201cThat the doctrine should be invoked only in clear cases, in which the harm to the public is substantially incontestable, and does not depend upon the idiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds\u201d (ibid, at 407; as to this condition, see also Egerton v. Brownlow, 4 H.L.C. 1, at 197, Rodriguez v. Speyer, [1919] A.C. 59, at 135-136, and Fender v. Mildmay, supra, at 436). In the present case it could not be affirmed that such conditions were fulfilled. It is not sufficient to say that some people may be, or probably would be, tempted by the hope of obtaining the legacy to conduct themselves in a manner injurious to wife and children. (Egerton v. Brownlow, supra, at 24-26, 85, 86, 126-128).\nPer Crocket J. (who agreed with the result in the present case): There is no generally accepted rule of law restricting the long recognized and salutory right and duty of the courts to refuse to enforce any and all contracts and testamentary dispositions of property regularly brought before them for adjudication, which they on sound judicial grounds find to be contrary to public policy in the sense of tending to subvert the public good. The judicial application to contracts and dispositions of property of the principle against contravention of public policy is not limited to contracts or dispositions which contravene the statute law or only those heads of public policy which are recognized by past decisions or to cases which clearly fall within the purview of those decisions. It is the courts\u2019 right and duty to bring their own judgment to bear upon the question propounded for their adjudication as to whether or not the purpose of a particular contract or disposition of property contravenes the public good. Nor is \u201csubstantial incontestability\u201d as regards harm to the public a necessary condition of a ground of public policy for the exercise by the courts of their right to hold invalid contracts or dispositions of property on such ground. (Discussion of authorities and judicial dicta).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which, affirming judgment of Middleton J.A.[2], held that the word \u201cchildren,\u201d as used in clause 9 of the will of Charles Millar, late of the city of Toronto, in the province of Ontario, deceased, does not include illegitimate children; and that the said clause 9 is not invalid as being against public policy.

McKeown K.C. for mothers of children who may or may not be legitimate.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014The question to be determined on this appeal concerns the validity of a clause in the will of the late Charles Millar of Toronto. It is in these words:\n9. All the rest and residue of my property wheresoever situate, I give, devise and bequeath unto my Executors and Trustees named below in Trust to convert into money as they deem advisable and invest all the money until the expiration of nine years from my death and then call in and convert it all into money and at the expiration of ten years from my death to give it and its accumulations to the mother who has since my death given birth in Toronto to the greatest number of children as shown by the Registrations under the Vital Statistics Act. If one or more mothers have equal highest number of registrations under the said Act to divide the said moneys and accumulations equally between them.\nThe determination of this controversy as to validity involves the decision of a point of construction, viz., whether the word \u201cchildren,\u201d as here employed, includes illegitimate children. That question was answered in the negative by Mr. Justice Middleton and by the Court of Appeal. We think it sufficient to say that we agree with this conclusion, which rests upon the reasons fully stated in the able judgments delivered by the Chief Justice of Ontario and Riddell J.A. in the Court of Appeal and by Middleton J.A.; and we think it unnecessary to add anything to these reasons.\nThe remaining question, concerning which we express our views more at length, is raised by the contention that this clause is void as \u201cagainst public policy.\u201d In sup- port of that contention we have had a powerful argument from Mr. Hellmuth; but, giving due weight to it, we find ourselves in agreement with the conclusions of the Ontario judges who unanimously held the clause to be valid.\nIt is convenient to notice first of all the manner in which the principle of law operates, by force of which a contract or disposition of property is held to be invalidated as being obnoxious to the public good on some ground or principle comprehended within the general phrase \u201cagainst public policy\u201d; and this has not a little relevancy in examining the contentions advanced by the appellant.\nAs Lord Sumner said in Rodriguez v. Speyer[3],\nConsiderations of public policy are applied to private contracts or dispositions in order to disable * * *\nIt is the duty of the courts to give effect to contracts and testamentary dispositions according to the settled rules and principles of law, since we are under a reign of law; but there are cases in which rules of law cannot have their normal operation because the law itself recognizes some paramount consideration of public policy which over-rides the interest and what otherwise would be the rights and powers of the individual. It is, in our opinion, important not to forget that it is in this way, in derogation of the rights and powers of private persons, as they would otherwise be ascertained by principles of law, that the principle of public policy operates. This is emphasized in the judgments of Lord Thankerton (at p. 414), and Lord Wright (at p. 425), in Fender v. Mildmay[4].\nAs regards the doctrine of public policy itself, there is some lack of unanimity upon the point of the jurisdiction of the courts to proceed under some new head of public policy, that is to say, some principle of public policy not already recognized by judicial decision in the sense hereinafter explained. There is high authority for the proposition that,\nIt is not at the present time open to the courts of justice to hold transactions or dispositions of property void simply because in the judgment of the court it is against the public good that they should be enforced, although the grounds of that judgment may be novel.\nThis is the view expressed by Lord Halsbury in a well known discussion of the subject in Janson v. Driefontein Consolidated Mines, Ltd.[5] \u201cI do not think,\u201d he said,\nthat the phrase \u201cagainst public policy\u201d is one which in a court of law explains itself. It does not leave at large to each tribunal to find that a particular contract is against public policy.\nAnd, at page 496,\nI do not think he [the judge] has any jurisdiction to bring into the discussion his own views of what he may consider an inexpedient thing in his own peculiar view of public policy. To permit such a discussion to arise it must be a question of some public policy recognized by the law.\nAlderson B., in his opinion in Egerton v. Brownlow[6], agrees that such a principle \u201cwould altogether destroy the sound and true distinction between judicial and legislative functions,\u201d and he adds, \u201cmy duty is as a judge to be governed by fixed rules and settled precedents.\u201d And Parke B. in his opinion in the same case observes (p. 123):\nIt is the province of the statesman, and not the lawyer, to discuss, and of the legislature to determine, what is the best for the public good, and to provide for it by proper enactments.\nThe subject is discussed in, if I may say so, a very illuminating way by Lord Wright in Fender v. Mildmay[7]. His conclusion is that the modern view of the law is that expressed in the observations, which he quotes, of Parke B. in Egerton v. Brownlow[8], and of Lord Lindley in Janson v. Driefontein Consolidated Mines, Ltd.[9]\nThe passage from Parke B. is in these words:\nIt is the province of the judge to expound the law only; the written from the statutes: the unwritten or common law from the decisions of our predecessors and of our existing courts, from text-writers of acknowledged authority, and upon the principles to be deduced from them by sound reason and just inference; not to speculate upon what is best, in his opinion, for the advantage of the community. Some of these decisions may have no doubt been founded upon the prevailing and just opinions of the public good; for instance, the illegality of covenants in restraint of marriage or trade. They have become a part of the recognized law, and we are therefore bound by them, but we are not thereby authorized to establish as law everything which we may think for the public good, and prohibit everything which we think otherwise.\nThe sentence taken from Lord Lindley\u2019s judgment is this:\npublic policy is a very unstable and dangerous foundation on which to build until made safe by decision. On this point I venture to remind your Lordships of the weighty observations of Alderson B., and Parke B., in Egerton v. Brownlow[10]. After stating that these passages embody the modern view of the law by which the courts in more recent times have governed themselves in exercising this exceptional jurisdiction, he proceeds\u2014and the precise terms in which he expresses himself should be carefully observed:\u2014\nPublic policy, like any other branch of the common law, is governed by the judicial use of precedents. * * * They [the House of Lords in the Mogul case[11], in the Maxim Nordenfelt case[12] and in Rodriguez v. Speyer[13]] have proceeded to apply some recognized principle to the new conditions, proceeding by way of analogy and according to logic and convenience, just as courts deal with any other rule of the common law.\nand he adds:\nIt is true that it has been observed that certain rules of public policy have to be moulded to suit new conditions of a changing world; but that is true of the principles of common law generally.\nOn the other hand, Lord Atkin (p. 407) expresses the definite opinion that Lord Halsbury\u2019s view is \u201ctoo rigid.\u201d Lord Roche (p. 436) says the question is debatable and does not give his own opinion upon it. Neither Lord Thankerton nor Lord Russell of Killowen, I think, intends to pass upon the general question, although the conclusions of both are based upon rules or principles deduced from decided cases. Lord Russell says:\nas I see this case, there is here no question of inventing a new rule of public policy [p. 422].\nLord Wright says he can hardly conceive that at this day a new head of public policy could be discovered.\nBefore leaving the subject, we ought, perhaps, to refer to three sentences in the opinion of Parke B. in Egerton v. Brownlow[14] which immediately follow the passages quoted above. They seem to put more pointedly than the sentences which precede them the view which, subject to the explanation by Lord Wright already quoted, would appear to have been the view of Lord Halsbury. The sentences are these:\nThe term \u201cpublic policy\u201d may indeed be used only in the sense of the policy of the law, and in that sense it forms a just ground of judicial decision. It amounts to no more than that a contract or condition is illegal which is against the principle of the established law. If it can be shown that any provision is contrary to well-decided cases, or the principle of decided cases, and void by analogy to them, and within the same principle, the objection ought to prevail. He adds:\nBut we are clearly of opinion that this cannot be shown here.\nWe should be disposed to think, if it were necessary to decide the question, that Lord Wright\u2019s view was the preferable view. We are, however, for the purpose of disposing of this appeal, under no obligation to decide this particular point touching the limits of the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of this branch of the law; and we are expressing no final opinion upon it.\nIt has not been argued by the appellants that the disposition in question here is void upon any particular rule or principle established by judicial decision. Such being the case, we think, taking the most liberal view of the jurisdiction of the courts, there are at least two conditions which must be fulfilled to justify a refusal by the courts on grounds of public policy to give effect to a rule of law according to its proper application in the usual course in respect of a disposition of property. First, we respectfully concur in these two sentences in the judgment of Lord Thankerton in Fender v. Mildmay[15]:\nGenerally, it may be stated that such prohibition is imposed in the interest of the safety of the state, or the economic or social well-being of the state and its people as a whole. It is therefore necessary, when the enforcement of a contract is challenged, to ascertain the existence and exact limits of the principle of public policy contended for, and then to consider whether the particular contract falls within those limits.\nSecondly, we take the liberty of adopting the words of Lord Atkin in his judgment in the same case (at p. 407):\n* * * it [referring to Lord Halsbury\u2019s judgment in Janson\u2019s case[16]] fortifies the serious warning, illustrated by the passages cited above [among them is the passage, already quoted, from the opinion of Parke B.], that the doctrine should be invoked only in clear cases, in which the harm to the public is substantially incontestable, and does not depend upon the idiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds. I think that this should be regarded as the true guide.\nThe last sentence makes it plain that we have here no mere obiter dictum. As regards the second of these conditions, it was in substance expressed by Lord Truro in Egerton v. Brownlow[17] in this sentence:\nJudges who are charged with the duty of seeing that dispositions and transactions are not upheld and enforced which are contrary to the spirit of the law, must be presumed to take care not to apply the law to doubtful cases, so as unnecessarily to interfere with transactions which are the subject of judicial investigation. Lord Parmoor in Rodriguez v. Speyer Brothers[18] thus emphasizes the admonition:\nMy Lords, in considering a rule of law founded on public policy care must always be taken not to introduce new principles which, to be valid, would require the sanction of the Legislature, and to maintain the important limitation, that it is beyond the jurisdiction of tribunals to determine matters of national policy.\nLord Roche, in his judgment in Fender v. Mildmay[19], says:\nNow, to evolve new heads of public policy, * * * if permissible to the courts at all, which is debatable, would, in my judgment, certainly be permissible only upon some occasion * * * where there was substantial agreement within the judiciary, * * *\nWe are asked to say that the tendency of this disposition is \u201cagainst public policy\u201d in the pertinent sense because, it is urged, its tendency is to give rise to a competition between married couples to bring about successive births of children in rapid sequence to the injury of the mothers\u2019 health, to the injury of the children, morally and physically, and to the degradation of motherhood and family life. It is even suggested that in cases in which the husband ceased to be fecund in course of the race, the contestants might be tempted to resort to other males to do his office.\nThe appellants argue that these tendencies bring the case within a sentence inadvertently ascribed to Lord Bramwell, but in fact taken from the judgment of Younger L.J. (now Lord Blanesburgh) in In re Wallace; Champion v. Wallace[20]. That sentence is:\nThis is only another way of saying that a tendency to be subversive of the public good within the meaning of the rule now under consideration must be subversive of something in the body politic which every normally constituted citizen of goodwill must, of necessity, desire to preserve.\nThis sentence, of course, does not define any head of public policy. It lays down a condition which must be present in order to enable the principle of public policy to operate. It leaves untouched the question, what precisely is the principle of public policy contended for in this case. We will, however, not dwell further upon the first condition.\nWe ask ourselves the question, is the second condition satisfied? Can it be judicially affirmed that for such reasons \u201cthe harm to the public\u201d from such dispositions \u201cis substantially incontestable\u201d? Is it so clear that something like general agreement upon the point among judges of this country could be judicially assumed? It will not be overlooked that the Ontario judges unanimously held the opposite view.\nIt is the evil tendency of such dispositions in respect of some interest of the state, or of some interest of the people as a whole, with which we are concerned. We find it impossible to affirm from any knowledge we have that a policy of encouraging large families by pecuniary rewards to the parents or donations to the children would have a tendency injurious to the state or to the people as a whole; still less that anything like unanimity in favour of such a proposition could be assumed. It is not sufficient to say that some people may be, or probably would be, tempted by the hope of obtaining this legacy to conduct themselves in a manner injurious to wife and children. That sort of argument is conclusively answered in Egerton v. Brownlow[21] in the judgment of the Lord Chancellor at the trial (pp. 24-26), in the opinion of Mr. Justice Cresswell (pp. 85, 86), and in the opinion of Baron Parke (pp. 126-128). One could easily conjure up the possibility that similar temptations might be inspired by a bequest of a large fortune to the grandchildren of the testator, to be divided equally among them, as inviting each of the children to have a numerous offspring in order to secure for his family as large a proportion as possible of the inheritance.\nConceive the case of a bequest of a large sum of money to each child of a given woman to vest at its birth. Such a bequest might, one could imagine, in some cases give rise to temptations similar to those whose possibility, it is said, is sufficient to invalidate the disposition before us. We do not suppose it would seriously be argued that in such a case the courts could deny the claim of a legatee on grounds of public policy.\nIn Egerton v. Brownlow[22], Alderson B. states explicitly, and there can be no doubt about it, that\na sum of money or an estate left to the first son of a marriage if born within a year of the nuptials, would not be a void bequest or devise.\nWould such a devise or bequest be void if given to the second son if born within two years? The observations of Parke B. in Egerton v. Brownlow[23] are so pertinent in this connection that we think it right to reproduce them textually:\nSuppose a large estate left to A, subject to the condition of his becoming senior wrangler and senior medallist at Cambridge. Would it be illegal, as tending to induce him to employ the money in corrupting the examiners, or betraying into idleness and profligacy, or destroying his most promising competitors? If a large estate is left to a man conditioned that he should within a stated time marry a countess, would it be void, as tending to induce him to use improper means to effect such an alliance? Or if an estate was to be forfeited in case the devisee did not take holy orders, or become a dean or a bishop, or take a degree of doctor of divinity in a certain time, would it be void, as having a tendency to induce him to obtain those orders, dignities, or distinctions by bad means? So the case of a condition to obtain the royal licence to use a particular name and arms, a most common occurrence, might on similar grounds be impeached, as having a tendency to cause the royal licence to be obtained by corrupt means. So even also the clause, in the form in this will, which is to use \u201cthe utmost endeavours to obtain it,\u201d might be said to have a similar though a more remote tendency to the same end; and yet to object to either of such clauses, on either ground, seems to be utterly untenable. Nay, a limitation to one for life, remainder to another, might be said to be void, as having a tendency to cause the remainder-man to try to kill the tenant for life; a limitation to first and other sons successively in tail, to induce the second son to destroy the life of the elder by a direct act of murder, or a continued course of cruelty and unkindness, or to use fraudulent artifices to prevent him from marrying. Insurances on lives might be avoided on the same ground. Insurances of property against fire, contracts by burial\u2011clubs to pay sums of money for the funeral of wives or children; in short, there are few contracts in which a suspicious mind might not find a tendency to produce evil; and to hold all such contracts to be void would, indeed, be an intolerable mischief.\nThe appeal is dismissed. The executors will have their costs of the appeal to this Court as between solicitor and client, and those appointed to represent the different interested parties will have their costs as between party and party, out of the estate.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I am in full accord with my Lord the Chief Justice and the learned trial Judge and the Court of Appeal that this bequest for the benefit of the mother or mothers giving birth in the city of Toronto to the greatest number of children during the ten years following the testator\u2019s death cannot properly be construed as contemplating illegitimate as well as legitimate births, and that the principle of public policy cannot be successfully invoked against its validity in the circumstances of this particular case. I thus qualify my concurrence in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice because I do not wish to be understood as assenting to the adoption by this Court of a number of the judicial dicta which are set out in his reasons, presumably as being applicable to Canadian as well as to British courts, and, moreover, because I cannot deduce from these dicta any such generally accepted rule of law restricting the long recognized and, in my opinion, salutory right and duty of the courts, both of England and of this country, to refuse to enforce any and all contracts and testamentary dispositions of property regularly brought before them for adjudication, which they on sound judicial grounds find to be contrary to public policy in the sense of tending to subvert the public good. In my view, which I venture to express with the greatest diffidence and respect to those who may think otherwise, it is quite impossible to find any consistent, logical ground in these various dicta to support the contention that the application of this wholesome principle by the courts of this country must now be taken as limited to the extent now contended for.\nSome of them seem to be based on the suggestion that the Legislature is the sole repository of the wisdom and public opinion of the country; that in it alone resides the right and power to determine whether any kind or class of contracts do or do not offend against the principle of public policy; and that any attempt, therefore, upon the part of the judiciary of the country to test the validity of any such contract or disposition of property by due consideration of their effect upon the public welfare constitutes an invasion upon the functions of the Legislature. For my part, I cannot understand how the courts of the country in applying this principle can be said to trench in any way upon the legislative power unless it be held that the Legislature\u2019s omission to declare any particular kind or class of contract or other disposition of property unlawful must be taken as establishing their incontestable validity. I know of no dictum from which such a rule of law can fairly be deduced.\nOther pronouncements in the House of Lords, carrying the great weight and authority of celebrated legal minds, such as the well known pronouncement of Baron Parke in Egerton v. Lord Brownlow[24], as to the province of the courts, are brought forward as limiting the judicial application of the principle now under discussion only to contracts and dispositions of property which contravene either the statute law of the country or the unwritten or common law as established by decisions of the past or of the existing courts of the country or to cases which clearly fall within the purview of these decisions. In the passage just referred to it is said:\nSome of these decisions may have no doubt been founded upon the prevailing and just opinions of the public good; for instance, the illegality of covenants in restraint of marriage or trade. They have become a part of the recognized law, and we are therefore bound by them, but we are not thereby authorized to establish as law everything which we may think for the public good, and prohibit everything which we think otherwise.\nFrom the words just quoted it has been sought to deduce the rule that the courts must not venture in any case to bring their own judgment to bear upon the question propounded for their adjudication as to whether the purpose of a particular contract or disposition of property contravenes the public good or not, but the context immediately preceding these words plainly shews, I think, that Parke, B., clearly recognized the right and duty of the courts to determine at least whether any particular case logically falls within the compass of any of the rules of the common law as established by past judicial decisions regarding the contravention of public policy.\nWhatever may be the true interpretation of Baron Parke\u2019s pronouncement in Egerton v. Brownlow[25], it is quite apparent, I think, that in later cases it has been used as the basis for the development of a further limitation upon the jurisdiction of the courts of England to adjudicate upon the question of public policy. This will be particularly observed in Lord Chancellor Halsbury\u2019s discussion of the subject in Janson v. Driefontein Consolidated Mines, Ltd.[26], where His Lordship quotes extensively from Baron Parke\u2019s reasons in the previous case and denies the right of any court to \u201cinvent a new head of public policy.\u201d This dictum, if taken literally and it be not obiter, and were accepted by the majority of the law lords hearing that particular case, would manifestly establish a new doctrine in the application by the courts of the prin- ciple of public policy and limit their consideration of the subject, so far as the common law of England is concerned, to the old heads of that subject as recognized by past decisions. In Fender v. Mildmay[27], however, Lord Atkin points out that, although Halsbury, L.C., in Janson v. Driefontein26\nappeared to decide that the categories of public policy are closed, and that the principle could not be invoked anew unless the case could be brought within some principle of public policy already recognized by the law\nthe Lord Chancellor\u2019s view did not receive the express assent of the other members of the House, and he added that that view seemed to him \u201ctoo rigid.\u201d Lord Atkin went on to say:\nOn the other hand, it fortifies the serious warning, illustrated by the passages cited above, that the doctrine should be invoked only in clear cases, in which the harm to the public is substantially incontestable and does not depend upon the idiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds. I think that this should be regarded as the true guide. In popular language, following the wise aphorism of Sir George Jessel, M.R., cited above, the contract should be given the benefit of the doubt. But there is no doubt that the rule exists. In cases where the promise is to do something contrary to public policy, which, for short, I will call a harmful thing, or where the consideration for the promise is the doing, or the promise to do, a harmful thing, a judge, though he is on slippery ground, at any rate has a chance of finding a footing. The contract is unreasonably to restrict a man\u2019s economic activities, to procure a marriage between two persons, to oust the jurisdiction of the court. These things are decided to be harmful in themselves. To do them is injurious to public interests.\nIt is to be observed that this very recent pronouncement clearly recognizes the continued existence of the rule regarding public policy, but that it in turn suggests what on its face appears to be a new condition or limitation for its application, viz.: \u201conly in clear cases in which the harm to the public is substantially incontestable.\u201d My Lord the Chief Justice in his reasons expressly adopts this dictum and treats \u201csubstantial incontestability\u201d as regards \u201charm to the public\u201d as a necessary condition for the exercise by the courts of their right to invalidate contracts or dispositions of property on the ground of public policy. With every possible respect I cannot follow His Lordship in the promulgation of such a new doctrine in this country upon the strength of what appears to me to be intended by its author only as a further reinforcement of the warnings which are to be found in previous cases as to the danger of judges, in deciding questions involving the consideration of what is and of what is not for the public good, being influenced too much by their own peculiar views, rather than as a pronouncement for the purpose of defining any new rule for the application of the general principle he was discussing. A careful examination of the context in which the expression is contained, as I have above reproduced it, makes it clear to my mind that there was really no thought of propounding any new doctrine. Indeed, Lord Atkin introduces the presumed new doctrine as one which was \u201cillustrated by the passages cited above.\u201d Among the passages he cites are the observations of Parke, B., in Egerton v. Brownlow[28], to which I have already called attention; a passage from the judgment of Jessel, M.R., in Printing and Numerical Registering Co. v. Sampson[29]; one from the judgment of Cave J. (later Lord Cave) in Re Mirams[30]; one from Lord Davey\u2019s judgment in Janson v. Driefontein[31], and an extract from Marshall on Insurance, 3rd ed., 32, which had been approved by Lord Halsbury in Janson v. Driefontein[32]. Not one of these passages makes use of any such expression as \u201csubstantially incontestable,\u201d but all of them seem to bear directly upon \u201cthe serious warning,\u201d which Lord Atkin says is illustrated by them, and to which he was particularly alluding, regarding \u201cidiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds.\u201d Whatever may be the true significance of the dictum relied on, it ought not, in my opinion, to be made the basis of the promulgation of what will undoubtedly constitute an entirely new doctrine in this country, and one whose adoption by this Court, I fear, cannot but seriously and permanently tie the hands of this and all other Canadian courts in the administration of that very important branch of the law, which specially concerns the moral and social, as well as the economic welfare and the security of the people generally.\nLord Atkin says that there is no doubt that the rule exists and clearly intimates that its application is not subject to the limitation which Lord Halsbury\u2019s proposition would place upon it by closing the door against the con- sideration of any new heads or categories of public policy, which limitation he describes as too rigid. Yet a single clause is extracted from one sentence in the very paragraph in which Lord Atkin thus expressed himself and of which no approval can be found in the lengthy reasons of the four other Law Lords who heard the case with him, and put forward as the foundation for the introduction into the courts, of Canada of what, with deference, seems to me to be a much more drastic and far-reaching restriction upon the application of the principle of public policy than that suggested by Lord Halsbury, which Lord Atkin himself declined to recognize and termed \u201ctoo rigid.\u201d May we not as well at once renounce the rule entirely as engraft upon it a condition which would render it practically inapplicable? How could any of the courts in any of the provinces of Canada invalidate any contract or disposition of property at all as tending to subvert the public good in the face of a pronouncement by this Court that they have no jurisdiction to do so unless the ground of public policy which is urged against it is one that is \u201csubstantially incontestable\u201d? Contravention of public policy has always been recognized as a good plea against the enforcement of any contract or testamentary disposition of property by the courts of this country. The joining of issue on such a plea by the party or parties seeking the enforcement of the particular contract or disposition of property concerned necessarily creates a contestation between the parties, which it becomes the clear duty of a judge to try and to decide judicially. But he is told, notwithstanding the fact that he is now actually confronted with a bona fide and serious contestation between the parties before him, that this Court has laid it down that he has no jurisdiction to declare the contract or disposition of property invalid unless he is prepared to adjudge that the ground of public policy, on which it has been definitely challenged, is \u201csubstantially incontestable.\u201d If he is to ignore his own conscientious conviction upon the point as possibly proceeding from an idiosyncratic view, as has been suggested, where is he to look for a safe footing on which he can judicially determine that the apprehended \u201charm to the public is substantially incontestable\u201d? It is suggested that he may look for something like general agreement upon the point among the judges of this country, or something like unanimity, as I take it, in the public itself, from which he could judicially assume it. But what is he to do in a case involving a ground of public policy which has never before been considered by any Canadian judge? Presumably he must then canvass the public opinion of the country as a whole in relation to the purpose or tendency of the particular contract or bequest and determine whether there would be likely to be anything like unanimity among the people as a whole in regarding it as injurious to the public good.\nThe recognition of such a method as a proper basis for a binding judicial adjudication by a trial judge of an issue of fact or law regularly brought before him, I very much fear, is itself fraught with quite as much danger to the public good as any possibly erroneous application by him of the rule of public policy could be. If a trial judge errs in taking too narrow a view of the question of public policy, his error in doing so may be as readily corrected on appeal to the higher courts of the country as any other erroneous decision may always be; but who can envisage the ultimate effect upon the country as a whole of the establishment of a rule of law that a trial judge or an appeal judge must in all cases involving the consideration of a question as to what may or may not be for the public good discard his own conscientious conviction upon a sound consideration of the subject and find its solution, either by assuming what the great majority of other judges throughout the country, none of whom have any responsibility in relation to the particular trial and no opportunity of fully considering the purpose or tendency of the particular contract or bequest involved, would be likely to think, or, alternatively, by assuming what the people of the country generally would be likely to think? I cannot help asking myself the question if the recognition at this time of such a rule of law may not tend to undermine the integrity of the whole system upon which the administration of justice in this country has been founded with all its safeguards and restraints to hold judges to the fearless and conscientious discharge of their duties and protect them as well against the danger of being swayed or influenced by what they may believe to be popular feeling or public opinion. Suppose that a judge is called upon to adjudicate upon the validity of a bequest or devise of the whole of an extensive estate for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a permanent organization for the carrying on throughout the country of a campaign to propagate atheism or infidelity and to undermine the influence of all Christian churches and other religious organizations in Canada. Can it properly be said that a court of justice in deciding that issue cannot bring its own conscientious judgment to bear upon the point and declare the challenged disposition of property invalid because there may be throughout the country a large or substantial body of anti-Christian and anti-religious opinion, which would undoubtedly regard the purpose of the will as legitimate and beneficent? I venture to say unhesitatingly that I do not think so.\nAppeal dismissed.

The trial judge and the appellate court held that it could not be said that the parties intended that there should be an irrevocable sale once the purchase price was not reimbursed within the stipulated delay; and that the instrument was not an its true character an alienation subject to the right of redemption but a pledge of immovables.\nHeld, that the judgment of the appellate court (Q.R. 63 K.B. 291) should be affirmed. The fact that a lender is making use of the vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 in order the better to secure himself is not necessarily in itself incompatible with the validity of the transaction as such a sale; and the contract may also contain stipulations for the protection of the creditor so long as they are not inconsistent with the essential nature of this particular type of contract (Salvas v. Vassal, 27 S.C.R. 68 and The Queen v. Montminy 484); but it is essential that there be alienation and that the title of the alienee be, by the true intendment of the transaction, to be absolute if the price is not reimbursed within the time stipulated therefor; and, from the instrument itself in this case, the parties to the deed had no intention of so stipulating.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, McDougall J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe facts of the case are the following: On the 9th of November, 1930, one Gauthier sold certain immovables to the respondent under a notarial deed, which was not registered until the 8th of May, 1933. On the 28th of May, 1931, Gauthier, by another notarial deed, sold the same property to the appellant, which deed was registered on the 1st of June, 1931, this being a sale containing a clause giving the vendor the right to exercise the facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. The right to exercise this faculty was to expire on the 7th of May, 1934. The respondent took possession of the property on the 8th of May, 1933, and thereupon proceeded to collect rents. In April, 1935, the appellant took the present action to be declared the owner of the property. The question to be determined in this case is what was intended by the parties and what they in fact did. The principal clause of the deed to be interpreted is the following:\u2014\nEt, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par monsieur Gauthier d\u2019op\u00e9rer son rachat de la mani\u00e8re convenue, notamment de rembourser \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance la susdite somme de trois mille dollars; ou de payer au moins dans les trente jours de leur \u00e9ch\u00e9ance respective l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ses versements d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats semi-annuels; ou d\u2019acquitter avant le premier janvier de chaque ann\u00e9e toutes taxes quelconques pouvant affecter les susdits immeubles; ou de prendre et de toujours maintenir en force les assurances-feu dont il est question plus haut, avec production de polices d\u2019assurance et d\u2019un re\u00e7u de leur renouvellement au moins dans les quinze jours de leur \u00e9ch\u00e9ance respective entre les mains de La Sauvegarde; ou de faire radier dans les trente jours de leur enregistrement tout privil\u00e8ge de fournisseurs de mat\u00e9riaux, entrepreneurs, etc., qui pourrait \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s plus haut d\u00e9crites; ou de maintenir toujours ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9paration, tel que convenu plus haut; alors dans chacun de ces cas, La Sauvegarde pourra soit exiger de suite de monsieur Gauthier le payement de tous deniers qui pourront lui \u00eatre dus pour quelque raison quelconque, soit en remboursement de la somme de trois mille dollars dont il est question ci-dessus soit pour le service de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats, le remboursement de taxes, le payement de primes d\u2019assurance, etc., ou \u00e0 son choix, garder et conserver comme propre, avec droit d\u2019en jouir et d\u2019en disposer comme bon lui semblera, les deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sus mentionn\u00e9es, desquelles propri\u00e9t\u00e9s elle sera d\u00e8s lors propri\u00e9taire incommutable, avec (toutes additions et am\u00e9liorations, sans retour ni indemnit\u00e9, tout en ayant le droit de garder tous deniers re\u00e7us pour quelque fin quelconque, le tout devant lui appartenir comme loyer et \u00e0 titre de dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats liquid\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019avance, sans proc\u00e9dure ni mise en demeure.\nArthur Vall\u00e9e K.C. and A. R. Gagn\u00e9 for the appellant.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. and E. H. Brown for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The question in substance which we are called upon to decide is whether or not the deed of the 28th of May, 1931, was in reality a sale \u201csous la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9.\u201d The learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench have held that this instrument is not in its true character an alienation subject to the right of redemption but a pledge of immovables. That question, to quote the words of Strong, C.J., in Salvas v. Vassal[2]\nmust in every case depend upon the interpretation of the deeds passed between the parties and a proper appreciation of the evidence.\nIn a passage, to which the appellant in his factum refers, Mr. Justice Girouard in the same case put the question in this form:\nLes parties n\u2019entendaient-elles pas faire une vente irr\u00e9vocable, si le prix n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rembours\u00e9?\nI do not find it necessary to refer to any extraneous facts.\nThe transaction is described in the deed as a \u201cvente sous la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s r\u00e9serv\u00e9e.\u201d But I find it impossible to reconcile with the terms of the deed an intention to effect an irrevocable sale if the price should not be reimbursed. On the contrary, the parties have made it very clear that, in default of reimbursement by the borrower at the date fixed, an option is vested in the appellants either to require payment of the sum lent or, at their choice, to retain the property in question as their own with full liberty to enjoy and dispose of it.\nIt was argued that in all material respects the deed before us does not differ from the deed in The Queen v. Montminy[3]; but, as Mr. Justice Letourneau points out, there is this essential distinction: the instrument which this Court had to consider on that appeal was an instrument by which the parties in the most explicit terms provided that in the event of the failure of the borrower to repay the price on the date fixed, the right of redemption should cease to operate, and that the lender should remain \u201cpropri\u00e9taire incommutable\u201d of the property in question.\nThe judgments in Salvas v. Vassal2 and in The Queen v. Montminy3 delivered by Mr. Justice Girouard, in each case speaking for the majority of the court, make it clear that the circumstance that a lender is making use of the vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 in order the better to secure himself is not necessarily in itself incompatible with the validity of the transaction as such a sale. In The Queen v. Montminy3 (p. 490) he says: Il est \u00e9vident que dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe, comme presque toujours d\u2019ailleurs le cr\u00e9ancier n\u2019a eu recours \u00e0 la vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 que pour \u00e9viter les longueurs et les frais d\u2019une vente judiciaire et mieux assurer ses avances d\u2019argent; mais, comme nous le disions dans Salvas v. Vassall (1), il n\u2019y a aucune ici qui prohibe ces conventions.\nAnd he observes also that the contract may contain stipulations for the protection of the creditor so long as they are not inconsistent with the essential nature of this particular type of contract.\nBut I agree with the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that it is essential that there be alienation and that the title of the alienee is by the true intendment of the transaction, to be absolute if the price is not reimbursed within the time stipulated therefor. It is plain, from the instrument itself, that the parties to the deed before us had no intention of so stipulating.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gagn\u00e9 & Nadon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mann, Lafleur & Brown.\n[1] (1937) Q.R. 63 K.B. 291.\n[2] (1896) 27 Can.

T. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 Limit\u00e9e, corporation l\u00e9gale ayant son principal si\u00e8ge d\u2019affaires \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, et les actionnaires et cr\u00e9anciers de la dite compagnie, et entre autres Peter alias Pierre L\u00e9gar\u00e9, dame B\u00e9atrice L\u00e9gar\u00e9-Miller, Findlays Ltd, et autres, et la Cie P. T. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 susdite, commettant ainsi par l\u00e0 le crime du complot pour frauder, contre la forme du statut en tel cas fait et pourvu.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench (in appeal) unanimously affirmed the conviction, and the appellants now seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under section 1025 of the Criminal Code. They must show that the judgment in the Court of King\u2019s Bench conflicts with the judgment of some other court of appeal in a like case. It is suggested that such a judgment is Brodie v. The King[1]. Upon comparing that decision with that of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, it is quite apparent that there is no conflict. In the Brodie case the accused were charged with having conspired together and with others, during a certain period, and at a named place, \u201cthereby committing the crime of seditious conspiracy.\u201d Here the accused are charged with having conspired together and with others, during a certain period, and at named places,\npar la supercherie, le mensonge et d\u2019autres moyens frauduleux, pour frauder le public et les porteurs d\u2019obligations de la Compagnie P. T. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 Limit\u00e9e, corporation l\u00e9gale ayant son principal si\u00e8ge d\u2019affaires \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, et les actionnaires et cr\u00e9anciers de la dite compagnie, etc.\nThey are not charged with having committed a crime in the abstract like \u201cmurder\u201d or \u201ctheft\u201d; the offence is charged in such a way as to lift it from the general to the particular. It is argued that the formal charge should have alleged that the conspiracy was to defraud the public and those named of $ (naming the sum) or at least of \u201cmoney.\u201d I do not agree that the judgment in the Brodie case says or infers that in such a charge as is here under consideration any such allegation is necessary. I think attention might very well be called to the concluding paragraph of that judgment.\nIt is then contended that the decision of the court below is in conflict with The King v. Sinclair[2], a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. The matter there came before the court on a case stated by the trial judge and all it determined (so far as the point under consideration is concerned) was that the charge, with the particulars, did not disclose any offence under section 394 of the Criminal Code (now section 444 and the section under which the present charge is laid). At pages 23-24, Wetmore J. states:\u2014\nThe conspiracy contemplated by the section is not one to defraud a candidate of his hopes or expectations of being elected, or the electors or the public of their hopes or expectations of (having a certain candidate elected. The conspiracy intended is one to deprive or defraud \u201cthe public or any person\u201d of certain substantial rights such as its or his property or means or something of a like character.\nTwo members of the court concurred in these reasons. Newlands J., speaking for himself and one other member of the court, expresses a similar view in somewhat different language.\nThis judgment does not conflict with that from which it is sought to appeal in the present case as the charge here does not allege or suggest a conspiracy to do anything of the kind referred to in the judgment in the Sinclair case. Counsel for the accused objected to the definition of a conspiracy to defraud, given by the trial judge and approved by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, but unless they are able to show that in so defining, the Court has decided contrary to a judgment of some other court of appeal in a like case, there is no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal. The Sinclair case (1) was the only one to which they (1) (1906) 12 C.C.C. 20.\nreferred as being such a judgment, and for the reasons just stated I am of opinion that that judgment is not one in a like case.\nThe third ground upon which the accused sought leave to appeal was that the case for the defence was not put to the jury. I disposed of this contention at the hearing as it is obvious that the judgment in this case could not upon that point be in conflict with any other court. The position is not that there has been dissent in the court below upon a question of law; and while the principle is well established that the trial judge is to place the defence properly before the jury, and there are many cases exemplifying the rule, the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in the present case, has come to the conclusion that this was done.\nThe application is refused.\nMotion refused.\n[1] [1936] S.C.R. 188.\n[2] (1906) 12 C.C.C. 20.\n"}

Code, s. 261\u2014Acts of third person\u2014Directions to jury\u2014Questions for jury.\nAn appeal by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1937] O.R. 693, ordering a new trial of accused (who had been convicted at trial on a charge of murder) on the ground of misdirection or failure of proper direction by the trial judge in charging the jury on the question of provocation, was dismissed.\nThe law with regard to provocation as embodied in s. 261 of the Cr. Code does not contemplate the extension of the relative lenity (in reducing culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter) to a case in which provocation received from a third person becomes the occasion of an act of homicide against a victim who, as the offender knows and fully realizes, was not in any way concerned in the provocation. But acts of provocation committed by a third person, which might be sufficient to reduce the offence to manslaughter if the victim had in fact participated in them, may have the same effect where the offence against the victim is committed by the accused under the belief that the victim was a party to those acts, although the victim was not implicated in them in fact. (Brown\u2019s case, 1 Leech C.C. 148, and Hall\u2019s case, 21 Cr. A.R. 48, cited and discussed.)\nIn the present case, the trial judge ought to have asked the jury to consider whether, in the blindness of his passion aroused by his quarrel with the husband of Mrs. S., the accused, suddenly observing Mrs. S. (the victim of the act now in question) within a few feet of the scene of the quarrel and of his mortal assault on the husband, attacked her on the assumption that she was involved in the acts of the husband and daughter. It was a question for the jury whether (a) the acts relied upon as constituting provocation were calculated to deprive an ordinary man of self-control to such an extent as to cause an attack upon Mrs. S. of such a character as that delivered by the accused, and (b) whether in fact the accused was by reason of what occurred deprived of his self-control to such a degree; and in his attack upon Mrs. S. was acting upon such provocation on a sudden and before his passion had time to cool, and under the assumption that she was involved therein.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney-General of Ontario (under s. 1023 (2) of the Criminal Code, as amended by 25-26 Geo. V (1935), c. 56, s. 16) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (Fisher and Henderson JJ.A. dissenting) allowed the accused\u2019s appeal against his conviction of murder at his trial before McFarland J. with a jury and set aside the conviction and ordered a retrial, on the ground of misdirection or failure of proper direction by the trial judge in addressing the jury on the question of provocation.\nW.B. Common K.C. and E.H. Lancaster K.C. for the appellant.\nPeter White K.C. and H.M. Rogers for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014We have come to the conclusion that the order directing a new trial should not be disturbed. As there is to be a new trial, we think it better to abstain from a discussion of the facts.\nThe controversy on the appeal concerns the application of section 261 of the Criminal Code, the text of which we quote:\nCulpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\n2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has been time for his passion to cool.\n3. Whether or not any particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received, shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one shall be held to give provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order to provide the offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any person.\nWe think it right to emphasize that this section deals with the conditions under which \u201cculpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter,\u201d because the act of the accused was committed \u201cin the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\u201d\nThe provocation contemplated by the section neither justifies nor excuses the act of homicide. But the law accounts the act and the violent feelings which prompted it less blameable because of the passion aroused by the provocation, leaving the offender in a condition in which he was not at the critical \u201cmoment the master of his own understanding,\u201d to quote the phrase of Tindal C.J. in Hayward\u2019s case[2], adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeals in Hall\u2019s case[3]; though still sufficiently blame-able to merit punishment\u2014and it may be punishment of high severity\u2014but not the extreme punishment of death. We do not think that the law, as embodied in section 261, contemplates the extension of this relative lenity to a case in which provocation received from one person becomes the occasion of an act of homicide against another who, as the offender knows and fully realizes, was not in any way concerned in the provocation. We do not think section 261 contemplates such a case, for example, as Simpson\u2019s case[4].\nOn the other hand, the law has recognized that an offender under the dominion of a passion provoked by wrong or insult may in some circumstances attack a person not in any way concerned with the act of provocation, under the full belief that he has been so; and such circumstances have been held to be sufficient to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.\nBrown\u2019s case[5] would appear, from the report in 1 East\u2019s Pleas of the Crown, at p. 246, to have proceeded upon this ground.\nHall\u2019s case[6] may have been decided upon similar considerations. There is nothing in any of the reports of the case indicating that there was any direct evidence of the participation of the victim in the attack on the accused upon which the latter relied as constituting provocation, or even that the victim was present at the time. It was held that the jury ought to have been asked to consider the issue of provocation and, accordingly, the court reduced the verdict of murder to manslaughter, although, obviously, as Lord Hewart observes, there were grave difficulties in the way of this defence. There was evidence from which it might have been inferred, if the story of the accused was accepted, that the offender acted upon the assumption that the victim had been one of his assailants. We are disposed to think, after considering the judgment with care, that the Court of Criminal Appeals did not regard the actual participation by the victim in the alleged assault upon the accused as an essential element in the defence of provocation.\nTrue it is that in these cases there was an affray and, both in Brown\u2019s case[7] and in Hall\u2019s case[8], the alleged provocation consisted in a violent assault upon the accused. We think, however, that section 261 of the Criminal Code leaves exclusively to the tribunal of fact, as an issue of fact, the question whether any particular \u201cwrongful act or insult\u201d is of such a character as to constitute provocation for the purposes of the section; at least subject to the condition expressed in the proviso to the third sub-section. And we think, moreover, as regards the source from which the provocation proceeds, that acts of provocation committed by a third person, which might be sufficient to reduce the offence to manslaughter if the victim had in fact participated in them, may have the same effect where the offence against the victim is committed by the accused under the belief that the victim was a party to those acts, although not implicated in them in fact.\nWe think the trial judge ought to have asked the jury to consider whether, in the blindness of his passion, aroused by the quarrel with the husband, the accused, suddenly observing the wife within a few feet of the scene of the quarrel and of his mortal assault on the husband, attacked her on the assumption that she was involved in the acts of the husband and daughter.\nWe think it was a question for the jury whether (a) the acts relied upon as constituting provocation were calculated to deprive an ordinary man of self-control to such an extent as to cause an attack upon Mrs. Seabright of such a character as that delivered by the accused; and (b) whether in fact the accused was by reason of what occurred deprived of his self\u2011control to such a degree; and in his attack upon Mrs. Seabright was acting upon such provocation on a sudden and before his passion had time to cool, and under the assumption that she was involved therein.\nAt the new trial the presiding judge will, no doubt, impress upon the jury the importance of considering with great care the first of these questions; but he will, of course, instruct the jury that, on the ultimate issue, they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of murder before convicting him of that crime. For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: I.A. Humphries.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.M.

M\u00e9thot K.C. for motion.\nLs. St.-Laurent K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCannon j.\u2014On the 27th January, 1936, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lacoursi\u00e8re, district magistrate, issued a summons or warrant against the appellant for infraction to the Lord\u2019s Day Act (R.S.C., c. 153). The appellant denied the jurisdiction of the magistrate and made an application for a writ of prohibition which issued against the respondents according to an order of Honourable Justice Marchand of the Superior Court. The writ is in the following terms:\nEdouard VIII, par la Gr\u00e2ce de Dieu, Roi de Grande-Bretagne, d\u2019Irlande et des Territoires Britanniques au del\u00e0 des mers, D\u00e9fenseur de la foi, Empereur des Indes.\nA la Cour de magistrat pour le district judiciaire des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, si\u00e9geant au palais de justice de la dite cit\u00e9 des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Arthur Larue, constable et officier sp\u00e9cial, charg\u00e9 de l\u2019observance de la loi concernant le jour du Seigneur, de la cit\u00e9 des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res et Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Lacoursi\u00e8re, Ecr. magistrat de district dans et pour le district de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\nSalut:\nNous vous enjoigons de n0065 pas proc\u00e9der contre la dite requ\u00e9rante Canadian International Paper Company, sur la plainte port\u00e9e par le dit intim\u00e9 Arthur Larue, le 27 janvier 1936, et nous ordonnons que toutes proc\u00e9dures prises contre la dite requ\u00e9rante sur la dite plainte et poursuivies en conformit\u00e9 avec la proc\u00e9dure criminelle, soient arr\u00eat\u00e9es et interrompues \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, et que le dossier du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur soit transmis \u00e0 notre Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant dans et pour notre dit district de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, en notre cit\u00e9 de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, sans d\u00e9lai, pour \u00eatre l\u00e0 et alors proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement selon que de droit sur la demande de la dite requ\u00e9rante produite devant cette dite cour, le 3 mars 1936, et nous commandons au dit Arthur Larue de compara\u00eetre devant cette dite cour, en notre dit district de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, en notre dite cit\u00e9 de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, le sixi\u00e8me jour apr\u00e8s signification sur lui de ce pr\u00e9sent bref pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de la requ\u00e9rante contenue dans sa dite requ\u00eate et dans la d\u00e9claration ci-annex\u00e9e.\nSubsequently the writ was quashed by a judgment of the Superior Court (Fortier J.) on the 7th December, 1936, and the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously upheld his judgment on the 24th February, 1937[2]. On the 4th March, 1937, the Court of King\u2019s Bench granted special leave to appeal to this Court.\nThe respondents now move to quash the appeal for want of jursidiction because these are proceedings for or upon a writ of prohibition arising out of a criminal charge which, under section 36 of the Supreme Court Act, are not appealable to this Court.\nIt must be noted that by section 41 of the Act, the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the proceeding was originated may grant special leave to appeal to this Court in any case \u201cwithin section 36,\u201d i.e., except in criminal causes and in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas cropus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge, etc. It was not disputed that these proceedings arose to stop the magistrate from hearing the criminal charge laid against the appellant. The learned counsel for the appellant contended, however, that the proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure are not similar to the prohibition proceedings within the meaning of our section 36. This point seems to have been raised without success in Gaynor & Greene v. United States of America[3].\nArticle 1003 of the Code of Civil Procedure says:\nThe writ of prohibition lies whenever a court of inferior jurisdiction exceeds its jurisdiction.\nIt is applied for, obtained, contested and executed in the same manner as mandamus, and with the same formalities; and the writ of summons is directed to the court of inferior jurisdiction and to the party proceeding therein.\nUnder 993,\nThe writ of summons can issue only upon the authorization of a judge of the Superior Court, granted upon the presentation of a petition, supported by affidavit, affirming the truth of the facts set forth in the petition.\nThe writ issued in this case prohibits the court, the magistrate and the complainant from further proceeding, in order\nque toutes les proc\u00e9dures prises contre la dite requ\u00e9rante sur la dite plainte et poursuivies en conformit\u00e9 avec la proc\u00e9dure criminelle, soient arr\u00eat\u00e9es et interrompues \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit;\nand it orders also that the record of the Magistrate\u2019s Court Court be transmitted to the Superior Court; but Arthur Larue alone is summoned to appear before the Superior Court to answer the petition. As far as the Magistrate\u2019s Court and the Magistrate himself are concerned, the writ contains nothing but a prohibition to proceed on a criminal charge and no summons to appear.\nEnglish authors and authorities have always been quoted, as far as my knowledge goes, in every reported prohibition case in the province of Quebec. See inter alia: Bastien v. Amyot[4]; Rossi v. Lacroix[5]; Paris v. Couture[6]; Vannier v. Meunier[7]. In Rossi v. Lacroix (1), the writ, by inadvertence, did not contain any prohibition and was simply an ordinary writ of summons to which was attached a copy of the original petition. The remarks of Mr. Justice Dorion in this case, at page 411, may be relevant:\nLe code de procedure n\u2019a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 le bref de prohibition. Il existait en vertu du droit commun. Il \u00e9tait, et il est encore, de la nature d\u2019une ordonnance nisi causa, par lequelle il est enjoint \u00e0 la partie de s\u2019abstenir \u00e0 moins que cause ne soit montr\u00e9e tel jour. Cette formule, qui est la formule de toute ordonnance nisi causa, comporte un ordre expr\u00e8s et un avertissement que celui \u00e0 qui il est donn\u00e9 ne peut proc\u00e9der qu\u2019\u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils, et aux risques et p\u00e9rils de sa proc\u00e9dure. Le refus de s\u2019y conformer le constitue en m\u00e9pris de l\u2019ordre donn\u00e9.\nLe code de proc\u00e9dure ne para\u00eet pas avoir rien chang\u00e9 \u00e0 cela, et, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019objet de la demande pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019obtention du bref est de permettre au requ\u00e9rant de faire accompagner le bref d\u2019un ordre de sursis. Le vrai bref de prohibition, c\u2019est le bref p\u00e9remptoire.\nThe point raised by the appellant cannot prevail.\nAlthough the Court of King\u2019s Bench granted special leave to appeal in, this case, we must not forget that they could do so validly only in cases within section 36 of the Supreme Court Act by which the granting or refusal of prohibition in criminal cases is expressly excluded from our appellate jurisdiction.\nWe are clearly of opinion that special leave should have been refused for want of jurisdiction to grant it and that the motion to quash the appeal must be granted with costs against the appellant.\nMotion granted with costs.\n[1] Q.R. 62 K.B. 268.\n[2] Q.R. 62 K.B. 268.\n[3] (1905) 36 Can.

Upon a petition under section 230 of chapter 127 of R.S.B.C., 1924, the trial judge upheld the registrar on the ground that a company can have only one seal, i.e., its common seal, unless enabled thereto by statutory authority. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed on equal division of the appellate court.\nHeld, that the appeal should be allowed and that there should be judgment directing the registrar to proceed with the registration of the deed under the appellant's application.\u2014In virtue of the enactments of the Quebec statute incorporating the Montreal Trust Company and the amending statutes, it was within the powers of the directors of the company to authorize the sealing of instruments on behalf of the company in this form, by employing a stamp usually kept at the head office or by employing a stamp or stamps kept at branch offices; and this power in virtue of the above enactments could be delegated to an executive committee.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1937] 3 W.W.R. 13) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming on equal division of the court the judgment of Robertson J. and dismissing the appellant's application by way of petition under section 230 of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 127, for a declaration that a certain conveyance in fee, made by the Montreal Trust Company as grantor to the appellant as grantee, was properly executed and for an order directing the Registrar of the Vancouver Land Registration District to proceed with the registration of the said conveyance under the application to him which he had rejected. On November 17, 1937, an application to this Court by the appellant in order to add the Montreal Trust Company as respondent was granted, costs reserved.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. for the appellant.\nLs. St-Laurent K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014The application of the appellant for registration of a certain conveyance in fee of the 30th of June, 1936, purporting to be made by the Montreal Trust Company as grantor to the appellant as grantee, was rejected by the Registrar at Vancouver for reasons in writing given by him and expressed in these words:\nThis application is summarily rejected on the ground that it is apparent on the face of the document submitted that the same was executed in Vancouver and a duplicate or facsimile seal affixed thereto (the head office of the Montreal Trust Company and the seal of the said company being both in Montreal). In fact, solicitor for applicant admits that this is so, claiming that a company can have as many seals as it wishes. In my opinion a company can have only one seal, i.e., its common seal, unless enabled thereto by statutory authority.\nThe appellant accordingly presented a petition under section 230 of chapter 127, R.S.B.C., 1924, praying a declaration that the conveyance was properly executed and an order directing the Registrar to proceed with the registration of it. This application was dismissed.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal[2] the appellant failed by reason of an equal division, two of the learned judges of that court thinking the appeal should be allowed, and two agreeing with Mr. Justice Robertson.\nThe question to be determined on this appeal is whether or not the instrument in question was competently executed on behalf of the Montreal Trust Company.\nThe Montreal Trust Company was incorporated by a statute of the province of Quebec (52 Vict., c. 72). By this statute certain general provisions of the statutory company law of that province are made applicable to the company. By one of these (now section 164 of chapter 223, R.S.Q., 1925):\n1. The directors may administer the affairs of the company in all things, and may make or cause to be made for it in its name any kind of contract which it may lawfully enter into.\n2. They may make by-laws not contrary to law nor to the charter of the company, for the following purposes:\u2014\n(d) the appointment, functions, duties and removal of all agents, officers and servants of the company, the security to be given by them to the company and their remuneration;\n(g) the conduct in all other particulars of the affairs of the company.\nBy section 9 of the special statute, as amended by (1900) 63 Vict., ch. 77, section 5,\nThe principal place of business of the company shall be at the city of Montreal, but the company may establish branch offices in other places.\nAnd by section 9 (a) of 20 Geo. V, ch. 139,\nThe affairs of the company shall be managed by a board of not less than five directors and the directors of the company may, from time to time, by by-law, increase or decrease to not less than five the number of its directors.\nThe directors may, from time to time, by by-law, delegate such of their powers as they see fit to an executive committee consisting of not less than three members of the board.\nIn virtue of a provision of the Interpretation Act in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada ((1859), c. 5, s 6 (24)), which is still in force in Quebec, the Montreal Trust Company is expressly empowered to have a common seal; and there are enactments in the statutes amending the Trust Company's special Act which, obviously, proceed upon the assumption that this is so, and which, indeed, could not be put into effect without the use of a common seal of the company. There is nothing in any of these statutory provisions touching the form of the seal.\nOne of the by-laws of the company provides that the seal of the company shall be in the form, \"Montreal Trust Company, Incorporated 1889.\"\nWe think it was clearly within the powers of the directors, as defined by the relevant statutes, to authorize the sealing of instruments on behalf of the company in this form, by employing a stamp usually kept at the head office, or by employing a stamp or stamps kept at branch offices; and that this power, in virtue of the enactment quoted above, could be delegated to the executive committee.\nBy a by-law, number 9, passed on April 10, 1930, it was provided,\nAll the powers and authority of the board of directors are delegated to the executive committee and shall be exercised by it when the board is not in session.\nBy the company's by-law number 12, the following regulation came into force:\nAny director of the company, together with any one of the following officers of the company, to wit: the general manager, an assistant general manager, a manager, the secretary or an assistant secretary, may exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as the company itself is authorized to exercise and do, including the management, administration and transaction of all the affairs and business of the company; and for greater certainty, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may exercise the following powers:\u2014\nTo sell, alienate\u2026 all kinds of property, whether moveable or immoveable, real or personal\u2026 :\nand to sign and execute\u2026 all such deeds, documents and such instruments as such directors and officers of the company may deem necessary or expedient, all of which deeds, documents and other instruments shall be valid and binding upon the company without further authorization, the whole with full powers of substitution either generally or for specific instances, all such powers may also be exercised and all such deeds, documents and other instruments may also be signed by such other person or persons either alone or otherwise as the board of directors or the executive committee of the company may from time to time by resolution authorize. The seal of the company, when required, may be affixed to all such deeds, documents and other instruments so signed or executed. Then, by resolution of the 23rd of August, 1935, the executive committee resolved as follows:\nIt was resolved that Messrs. R. H. Baird, A. T. Lowe, F. J. Lynn and A. J. Ross, officers of the Royal Bank of Canada, Vancouver, or any one of them, be authorized to sign as an authorized signing officer where the signature of the president, vice-president or a director is required under by-law no. 12 and they are hereby authorized to sign with Robert Bone, manager of the Vancouver office, or Frank N. Hirst, assistant secretary, and all documents so executed shall be binding upon the company without any further authorization. The seal of the company may be affixed to the document so executed.\nWe think the executive committee was acting within the scope of its authority in passing this resolution, and that the persons named became possessed of the powers which the resolution purports to vest in them. With respect, we are unable to concur in the view, upon which Mr. Justice Robertson acted, that the last sentence contemplates exclusively the seal of the company which is kept in the head office at Montreal and designates exclusively an impression created by that seal. We think such an interpretation of the resolution is unnecessarily narrow; and that, properly read, the resolution contemplates an impression in the form prescribed by the by-law made by any stamp used by agents thereunto properly authorized on behalf of the company.\nThe instrument is, prima facie, the instrument of the company, and there is nothing in the material brought to the notice of this Court or of the British Columbia courts justifying a judicial conclusion that the deed is invalid.\nThe appeal will, therefore, be allowed and there will be judgment directing the Registrar to proceed with the registration under the appellant's application.\nAs to costs, the appellants shall have their costs of the appeal to this Court. There will be no costs of the application in this Court to add the Trust Company as a party.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Knox Walkem.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. Alan Maclean.\n[1] [1937] 3 W.W.R. 13; [1937] 3 D.L.R. 484.\n[2] [1937] 3 W.W.R. 13; [1937] 3 D.L.R. 484.\n"}

In order to facilitate the execution of his work, the appellants allowed Beau-champ to have possession of one of their cars, with full discretion as to its use, though the latter was to pay for the gas and oil. Some time prior to the date of the accident, Beauchamp caused an announcement to be inscribed in a newspaper advertising a motor car for sale, and, in answer to this, one Th\u00e9berge communicated with Beauchamp. The latter tried to interest Th\u00e9berge in the purchase of one of the cars belonging to his employers, the appellants, but Th\u00e9berge refused to buy, expressing his desire to have a car from a private individual. Then Beauchamp remembered that one Desormeaux had a second-hand car for sale; and, after some negotiations, that car was sold through Beauchmap to Th\u00e9berge. The morning following the sale Beauchamp drove Th\u00e9berge in the appellants\u2019 car to the provincial licence bureau in order to obtain a licence for the operation of the car; and they were driving back to D\u00e9sormeaux\u2019s house to put on the new plates on the car when the accident occurred. Beauchamp had to apply the brakes of the car to reduce its speed; the street was slippery, and this caused the car to skid up over the sidewalk and to strike the respondent, thus causing him serious injuries. The appellants\u2019 ground of appeal was that their employee at the time of the accident was not acting in the performance of the work for which he had been employed by them. Held that, according to the facts and the circumstances of the case, the appellants are liable. The appellants\u2019 car was, for the purposes of their business, entrusted by the appellants, owners of the car, to their employee Beauchamp as their servant; but the latter was in-vested with full discretion as to the use of it. In the exercise of that discretion, Beauchamp acted as agent and servant of the owners, the appellants. In other words, Beauchamp was in the exercise of his functions as servant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Chase-Casgrain J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages for the sum of $12,200.50 as a result of an automobile accident.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nF. P. Brais K.C. and A. J. Campbell for the appellants.\nM. Dugas K.C. and H. Perrier K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014Les appelants se sont pourvus devant nous en appel d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi confirmant unanimement celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure les condamnant \u00e0 payer $12,200.50 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, conjointement et solidairement avec leur co-d\u00e9fendeur Beauchamp. Ce dernier \u00e9tait \u00e0 leur emploi et conduisait l\u2019automobile lors de l\u2019accident qui a caus\u00e9 les dommages. Il ne s\u2019est pas pourvu en appel et\u2014quant \u00e0 lui\u2014le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure constitue chose jug\u00e9e.\nMais les appelants ont pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019ils ne sont pas responsables de la faute de Beauchamp, vu qu\u2019ils ne sont pas couverts par les termes de l\u2019article 1054 du code civil qui d\u00e9termine les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on est civilement responsable de la faute d\u2019autrui. Le paragraphe qui nous concerne est le suivant:\nLes ma\u00eetres et commettants sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers, dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution\u2019 des foliotions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s.\nDans Moreau v. Labelle[1], cette cour, par la voix de mon coll\u00e8gue l\u2019honorable juge Rinfret, a revu toute la jurisprudence concernant cet article 1054 et en a expliqu\u00e9 l\u2019application. Inutile d\u2019y revenir. Je me contenterai de citer ce que cette cour disait \u00e0 la page 215:\nUn employ\u00e9 qui n\u2019ex\u00e9cute pas les ordres de son ma\u00eetre ne cesse pas pour cela d\u2019\u00eatre son employ\u00e9; mais il ne manque pas de cas o\u00f9 un simple pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, investi d\u2019un mandat sp\u00e9cial, qui n\u2019ex\u00e9cute pas les ordres qu\u2019il a re\u00e7us, cesse par le fait m\u00eame d\u2019\u00eatre un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. Cela va de soi: les fonctions d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 sp\u00e9cial sont beaucoup plus restreintes que les fonctions d\u2019un employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier.\nNotre juge-en-chef actuel, dans la cause de The Governor and Company of Gentlemen Adventurers of England v. Vaillancourt[2], en commentant cet article disait:\nI doubt myself if exposition could make the meaning of the language used in either text plainer than it is. Le fait dommageable must be something done in the execution of the servant\u2019s functions as servant or in the performance of his work as servant. If the thing done belongs to the kind of work which the servant is employed to perform or the class of things falling within l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions, then by the plain words of the text responsibility rests upon the employer. Whether that is so or not in a particular case must, I think, always be in substance a question of fact.\nEt \u00e0 la page 417:\nBut in substance the solution of the point involves nothing more than an accurate appreciation of the facts in their relation to the rule.\nTous les juges qui ont entendu cette cause, en appr\u00e9ciant les faits, ont conclu que l\u2019accident avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par Beauchamp dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions comme employ\u00e9 des appelants. Il nous reste \u00e0 \u00e9tudier le dossier pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a, dans ces jugements des cours inf\u00e9rieures, erreur tellement \u00e9vidente que nous devions intervenir pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ces opinions, bien qu\u2019elles soient concordantes sur une question de fait.\nIl nous faut donc d\u00e9finir exactement quelles \u00e9taient les fonctions de Beauchamp. Il est admis que Beauchamp \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi des appelants comme vendeur d\u2019automobiles \u00e0 commission et qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident il conduisait un char mis \u00e0 sa disposition par les appelants comme n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son contrat d\u2019engagement qui \u00e9tait verbal.\nL\u2019accident a eu lieu vers onze heures du matin, pendant ses heures de travail qui, d\u2019ailleurs, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas limit\u00e9es mais laiss\u00e9es \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion. Etait-il, \u00e0 ce moment, en possession l\u00e9gale de l\u2019automobile? S\u2019en servait-il avec l\u2019autorisation du ma\u00eetre? ou s\u2019en \u00e9tait-il empar\u00e9 pour ses propres fins? On a beaucoup discut\u00e9 devant nous le fait que, la veille de l\u2019accident, Beauchamp s\u2019est occup\u00e9 de la vente \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 Th\u00e9berge d\u2019un automobile appartenant non pas aux appelants, mais \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 D\u00e9sormeaux. Mais, comme le dit Beauchamp, au moment de l\u2019accident, le char \u00e9tait vendu de la veille et il conduisait simplement Th\u00e9-berge chez D\u00e9sormeaux pour poser les plaques que l\u2019on venait de se procurer au bureau du gouvernement. A ce moment-l\u00e0, la possession de l\u2019automobile mis \u00e0 sa disposition par ses ma\u00eetres \u00e9tait-elle ill\u00e9gale? M\u00eame en admettant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 de parfaire la vente de D\u00e9sormeaux \u00e0 Th\u00e9berge, peut-on dire qu\u2019il y avait prise de possession ill\u00e9gale pour ses propres fins?\nVoici ce que nous r\u00e9v\u00e8le la preuve: Albert Hodge, g\u00e9rant des appelants, qui a engag\u00e9 Beauchamp, nous dit que Beauchamp avait droit d\u2019avoir une automobile selon l\u2019habitude:\nOn engage un homme, un vendeur, on lui fournit une automobile, parce qu\u2019il ne peut pas vendre d\u2019automobiles sans en avoir. Naturellement ils vont chercher les gens, surtout dans les chars usag\u00e9s, pour donner des d\u00e9monstrations. Il leur faut absolument un char pour \u00eatre capable de vendre.\nD. C\u2019est un d\u00e9monstrateur que vous leur mettez entre les mains?\nR. Oui, je lui ai donn\u00e9 un char usag\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il s\u2019occupait des usag\u00e9s.\nD. Est-ce que le char que vous leur donnez ils doivent le vendre, celui dont ils doivent se servir?\nR. Dont ils doivent se servir et qu\u2019ils doivent vendre.\n* * *\nD. Maintenant, quant \u00e0 ces chars-l\u00e0, quand ils \u00e9taient entre les mains des vendeurs, qui voyait aux r\u00e9parations?\nR. C\u2019est nous autres, la maison.\nD. Donniez-vous des instructions \u00e0 vos vendeurs \u00e0 ce sujet?\nR. Absolument point. Un char ne devait pas sortir en mauvais ordre.\nD. Pourquoi ces chars ne devaient-ils pas sortir en mauvais ordre?\nR. Il y a plusieurs raisons. La premi\u00e8re, c\u2019est qu\u2019un char doit \u00eatre en bon ordre pour marcher et deuxi\u00e8mement, c\u2019est qu\u2019un homme ne peut pas faire une vente d\u2019un char avec un char en mauvais ordre. Sans cela ils perdent leurs prospects. Si un char sonne ou qu\u2019il\u2019 fait du bruit ou qu\u2019il est en mauvais ordre, cela emp\u00eache la vente. C\u2019est dommageable pour eux, les vendeurs.\nBeauchamp \u00e9tait sous le contr\u00f4le des appelants et Hodge assemblait les vendeurs trois ou quatre fois par semaine pour leur donner des instructions et des recommandations: D. Voulez-vous dire de quelle fa\u00e7on vous faites savoir vos d\u00e9sirs \u00e0 ce sujet-l\u00e0?\nR. D\u2019abord, moi, je fais des assembl\u00e9es trois ou quatre fois par semaine, des assembl\u00e9es de vendeurs ou d\u2019agents, et souvent, tr\u00e8s souvent, aux assembl\u00e9es je recommendais aux hommes de toujours sortir un char en bon ordre, parce que cela devenait difficle de vendre un char en mauvais ordre. Je recommandais toujours de tenir un char propre et en bon ordre. Au garage ils avaient l\u2019autorisation de r\u00e9parer les chars. Aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019un vendeur demandait une r\u00e9paration, ils avaient l\u2019ordre de le r\u00e9parer.\nD. Est-ce qu\u2019il fallait une formalit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re?\nR. Non.\nD. Avez-vous un \u00e9tablissement pour la r\u00e9paration dans votre garage?\nR. Ah oui.\nD. Est-ce qu\u2019il y a des ordres de donn\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9tablissement-l\u00e0 d\u2019accepter les ordres des vendeurs? R. Absolument.\nD. Ces hommes qui travaillent pour vous, ces vendeurs, ils \u00e9taient engag\u00e9s pour vendre, quoi?\nR. Pour vendre de l\u2019automobile.\nD. Pour qui?\nR. Pour Jarry & Fr\u00e8re.\nD. Est-ce qu\u2019ils avaient la permission de vendre \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre?\nR. Non, pas en dehors de Jarry & Fr\u00e8re. Il y a Jarry & Fr\u00e8re et Jarry Automobile.\nEt,\nD. Maintenant, monsieur Hodge, vos vendeurs je comprends que vous leur confiez une automobile et qu\u2019ils en font ce qu\u2019ils veulent?\nR. Oui. Bien, ils en font ce qu\u2019ils veulent pour travailler.\nD. Vous n\u2019exercez aucun contr\u00f4le?\nR. Ah bien, on ne peut pas les suivre, mais quand on s\u2019aper\u00e7oit qu\u2019ils font quelque chose de mal * * *\nPar Me Philippe Brais C.R., avocat de Jarry & Fr\u00e8re:\nD. Qu\u2019est-ce que vous faites, alors?\nR. On les avertit, et, s\u2019ils ne font pas mieux on \u00f4te le char.\nPar Me Maurice Dugas C.R., avocat du demandeur:\nD. Ce sont les vendeurs qui paient la gazoline?\nR. Oui.\nD. Alors, vous savez, comme question de fait, que vos vendeurs se servent des automobiles que vous mettez \u00e0 leur disposition pour leurs affaires personnelles?\nR. Bien, probablement, ils doivent, en faire au travers.\nHenri Beauchamp:\nD. Est-ce que la maison Jarry et Fr\u00e8re mettait ses automobiles \u00e0 votre disposition pour faire de la sollicitation?\nR. Ils me pr\u00eataient la machine.\nD. Etait-ce toujours la m\u00eame machine que l\u2019on vous pr\u00eatait?\nR. Pas toujours. Cela d\u00e9pendait des d\u00e9monstrations que j\u2019avais \u00e0 faire.\nD. Au moment de l\u2019accident, quelle sorte d\u2019automobile aviez-vous?\nR. J\u2019avais une petite Ford Coup\u00e9.\nD. Etait-ce une automobile qui appartenait \u00e0 Jarry et Fr\u00e8re?\nR. C\u2019\u00e9tait une automobile qui appartenait \u00e0 Jarry et Fr\u00e8re.\n* * *\nD. L\u2019automobile que vous aviez \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 est-ce que c\u2019\u00e9tait une automobile que vous offriez en vente, est-ce que c\u2019\u00e9tait une automobile que l\u2019on offrait en vente? Comprenez-vous ce que je veux dire? Est-ce que c\u2019\u00e9tait une automobile que vous essayiez de vendre ou si c\u2019\u00e9tait une automobile dont vous vous serviez pour aller voir vos clients?\nR. J\u2019essayais \u00e0 vendre celle-l\u00e0 en essayant \u00e0 en vendre d\u2019autres. S\u2019ils ne voulaient pas de celle-l\u00e0, j\u2019essayais d\u2019en vendre d\u2019autres.\n* * * D. J\u2019ai compris que vous \u00e9tiez en possession de l\u2019automobile que vous conduisiez au moment de l\u2019accident depuis quelques jours.\nR. Oui, j\u2019\u00e9tais en possession de la machine depuis quelque jours.\nD. Vous avez dit aussi que vous n\u2019aviez pas l\u2019habitude de reporter l\u2019automobile tous les soirs au garage ou sur le terrain de Jarry & Fr\u00e8re, mais qu\u2019il vous arrivait de garder l\u2019automobile \u00e0 la porte de chez vous, c\u2019est exact?\nR. Je veux dire qu\u2019il y des soirs que je la mettais sur le terrain, d\u2019autres soirs je l\u2019amenais chez moi. Des fois c\u2019\u00e9tait sur le terrain, des fois chez nous.\nD. Je suppose que tous les vendeurs d\u2019automobiles avaient une automobile \u00e0 leur disposition, j\u2019entends les vendeurs de Jarry & Fr\u00e8re?\nR. Oui.\nD. Quand vous gardiez l\u2019automobile comme cela chez vous, \u00e0 la porte de chez vous, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que vous avez dit ant\u00e9rieurement, vous ne consid\u00e9riez pas que c\u2019\u00e9tait une d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance aux ordres que vous aviez re\u00e7us?\nR. Je ne la laissais pas \u00e0 la porte chez nous, j\u2019avais un garage.\nD. Vous la gardiez dans un garage?\nR. Dans un garage, oui.\nD. Mais c\u2019\u00e9tait permis, cela, vous aviez la permission de garder l\u2019automobile chez vous comme cela la nuit?\nR. Tous les vendeurs en partie gardaient leurs machines avec eux?\nD. Et vous vous serviez de cette automobile-l\u00e0 pour vos affaires?\nR. Bien, pour vendre de la machine.\nPar la Cour:\nD. Pour vendre de la machine?\nR. Pour vendre la machine de Jarry, pour vendre les machines qui appartenaient \u00e0 Jarry?\nD. A part celle dans laquelle vous vous promeniez?\nR. Celle-l\u00e0, si je trouvais \u00e0 la vendre je la vendais. Si j\u2019arrivais \u00e0 la porte de chez un client qui me disait: \u201cCombien demandes-tu pour ce char-l\u00e0?\u201d Je lui offrais la machine que j\u2019avais en mains. Si celle-l\u00e0 ne faisait pas son affaire, je le ramenais au terrain, j\u2019essayais de lui en vendre un autre.\nPar Me Maurice Dugas C.R., avocat du demandeur:\nD. Quand vous aviez une course \u00e0 faire, je comprends que vous n\u2019\u00e9tiez pas tenu de demander la permission \u00e0 M. Hodge ou \u00e0 M. Jarry?\nR. Non. Moi, je partais avec mon char, j\u2019allais voir les clients que j\u2019avais \u00e0 voir.\nD. Sans demander de permission \u00e0 personne?\nR. Sans demander de permission \u00e0 personne.\nD. Le matin de l\u2019accident vous \u00eates parti avec votre automobile et je comprends que vous \u00eates all\u00e9 voir des clients ce jour-l\u00e0?\nR. Je me suis rendu chez M. Th\u00e9berge \u00e0 neuf heures et demie.\nD. Avant cela vous \u00eates all\u00e9 voir des clients, si vous vous rappelez bien la d\u00e9claration que vous avez faite sous serment?\nR. Oui, quelques clients ce matin-l\u00e0?\nD. Et vous \u00eates parti \u00e0 quelle heure de chez vous, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s?\nR. Je suis parti de chez nous entre huit heures et huit heures et demie.\nD. Et l\u2019accident est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 onze heures, je comprends?\nR. Oui. Il appert aux extraits du t\u00e9moignage de Hodge que ce dernier pr\u00e9tend avoir d\u00e9fendu aux vendeurs, et \u00e0 Beau-champ en particulier, de vendre des automobiles autres que ceux des appelants. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, sur ce point, n\u2019a pas cru le t\u00e9moignage de Hodge et en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de prohibition \u00e0 ce sujet. D\u2019ailleurs, Beauchamp, interrog\u00e9 sur ce point, dit qu\u2019il n\u2019en a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question.\nMais m\u00eame si cette d\u00e9fense avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, il faudrait faire la distinction marqu\u00e9e par Lord Dunedin et cit\u00e9e par l\u2019honorable juge Rinfret, dans la cause de Moreau v. Labelle[3]. Le noble lord s\u2019exprimait comme suit dans la cause de Plump v. Cobden Flour Mills Company[4]:\nThere are prohibitions which limit the sphere of employment, and prohibitions which only deal with conduct within the sphere of employment. A transgression of a prohibition of the latter class leaves the sphere of employment where it was, and consequently will not prevent recovery and compensation. A transgression of the former class carries with it the result that the man has gone outside the sphere.\nJe crois, en pr\u00e9sence de la preuve, que, vu la nature de son mandat, Beauchamp \u00e9tait en tout temps en possession l\u00e9gale de l\u2019automobile mise \u00e0 sa disposition par les appelants. Il pouvait s\u2019en servir pour circuler pendant ses heures de travail; et rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait de rendre service \u00e0 un ami ou \u00e0 un client en perspective, en le conduisant au bureau du gouvernement pour prendre sa licence, obtenir ses plaques et conduire ensuite cette personne pour poser les plaques sur l\u2019automobile qu\u2019elle aurait achet\u00e9e. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de l\u2019abus de ses fonctions; mais il se servait de l\u2019auto, cherchant \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 comme \u00e0 tout autre instant, suivant le t\u00e9moignage de Hodge, un acheteur possible de la voiture qu\u2019il conduisait. Les appelants avaient engag\u00e9 Beauchamp et les autres vendeurs pour parcourir, pratiquement jour et nuit, Montr\u00e9al et ses environs pour d\u00e9montrer les qualit\u00e9s des chars usag\u00e9s que les appelants tenaient en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9parations, afin de les faire voir, de les faire essayer et t\u00e2cher d\u2019en disposer aux personnes qui, au cours de ces courses, pourraient s\u2019y int\u00e9resser et devenir des clients ou des acheteurs en perspective.\nIl est en preuve que Th\u00e9berge s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u2019abord rendu chez Jarry dans l\u2019intention d\u2019acheter un de leurs chars. Il est aussi en preuve que Beauchamp s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 chez D\u00e9sormeaux comme l\u2019agent de Jarry Fr\u00e8res.

On ne peut dire qu\u2019il s\u2019en servait exclusivement pour ses propres fins; et, d\u2019ailleurs, il semble \u00e9vident que les appelants lui laissaient la discr\u00e9tion la plus absolue quant \u00e0 l\u2019usage qu\u2019il pouvait faire de l\u2019automobile.

Le serviteur dans ces conditions se sert de la chose du ma\u00eetre en sa qualit\u00e9 et \u00e0 titre de serviteur ou d\u2019employ\u00e9, et non pas d\u2019emprunteur; et si, au cours de l\u2019usage de la chose, le serviteur commet avec cette chose un d\u00e9lit, s\u2019il cause des dommages, le propri\u00e9taire est responsable de ces dommages en tant que ma\u00eetre et patron.

The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That court (Masten J.A. dissenting) allowed the appeal with costs and directed that judgment be entered in favour of the plaintiff Winston McQuillen for $450, and in favour of the plaintiff Thelma McQuillen for $750, with the costs of the action.

He was found guilty and the conviction was affirmed by a majority of the appellate court. The appeal in this Court was as to the proper construction of section 364 of the Criminal Code.\nHeld, Duff C J. and Davis J. dissenting, that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The control and responsibility of the Dominion post office authorities over the stolen letter ceased from the moment that it was delivered in the main post office to the representative of the provincial authorities.\u2014In law, the letter was abstracted after it had been delivered to the duly constituted agents of the provincial authorities and it had passed out of the control of the Dominion post office: the abstraction took place when it was no more a \u201cpost letter\u201d or \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste.\u201d\nPer Crocket J.\u2014The parliamentary post office (bureau de poste du Parlement) was not a \u201cbureau de poste\u201d within the meaning of section 364 of the Criminal Code; and, also, the stolen letter was not a \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste\u201d at the time of the theft in the sense of that expression as given in section 2 of the Post Office Act. The letter at that time was neither in a \u201cpost office\u201d nor \u201cbeing carried through the post,\u201d the Post Office Department\u2019s control and responsibility of and for it having ceased upon its delivery at the so-called \u201cbureau de poste\u201d which was officered and operated by appointees of the Provincial Government entirely at the latter\u2019s expense and over which neither the Quebec city post office nor the Post Office Department of Canada had any control.\nPer Kerwin J.\u2014The parliamentary post office was not a \u201cpost office\u201d within the meaning of section 2 (l) of the Post Office Act. A \u201cpost office\u201d means any building * * * where any letter which may be sent by post is received * * *; and it cannot have been intended that any letter which may be sent by post is in a post office unless it is in a building * * * which is under the control of the Postmaster-General as part of the postal service of Canada. Upon the evidence, the quarters in the Legislative Assembly building in Quebec, set aside by the provincial authorities cannot be said to be part of the postal service of Canada, even though what was done was by the consent or authority of the Postmaster-General. Per Duff C.J. and Davis J. (dissenting).\u2014Upon the evidence and in view of the findings of the trial judge, the officials of the Parliamentary Post Office, in all their activities, in undertaking to receive, collect send or deliver letters and in receiving, collecting sending, delivering letters and having in possession letters for the purpose of so conveying and delivering them, were acting under the authority of the Postmaster-General. The Parliamentary Post Office was a post office established by the Postmaster-General in exercise of his powers (section 7) under the Post Office Act, and, therefore, a post office within the contemplation of section 364 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, the letter in question in this case had not ceased to be a \u201cpost letter\u201d within the meaning of that section when it was abstracted by the appellant.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing his appeal, by a majority of the Court, from his conviction by J. H. Fortier J. after a summary trial for having stolen a \u201cpost letter\u201d from a \u201cpost office\u201d contrary to the provisions of section 364 of the Criminal Code.\nF. Choquette K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Rivard K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. (dissenting) was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal raises a question as to the scope of section 364 of the Criminal Code under which it is an offence to steal a \u201cpost letter\u201d from a \u201cpost office.\u201d The definition of \u201cpost office\u201d in the Post Office Act is a very broad one and comprises (inter alias) under that term all places where \u201cmailable matter\u201d is \u201creceived or distributed, sorted, put up in packets or despatched.\u201d\nThe appellant was charged with having stolen a \u201cpost letter\u201d from the post office, which is generally referred to in the record under the designation \u201cthe Parliamentary Post Office.\u201d He was found guilty. An appeal was taken to the Court of King\u2019s Bench on various grounds. Only two of them will require discussion; first, that, \u201con the evidence,\u201d the Legislative Post Office is not a \u201cpost office\u201d within the meaning of section 364 of the Criminal Code; and, second, that the letter stolen was not a \u201cpost letter\u201d within the meaning of that section.\nThese questions, in my conception of the evidence and of the findings of the trial judge, are, I am disposed to think, questions of mixed fact and law rather than of law; and, moreover, I am disposed to think that in substance the grounds of dissent in the Court of King\u2019s Bench are matters of mixed law and fact rather than matters of law. Since, however, I am satisfied that the appeal should be dismissed on the merits, I shall not further discuss the point of jurisdiction.\nBy section 6 of the Criminal Code:\nIn every case in which the offence dealt with in this Act relates to the subject treated of in any other Act the words and expressions used herein in respect to such offence shall have the meaning assigned to them in such other Act.\nand before proceeding to the facts, it is convenient first of all to quote the precise terms of the definition of \u201cpost office\u201d contained in the Post Office Act. That definition is as follows:\n2(1) \u201cpost office\u201d means any building, room, post office, railway car, street letter box, street stamp-vending box, receiving box or other receptacle or place where post letters or other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or despatched.\nBy section 7 of the Act, the Postmaster-General has authority to,\n\u201c(a) establish and close post offices and post routes.\u201d\nSince there is nothing in the context which \u201cotherwise requires,\u201d it follows that \u201cpost office\u201d here has the meaning ascribed to the phrase in section 2(1); and, in consequence, the Postmaster-General has authority under section 7 to establish a post office for providing any one or more of the services mentioned in this definition.\nBy section 35,\nSubject to the provisions and regulations aforesaid, and the exceptions hereinafter made, the Postmaster-General shall have the sole and exclusive privilege of conveying, receiving, collecting, sending and delivering letters within Canada.\nOur attention has not been called to anything in the \u201cprovisions and regulations aforesaid\u201d which qualifies the application of this section in its bearing on this appeal. There is another section which ought not to be overlooked. Section 101 is in these words:\nEvery person who without the authority of the Postmaster-General, the proof of which authority shall rest on such person, places or permits or causes to be placed or to remain on his house or premises, the words Post Office, or any other words or mark which imply or give reasonable cause to believe that such house or premises is a post office or a place for the receipt of letters, shall, on summary conviction, incur a penalty not exceeding ten dollars for each offence. 2. Any person who, otherwise than in conformity with this Act, collects, sends, conveys or delivers, or undertakes to collect, send, convey or deliver any letter within Canada, or receives or has in his possession within Canada any letter for the purpose of so conveying or delivering it, shall, for each and every letter so unlawfully collected, sent, conveyed or delivered, or undertaken so to be, or found in his possession, incur a penalty not exceeding twenty dollars.\nThe learned trial judge had before him a letter addressed by the Deputy Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec, who appears to have filled the role of Post Office Inspector for the city of Quebec, dated the 12th of March, 1919. That letter was written in response to a request made by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec \u201cfor the installation of a House of Assembly Post Office\u201d and authorized the inauguration of such a post office, which I shall refer to hereafter as the Parliamentary Post Office. There were departmental memoranda, apparently, indicating the character of the office to be established which are not in evidence, but the letter, coupled with the facts found by the trial judge, determines with sufficient accuracy for our present purposes the character of it.\nAs to outgoing mail, the letter states:\nLetters and other matter prepaid by postage stamps would be stamped and \u201cprimary\u201d sorted in the Legislative Assembly Post Office. This mail would be sent in \u201clock\u201d bags to the Quebec Post Office, where it would be carefully looked over before being distributed for despatch * * * All mail for despatch originating with any of the Provincial Departments should be deposited in the Legislative Assembly Post Office.\nAs to incoming mail,\nA duly authorized messenger representing all the Legislative Assembly Departments would call at the Quebec Post Office and sign for all registered mail for all the Departments, which he would deliver as instructed to the several Departments located in the Legislative Assembly building. The lock bag containing the ordinary mail would be sent to the Legislative Assembly Post Office, where it would be distributed and messengers from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.\n* * *\nMails would be conveyed as often as required by a courier with horse drawn vehicle, whose services would be paid for by the Legislative Assembly.\nAgain,\n* * * the Legislative Assembly Post Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada,\nNow, this letter makes it quite clear that this Parliamentary Post Office was established at the request of the Legislative Assembly for the convenience of the Legislative Assembly and the Government departments housed in the same building and their employees; and that the intention of the letter is to give the authority of the Postmaster-General to the establishment of such an office, where mail would be received from the Quebec Post Office in one of the Departmental sacks; that such sacks would be opened at the Parliamentary Post Office and the mail contained therein distributed in the usual way to be called for and delivered to persons to whom the mail might be addressed or to messengers of the Departments. It was also contemplated that mailable matter prepaid by postage stamps would be received and stamped with an official stamp of the usual character and provisionally sorted in the Post Office and sent forward in an official bag to the Quebec Post Office. It was contemplated, there can be no doubt, that this Parliamentary Post Office would be used by all the members and employees of the Legislature; as well as by the employees of the Departments. The effect of the letter beyond doubt is to authorize the use of legends indicating where mail would be received as such; where letters, for example, properly stamped, would be collected and dealt with as mail.\nThe learned trial judge has found as a fact that letters are registered in this Post Office; and it appears that, for a period which ended in 1935, Post Office orders were issued.\nThe Parliamentary Post Office was to be, as the letter states, under the control of an official designated as Postmaster and there is evidence to the effect that this official receives from the Postmaster of Quebec, who acts as inspector of the post offices in the city of Quebec, the circular communications addressed to postmasters generally and communications sent to him by the inspector are addressed to him as \u201cThe Postmaster of the Parliamentary Post Office.\u201d The letter of the Deputy Postmaster General, as we have seen, makes it quite plain that the office is to be governed by the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department.\nIt must have been fairly clear to anybody reading the Post Office Act that a \u201cpost office\u201d operated in the manner contemplated would, in the absence of authority from the Postmaster-General, infringe the Post Office Act; and, on the evidence, the learned judge was entitled to start from the premise that the Parliamentary Post Office was in fact established and operated under such authority. He has, indeed, found as a fact that the Postmaster of the central post office in Quebec gives instructions and governs and directs the administration of the Parliamentary Post Office and that this is done conformably to the control of this post office by the Postmaster-General and to the circumstance that it is subject to the departmental regulations.\nI concur with the following observations of Mr. Justice St. Jacques:\nL\u2019\u00e9tablissement des bureaux de poste n\u00e9cessaires au service des postes rel\u00e8ve enti\u00e8rement du Ministre, et l\u2019on sait que les d\u00e9put\u00e9s ministres sont particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019application des d\u00e9tails de la loi.\nC\u2019est dans l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs qui sont confi\u00e9s au minist\u00e8re des Postes par les articles 35 et 39 de la loi que ce bureau particulier a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019\u00e9difice du Gouvernement provincial.\nIl est \u00e9vident que le ministre des Postes, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le sous-ministre, n\u2019a pas voulu que ce bureau ait le caract\u00e8re complet et absolu des bureaux de poste ordinaires qui sont \u00e9tablis un peu partout dans les cit\u00e9s, suivant les besoins du service des Postes. On a voulu que ce bureau soit simplement un \u201cclearing-house\u201d oui seraient transport\u00e9es par un messager d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 par le Gouvernement provincial toutes les lettres adress\u00e9es aux divers services du Gouvernement provincial et qui sont re\u00e7ues au bureau de poste principal \u00e9tabli dans la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, sur la rue Buade.\nIl est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 ce document, \u00e9mis par le sous-ministre des Postes en 1919, que le sac ferm\u00e9 contenant le courrier ordinaire serait envoy\u00e9 au bureau de poste de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e L\u00e9gislative o\u00f9 les lettres seraient distribu\u00e9es, et les messagers des diff\u00e9rents services du Gouvernement Provincial pourraient recevoir \u00e0 ce bureau les lettres qui y parviennent.\nIl faut retenir de ce document la phrase suivante:\n\u201cIn brief, the Legislative Assembly Post Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada.\u201d\nIl est \u00e9vident que des bureaux semblables existent dans d\u2019autres parties du pays, puisque le sous-ministre dit:\n\u201cThe office would not be a postal station, but a clearing house, similar to that conducted by the Federal Parliament and applicable to the various Legislative Assemblies.\u201d\nJusqu\u2019\u00e0 1935, le minist\u00e8re des Postes permettait aux employ\u00e9s de ce bureau d\u2019\u00e9mettre des mandats et des bons de poste, tout comme on le fait dans les bureaux de poste r\u00e9guliers Ce privil\u00e8ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re des Postes en 1935.\nLa recommandation des lettres peut se faire au \u201cbureau de poste du Parlement\u201d qui per\u00e7oit le co\u00fbt de cette recommandation.\nIl importe peu, me semble-t-il, que les employ\u00e9s qui travaillent dans ce bureau de poste soient engag\u00e9s et pay\u00e9 par le Gouvernement provincial. C\u2019est \u00e0 cette condition que le minist\u00e8re des Postes a consenti \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement dans l\u2019\u00e9difice du Gouvernement provincial d\u2019un tel bureau.\nCe bureau est-il r\u00e9gulier ou non, au sens absolu de la loi? Ce n\u2019en est pas moins un bureau de poste o\u00f9 l\u2019on re\u00e7oit des lettres qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es \u00e0, la poste et o\u00f9 l\u2019on re\u00e7oit \u00e9galement des lettres pour \u00eatre confi\u00e9es a la poste.\nThere was evidence, I repeat, before the trial judge from which he might not improperly conclude that the officials of the Parliamentary Post Office, the postmaster and others, in all their activities, in undertaking to receive, collect, send or deliver letters and in receiving, collecting, sending, delivering letters and having in possession letters for the purpose of so conveying and delivering them, were acting under the authority of the Postmaster-General; and I think Mr. Justice St. Jacques is on solid ground in holding that, in view of the evidence and of the findings of the trial judge, the Parliamentary Post Office was a post office established by the Postmaster-General in exercise of his powers under the Post Office Act and, therefore, a post office within the contemplation of section 364 of the Criminal Code. It is a post office within the scope, as I think, of section 7 and constituted as such by the authority of the Postmaster-General. Such being the case, it follows necessarily in my view that the letter in question had not ceased to be a \u201cpost letter\u201d within the meaning of section 364 when it was abstracted by the appellant. Admittedly, it was in the Parliamentary Post Office among a number of other letters in process of being distributed when the abstraction occurred.\nIt was contended before us on behalf of the appellant that the delivery of the post bag to the courier whose duty it was to take the bag from the Quebec Post Office to the Parliamentary Post Office was a delivery to the person to whom the letter was addressed. The dissenting judges in the court below appear to have taken the view that the latter was not delivered until it reached the Parliamentary Post Office. The trial judge was entitled to find, however, as a fact, and in effect did so find, that the courier was acting under the authority of the Post-master-General in carrying an official bag from one post office to another post office and that there was no delivery to the addressee.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nCannon J.\u2014In his factum, the respondent states the point to be decided by us as follows:\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench did not come to the same understanding upon the words \u201cpost letter.\u201d Whilst the majority asserted that the letter, at the time of its withdrawal by the appellant, was still \u201cin transit,\u201d the dissentient minority claimed that at that time it was already in the hands of he to whom it was addressed, or at least that it should be considered so.\nThus this is the disputable point, at the time of the theft, which is not doubted, was the above described letter still, yes or no, a \u201cpost letter\u201d in the meaning of the law?\nUnder the provisions of the Act respecting the postal service, R.S.C., c. 161, section 2, par. (j),\n\u201cPost letter\u201d means any letter transmitted by the post or delivered through the post, or deposited in any post office, or in any letter box put up anywhere under the authority of the Postmaster-General, whether such letter is addressed to a real or a fictitious person or not, and whether it is intended for transmission by the post or delivery through the post or not; and a letter shall be deemed a post letter from the time of its being so deposited to the time of its being delivered to the person to whom it is addressed, or so long as it remains in the post office or in any such letter box or is being carried through the post; and a delivery to any person authorized by the Postmaster-General to receive letters for the post shall be deemed a delivery at the post office, and a delivery of any letter or other mailable matter at the house or office of the person to whom the letter is addressed, or to him, or to his servant, or agent, or other person considered to be authorized to receive the letter or other mailable matter, according to the usual manner of delivering that person\u2019s letters, shall be a delivery to the person addressed.\u201d\nExhibit P2 concerning the organization of the post office at the Parliament contains the following about the delivery of the mail addressed to the Parliament Buildings:\nMails will be conveyed as often as required by a courier with horse drawn vehicle, whose services would be paid for by the Legislative Assembly.\n* * *\nThe Legislative Assembly Post Office would be conducted without any expense whatever to the Post Office Department of Canada, and there would be no account for the purchase of stamps in view of the fact that stamps would be purchased as hereinbefore mentioned.\nIn brief, the Legislative Assembly Post Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada. It would be operated and officered by clerks appointed by authority of the Legislative Assembly, who would obtain supplies of postage stamps from the City post office and postal stations, or from stamp vendors or sub-offices of their own choosing, conveying the mail bags both ways between the Quebec Post Office and the Legislative Assembly, without expense to the Post Office Department of Canada in any way.\nAn office of this nature would not be recognized as a regular post office, being simply a clearing house, as the Department could not undertake to establish either a sub-office or a regular office in a separate institution such as Provincial Government building, as all post offices have to be for the service of the general public, and under the direct control of the Department. Letters and other matter prepaid by postage stamps would be stamped and \u201cprimary\u201d sorted in the Legislative Assembly Post Office. This mail would be sent in \u201clock\u201d bags to the Quebec Post Office, where it would be carefully looked over before being distributed for despatch.\nA fully authorized messenger representing all the Legislative Assembly Departments would call at the Quebec Post Office and sign for all registered mail for all the Departments which he would deliver as instructed to the several departments located in the Legislative Assembly Building. The lock bag containing the ordinary mail would be sent to the Legislative Assembly Post Office, where it would be distributed and messengers from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.\nExhibit D1 contains the regulation as to the distribution of correspondence:\nArt. 246. Distribution des correspondances.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re au sujet d\u2019un objet quelconque de correspondance cesse lorsquei la distribution en a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e, soit au destinaire, soit \u00e0 une personne d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 recevoir sa correspondance, ou \u00e0 une personne aux soins de qui cet objet \u00e9tait adress\u00e9, et le minist\u00e8re ne peut entreprendre de faire des recherches relativement au traitement dudit objet lorsqu\u2019il en a dispos\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement.\nNow, as to what happened to the letter addressed to J. P. Bergeron, we have the evidence of the postmaster, J. B. L. Morin, who is the Federal official in charge of the main post office and of all the stations within the city of Quebec. Here is what he says:\nQ. Maintenant, M. Morin, voulez-vous dire \u00e0 quel endroit se fait la d\u00e9livrance des lettres destin\u00e9es au Parlement de Qu\u00e9bec?\nR.

The dissenting judges, however, seem to have reached the opinion that delivery took place only after it reached Parliament and that it was still under the control of the Dominion authorities between the main post office and the Parliament Building. This does not agree, in my opinion, with the facts as they appear by the evidence of Morin, the only person who really knows about the exact relationship in actual practice between the Dominion Postal Service and the Parliament distribution office. I would say that the control and responsibility of the Dominion post office authorities on this particular letter ceased from the moment that it was delivered in the main post office to the representative of the provincial authorities. Although my views do not agree fully with the dissenting judges in appeal, as to the time and place where delivery took place, I agree with them on the construction of the statutory definition of \u201cpost letter.\u201d For slightly different reasons, the same conclusion is reached, to wit: in law, the letter was abstracted after it had been delivered to the duly constituted agents of the provincial authorities and it had passed out of the control of the Dominion Post Office; the abstraction took place when it was no more a \u201cpost letter,\u201d or \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste.\u201d\nI am of opinion that the conviction should be quashed and the appeal allowed.\nCrocket J.\u2014This is an appeal under s. 1023 of the Criminal Code from a majority judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of the province of Quebec affirming a conviction made against the appellant in the Court of Sessions of the Peace for the theft of a letter containing money \u201cdans le bureau de poste du Parlement\u201d in the city of Quebec contrary to the provisions of s. 364 of the Criminal Code. Dorion and Galipeault JJ. were the dissenting judges.\nWhen the appeal came on for hearing in this court Mr. Rivard for the Crown in pursuance of notice objected to the court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain it on the ground that the dissent in the court below was not on a question of law as provided by s. 1023 of the Criminal Code, and moved to quash the appeal for that reason. As this objection appeared to involve a consideration of the grounds of the appeal itself, the learned Chief Justice suggested that it would be more convenient to allow the appeal to proceed and hear counsel on the merits as well as on the jurisdictional objection. The motion to quash and the appeal itself were, therefore, argued together.\nAs to the motion to quash, Mr. Rivard contended that the record of the dissent appearing in the entry of the formal judgment of the court, under the provisions of s. 1013 of the Criminal Code, shewed on its face that it was a dissent on a question of fact or on a question of mixed law and fact.\nThis entry stated that Judges Dorion and Galipeault dissented, holding that the charge of theft of a post letter is not proven, and that the evidence only discloses theft of a sum of $1.50, entailing a maximum penalty of six months.\nWhile it may very well be said, if one looks Only at the statement \u201cthat the charge of theft of a post letter is not proven,\u201d that it may indicate a dissent upon a pure question of fact of a mixed question of law and fact, the words which immediately follow would seem to me to shew that the real basis of the dissent was that the theft which the evidence disclosed as having been committed by the defendant was not the theft of a post letter within the meaning of s. 364 of the Criminal Code, for which he would be liable to a minimum penalty of three years under the provisions of that section.\nHowever this may be, there seems to be no doubt that this court will look at the notes or written reasons of dissenting judges, and whenever necessary at the notes or reasons of the majority judges or any other portion of the record to ascertain the real grounds upon which any dissent is based, if the formal judgment of the court omits to state these grounds specifically or fails to make them clear.\nAn examination of the written reasons for both the majority and the dissenting judgments in the present case makes it quite clear, as I read them, that the only question considered in the court below was whether upon the undisputed facts disclosed by the evidence the Bureau de Poste du Parlement, where the letter was stolen, was a \u201cbureau de poste\u201d or the letter the appellant was charged with stealing there a \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste\u201d within the meaning of s. 364 of the French version of the Criminal Code or s. 2 (the interpretation section) of the Canada Post Office Act.\nSt. Jacques J., who, having been deputed by the court for the purpose, signed the formal judgment containing the ground of dissent as above stated, sets out in his own notes four grounds on which the appeal was heard. All these he describes as \u201cmotifs de droit,\u201d and states that the facts are not in dispute. After pointing out, as to the first two grounds relied on by the appellant, viz.: (1) The Bureau de Poste du Parlement was not upon the evidence \u201cun bureau de poste au sens de la loi,\u201d (2) The letter the appellant was charged with having stolen was not upon the evidence \u201cune lettre\u2019 confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste\u2019 au sens de la loi,\u201d that they were in effect one and the same, His Lordship said that there was, therefore, only one point to be decided on the appeal, i.e., \u201cau sujet du sens qu\u2019il faut donner, au regard de la loi, aux mots lettre confi\u00e9e a la poste.\u201d He held, not only that the stolen letter fell within the definition of a \u201clettre confiee a la poste\u201d given in the interpretation section of the Canada Post Office Act because it had been posted the previous day in the Quebec City Post Office and was stolen before it had reached the addressee or other person authorized to receive it for him, but also that the \u201cBureau de Poste du Parlement,\u201d though not a regular post office, fell within the definition of \u201cBureau de poste\u201d given in the same section of that Act as a place where \u201clettres confi\u00e9es \u00e0 la poste\u201d are received.\nL\u00e9tourneau J., in his notes, confirmed the conviction for the reason that the bureau, where the letter was stolen, was a \u201cbureau de poste\u201d in the sense which the Canada Post Office Act gives to these words since that office was undoubtedly a place where \u201clettres confi\u00e9es \u00e0 la poste\u201d or other mailable matter were distributed, sorted, etc., within the meaning of that statute.\nWalsh J. concurred with the latter and the accused\u2019s appeal was, therefore, dismissed for the reasons indicated.\nDorion and Galipeault JJ. dissented from these conclusions of the majority judges on the ground that the accused stole the letter in a place which was not a \u201cbureau de poste\u201d and the letter not a \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste,\u201d within the meaning of the definition of these expressions given in s. 2 of the Canada Post Office Act, for the reason that upon the undisputed facts as disclosed by the evidence, the so-called Parliament post office was officered and operated entirely by appointees of the Quebec Provincial Government, over whom the Post Office Department of Canada had no control, and that the letter in question, at the time it was stolen, had ceased under the provisions of s. 2 of the Canada Post Office Act to be a post letter within the meaning of that section.\nDorion J., in his notes, set out the provisions of the Canada Post Office Act, which define \u201cbureau de poste\u201d and \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste\u201d as well as other provisions of that Act, and also discussed a letter from the Deputy Postmaster-General under date of March 12, 1919, addressed to the then Postmaster of Quebec city regarding the request of the Legislative Assembly for the installation of a post office in the Parliament Building. This letter set forth the conditions under which the proposed office should be instituted and the mail delivered from the Quebec city Post Office. Among the conditions stated were: the proposed office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada; that it would be operated and officered by clerks appointed by authority of the Legislative Assembly, who would obtain supplies of postage stamps from the city post office and postal stations, etc., conveying the mail bags both ways between the Quebec city Post Office and the Legislative Assembly without expense to the Post Office Department of Canada in any way. The letter stated that an office of this nature would not be recognized as a regular post office, being simply a clearing house, as the Department could not undertake to establish either a sub-office or a regular office in a separate institution such as a Provincial Government building, as all post offices have to be for the general service of the public and under the direct control of the Department. It was also stated that a duly authorized messenger representing all the Legislative Assembly departments would call at the Quebec city Post Office and sign for all registered mail for all the departments, which he would deliver as instructed to the several departments located in the Legislative Assembly building; that the locked bag containing the ordinary mail would be sent to the Legislative Assembly post office where it would be distributed and messengers from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.\nIt is evident, therefore, that all the judges, who heard the appeal in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, treated the problem before them, viz.: whether the accused was properly convicted of the offence with which he was charged under s. 364 of the Criminal Code, as one which involved a question or questions of law only inasmuch as all the facts relating thereto were established by undisputed and undisputable evidence.\nIn my opinion they were right in doing so. No question was involved on the appeal as to the weight or appreciation of evidence by inference or otherwise as in Gauthier v. The King[1], where it was held by this court, assuming that the question whether there was any evidence to support a conviction should be deemed a question of law, the question whether the proper inference has been drawn by the trial judge from facts established in evidence is really not a question of law, but purely a question of fact for consideration. The conviction of the appellant for the theft with which he was charged under s. 364 of the Criminal Code admittedly could not properly have been made if the Bureau de Poste du Parlement was not a \u201cbureau de poste\u201d within the meaning of that section of the Code and of the interpretation section of the Canada Post Office Act, or if the letter he was charged with stealing, at the time of the theft, was not a \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste\u201d within the meaning of those statutory provisions, no matter what inferences may have been drawn from established facts as to the culpability of the appellant in respect of the commission of the theft of the letter itself. As to whether the place where the theft was in fact committed was or was not such a bureau de poste or the stolen letter such a letter depends entirely on the interpretation of the statutory provisions referred to. The letter of the Deputy Post master-General of March 12, 1919, was produced by the Crown on the trial as evidence of the conditions under which the Bureau de Poste du Parlement was instituted and was to be operated. As regards its meaning and effect upon the two vital issues involved in the appeal that also was for the decision of the trial court as a question of law. These two questions are manifestly in my judgment questions of law alone, and two of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench having dissented from the majority judgment upon them, I am of opinion that the appellant has a right to a further appeal to this court under the provisions of s. 1023, and that the motion to quash the appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the merits of the appeal it is apparent that s. 364 of the Criminal Code creates an offence which relates to the conduct of the postal service of Canada and that in virtue of the provisions of s. 6 of the Code the words \u201cbureau de poste\u201d and \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste\u201d must be given the meaning assigned to them by s. 2 of the Post Office Act, c. 161, R.S.C., 1927. I am of opinion that the definition of \u201cbureau de poste\u201d given in par. (1) of that section as embodying \u201ca place where post letters or other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or despatched\u201d or, as the French version states it, \u201cun lieu o\u00f9 les lettres confi\u00e9es \u00e0 la poste ou autres objets transmissibles sont re\u00e7us ou d\u00e9livr\u00e9s, distribu\u00e9s, tri\u00e9s, form\u00e9s en paquets ou exp\u00e9di\u00e9s,\u201d must be taken as necessarily implying a bureau or place which is under the control and supervision of the Post Office Department of Canada. Otherwise any room or place in any large business establishment which manitains a staff for the receipt, classification, distribution, delivery or despatch of any letters brought to the establishment by its own employees or stamped and addressed for transit through the regular postal service would constitute a post office within the meaning of the Post Office Act and of s. 364 of the Criminal Code. I am of opinion also that the definition in the same section of the Post Office Act of the words \u201cpost letter,\u201d or, as it is in the French version, \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste\u201d and the proviso that a letter shall be deemed a post letter from the time of its being deposited in any post office \u201cto the time of its being delivered to the person to whom it is addressed, or so long as it remains in the post office or in any such letter box or is being carried through the post\u201d shew that the intention was that no letter should be deemed a post letter within the meaning of the Post Office Act unless it be in the custody and control of some post office or branch of the postal service, which is under the direct control of the Post Office Department of Canada.\nAlthough the letter of March 12, 1919, from the Deputy Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec regarding the agreement for the establishment of the \u201cbureau de poste du Parlement\u201d says that that office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada, its whole tenor, in my judgment, shews that it is in no sense a post office in the true sense of the Post Office Act, but simply a clearing house for the reception and distribution of outgoing and incoming mail for the convenience of the Legislative Assembly and the Departments of the Provincial Government situated in the Parliament Building. Indeed the letter explicitly states that an office of this nature would not be recognized as a regular post office, \u201cas the Department could not undertake to establish either a sub- office or a regular office in a separate institution such as a Provincial Government building, as all post offices have to be for the general service of the public and under the direct control of the Department.\u201d\nIf I am right in my construction of the two material paragraphs of the Canada Post Office Act, it follows that the \u201cbureau de poste du Parlement\u201d is not a \u201cbureau de poste\u201d within the meaning of s. 364 of the Criminal Code, and also that the letter which the defendant was charged with stealing therein was not a \u201clettre confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la poste\u201d at the time of the theft in the sense of that expression as given in s. 2 of the Canada Post Office Act. The letter at that time was neither in a \u201cpost office\u201d nor \u201cbeing carried through the post,\u201d the Post Office Department\u2019s control and responsibility of and for it having ceased upon its delivery at the so-called \u201cbureau de poste\u201d which is officered and operated by appointees of the Provincial Government entirely at the latter\u2019s expense and over which neither the Quebec city post office nor the Post Office Department had any control.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction in so far as it applies to an offence against s. 364.\nKerwin J.\u2014The accused was charged under section 364 of the Criminal Code that he \u201ca vol\u00e9 une lettre dans la bureau de poste du parlement,\u201d and the question is what construction is to be placed upon the expression \u201cun bureau de poste\u201d in clause (6) of section 364, which, for this purpose, by virtue of section 6 of the Code, is to have the meaning assigned to it by section 2, paragraph (l) of the Post Office Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 161. That paragraph states:\u2014\n(l) \u201cpost office\u201d means any building, room, post office, railway car, street letter box, street stamp-vending box, receiving box or other receptacle or place where post letters or other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or despatched.\nIt is to be noted that not only does it include a building, etc., where post letters are received, etc., but also a building, etc, where other mailable matter is received, etc. By section 2 (h):\u2014\n\u201cmailable matter\u201d includes any letter, packet, parcel, newspaper, book or other thing which, by this Act or by any regulation made in pursuance of it, may be sent by post. That is \u201cpost office\u201d means any building, etc., where any letter which may be sent by post is received, etc. Now it cannot have been intended that any letter which may be sent by post is in a post office unless it is in a building, room, etc., which building, room, etc., is under the control of the Postmaster-General as part of the postal service of Canada. In my opinion that is the construction to be given to section 364 of the Code.\nSection 4 of the Post Office Act enacts:\u2014\n4. There shall be at the seat of government of Canada a department, known as the Post Office Department, for the superintendence and management, under the direction of the Postmaster-General, of the postal service of Canada.\nBy section 7, the Postmaster-General has authority to do a number of things. By section 35 he has the sole and exclusive privilege of conveying, receiving, collecting, sending and delivering letters within Canada. By section 39 he may establish one or more branch post offices.\nIt may be assumed that the Postmaster-General would be justified, under his powers, in permitting certain actions to be done to accelerate the work of the postal service proper, such as, for instance, allowing private commercial houses to collect all the mailable matter of its employees and even such as has been deposited by members of the public in receptacles provided by the concerns themselves. He might authorize them to use a machine which would indicate that the postage had been paid. He might permit the inhabitants of an outlying settlement to deal with mailable matter in various ways. He might not object to the sign \u201cPost Office\u201d being used under certain conditions. And it may be assumed that he could from time to time revoke or alter any directions given, or regulations made, by him with respect to such matters.\nThere is no dispute as to what he has done in the present case. There is in evidence a letter from the Deputy Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec, and there is certain oral testimony bearing on the question which is uncontradicted. To summarize from such evidence:\u2014\n1. Those engaged in what is called the Parliamentary Post Office are employees of the Provincial Government and not of the Post Office Department; as are also the couriers who transport the bags between the Quebec Post Office and the Legislative Assembly Building. 2. There is a \u201cprimary sorting\u201d in the building.\n3. Receipts are given for mailable matter which the senders decide to register.\n4. At one time money orders were issued although the authority for so doing has since been withdrawn.\n5. To quote from the letter of the Deputy Postmaster-General:\u2014\nIn brief, the Legislative Assembly Post Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada.\nBut\nAn office of this nature would not be recognized as a regular post office, being simply a clearing house, as the Department could not undertake to establish either a sub-office or a regular office in a separate institution such as Provincial Government building, as all post offices have to be for the service of the general public, and under the direct control of the Department.\nThe office would not be a postal station, but a clearing house, similar to that conducted by the Federal Parliament and applicable to the various Legislative Assemblies. In this case postal note, money orders and savings bank business could not be put into effect, as the Assembly Post Office would not be a regular post office, nor published in the Canada Official Postal Guide.\nBearing in mind all these considerations, the quarters in the Legislative Assembly Building in Quebec, set aside by the provincial authorities, cannot be said, in my opinion, to be part of the postal service of Canada even though what was done was by the consent or authority of the Postmaster-General.\nHowever, what we are asked to do is to construe an expression used by Parliament in describing an offence. Parliament indeed has provided for various offences which may be termed \u201cpostal offences\u201d as, for example, section 365 of the Code; and it has seen fit to differentiate between the punishments that may be imposed for such offences. We are not concerned wiht the reason for such distinctions. Unless the courts below are correct in their interpretation of the section under which the accused was charged, he is entitled to have the conviction set aside.\nA motion was made to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction but I am of opinion that this appeal is on a question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, as provided by section 1023 of the Criminal Code. A perusal of the dissenting judgment satisfies me that the dissent was on the proper construction of section 364 of the Code. There are no facts in dispute and it is not a \u201cquestion whether the proper inference has been drawn by the trial judge from facts established in evidence\u201d as in Gauthier v. The King[2]. This Court had to consider what was a question of law when the proper construction of a statutory provision was involved in Township of Tisdale v. Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines[3]. Referring to the finding made by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board that the property attempted to be assessed was situate on \u201cmineral land,\u201d the judgment states at page 323:\u2014\nIt seems., as found by the Supreme Court of Ontario, that upon the evidence adduced and the findings of the Board, we would be precluded from interfering therewith if we agree in law with their view as to the meaning of the statute. The construction of a statutory enactment is a question of law, while the question of whether the particular matter or thing is of such a nature or kind as to fall within the legal definition of its term is a question of fact.\nIn Loblaw Groceterias Co. Ltd. v. City of Toronto[4], the Court, at page 254, dealt with the argument that\nthe courts below having reached the conclusion that the land and building were used as distribution premises, this is a finding of fact with which we ought not to interfere.\nThe judgment proceeds:\u2014\nBut it is a question of law that is made the subject-matter of the right of appeal from the County Judge upon a stated case and we are bound to determine upon the proper construction of the amendment whether or not upon the facts stated the land and building are caught by the increased rate of assessment.\nI have not lost sight of what the Court was dealing with in the two cases cited and I am not unaware of the danger of relying upon statements extracted from a judgment without relating them to the facts of the particular case, but the principles therein declared appeal to me as affording a criterion which may usefully be followed in arriving at a conclusion in this case.\nIt was stated in the dissenting judgment that while the conviction should be set aside, the accused should be found guilty of some other offence. The only other offence suggested is one which would carry with it a sentence which the accused has already served, and under the circumstances, therefore, I would restrict our judgment to allowing the appeal and setting aside the conviction.\nAppeal allowed and conviction quashed.\n[1] [1931] S.C.R. 416.\n[2] [1931] S.C.R. 416.\n[3] [1933] S.C.R. 321.\n[4] [1936] S.C.R. 249.\n"}

(Suppliant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Respondent) Respondent.\n1937: May 30, 31; 1937: October 21.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014Petition of right\u2014Action for recovery of money paid for sales tax and excise tax\u2014Period of limitation\u2014Claims barred\u2014Section 32 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 84\u2014Section 48 of Ontario Limitations Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 106\u2014Sec. 117 of the Special War Revenue Act, as enacted by 23-24 Geo. V, c. 50, s. 24.\nThe suppliant, toy its petition of right, sought recovery of moneys paid the Crown as sales taxes and excise duties upon liquors purchased by it for export and which it claimed were exported to the United States. The liquors had been manufactured by one Walker Company and were alleged by the suppliant to have been purchased by it from that company at prices that included such sales taxes and excise duties. In May, 1926, the suppliant by an agreement in writing sold and transferred to Dominion Distilleries Limited its business and undertaking as a going concern, the sale and transfer including all debts due to the suppliant in connection with the business. The terms of the agreement were fulfilled and the suppliant had not carried on business since 1926. The transactions in liquor by the suppliant with the Walker Company took place between January 31st, 1924, and January 25th, 1926. And the petition of right was filed before the Exchequer Court of Canada on December 14th, 1934. The claim of the suppliant was to recover the sum of $1,417,958.62, being $1,296,557.01 in respect of excise duties and $121,401.61 in respect of sales taxes. The Exchequer Court of Canada dismissed the petition of right.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nPer The Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ.\u2014Without deciding the question as to whether some one other than the; manufacturer or producer, upon whom the duties and taxes were imposed and by whom they were actually paid to the Crown, could recover such payments from the Crown\u2014assuming that the suppliant as the purchaser of the liquor could recover in its own name and assuming further that the suppliant\u2019s charter had not become forfeited for non-user and that it was an existing company entitled to maintain the petition\u2014held that the claim for $1,296,557.01 in respect of the payment of excise duties was barred at the end of six years by virtue of the combined effect of section 2 of the Exchequer Court Act and section 48 of the Ontario Limitations Act, such claim not being liable to be treated as a specialty debt for which the prescriptive period is 20 years; and that the claim for $121,401.61 in respect of the payment of the sales taxes was also barred by the six-year limitation above mentioned as the suppliant has made no application for a refund within the time prescribed by the statute and did not invoke the statutory right to a refund, the whole in conformity with the provisions of section 117 of the Special War Revenue Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J.[1] dismissing the suppliant\u2019s petition of right with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLs. St. Laurent K.C., L. A. Landriau K.C. and Oscar Gagnon K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and C. F. H. Carson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J\u2014The appellant is a suppliant by petition of right whose claim against the Crown was dismissed by a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada from which judgment this appeal was taken. The claim of the suppliant is to recover from the Crown the sum of $1,417,958.62 paid by Hiram Walker & Sons Limited (hereinafter for convenience referred to as the Walker Company) to the Crown in respect of excise duties and sales taxes on liquor manufactured by the Walker Company and alleged by the suppliant to have been purchased by it from the Walker Company at prices that included the excise duties and sales taxes. The claim put forward by the suppliant is that it resold and exported this liquor to purchasers in the United States and that by reason of such export, the duties and taxes collected by the Crown were not payable and that the Crown is liable to repay to the suppliant the moneys paid together with interest. The sum of $1,417,958.62 is made up of $1,296,557.01 in respect of excise duties and $121,401.61 in respect of sales taxes. The transactions in question were said to have taken place between January 31st, 1924, and January 25th, 1926.\nThe suppliant was a Dominion company having its office at Montreal. Although it had a distillery licence it did nothing in the way of carrying on a distillery business other than the blending of some Scotch whiskies in relatively small quantities. Commencing in January, 1924, orders for liquor were furnished in the name of the suppliant to the Walker Company. In the early part of 1924 the liquor was transferred from the Walker Distillery in Walkerville to a nearby warehouse from which it was distributed in accordance with instructions given by one Cooper, who appears to have been active in the business of the suppliant company. The orders, invoices and other documents that were made out at the time gave the transactions the appearance of sales by the Walker Company to the suppliant and of resales by the suppliant to either W. Kemp or G. Scherer. On or about April 26th, 1924, the excise officer in charge of the Walker Distillery was instructed to refuse the delivery or the issue of permits for the removal of duty paid spirits from the Walker distillery to the suppliant unless the goods were shipped to the suppliant\u2019s licensed premises in Montreal. Thereafter the liquor was shipped from the Walker Distillery to Montreal where it was at once reshipped (often without unloading) to Sandwich or one of the border points on the Detroit river, where it appears to have gone into Cooper\u2019s possession and thence was resold and distributed by him. It is claimed by the suppliant that all the liquor was exported from the border points in and about Walkerville to the United States but this claim was strenuously challenged by the Crown.\nUnder the Excise Act the liquor could not be removed from the Walker Distillery until the excise duties had been paid or secured by bond. In the case of each of the transactions in question the Walker Company made a requisition to the excise officer for a permit to remove the liquor \u201cduty paid,\u201d paid the duties and obtained a permit for removal. Pursuant to the regulations respecting sales tax, the Walker Company paid before the end of each month the sales tax due in respect of transactions of the previous month, in accordance with returns made by it to the Department of National Revenue showing the sales for the month and the taxes payable thereon. No suggestion was made at any time that the moneys were paid under protest or subject to any reservation either on behalf of the Walker Company or the suppliant.\nBy agreement dated May 26th, 1926, the suppliant sold its business as a going concern to a company known as Dominion Distillers Limited. The sale and transfer included all debts due to the suppliant in connection with the business. In 1927 Dominion Distillers Limited sold its assets to Dominion Distillers Consolidated Limited. In 1930 Dominion Distillers Limited and Dominion Distillers Consolidated Limited went into liquidation. The suppliant had ceased doing business sometime in 1925 or 1926 and no meetings of its directors or shareholders were held from March 9th, 1926, until February 16th, 1935. In these circumstances the respondent launched a motion before the trial for an order dismissing the action and directing that the respondent\u2019s costs be paid by the solicitor for the suppliant upon the grounds that the action was brought without authority and that the company had before the commencement of the action sold and transferred all its assets. The motion was adjourned to the trial and the respondent gave a supplementary notice that on the return of the motion it would rely upon the additional ground that if there was any such corporation as the suppliant it had ceased to exist and its charter had become forfeited by reason of non-user under the provisions of The Companies Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 27, sec. 29, and amending Acts. On the second day of the trial this motion was argued before the learned judge as well as a motion to dismiss on the ground that the suppliant\u2019s cause of action, if any, was barred by the Statute of Limitations. The learned judge, however, decided that the trial should proceed to the end and adjourned the motions to the conclusion of the trial.\nJudgment was reserved at the trial and was pronounced on June 12th, 1937, dismissing the petition with costs. The learned judge felt bound by the Carling case[2] to hold that in the main the liquor was exported. He thought the proof of export in the case (upon this point, since the appeal fails on other grounds, it is unnecessary to pronounce a decision) was equally strong as in the Carling case2. He was of opinion, however, that the claim to recover in respect of sales taxes was barred by sec. 117 of the Special War Revenue Act (enacted by 21-22 George V, ch. 54, sec. 21, and amended by 23-24 George V, ch. 50, sec. 24) because it did not appear that any application in writing had been made for a refund within two years from the time when such refund first became payable. His judgment was also based on the conclusion that the suppliant company had ceased to exist by reason of the forfeiture of its charter for non-user and that the petition was, therefore, unauthorized and a nullity. The learned judge also held that the Ontario Limitations Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 106, sec. 48, was applicable and that the cause of action was barred because the petition was laid more than six years after the cause of action arose.\nIn the first place it is to be observed that all the moneys paid, either as excise duty or as sales taxes, on the liquor in question were paid by the Walker Company to the Crown, neither by compulsion nor under protest, and now form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, and that the Walker Company is not a party to this action to recover back these moneys. We should find it difficult to decide, if it were necessary to do so, that some one other than the manufacturer or producer, upon whom the duties and taxes were imposed and by whom they were actually paid to the Crown, could recover the payments from the Crown. But assuming that the suppliant, as the purchaser of the liquor, whose purchase moneys included these outlays by its vendor, could recover in its own name and on its own behalf, the difficulties in its way appear to be insurmountable. We shall assume, further, in the suppliant\u2019s favour, without expressing any opinion upon the point, that the suppliant\u2019s charter had not become forfeited for non-user and that it was an existing corporation entitled to maintain the action. It is, moreover, unnecessary to express any opinion upon the contention of the Crown that at the date of the petition of right the suppliant had no longer any interest in the claim upon which it sues by virtue of the fact that the claim had been transferred to the Dominion Distillers Consolidated Limited through the Dominion Distillers Limited. We have arrived at our conclusion without taking into account the difficulties which might be raised by these questions.\nTwo or three dates are of importance in the consideration of the appeal. The date of the filing of the petition of right was December 14th, 1934; the transactions in liquor in respect of which the Walker Company paid excise duty and sales taxes were, as already stated, between January 31st, 1924, and January 25th, 1926.\nAs to the claim for $1,296,557.01 in respect of the payment of excise duties. These duties were paid by the Walker Company voluntarily in the ordinary course of business before removal of the liquor. Liability for payment during the period in question was imposed by the Excise Act, R.S.C., 1906, ch. 51\u2014(prior to 1921 the statute was called The Inland Revenue Act, 11-12 George V, ch. 26, sec. 2). Under sec. 174 the duties could not be refunded on export unless when specially permitted by some regulation made by the Governor In Council. No such regulation was made. Under The Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, 1931 (21-22 George V, ch. 27, sec. 33), the Governor in Council, whenever he deems it right and conducive to the public good, may remit any duty or toll payable to His Majesty, imposed or authorized to be imposed by any Act of the Parliament of Canada. Remit, by the context, involves \u201cthe refund of any sum of money paid to the Minister for\u201d any duty imposed or authorized to be imposed by any Act of the Parliament of Canada. No such order in council was ever passed. Treated as an action for moneys had and received, the claim was clearly barred at the end of six years by virtue of the combined effect of sec. 32 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 34, and sec. 48 of the Ontario Limitations Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 106. The claim cannot be treated as a specialty debt for which the prescriptive period is 20 years.\nAs to the claim for $121,401.61 in respect of the payment of the sales tax. The following provision was added to the Special War Revenue Act in 1931 (21-22 George V, ch. 54, sec. 21):\n117. No refund or deduction from any of the taxes imposed by this Act shall be paid unless application for the same is made by the person entitled thereto within two years of the time when any such refund or deduction first became payable under this Act or under any regulations made thereunder.\nThe above section was repealed in 1933 (23-24 George V, ch. 50, sec. 24) and the following substituted:\n117. (1) No refund or deduction from any of the taxes imposed by this Act shall be paid unless application in writing for the same is made by the person entitled thereto within two years of the time when any such refund or deduction first became payable under this Act or under any regulations made thereunder.\n(2) If any person, whether by mistake of law or fact, has paid or overpaid to His Majesty, any moneys which have been taken to account, as taxes imposed by this Act, such moneys shall not be refunded unless application has been made in writing within two years after such moneys were paid or overpaid.\nNo application was made for a refund within the time prescribed by the statute. Moreover, the suppliant did not invoke the statutory right to a refund; the claim was not put upon that basis. Treated as an action for moneys had and received, this part of the applicant\u2019s claim also fails, being barred by the six-year limitation above mentioned.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nCannon J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKERWIN J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Oscar Gagnon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. Stuart Edwards.\n[1] [1937] Ex. C.R. 145.\n[2] [1931] A.C. 435.\n2 [1931] A.C. 435.\n"}

Warren (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nGray Goose Stage Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1937: October 6; 1937: December 15.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nJury trial\u2014Assessment of damages in negligence action\u2014New trial ordered on ground that damages excessive\u2014Jurisdiction of appellate court\u2014Order for new trial set aside.\nWhere in an action for negligence the damages have been assessed by a jury, an appellate court has no jurisdiction in respect of the amount awarded to rehear the case and control the verdict of the jury. The court is not a court of review for that purpose. If, viewing the evidence as a whole, an appellate court can see plainly that the amount of damages is in law indefensible, or that the trial has been unsatisfactory by reason of misdirection or wrongful admission or rejection of evidence, or if it is demonstrable that the jury have or must have misunderstood the evidence or taken into account matters which could not legally affect their verdict, the court may grant a new trial for the reassessment of the damages. This is not to be taken, however, as an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which a new trial may be granted for such a purpose. The verdict ought to be set aside in any case in which an appellate court finds it clearly established that the jury had misunderstood or disregarded their duty.\nPer Kerwin J.\u2014When an appellate court cannot agree with the jury\u2019s estimate of the amount of damages, \u201cthe rule of conduct\u201d for that court when considering whether a verdict should be set aside on the ground that the damages are excessive, \u201cis as nearly as possible the same as when the court is asked to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is against the weight of evidence.\u201d Praed v. Graham (24 Q.B.D. 53) approved.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, with a jury, awarding $5,392.30 as damages resulting from an automobile accident and ordering a new trial limited to the assessment of damages (unless the parties consented to a reduction of the general damages from $5,000 to $2,000), upon the ground that the amount of the damages fixed by the jury was grossly excessive.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nJ. M. Stevenson K.C. for the appellant.\nThos. N. Phelan K.C. and Brenton O\u2019Brien for the respondent. The judgment of Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014The plaintiff (appellant) was a passenger in a public motor car owned and operated by the defendant company (respondent) on an occasion when the car suddenly left the travelled highway and went into the ditch. The plaintiff claimed damages in this action for physical injuries alleged to have been suffered as a result of what occurred. Liability was denied. The action was tried with a jury and on the answers of the jury to certain questions submitted to them the learned trial judge entered judgment against the defendant for $392.30 special damages and $5,000 general damages. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[2] and that court affirmed the liability but ordered a new trial limited to the assessment of damages (unless the parties consented to a reduction of the general damages from $5,000 to $2,000) upon the ground that the amount of the damages fixed by the jury was grossly excessive. Both parties appealed from that judgment to this Court.\nThe motor car was not a regular bus model but was an old seven-passenger car that had been driven for 200,000 miles and had been put into service as a public conveyance. There was evidence that the accident was caused by a break occurring in the steering apparatus which put the car out of control of the driver and there was evidence that part of the steering apparatus had been severely worn and was in a bad state of disrepair. On the other hand, there was evidence, on behalf of the defendant, that the practice had been to have an almost daily inspection of the car and that the car had in fact been inspected and the steering apparatus found in good condition three days before the accident. The jury were of course entitled to disbelieve this evidence if they chose. They found that the defendant had been guilty of negligence and that the negligence was \u201cthat proper inspection of the vehicle was not carried out.\u201d\nAt the time of the accident and for some time thereafter it is plain that the plaintiff did not regard the physical injuries which he suffered as of very much account. He was a war veteran with a progressive disability which had led to the increase of his pension from a ten per cent disability to a thirty per cent disability and at the time of the accident an application from him for a larger disability pension was pending. After the accident he consulted several doctors, one after the other, over a period of some months. His substantial claim for damages at the trial was made upon his story that he had suffered very considerably from headaches since the accident occurred and that they had resulted in a condition of physical weakness and in a lack of power of concentration on his work which had seriously affected his earning capacity. His business was that of an insurance adjuster. It appears that a diet which one of the doctors prescribed for him had counteracted the headaches but the evidence does not disclose what effect if any the diet had upon his general health.\nCounsel for the defendant contends that there is no liability. This contention is put firstly upon the ground that, while the jury found negligence, the answer they gave as to what constituted the negligence, i.e., the absence of proper inspection of the vehicle, was not in itself negligence and that the very answer negatived all other acts of alleged negligence. We did not require to hear counsel for the plaintiff on this point. While it may well be that want of inspection is not by itself negligence unless there was either some original defect or a state of disrepair which inspection would have disclosed, where, as here, the evidence pointed to a known defect or condition of disrepair in the steering apparatus, the language of the jury read and construed in the light of the evidence and the charge can only be interpreted fairly as meaning that the jury thought that a proper and sufficient inspection would have disclosed the full extent of the faulty condition and that its repair would have avoided the event that happened. A high degree of care is required on the part of common carriers and the lack of inspection as found by the jury was, in view of the evidence, plainly a sufficient finding of negligence.\nThe mention of an insurance company in the case, which was one of the grounds of the defendant\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, was not pressed in that court, perhaps because the complaining party realized that it was as remiss as its opponent in this regard. In any case, as the point was not pressed in the court below, it was not open to the defendant in this Court.\nThe main proposition advanced by counsel for the defendant before us was that on the evidence no causal relation is proved between the headaches and the accident \u2014that the evidence is so vague that it could not reasonably be concluded that the headaches were the direct result of the accident. But there was some evidence, if believed, sufficient to connect the headaches with the accident. The weight of the evidence was a question solely for the jury and in an admirably clear and direct charge the learned trial judge put that question to the jury as \u201cthe big question\u201d to be decided by them.\nIf you find he was not suffering from a headache before the accident and that he struck his head on the occasion in question against the back of the front seat of the car and has been suffering headaches since then, it would be a fair inference that it was the blow on the head from the back of the front seat that caused them; and in that case the evidence of Dr. McConnell would be of some importance. But before using the evidence of Dr. McConnell at all you must find that the headaches did not exist before the accident and that he did not suffer from headaches before the accident. Because the evidence of Dr. McConnell is not going to be of any assistance to you in coming to a conclusion as to whether he had these before or after. He says: \u201cAssuming the truth of his history\u201d; that is, assuming the truth of what the plaintiff tells him, then he says: \u201cThe condition I found could be due to the accident.\u201d But he also says \u201cThe condition which I found may have existed long before the accident.\u201d So that as to whether he was suffering from those injuries before the accident or whether they commenced after the accident, the evidence of Dr. McConnell does not help you one way or the other. If you find they were non-existent before the accident, then you consider the evidence of Dr. McConnell who says he found the third ventricle was slightly larger than normal, that the left frontal region was abnormal, there was a larger space than normal, and that they were liable to cause headaches.\nThe Jury could not have assessed the general damages at $5,000 unless they had accepted the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that the headaches were the direct result of the accident because the other complaints of the plaintiff were admittedly of trifling significance. The jury\u2019s finding of liability, affirmed as it was by the Court of Appeal, must stand.\nOnce liability has been established, any views as to the weakness of the evidence regarded from the point of view of liability (the weight of which evidence, we repeat, was for the jury) must not influence the Court on the amount of compensation for the injuries. While it may be that the general damages were awarded on a generous scale, there was no firm ground, in our opinion, on which the Court of Appeal was entitled to set aside the jury\u2019s assessment. This was essentially a case for a jury and it is quite impossible for the Court to say that the amount of the damages fixed by the jury was so large that the jury reviewing the whole of the evidence reasonably could not properly have arrived at that amount. Lord Wright in the House of Lords in Mechanical and General Inventions Co. v. Austin[3] said:\nThe appellate court is never the judge of fact in a case where the constitutional judge of fact is the jury. For the appellate court to set aside the verdict of a jury as being against the weight of evidence, merely because the court does not agree with it, would, in my judgment, be to usurp the functions of the jury and to substitute their own opinion for that of the jury: that would be quite wrong. Much more is necessary in order to justify the setting aside of a jury\u2019s verdict where there is some evidence to support it.\nAnd at p. 377:\nThe jury were, as the Lord Chancellor explains, properly directed and had all the facts fully before them. In considering their award on damages, that view of the evidence most favourable to their finding must be taken, not the view most adverse to it, if or where two views are competent. It is true that the damages awarded ran into big figures, but damages cannot be treated as excessive merely because they are large. Excess implies some standard which has been exceeded.\nThe authorities are numerous but we might usefully refer to the judgment of the Privy Council in McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada[4]. That was an Alberta case. Beck, J., sitting without a jury, assessed the damages (a mortgagee\u2019s negligence case) at $2,800. The Alberta court of appeal set aside the assessment but granted to the plaintiff the option to have it referred back to the clerk of the court at Calgary to take an account within prescribed limits of what damage, if any, the plaintiff had suffered by the negligence of the defendants. Upon appeal to this Court, the majority (Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting) affirmed the order permitting a reference at the plaintiff\u2019s option but varied the directions as to the mode of assessing the damages. Upon further appeal to the Privy Council, the assessment made by the trial judge was restored. Lord Moulton, who delivered the judgment of the Board, said at p. 309: The tribunal which has the duty of making such assessment, whether it be judge or jury, has often a difficult task, but it must do it as best it can, and unless the conclusions to which it comes from the evidence before it are clearly erroneous they should not be interfered with on appeal, inasmuch as the courts of appeal have not the advantage of seeing the witnesses\u2014a matter which is of grave importance in drawing conclusions as to quantum of damage from the evidence that they give. Their Lordships cannot see anything to justify them in coming to the conclusion that Beck J.\u2019s assessment of the damages is erroneous, and they are therefore of opinion that it ought not to have been disturbed on appeal.\nThe importance of that case lies in the fact that the assessment had been made by the trial judge himself and the court of appeal had jurisdiction to rehear the case and to substitute their findings for his findings. But notwithstanding that both the court of appeal of Alberta and the Supreme Court of Canada had seen fit to set aside the assessment of damages made by the trial judge, the Privy Council restored the assessment. That course undoubtedly would not have been taken had the Privy Council not concluded that the two appellate courts below had erred in principle in interfering with the assessment made by the trial judge.\nIn the case before us, however, the damages had been assessed by a jury and the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction in respect of the amount awarded to rehear the case and control the verdict of the jury. The court is not a court of review for that purpose. If, viewing the evidence as a whole, the Court of Appeal can see plainly that the amount of damages is in law indefensible, or that the trial has been unsatisfactory by reason of misdirection or wrongful admission or rejection of evidence, or if it is demonstrable that the jury have or must have misunderstood the evidence or taken into account matters which could not legally affect their verdict, the court may grant a new trial for the reassessment of the damages. This, of course, is not an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which a new trial may be granted for such a purpose. The verdict ought to be set aside in any case in which the court finds it clearly established that the jury have misunderstood or disregarded their duty.\nIn this case the jury were properly directed and had all the facts before them and there is no reason for inferring that they took into account any irrelevant consideration in arriving at the amount of the damages. The appeal must be allowed and the cross-appeal must be dismissed and the judgment at the trial restored, with costs throughout.\nKerwin J.\u2014The cross-appeal was practically disposed of on the argument. The evidence at the trial was directed to the condition of the automobile and the answer of the jury must be considered in view of that evidence and of the judge\u2019s charge. I have no doubt that so reading the jury\u2019s answer, it is a sufficient finding of negligence.\nAs to the appeal of the plaintiff on the question of the amount of damages, I must confess that I was much impressed by Mr. Phelan\u2019s contention that there was not shown to be any connection between the accident and the headaches of which the plaintiff complained. That argument is based to a great extent upon the care with which Dr. McConnell answered the questions put to him upon the precise point. However, a perusal of the evidence since the argument satisfies me that while Dr. McConnell was not as emphatic as some expert witnesses in other cases, there was no doubt as to his opinion, the reasons for which he gave simply and clearly. The jury were entitled to give effect to his opinion and, of course, so far as it was predicated upon the symptoms of the plaintiff, as told by the latter to the doctor, the plaintiff was in the witness box and was heard and seen by the jury. The jury apparently accepted the plaintiff\u2019s story and their finding cannot be disturbed.\nOnce granted these premises, I am unable to see how, on the evidence, the amount of the verdict can be challenged. A claim based upon headaches may be suspect but the evidence of the plaintiff as to his loss of earnings, the fact of the encephalographies and the prescribed diets, and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to his pain and suffering, coupled with the evidence of Dr. McConnell that the plaintiff would have pain, were all questions for the jury to consider. As the Lord Chancellor stated in Mechanical and General Inventions Co. Ltd. and Lehwess v. Austen[5]:\nThe jury were the proper constitutional tribunal to assess the damages and it is impossible to say that they have gone so wrong that their (assessment must be set aside. It is not a case merely for a nominal but for substantial damages, of which the jury were the judges. Part of Lord Wright\u2019s judgment in the same case, at page 374, has been transcribed and referred to by this Court in McCannell v. McLean[6], and I think that the following quotation from the extract,\u2014\nThus the question in truth is not whether the verdict appeals to the appellate court to be right but whether it is such as to show that the jury have failed to perform their duty.\nis particularly appropriate to the case at bar.\nNeither from a perusal of the evidence and the judge\u2019s charge nor from a careful consideration of the reasons for judgment of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal can I conclude that the jury in this case have failed to do their duty. With great respect I read the latter as indicating nothing more than that the learned judges in the Court of Appeal could not agree with the jury\u2019s estimate of the amount of damages, and that is not in my view a correct method of approach. In the Mechanical and General Inventions case, Lord Wright, at page 378, points out that in Praed v. Graham[7], Lord Esher had stated that \u201cthe rule of conduct\u201d for the appellate court when considering whether a verdict should be set aside on the ground that the damages are excessive,\nis as nearly as possible the same as where the court is asked to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is against the weight of evidence.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stevenson, McLorg and Bence.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Gilbert H.

J. and Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nMines and minerals\u2014Mining prospector\u2014Locating mining properties and staking them for employer\u2014Profit-sharing contract\u2014Remuneration being salary, expenses and percentage of the net profits of the sale of properties\u2014Sale by employer to a company for fully paid no par value shares of that company\u2014Right of the employee to percentage of such shares\u2014Valuation of such shares\u2014\u201cProfits.\u201d\nThe appellant, a mining prospector, was employed by the respondent, a mining company engaged particularly in the exploration of mining properties, to locate mining properties and to cause them to be transferred, after staking, to the respondent; he was to be paid a salary of $150 a month and his expenses and in addition he was to be entitled to 10 per cent of the net profits which the respondent might make from the sale or exploitation of the staked claims which it should acquire through his efforts. By the express terms of the contract between the parties, the engagement of the appellant \u201cat the service of\u201d (au service de) the respondent was to be monthly but either one of the parties to the contract could put an end to it by notice of fifteen days. The appellant during a period of about two years staked some forty or more claims in the name of himself or others and transferred or caused the same to be transferred to the respondent. He was paid his salary of $150 a month and his expenses. The respondent later sold forty mining claims to Lamaque Gold Mines Limited, (the mis-en-cause) for the sum of $5,000 and 150,000 fully paid no par value shares of the capital stock of that company. The sale was completed and the cash and share consideration received by the respondent. Within a year of the acquisition of the 150,000 shares and before the financing of the Lamaque Company had been completed and its shares made available to the public, the respondent, without the knowledge of the appellant, sold to its own shareholders (there were only sixteen of them) at the price of 7 cents a share all the 150,000 shares of the Lamaque Company that it had acquired. The respondent arrived at this price of 7 cents a share by taking the actual cost of the shares to be the total expenditures of the respondent in all its mining operations up to that date which (including the salary and expenses of the appellant) had amounted to about $15,500, and deducting therefrom the $5,000 cash received from the Lamaque Company. A few months thereafter, at the time of the institution of this action, shares of the Lamaque Company, although not listed on the market, were being traded in by the public at various prices around $2 a share. The appellant, putting a value of $3 a share, claimed from the respondent the sum of $45,500, being 10 per cent of the thus estimated net profits of the sale. The respondent alleged in its defence that the shares had only realized their actual cost and that there was no profit in the transaction. The appellant admitted at the trial that eight of the forty claims had not been staked by him, and that twenty-two of the other claims had been staked and transferred by him but had been allowed to lapse by the respondent and subsequently were revived by a new staking on the part of the respondent itself. The trial judge held that the appellant was entitled on the basis of only ten out of forty claims, and awarded him 10 per cent of one-quarter of the 150,000 shares, i.e., 3,750 shares, subject to payment by the appellant to the respondent of 10 per cent of one-quarter of the total net expenditures of the respondent ($15,535.03 less the $5,000 cash payment), i.e., $262.50, and condemned the respondent to deliver to the appellant within fifteen days 3,750 shares of the Lamaque Company provided the appellant paid the respondent the sum of $262.50 and, in default of the respondent delivering said shares, the respondent was condemned (on a valuation of $2 per share) to pay to the appellant $7,237.50 with interest and costs. The respondent appealed from that judgment to the Court of King\u2019s Bench and the trial judgment was modified by awarding the appellant only $702.85 with interest and costs. The majority of that Court held that the appellant was entitled to money profits but not to profits in kind (i.e., in shares of the Lamaque Company) and arrived at the money profits in the same manner as the trial judge had but they put a value of 25 cents instead of $2 on the shares of the Lamaque Company. The appellant appealed to this Court, asking that the trial judgment be restored.\nHeld that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored, the latter having made a practical application of the profit-sharing terms of the contract to the particular facts of the case; but the judgment of the trial judge should be varied by limiting the recovery by the appellant to the money value of the shares awarded the appellant as fixed by the trial judge, i.e., $7,237.50. The appellant was entitled to the valuation of $2 a share taken by the trial judge and the price of 25 cents a share adopted by the majority of the appellate court was not a public price. The appellant, as between himself and the respondent, was entitled to have the shares valued on the basis of the public sales of the Lamaque shares.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson JJ: There is no precise legal meaning to the word \u201cprofits\u201d that can be applied in every case: the construction to be given to the word must be governed by the facts and circumstances of each particular case. In re The Spanish Prospecting Company Limited ([1911] 1 ch. 92), ref.\nPer Cannon and Kerwin JJ.: It was open to the appellant to adduce evidence of the value of the shares down to the date of the hearing and to claim the highest value shown by such evidence. Such value would represent the damages foreseen or which might have been foreseen when the agreement with the appellant was made. Article 1074 C.C.; Sen\u00e9cal v. Pauz\u00e9, 14 A.C. 637; Siscoe Gold Mines Limited v. Bijakowski [1935] S.C.R. 193. Sen\u00e9cal v. Hatton (10 L.N. 50) discussed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, modifying the judgment of the Superior Court, Chase Casgrain J., and condemning the respondent to pay the appellant the sum of $702.85 with interest and costs, instead of the sum of $7,237,50 with interest and costs as awarded by the trial judge.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAld\u00e9ric Laurendeau K.C. for the appellant.\nAntonio Perrault K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson J.J. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014The appellant (plaintiff) is a mining prospector and the respondent (defendant) is a mining company engaged particularly, as its name implies, in the exploration of mining properties. The facts are not now in dispute. The appellant was engaged by the respondent to locate mining properties and to cause them to be transferred, after staking, to the respondent. He was to be paid a salary of $150 a month and his expenses and in addition he was to be entitled to 10 per cent of the net profits which the respondent might make from the sale or exploitation of the staked claims which it should acquire through his efforts. By the express terms of the contract between the parties, the engagement of the appellant \u201cat the service of\u201d (au service de) the respondent was to be monthly but either one of the parties to the contract could put an end to it by notice of fifteen days. The appellant during a period of about two years staked some forty or more claims in the name of himself or others and transferred or caused the same to be transferred to the respondent. He was paid his salary of $150 a month and his expenses; there is no dispute as to that. The respondent later sold forty mining claims to Lamaque Gold Mines Limited (the mis-en-cause), for the sum of $5,000 and 150,000 fully paid no par value shares of the capital stock of that company. The sale was completed and the cash and share consideration received by the respondent. It may be observed in passing that the respondent and two other mining companies, The Teck-Hughes Gold Mines Limited and Read-Authier Mine Limited, became virtually a promoting syndicate of the Lamaque Gold Mines Limited (hereinafter for convenience referred to as the Lamaque Company).\nWithin a year of the acquisition of the 150,000 shares and before the financing of the Lamaque Company had been completed and its shares made available to the public, the respondent, without the knowledge of the appellant, sold to its own shareholders (there were only sixteen of them) at the price of 7 cents a share all the 150,000 shares of the Lamaque Company that it had acquired. The respondent arrived at this price of 7 cents a share by taking the actual cost of the shares to be the total expenditures of the respondent in all its mining operations up to that date which (including the salary and expenses of the appellant) had amounted to about $15,500, and deducting therefrom the $5,000 cash received from the Lamaque Company. What was in form a sale of these shares to the respondent\u2019s own shareholders was in substance a distribution of what was regarded as a realized profit on the company\u2019s capital assets. A few months thereafter, at the time of the institution of this action, shares of the Lamaque Company were being traded in by the public at various prices around $2 a share. Mr. Wilcox, the secretary-treasurer of the respondent, denied that Lamaque shares had sold at any time as high as $3, but he thought it possible that they went above $2.50. He says the shares were never listed on the market but were \u201csold over the counter. What we call the gutter market.\nThe appellant was aware of the fact that forty mining claims had been sold by the respondent for $5,000 and 150,000 shares of the Lamaque Company and demanded from the respondent 10 per cent of the net profits on the sale. He did not know then of the sale of the shares at 7 cents a share. The respondent took the position in its defence of the action that the shares had only realized their actual cost and that there was no profit at all in the transaction.\nIt is perfectly plain that a device so crude and transparent as that adopted by the respondent cannot defeat the appellant\u2019s just claim to the fruits of his contract. The appellant admitted at the trial that eight of the forty claims had not been staked by him. As to twenty-two of the other claims the appellant said that they had been staked and transferred by him but had been allowed to lapse by the respondent and subsequently were revived by a new staking on the part of the respondent itself. The trial judge however on conflicting testimony ruled all these twenty-two claims out, leaving the appellant entitled on the basis of only ten out of forty claims, and awarded the appellant 10 per cent of one-quarter of the 150,000 shares, i.e., 3,750 shares, subject to payment by the appellant to the respondent of 10 per cent of one-quarter of the total net expenditures of the respondent ($15,535.93 less the $5,000 cash payment), i.e., $262.50, and condemned the respondent to deliver to the appellant within fifteen days 3,750 shares of the Lamaque Company provided the appellant paid the respondent the sum of $262.50 and, in default of the respondent delivering said shares, the respondent was condemned (on a valuation of $2 per share) to pay to the appellant $7,237.50 with interest and costs.\nThe respondent appealed from that judgment to the Court of King\u2019s Bench but there was no cross appeal by the appellant. The Court of King\u2019s Bench (Galipeault and Walsh JJ. dissenting) modified the trial judgment by awarding the appellant only $702.85 with interest and costs. The majority of that Court held that the appellant was entitled to money profits but not to profits in kind (i.e., in shares of the Lamaque Company) and arrived at the money profits in the same manner as the trial judge had but they put a value of 25 cents instead of $2 on the shares of the Lamaque Company. The appellant appeals to this Court, asking that the trial judgment be restored. There is no cross appeal by the respondent.\nIt is contended before us that the parties were in partnership and that the appellant\u2019s only remedy is dissolution and taking of the accounts. But it is well established that the mere sharing in profits by a servant or agent does not necessarily create the relationship of partnership. Where a salary is paid to a person by another in addition to a share of profits it is strong evidence that the relation between the two is that of master and servant rather than that of partners. Where as here there is no suggestion that the appellant was to contribute in any way to the losses, if any, of the respondent and the contract is obviously one of service on a monthly salary basis, it cannot be said that the contract created a partnership between the parties. Then it is contended that the appellant was an employee of the respondent and as such was bound by whatever his employer did, that was not fraudulent, and in consequence is bound by the sale of the 150,000 shares at the price of 7 cents each. That is an untenable proposition. Upon the facts of a case such as this, an employer could not bind an employee by a sale such as that put through here.\nWe are of opinion that the learned trial judge made a practical application of the profit-sharing term of the contract to the particular facts of the case. There is no precise legal meaning to the word \u201cprofits\u201d that can be applied in every case. The construction to be given to the word must be governed by the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The question of profits was rather fully discussed in. In re The Spanish Prospecting Company, Limited.[1] Fletcher Moulton, L.J. said in part at pp. 100 and 101,\nProfits may exist in kind as well as in cash. For instance, if a business is so far as assets and liabilities are concerned in the same position that it was in the year before with the exception that it has contrived during the year to acquire some property, say mining rights, which it had not previously possessed, it follows that those mining rights represent the profits of the year, and this whether or not they are specifically valued in the annual accounts.\nBusiness men dealing fairly and in a practical way with a profit-sharing contract such as we have in this case would find very little difficulty in adjusting and settling the matter but when courts are asked to work out the problem in a strictly legal manner the problem presents real difficulty. The learned trial judge in our view dealt with the matter, in the circumstances of the case, in a practical way.\nWe are of opinion that the appellant was entitled to the valuation of $2 a share taken by the trial judge. The price of 25 cents a share adopted by the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was not a public price. It was a prearranged option price agreed upon by the promoting syndicate (composed of the respondent, The Teck-Hughes Company and the Read-Authier Company) before the incorporation of the Lamaque Company for the purchase of 1,800,000 treasury shares of the Lamaque Company as part of the general financing and promotion of the new company. That price cannot fairly be taken as the basis upon which the appellant\u2019s rights are to be arrived at. The appellant, as between himself and the respondent, is entitled to have the shares valued on the basis of the public sales of the Lamaque shares. It is contended that the evidence of public sales is unsatisfactory in that they were isolated transactions in more or less small amounts and outside a listed exchange. But it comes with ill grace, we think, from the respondent, in view of the way it dealt with the 150,000 shares, to hew too closely to the line in determining the amount of the real profit made by it through the sale of the mining claims staked for it by the appellant under the contract.\nObjection was taken to the form of the judgment at the trial as not being susceptible of execution under the Quebec practice. But, quite apart from the objection, there may have been substantial changes in the market value of the mining shares in question since the date of the delivery of judgment at the trial two years ago, and the most convenient and we think proper course under the circumstances is to vary the trial judgment by limiting the recovery to the money value of the shares as fixed by the trial judge.\nWe would therefore allow the appeal and direct judgment to be entered in favour of the appellant in the sum of $7,237.50 with interest from the date of the judgment at the trial, and costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Cannon and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The agreement between the parties provides that for the work to be done by the appellant, a prospector, for the respondent company, the latter\ns\u2019engage \u00e0 donner au dit Georges Bussi\u00e8res, en plus de son salaire, dix pour cent du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice net qu\u2019elle r\u00e9alisera sur la vente ou l\u2019exploitation des claims qu\u2019elle acquerra de lui ou par son entremise.\nThe position accepted by both parties before this Court is that the dispute as to \u201cdix pour cent du benefice net\u201d relates to ten mining claims only out of the forty mentioned by the appellant in his declaration. It is evident that the appellant must abide by the trial judge\u2019s finding that the total expenses in connection with the forty claims are the expenses to which the appellant must contribute his quarter share; and, since the respondent has not appealed from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the real question before us is the manner in which and the date at which the value of certain shares must be ascertained.\nThese shares are shares of Lamaque Gold Mines Limited which the respondent received, together with $5,000 in cash, from the Lamaque Company in 1933 as the consideration for the sale to the Lamaque Company of the forty mining claims. The respondent had already paid the expenses in connection with these claims and, after deducting the $5,000, recouped itself for the balance of the expenses by dividing the 150,000 shares of the Lamaque Company among its own shareholders at seven cents per share. The respondent had therefore contended in the courts below that there was no net profit and, therefore, nothing to which the appellant was entitled, but, in view of the fact that the Court of King\u2019s Bench disregarded this contention and found the value of each share to be twenty-five cents, it is not open to the respondent to argue that each share is not worth at least that much.\nHowever, the right of the appellant was to receive ten per cent of the shares \u201cen nature\u201d and ten per cent of the $5,000 less his one-quarter share of the expenses. I am of opinion that this is the proper construction of the clause in the contract, particularly considering the nature of the work for which the appellant was engaged and also the fact that it might reasonably be inferred that the parties were contracting on the basis of the mining claims being disposed of in quite a usual manner, i.e., for shares in a company in existence or to be formed; and therefore within the very terms of article 1020 of the Civil Code.\nBy transferring the Lamaque shares to its shareholders the respondent has rendered itself unable to fulfil its obligation and it must, therefore, pay the value of these shares. It seems futile to suggest that the value is seven cents per share and, with respect, I am unable to agree with the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that such value is twenty-five cents per share. The method of arriving at the former has been explained above. As to the latter, it is sufficient to point out that that price was fixed by an agreement of December 15, 1932, giving the Teck Hughes Gold Mines Limited the option to purchase a certain number of shares of no par value of a company not yet then formed but which in fact turned out to be Lamaque Gold Mines Limited. To me that cannot possibly be any evidence of the value of the shares. And in any event, I can discover no principle upon which the appellant is limited to the value of the shares either at the time the respondent obtained them or at the time it divided them among its own shareholders.\nIn June, 1934, the appellant demanded his proportion of the net profits and in August, 1934, served his action. Evidence was produced to warrant the trial judge\u2019s finding that on and about such latter date the value was two dollars per share, and while I quite recognize the difference between isolated sales of a few shares and the disposal of a large number, no evidence was given by the respondent to show any other value at the times just mentioned. In my view it was open to the appellant to adduce evidence of the value down to the date of the hearing and to claim the highest value shown by such evidence. Such value would represent the damages foreseen or which might have been foreseen when the agreement with the appellant was made. Article 1074, Civil Code; Sen\u00e9cal v. Pauz\u00e9;[2] Sisco Gold Mines Limited v. Bijakowski.[3]\nRespondent referred to the decision of the Privy Council in Sen\u00e9cal v. Hatton[4], affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the province of Quebec. In that case the trial judge had condemned the defendant Sen\u00e9cal to pay the par value of certain bonds in his possession, to which the Court found the plaintiff was entitled. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench while maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action decided that he was entitled not to the nominal value of the said bonds but \u201cconsidering that it is proved in the cause that the said bonds were at the time the appellant got the same, of the value of 25 per cent of the face or nominal value of the said bonds,\u201d gave judgment for an amount representing twenty-five per cent of the par value of the bonds. Chief Justice Dorion does state at page 116:\u2014\nSen\u00e9cal was bound to deliver the bonds, but he was not bound as the alternative to pay the nominal value. What he was bound to do was to pay the market; value at the time the bonds were acquired by him. This is the doctrine of all the authors who have written upon failure to fulfil obligations.\nBut Mr. Justice Ramsay, at page 119, states:\u2014\nthe right of respondent on his own showing is to have 35 debentures or their value\u2014their greatest value\u2014which seems to me to be 25 cents in the dollar.\nMr. Justice Cross stated that he would be in favour of allowing a higher value in default of the surrender of the bonds \u201con the principle that Sen\u00e9cal was bound to produce the bonds or give the highest price they were shown to be worth,\u201d but he did not dissent from the views of his colleagues as to what the evidence indicated.\nIn the Privy Council it is stated, at page 51 of the report\u2014\nIt has been contended that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench was wrong in valuing the debentures at 25 cents to the dollar. It appears to their Lordships that there was evidence upon which the Court were fully justified in arriving at that conclusion. There was evidence that on the 29th of November, 1882, similar debentures were sold at 25 cents to the dollar.\nNovember 29th, 1882, was certainly subsequent to the date the appellant in that case had received the bonds and in any event there was apparently no cross-appeal by the respondent. I believe their Lordships were not laying down any rule contrary to that set forth in the Pauz\u00e9 case.[5] See Mignault, Vol. 5, p. 421. I take it that the appellant before us is entitled to be allowed, in lieu of the transfer to him of the number of shares to which he is entitled, the highest value that the evidence discloses the shares were worth down to the date of the hearing.\nAs to the defence of prescription, it is necessary to state only that in my opinion articles 2262 and 2267 of the Civil Code do not apply but rather article 2260 as this is a contract for an indeterminate time.\nThe appeal must be allowed. The judgment of the Superior Court\nCondamne la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 lui remettre, dans les quinze jours de la date du pr\u00e9sent jugement, contre paiement de la somme de $262.50, 3,750 actions de la Lamaque Gold Mines Limited et, \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut de ce faire dans ledit d\u00e9lai \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $7,237.50, avec int\u00e9r\u00e9t de d\u00e9pens.\nWithout determining the question raised as to the form of the judgment, I would, in view of the time that has elapsed since the date of that judgment substitute one for payment by the respondent to the appellant of the sum of $7,237.50 with interest and costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Laurendeau & Laurendeau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perrault & Perrault.\n[1] [1911] 1 Ch. 92.\n[2] (1889) 14s A.C. 637.\n[3] [1935] S.C.R. 193.\n[4] (1886) 10 Ln. 50; M.L.R. 1, Q.B. 112.\n[5] (1889) 14 A.C. 637.\n"}

APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Ewing J.[2], and maintaining the appellant's action.\nThe cause of action arose out of a motor accident. The plaintiffs are father and son, the former suing on his own behalf and as next friend of the son, a boy of 19 at the time of the accident. The accident consisted of a collision between a motor car driven by the defendant and a motorcycle ridden by the infant plaintiff in the mining settlement of Cadomin. The injuries suffered by the plaintiff were serious, resulting in the loss of his right leg. The trial judge found that the defendant was negligent and that the plaintiffs were not guilty of contributory negligence and awarded damages of $1,673.90 to the father and $13,950 to the son. The appellate court, Harvey C.J.A. dissenting, held that the evidence warranted the trial judge's findings and dismissed the appellant's appeal. Harvey C.J.A. dissented on the ground that section 471 of The Vehicles and Highways Act applied to the circumstances of the case. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing the argument of counsel for the appellant and without calling the counsel for the respondent, the Court dismissed the appeal with costs.\nDuff C.J., speaking for the Court, delivered the following oral judgment:\n\"It is not necessary, Mr. Maclean, to call on you.\n\"As regards the questions of fact, they have been very fully discussed in the course of the very thorough argument which counsel for the appellant has put before us.
